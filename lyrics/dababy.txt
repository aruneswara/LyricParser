Woo, woo
I pull up like
How you pull up, Baby? How you pull up? 
How you pull up? I pull up 
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop
It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' 
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'
Know you heard me say, "You play, you lay," don't make me push the button
Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money 
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot 
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you 
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop 
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chopPooh, you a fool for this one

You know that your ho told you that nigga crazy
Don't think that she lied to you, nigga 
Get caught with your ho when I'm poppin' 'em both
Now they high just like Bobby and Whitney 
Say I'm the goat, act like I don't know
But fuck it, I'm obviously winnin'
Don't make me go hit the bank and take out a hundred
To show you our pockets are different 
I'm out with your bitch and I only want knowledge
She got a lil' mileage, I'm chillin' 
You disrespect me and I'll beat your ass up
All in front of your partners and children 
I'm the type to let a nigga think that I'm broke
Until I pop out with a million 
Take 20K and put that on your head
And make one of your partners come kill you 
Say he fuckin' with me then he gotta grow up
'Cause this nigga gotta be kiddin' 
This shit, it can't fit in my pocket
I got it, like I hit the lottery, nigga 
Opp, I'll slap the shit out a nigga
No talkin', I don't like to argue with niggas 
Ain't gon' be no more laughin'
You see me whip out 'cause I'm gon' be done shot me a nigga 
I don't follow no bitches on IG
But all of your bitches, they follow a nigga 
And that lil' nigga ain't gon' shoot shit with that gun

Hopped out on a whole other wave from these niggas
Let's see one of you little niggas top that
I will turn a nigga into a convertible
Push me a lil' nigga top back 
Her boyfriend be hatin' and callin' her groupie
Just 'cause she like all my music 
She'll send me a text and then delete the message
He tryna find out, it's confusin'
I don't know what these niggas is thinkin' about
Use the brain in your head 'fore you lose it 
I'll pull up after school and I'll teach her some shit
Tell your bro I'm a motherfuckin' tutor

Yeah, rest in peace to Bankroll‚ show 'em how to do it
Baby goin' crazy‚ he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta‚ no security with my jewelry
Found I was rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass‚ nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin' me
We was skippin' school on the train‚ duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin' 'bout robbin' me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppers
Fucked around and tried to go and lease a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin' too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby prolly got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby prolly still drug dealin
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby prolly still sell reefer
Huh? Baby prolly still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggystyle the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, Wi-Fi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga...

I had to move in with TG when I went broke movin' out to Cali
What you know about smilin' every day for all your fans, actin' like you happy?
I spent a hundred thousand layin' my daddy to rest, but I ain't braggin'
I got some questions, I'm a die about respect if I don't get answers
My mama stood up in that chair, took it like a G when she had cancer
My brother be thinkin' that we don't love him and let him struggle like we ain't family

When I crack a smile, white gold 
Yeah, I'm talkin' diamonds, froze 
Came from the bottom, toes 
Yeah, backend Baby 
That's what they pay me a show 
That's probably some cap in my rap
By the time this shit drop, they gon' pay me some more 
And I still can go back to the trap
Send a box, pick it up, make a play at the store
Feelings still hurt from when I saved that ho
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine 
Nope
Too raw, dope 
You know I'm one of the G.O.A.T.'s
She let me put it in the back of her throat
Walk in the bank with a M in a tote 
I'm tryna make a deposit
Let 'em try play with the money 
Shawty gon' take off your noggin
Long as she want it and pick it, I'm buyin' it
I had the Rover for a year, I don't drive
I get 'em whacked, I don't advise 'em to try it, yeah
I'm runnin' shit, I ain't lyin'
I got a backend for one twenty-five
I bought a Patek for one eighty-five
This shit gettin' easy at this point
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine 
Heartless, don't need a valentine 
I call 'em racks, not bands 
Ain't no rubber band on mine 
I used to be down, down, down, down
Waiting on taxes time 
Look at me now, now, now, now
They pay me to flex and shine 
Big speaker like an eighteen inch sub 
I'm a hundred, you a dub 
Lookin' for me, I'm booked up 
50 Cent, I'm in the club 
Diamonds on my earlobe, ice on dyke 
One-fifty on studs
Rugrat, young nigga got it out the mud
My heart so cold I think I'm done with ice 
Said if I leave her, she gon' die
Well, bitch, you done with life 
Better not pull up with no knife
'Cause I bring guns to fights 
Say you got that sack, I got that sack
But ain't no ones in mine 
And my lil' bitch say I'm gettin' too bougie
I don't even like dubs in mine

Blame it on motherfuckin' Baby, nigga, blame it on Baby, nigga
Blame it on Baby
Yeah, let's goWait a minute, who are you? 
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song
Ooh, I know the feelin', ain't it? 
You ever feel the way I feel, you know it feel amazin' 
I had this bitch, we used to kick it, she was feelin' Baby 
She stepped on my heart, had me feelin' basic 
You know how people like to come back when you level up 
I made a change, you stayed the same, I got ahead of ya
Plus I been tryin' to free some time up in my schedule, but 
When opportunity knockin', I never say no
'Cause I been busy catchin' them blessings I used to pray for 
Stackin' up the backend like Tetris, we playin' Legos
And every day I pray to God that a nigga don't try to play, though
'Cause I don't like to play, be done gave a nigga a halo 
Thinkin' 'bout the people I lost, know I got some angels
Chillin' with my freak, when we fuckin', it ease my anger
I'm takin' selfies with my bitch, she keep switchin' up different angles
And no, I never kept a bitch, but I always keep me a banger 
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga 
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song
Ooh, I let her ride again
She spread her legs and open up, I end up slidin' in 
She know the shit excitin' you is not excitin' him 
She swallow me up every mornin' like a vitamin 
He know to come look where I'm at, he wanna find her, shit 
Know I'm aggressive, when she kiss me, like to bite her lip 
I don't be makin' love songs, they don't excite a jit 
Real nigga, I got feelings, I'm not hiding it 
Still pimpin', tell the bitch I really like her friend 
You know her pussy good 'cause I be tryna fly her in 
If I speak once, she don't respond, I won't say hi again 
She catch me once and let me slide, I never lie again 
My name not Melly, I got murder on my mind again 
I'm with the shits, I'd kill him twice if he could die again
And if he think 'bout tryin' me, he better try again
'Cause I'ma let 'em spin, if he don't drop, then we gon' slide again 
I keep it loaded when I ride 'cause I'm still a nigga 
I fuck with her to ease my mind, 'cause I be in my feelings
And every single person in my life tell me I'm their hero
But when it's up and then go down, they treat me like the villain
Guess I forgot to mention
I'm just a nigga with a broken heart tryna find my way back home
And I'm sittin' here with the car in park while she ride dick to my song Ah, bitch 
Fuck a nigga mean, nigga?

I'ma drop the bitch off with my sis, she the shit
As soon as she done with that nappy ass hair, you can call up your boy to come pick up his bitch 
Look at my wrist, that's a brick, I just fucked up my Rolex, but fuck it, it's lit 
I don't give a fuck 'bout no fame or no chain, ain't no jewelry, put me on the lick 
I just went sat with the label 
Niggas offered me a contract 
Told them niggas, "I ain't want it" 
The shit was wack, I didn't sign that 
I'm the best, but never mind that 
My shit so hard that they rewind that 
Got that work if you can't find that 
You can't afford it, we can finance
I got one foot in the trap, got one foot up they ass, ditch your coat on the rap
Got my dick in your bitch, she be bendin' it over and bustin' it open and throwin' it back
I'm tryna go fuck her buddy
Fuck all these hoes, 'cause they don't really love me
I'm tryna get me some motherfuckin' money
If they free Meek Mill, why they ain't free my cousin?
I bet we shoot up your motherfuckin' party if somebody touch me or one of my brothers
I bet won't none of these niggas that talk on the internet try me, they see me in public
I bet they play all my motherfuckin' teachin'

They like how? That don't even match
Okay, hold on, take my phone, baby

I'm just a lil' nigga from Charlotte, the biggest new artist 
They wanna see me up the road, but my lawyer a fool with dismissin' the charges 
You know BDB ENT, we gon' pull up Infinitis, Challengers, Chargers 
And no, we don't gotta get money with you, bitch, we gon' get money regardless 
I'ma let you do all of the talkin'
Don't get me started, you know I'ma stop it 
And I don't got a cent for a ho
She bringin' up money, I'm changin' the topic 
She need to be talkin' 'bout suckin' some dick
I nut in her mouth and she gargle 
If she spit out that rich nigga shit without swallowin', me and her havin' some problems 
We havin' revolvers strictly for murder and plenty of pistols and choppers 
Ayy, when you gon' stop?
Whenever the fat lady sing, I don't listen to opera 
You know how I give it up
Fuck around, fucked up my hand, beat a nigga up
Pull off on a nigga like vroom
He don't got a car, he still catchin' the city bus 
His baby mama unemployed
So she in the club with her ass and her titties out 
And we done robbed so many plugs
You better check and go ask what my city 'bout
Had to slide the nigga bitch a dub
Wanted to fuck me but I only hit her mouth 
Take the palm of my hand, slap me a nigga
Got somethin' to say, make 'em spit it out
You knowin' 'bout Baby
All the shit that nigga rappin' 'bout, that nigga really 'bout
And no, I ain't takin' advice from a nigga
I'm cool on that, I got it figured out
These niggas be cryin' 'bout petty shit
I can't relate because I took a bigger loss
And these niggas know I been a boss
Ever since Rick Ross was the biggest boss 
Got diamonds all over my teeth
I been eatin' chicken, I need me some dental floss
Hold my watch in the air
It's no longer hot, you can go turn the condition off
I'm hittin' this ho on the low
She fuck with me hard, she say that her nigga soft 
Why you talkin' so low?
'Cause if a nigga find out and he try me, I'm knockin' a nigga off
I'm ridin' past 12, flyin' through fast as hell, flickin' a nigga off 
I'm revin' the gas, burnin' out on niggas' ass, I'm showin' my engine off 
Hahaha
And that's just how the fuck I get down, man, you know I just be playin' sometimes
Like right now, like, I'm just fuckin' 'round, you know
Me and kid, you know, we up in the penthouse, you know, kickin' shit
And, uh, I'm still the best rapper
Straight off the rip, you know I don't wait for the drop

Believe what you see, nigga
I can't name a rapper that's out here and breathin' that's fuckin' with me, niggaI got 20 on my beat
Everybody know my name ringin' bells
Ringin' bells like the hallway 
I ain't gotta cap in no mothafuckin' rap
I'll whip out and air it out broad day 
I got in with that stick, and I'm with that
Break a nigga in half like a Kit-Kat 
I been tryna be positive, mama 
They ain't fuckin' wit' Jonathan, mama 
Who you know put they mothafuckin' self on the map
And now they don't owe nobody shit? 
I send one of my lil' niggas, come take you off
You get laid on the floor by a jit 
Got pulled over with fifty-five K in my pocket 
The police, they know I'm legit 
The police, they know I got sticks
They be worried about me, they know I'm a clique
These niggas, they know I'm a dawg
I ain't worried about him, I know he a bitch 
The next nigga that come play with me
I'ma send him to go ask 2Pac for a pic, bitch
They say I'm the hottest new nigga
Go check the thermometer, that nigga sick 
Nigga must have a fever or somethin'
Heard he was born up in Cleveland or somethin' 
Let me give you a history lesson
We moved back to Charlotte, 1999 
I ain't sayin that none of that matter
'Cause if somebody touch me, then somebody dyin' 
Why he talkin' so calm when he say that? 
How he make 'em rewind and replay that? 
Who you know get a fade once a week and they tryna get waves?
Fuck a mothafuckin' wave-cap 
Every time that the DJ play "Suge"
Niggas throw up they arms like a mothafuckin' racetrack 
Every time that my baby girl see me
She run and say "Daddy", I love when she say that 
Every time I hit one of my moves
All the bitches go crazy, they like how I do that 
I keep one in the head, if I don't let off first
I'ma dive to the side when I shoot back
Yeah, I'm comin' like Blade in this bitch 
Fuck around, and walked out in a trench coat
They gon' have to put me with the greats 
Wanna fuck with me, she gotta wait 
On the yacht, with me, me and the kids
There's four of us, we on the sea eatin' steak 
I won't go back and forth with a shrimp
You goin out sad 'bout a ho, I'm a pimp 
He keep bumpin' his motherfuckin' gums
We gon put his ass up like a mothafuckin' blimp 
Like to talk on the pillow wit' hoes, that's gon' get him exposed
He a mothafuckin' simp 
You know he got that thang on him, baby
Quit askin' him why that boy walk with a limp 
I don't care bout this mothafuckin' chain 
But I'll still bust your mothafuckin' brain 
Just got head on a mothafuckin' plane 
Ain't no cap in my rap, I'm the truth 
End up fuckin' this ho from the back
I knew her for a day, she on go, she the swoop 
And these niggas ain't livin' like that
Why he talkin' so gangsta? Your bro, he a fluke 
They know Baby gon' blow, he a flute 
They know Baby gon' blow, he the bomb 
They know Baby was just in Miami
Now he in L.A., nigga think he LeBron 
They know Baby go baby on baby 
But five years ago, nigga say he was John 
I touch down at the front of the plane
And the driver come pick up my Louis Vuitton 
While he drive me around, I be blowin' out pressure
I'm chillin' backseat with the iron 
And I'm done with this shit, man
I'm one of the best mothafuckin' rappers, man 
You know 
But I ain't gon' keep, you know, I mean, braggin' 'bout this
I'm done with this one, I'm the best mothafuckin' rapper, man
Quit playin' with Baby, man, do not play with me
I'm just exercising, I'm just exercising my craft, that's it 
And I'm not gonna keep sayin' this shit,  I'm done sayin' this shit
Uh
And I got 20 on my mothafuckin' beat, but this nigga can't engineer for shit
I'm 'bout to make this nigga just start makin' beats and quit engineering
A'ight, cut that shit offUh, yeah, that muh'fucker sound like a muh'fuckin', uh, alarm clock or some shit, you know
It's alertin' you bitch ass niggas that, that I'm the muh'fuckin' best, yeah

Fuck waitin' on the label, had to drop a tape 
I used to trip 'bout bitches fuckin' off
But I been fuckin' off so I been straight 
You saving hoes, we need to make a movie 'bout you
Wear your mothafuckin' cape 
I tell your ho, "We'll make a movie"
But we're probably never goin' on a date 
I'm motivated by the money, money motivate me
I always got my mind on it 
I went to jail because I tried to catch a flight
And I forgot I had the iron on me 
I get the shit so cheap you think I drop a ticket
But really threw a extra five on it 
And everything a nigga drop be going crazy
Sounding like I took my time on it
Threw a bag on the table, he thought it was ten pounds
But I really put nine on it 
And half of them bitches was fake weed
When he open them up he gon' hate me 
I don't gotta rape bitches, they rape me
Beat a rap nigga up like I'm AP
Throw that rock in the air like I'm Jay-Z
Got a Glock on me, now, and I still'll do it
You can't name five niggas in the rap game
That can come out with realer music
Standing on anything that I ever said all alone
And I still approve it
You know I shot your homeboy
Fucked your main bitch, robbed your partner, I did that
And still get ya stepped on
The most slept on in the game, don't forget that, bitch
I ain't trippin' off another nigga, I'll be straight
Ain't even got a chance to eat
I seen you lookin' at my plate
You know the bitches treat me great
They suck my dick and feed me grapes
I'm on my way to get a bag
I'm fuckin' up, I'm runnin' late 
I just told my bitch that she gotta learn
To be nice to my side bitch
You gotta quit trippin' and callin' me private 
'Cause all of my other lil' bitches don't like it 
You know I'm a dog, babe, you know that I'm trifling
Been like this forever and you know you used to like it
That boom on my side and ya I call it my sidekick 
I whip out and shoot it, just do it like Nike
I pull out and swing that bitch ride on the crowd
Like a ceiling fan 
Yeah, we took the pounds from the middle man 
I got plenty of haters, got plenty fans 
But a hater gon' hate, we don't give a damn 
Got my bitch making oodles o' noodles 
Pulled up with that tool in an Uber 
I'm in the pool with a cougar 
They only cool on computers 
They told me I look better in real life 
I don't care what a fuck nigga feel like 
I just went out to lunch with your bih tonight 
Had her back to the crib before midnight 
I think I got more hoes than I realize
I went, iced my Rollie, that's real ice
All in front of her friends and her momma 
I still grab on her ass 'cause it feel nice

Ain't even got a chance to eat

Rather be myself, if people look at me, don't matter
A rockstar, nigga, just tryna keep it kosher
Try to keep my eyes on my own paper like my teachers told me
Soon as niggas think it's over 
Number one on the charts, I'm there vicariously
Oh, there they go
Biasedly pushin' negative narratives, I'm ready, though
Cops wanna pull me over, embarrass me
Abusin' power, you never knew me, thought I was arrogant
As a juvenile, police pulled their guns like they scared of me
And we're used to how crackers treat us, now that's the scary thing
Want anything we good at and we cherish it
Now we all fed up and niggas comin' back for everything
Rockstars, nigga, just watch the news, they burnin' cop cars, nigga
Kill another nigga, break the law, then call us outlaws, nigga
What happened? Want us to keep it peaceful

My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me 
You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin'

It's safe to say I earned it, ain't a nigga gave me nothin' 
I'm ready to hop out on a nigga, get to bustin'

Full of pain, dropped enough tears to fill up a fuckin' bucket
Goin' for buckets, I bought a chopper
I got a big drum, it hold a hundred, ain't goin' for nothin'
I'm ready to air it out on all these niggas, I can see 'em runnin'
Just talked to my mama, she hit me on FaceTime just to check up on me and my brother
I'm really the baby, she know that her youngest son was always guaranteed to get the money 
She know that her baby boy was always guaranteed to get the loot
She know what I do, she know 'fore I run from a nigga, I'ma pull it out and shoot 
PTSD, I'm always waking up in cold sweats like I got the flu
My daughter a G, she saw me kill a nigga in front of her before the age of two
And I'll kill another nigga too
'Fore I let another nigga do somethin' to you
Long as you know that, don't let nobody tell you different
Daddy love you

You better let me go the day you need me 
Soon as you up me on that nigga, get to bustin' 
And if I ain't enough, go get the chop 
Keep a Glocky when I ride in the Suburban
'Cause the codeine had a young nigga swervin'
I got the mop, watch me wash 'em like detergent
And I'm ballin', that's why it's diamonds on my jersey
Slide on opps' side and flip the block back, yeah, yeah
My junior popped him and left him lopsided, yeah, yeah
We spin his block, got the rebound, Dennis Rodman
Fool me one time, you can't cross me again
Twelve hundred horsepower, I get lost in the wind
If he talkin' on the yard, the pen' dogs'll take his chin
Maybach SUV for my refugees
Buy blocks in the hood, put money in the streets
I was solo when the opps caught me at the gas station
Had it on me, thirty thousand, thought it was my last day
But they ain't even want no smoke
If I had to choose it, murder what she wrote
Let's go
Brand new Lamborghini, fuck a cop car
With the pistol on my hip like I'm a cop 
Have you ever met a real nigga rockstar? 
This ain't no guitar, bitch, this a Glock 
My Glock told me to promise you gon' squeeze me

Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty 
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me 
And the day I die, I bet lil' Jon goin' down in history
'Cause I've been solo, rockin' Dolo, I've been stuntin'
No, ho, it's a no-go, I don't want you 
And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'
Lemme pop my shit
I came from shit, three of us and my mom, she couldn't pay rent
Two jobs, all alone, she couldn't quit
We was home alone when we was jits
That was before I was grown, before I was on
I ain't had no shoes, I ain't had no clothes
Lemme wear your shoes, lemme fuck your bitch
I ain't had no car, I ain't had no whip
Wonder why a nigga cover his ears when y'all talk
'Cause it ain't nobody could tell me shit
I spent 30K on my daughter birthday, everybody had fun
Nigga, everybody lit
When a nigga go home, I don't answer my phone
Everybody want to leech, everybody want a loan
Everybody wanna talk, everybody wanna clique
I don't wanna be friends and get off my dick
I ain't had time to think, I ain't had time to breathe
I've been prayin' to the Lord, I've been talkin' on my knees
I been thinkin' 'bout my pops, I been thinkin' about my opps
Thinkin' how can I stop me a nigga when he breathin'
When a nigga play with me, I ain't lookin' for my phone
I ain't finna drive away, I ain't lookin' for my keys
The fuck these niggas know about me?
This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey

And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long 
I came from nothin' 
Put yourself in my shoes, like I abandoned the race
And you ran in my place
Shoes too big, but they use hair strands as a lace, and they break
When it's hot outside, you don't want fans in your face 
But you might want a fan in your face
When yo' man got a heat and the hand in the waist 
Gotta keep a cool head, niggas got PTSD these days 
Some folks ain't live to see these days 
I be in the lab like Dex, coolin', takin' these Dee Dee breaks 
The PD way, I could write a book like TD Jakes 
Walkin' 'round my city in some house shoes
Know that they always wanted someone they could honk and shout to 
Just gotta remember, got a family in the house, too 
Don't get caught up with the one that still function without you 
This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey 
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty 
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me 
And the day I die, I bet lil' Jon  goin' down in history
'Cause I've been solo, rockin' Dolo, I've been stuntin'
No, ho, it's a no-go, I don't want you 
And everybody wonderin' why he come around and don't say nothin'
'Cause it been so long, it been so long
I came from nothin'
I'm the only nigga left, homie
It ain't right how they all went left on me
Niggas took my heart and they stepped on it 
Lately, I've been hangin' by myself, homie 
These fuck niggas made me sick, they got me nauseous 
Paranoid, all this money movin' cautious 
Flippin' quarters on a corner to a baller 
Run up on Gucci, you gon' see the coroner
Bright carats on my chest not pointers 
Paris freshin', we fresh like a foreigner 
Nigga tried to rob me, now he a goner 
Gucci Mane preach the gospel to the mourners 
Guwap, yeah
This shit right here sound like some gospel
I lost my daddy the same week that they lost Nipsey 
Ain't got no love left in my heart, my shit be empty 
I'm ready to fire on all my opps, let a nigga tempt me

Bitches call me a cutie, I'm groovy
My daughter took care of forever off music 
Screaming, "Fly high," to Kobe, Gianna, we ballin'
I can't tell you shit about losin' 
Finger fuck allegations, keep hatin'
I'm patiently waitin' on niggas to prove it 
Bitch, you know I turn piss into lemonade
Turn shit into sugar, that's chocolate pudding
Let you know I don't fuck with you anyway 
Know I keep getting better, you thought that I wouldn't
I'ma keep lettin' off, I'm a renegade
The media blitzed and I took off and shook 'em
Came out like a boss and they feel a way 
Gon' end up gettin' fucked, you keep thinkin' I'm pussy
Bitch, I'm 'bout my business, it's all about timin'
When I put this shit on, I don't cop from no stylist
I'm all on the TV and net, I'm too viral
I pull up with a vibe, when we hop out, we vibin'
I like movin' in silence, don't bother nobody
He come bother me, I'ma catch me a body
I don't get into politics, I just be poppin' shit
Obviously hot as a motherfuckin' fire 
Let me cool off a minute
I got nothin' to hide, I don't run from my problems
Just tryna get you out my business 
Only answer to God, I'm already convicted
If I'm havin' you as my witness 
Having hoes at my shows, tryna take off they clothes
I don't know what to do with them bitches 
You know it's Baby, nigga
Let's go
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me, let's go
Oh, no, bitch
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me 
Let's go, bitch 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me

Huh? Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Verse two
You do what you want when you poppin' 
Guess I do what I want, plus I'm single as fuck
See my boo in the cut, I got options 
Know I'm all up her skirt like a stockin' 
My album make hoes call me Kirk like my mama
I see how they peepin' the technique and jockin'
All these icy VVS on my neck, let's play hockey 
I'm guessin' that he brought a stick, 'cause I brought a stick 
And I ain't the type to be payin' for pussy
I fuck hoes for free, never bought a bitch
Hold me up to the sun, I'm not counterfeit 
I just got a new gun from my bottom bitch
And I'm ready to slang it, I'm armed and I'm dangerous 
Come fuckin' with me, better find a ditch
And throw yourself in it 'cause that's how I'm living
When I get in my feelings, I make niggas feel it
When I hit yo lil' bitch, I put dick in her kidneys
On a date with my new ho, I took her to Wendy's
We ain't going in, get that shit from the window
Take that ho through the drive-thru
Keep playin' me like a ho, we gon' slide through
It's cool, I'ma let you act up on the internet
Let's see you niggas act tough when I find you
Bitch ass nigga and umm...
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me, huh?
Nah, bitch 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Let's go, bitch
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Oh, no, bitch 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me 
Bitch, you know ain't no stopping no nigga like me
Baby, on Baby, on motherfuckin' Baby, nigga
Let's get itWe got London on da Track
My voice kinda fucked up for this one 
Yeah
They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop
I ran the light and hit the gas 
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch 
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it 
She always been a good girl, but she fuck me like a thot 
I take my time, I have her blastin' 
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga
Thought that it was over, but I'm back now
I run up them racks and now them hoes know how to act now
Looking for the truth? You found a nigga
Thought I was a one hit wonder 'til I dropped the album, didn't it?
Thought I was just like you 'til I bought a new car
Pull up in that bitch, like vroom
And I dropped your boo off
You'll probably pick her up later
I probably pick up a quarter million and shit on a hater
And it ain't a nigga gave me shit, but I did plenty of favors
I'm talking favors
Favors you ain't deserve and you ain't want that 
Passin' out these loans that I don't want back 
By the time you cross the line, I let you go back 
And now I pull up, drop the window, yell out
They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop 
I ran the light and hit the gas 
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch 
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it 
She always been a good girl, but she fuck me like a thot 
I take my time, I have her blastin' 
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga 
Look, I ain't trippin', I already got more money than my opps
I'm just trying to get more money than last year
Don't argue with 'em, we take care of any problem that we got
I just hope when it's over, you got my back, uh-huh
And I ain't nothin' like your last
Look, I ain't nothing like your last nigga, you buggin', I run it up
Had to stack my bread up, I was sick of feelin' regular
Niggas out here drillin' her and you worried about impressin' her 
I swear he's not me
If he ain't with the shits, then he not with me 
I'm icy as a motherfucker, golly
Why the fuck wouldn't they wanna rob me?
They thought it was over 'til I pulled up in the drop
I ran the light and hit the gas 
She like it when I hit her with my chain on and my watch 
She say, "Record," I use the flash with it

I take my time, I have her blastin' 
She know that nigga think he fuckin' with me, but he not
She say I'm nothin' like her last nigga Baby

In a dirty-ass cell, doin' push-ups, eatin' soup
The media believin' 'em, they wanna see me go back
Rich nigga can't rob a broke nigga and you know that
Locked a nigga up in South Florida like he Kodak
A quarter-million dollars in my motherfuckin' tote bag
They think I like to fight until a nigga get a toe tag 
Hang his jersey up, his shit a throwback

You the reason baby brother love gun smoke
I was playin' with your guns in the closet
Would've had a bullet and I probably would've popped it
We grew up 'round drugs, sex, poverty and violence
Wasn't hard to tell in high school you caught a body
'Cause when you walked in, I saw the way you looked at mommy
I saw everything, nigga, I'm your baby brother, nigga
And when you walked in, seen that look in your eyes
You told me that you got some demons

I went and copped a Cuban from Shyne out in Philly
I went broke and sold it, mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali, got bags and I sent 'em
Ever fall off, get some change from a freak 
We leavin' stains on the sheets 
You might wanna change up yo keys 
I got yo' bitch name on the leash 
I had this lil' ho from the city, she really went with it
Stay down like a G 
I gave her way too much salt
Now she fuck with a nigga that play in the league 
I put a hoe through the most 
I make a pretty bitch leave 
I might end up playin' with you 
'Cause you ain't gonna be playin' with me 
I used to fuck with a bitch that ain't even pay 
Rent she be stayin' for free 
I asked to pay a lil' bill
She act like I told her to jump in the sea 
Like I told her go get a rope 
Tie it around both yo' feet 
Tie up that rope to a brick 
Bend you ass over and leave 
I had my mind on the milli'
I went and copped a Cuban from Shyne out in Philly
I went broke and sold it, mad that I did it
Flew out to Cali, got bags and I sent 'em
Ever fall off, get some change from a freak 
We leavin' stains on the sheets 
You might wanna change up yo keys 
I got yo' bitch name on the leash I'm my brother's keeper and it been like that forever
We can't help the shit we seen, we had to live through that together 
All these demons on my soul, Lord, I need help fightin' these devils 
He play with me, he gotta go, go dig a grave and get a shovel 
Get in the grave, I'ma help you get there
Two jobs, mama workin', minimum wage
Barely havin' rent, fare
We was motivated by them pitiful days
We was raised thе right way
Do the wrong thing, we get whoopеd like a slave 
Make us go get a switch
Though you was the oldest, so you got it worst 
You was the oldest, so you got it first 
I was the baby so I got it easy 
Remember us cussin' and fightin' in church
Knowin' damn well that as soon as we leave 
The look mommy gave us, knew we was gettin' hurt 
One hand on the wheel and the other one swingin' 
Get hit in the mouth, okay, mama, I'm bleedin', Jesus 
Bruh, I been hurt, ain't had not feelings since we lost you
Feel like a prisoner of my mind, no one to talk to
Never let depression go unchecked, that shit'll cost you

Gotta give them both the world, I swear to God I got to spoil 'em
I'ma draw around this bitch, I'm payin' child support and lawyers
Tell that bitch to suck my dick, she couldn't break me if she wanted
Let it still with the county
We was traumatized when we was jits
I was fucked up when you found me
Since my big brother dead, guess I got four new kids
Uncle Baby totally 'bout it, Uncle Baby gon' make sure they got it

The teller tell me that I act funny
I'm going shoppin' with the trap money
I put that shit on and I drip
I tried to sneak in that bitch with the rod, my shirt was too tight, it ain't cover the clip
I'm getting high on the low with yo' bitch, drinkin' Hen' while I drive I'm control the whip

Don't try to pull out yo' picture phone
Kiss on this dick, ain't no mistletoe

Get rid of a bitch, I don't miss a ho

That ain't DaBaby, that's my babyA nigga barely read the scripture, but I'm spiritual 
Seven-figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle 
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal 
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you
Give a fuck about your feelings, pussy nigga, shit, I got feelings too 
Nigga, we was broke , shit, we had to steal our food
We cut like that, steal from us, shit, we rob niggas too
First time I ever robbed a plug, nigga, I was still in school 
I'll take your gun, trade yo' shit, come back wit' a different tool 
I don't want that ho, ain't coming back, bitch, I got a different boo 
Say I sound the same 'til my new shit dropped and they heard me switch the groove
I don't play both sides, you ain't one of mines, I don't like to pick and choose
A nigga barely read the scripture but I'm spiritual 
Seven-figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle 
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal 
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you 
And no, I ain't feelin' these niggas, I'm numb
Before I blew up, did my shows with a gun
Still can go city to city alone with my jewelry on
This ain't what you want
Treat this bitch like a cold when it's cold outside 
I got it on, it ain't in the trunk
Soon as I feel it's a threat, I'ma dump 
You can play for the internet, you know what's up
Rock out a show and I leave with a slut 
So many bitches want a lil' nigga, can't fit 'em inside of the truck
I ain't no beginner and this shit ain't luck
I don't like the library, but, nigga, I'm booked 
Damn, he done got full of his self
Stick out his hand and it ain't gon' get shook
A bitch say my name and I don't even look
A nigga barely read the scripture but I'm spiritual 
Seven-figure nigga, thank you, God, it's a miracle 
Turned on the lights and you see roaches in our cereal 
You can't touch me now, we ain't the same, I still ain't feelin' you
BitchAt first, I didn't like this beat, I just liked the build-up 
She tryna fall in love with me, I'm just tryna hit her 
She stalkin' me on Instagram 'cause I don't fuck with Twitter 
Say she think her boyfriend scared of me, he say that I'm a killer
Why he say that? 
He better deal wit' it 
Yeah, she gone now 
Got caught by a real nigga 
Wanna be on her own now 
She wanna roam out 
Tired of you treatin' her like a lil' girl
She wanna be grown now 
She wanna get dressed and go flex when they play her song now
You tryna take the bitch up the street, she tryna get flown out
She tryna date, go out to eat, but bitch, we ain't goin' out 
I'm fuckin' her great, I got the keys, I can get in your home now 
I'm all in your shit, nigga 
Thuggin' it out, feet on the couch like I pay the rent, nigga 
She runnin' her mouth, I'm beatin' her down, I'm talkin' my shit, nigga 
You ever find out, come see what I'm 'bout, you know how I get, nigga 
You know how I'm built, nigga
At-at-at first I didn't like this beat, I just liked the build-up 
She tryna fall in love with me, I'm just tryna hit her 
She stalkin' me on Instagram 'cause I don't fuck with Twitter 
Say she think her boyfriend scared of me, he say that I'm a killer 
Why he say that?Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ha, bitch
I’m really Rich
Okay, I got too many rooms inside my crib
I’m on FaceTime with my hoes, bitches asking where I live
I just sat with the label, but I didn’t sign the deal
I told my plug to turn me up
He told me, “Boy, you need to chill”
And I’ma keep the fucking swanging 'til we got a fucking M
Forever loyal to the family, never switch up on my friends
Inside the gate  been pushing weight before I ever seen a gym
Took a loss for thirty thousand when I dropped Above the Rim
They talking money when we meeting, ain’t no need to meet again
Ain’t no capping in my rapping, so I never need a pen
I like a freak to mind her business, tell the people I’m her friend
I play for keeps
I get the pussy, then I dip ‘em in the wind
I’m a motherfucking pimp
I fuck her once, I fuck again
Yeah
If I ain’t on Patron, I’m on the Hen'
And I ain’t tryna kick it with you niggas, fuck a friend
All these bitches in my mention, liking pictures on the 'Gram
I’m having way too much fun shittin’ on you niggas
They knocking on my door
'Cause I’m different on you niggas
How can I ignore that I’m the sickest ever did it?
Rocking shiny clothes and dancing in my videos like Diddy
I’m that nigga in my city
And if a fuck nigga ever hatin’, he only hatin’ 'cause he ain’t with me
And if a lil' bitch you hear is talking down, the bitch is talking down because she in her feelings
Know you heard 'bout Baby Jesus
Everybody round ‘em winning
I just did a show in Charlotte and bitches wrapped around the building
And, I got too many rooms inside my crib
I’m on FaceTime with my hoes, bitches asking where I live
I just got lost, I used my GPS to take me to my fridge
I told my baby momma she can work for me and watch the kid
Before I leave I kiss my daughter, my lil' baby getting big
When she was born, I told her she gon' be 13 in a Benz
Steady flexing on my old friend, I just dropped my next again
I’m smoking OG with my old head, talking shit and drinking gin
Fucking rook, you know you should’ve checked the pack
You bought the floop, I did the scoop
Just made the play in public housing, rocking skinny jeans and boots
These bitches hanging on my dick, they keep on saying I’m the truth
Bitches see me and they squeeze me, got the juice
I’m on the flock three times a week, for stuffing dick inside your boo
She call my phone, I’m coming over
Put it on her, she like, "Ooh"
I’m setting trends for all these niggas tryna copy what I do
But you can’t never be like me, you might as well just be like you
Coolest monkey in the jungle, nigga, motherfuck a zoo
Got monkey nuts below that AK, bitch pull up go with yo move
Any nigga touch my family
I pull up, shoot up the school
Had niggas begging me to calm down
Bet you niggas gon' get the law now
I ain't finna talk to nan nigga on the internet
'Cause when I bump into him, I’m a drawdown
Nigga don’t know what to do with me
They put a wall up, I tear a wall down

Got a cramp in my back, I was carryin' ungrateful bitches and niggas
I got it though, cut the light on and I see a soul full of pain when I look in the mirror
I'm broken now, ain't believe in this shit
I'll trade anything just to see big brother get up
How you even mean to do this?
Fuck it, I'm in my feelings
I wanna kill somethin' too, G 
Had to call my Dominican boo thing 
Call me down, I'm on FaceTime, a movie 
Shot me down on the page, niggas goofy
Knock 'em down, pay for brains like I'm Boosie
Hate that I gave 'em time that I could gave my brother
A shame how they turn 'round and do me
It's a shame how they turn 'round and flip
A shame how this money gon' turn into murder
A shame how they run down and spent 'em
Couple more on my list and we still gotta burn 'em
A shame how I still ain't forget
The nerve of you ungrateful motherfuckers who act like I ain't the trillest
And to do me like that, but you gon' feel it
Started from the bottom, he an eight-figure nigga

Fuck you tonight and make you want to kill him
I just found out that this bitch is a nympho
I broke her off, she said she can't wait to get more
I let her have it, put her face in the pillow
And end up rapping 'bout the shit on my intro
And I keep fighting myself feeling bad for my enemies
Fuck all this shit, nigga, pass me the Hennessy
Until they tell me shit, let them keep hating
I can't entertain it, it's bad for my energy 
Oh, ok, ok

Tryna get up in them pants, 'cause I really need a bag, I 'on't really mean to brag
I ain't seen a nigga yet that can run in with ya boy
I'm walkin' 'round the house without a shirt like Uncle Roy
I sent my Uncle Rick to get some liquor from the store
I need to hit the nursing home to see my Uncle Ray
Supposed to go and see my mama but I went and made a play
I ain't nothing like the muh'fuckin' niggas round the way, I'm the muh'fuckin' truth
Everything I muh'fuckin' do
I asked him what he paid, the nigga said, "25," should've seen the nigga eyes when I told him, "22"
Like the other nigga face when I hit 'em for the twenty
You know everybody 'round me getting muh'fuckin' money
I ain't forget to pray, but I ain't go to church on Sunday
I was selling pounds tryna break 'em down to onions, goddamn, there he go
These niggas hate it when they see me on the radio, they even played a nigga on the TV
These niggas late, I told these niggas I was great they ain't believe me
I hit the crowd, the people squeeze me, they be screamin', "Baby Jesus"
Fucked around and made a 20 yesterday from sellin' reefer
Made another 45 hundred doin' niggas features
I'ma turn a 25 to a 50, double that and bring it back to the family everybody round me eatin'
And if I'm on the stage and nigga in the crowd play crazy we gon' jump up off the stage we gon' beat him
I cut a couple side hoes off, cause I don't got the time of the day for them bitches I don't need 'em
All the labels lookin' at me cut the muh'fuckin' check
'Cause I ain't seen a rapper out here fuckin' with me yet
I'm holding up a Rollie on my muh'fuckin' wrist
And I'm dancin' round with diamonds on my muh'fuckin' neck
Fuckin' on her good like I'm tryna break a sweat
I just hopped up off a flight, flew to Charlotte overnight
I don't wanna be a killer, I don't think you wanna die
That's a muh'fuckin' .40, put it on a nigga life
What the fuck a nigga mean, fuck is on a nigga mind
Why he wanna fuck with me? I was out here doing fine
Book the show and pay the fee, I'ma turn up every time
I'm too busy on the grind, don’t try now to hit my lineWho shot your homeboy? Nigga with a diaper on?
Got on a classic Biggie beat and got a cypher on?
Your girl said she stickin' with DaBaby, right or wrong
Just gave me head in the rented car while the lights was on
You know me, I be chillin’ and coolin', know I'm the shit with the music
Since you in love with computers, go look my name up on Google
And please don’t turn to a groupie, these other niggas be goofy
Might as well pick up popcorn, we finna make this a movie
I'm somewhere laid up with a stallion, lettin' them haters hate
Eating jumbo shrimp with the steak off a paper plate
Balling on 'em like Michael Jordan back in '88
Got my dick sucked before my flight, it almost made me late
I'm in a different bracket than rappers, these niggas can't relate
Don't make me get to slappin’ at rappers, give ’em a change of face
I made so many racks off of trapping, yeah, I was slanging weight
I put the weed down and start eating, they say I'm gaining weight
Who shot you, that lil’ nigga with the pamper Baby?
With 10 pounds of Cali weed inside the hamper Baby?
Your baby mama looking like she want a sample, baby
I pulled up with the bald fade like a cancer patient
Who shot you, the lil' nigga that be on Instagram?
Do what the fuck he wanna do, like he don't give a damn?
Just got some head after the show inside the sprinter van
They know I'm a fool ’cause I'm smooth and cool as a ceiling fan
You need to get your boss, I ain't tryna fuck with the middle man

And when I need motivation I get it from a hater
And when I need some good head I go get it from your lady
I just might fly out to Cali and ball like I'm a Laker
And send a box to my brother and let him get some paper
Come back to Charlotte a Muslim like, "As-salamu alaykum"
Pull up in a silver Bentley like Mr. Arnold Taylor

Plus, I ain't ever think I was like one of you niggas, I been this way since I was five
Thank God I passed it along to my daughter, her confident qualities
She only three, got a whole 'nother beautiful daughter
They look like each other, can't wait 'til the day that they meet
I knew it was room at the table for me to get somethin', so I turned up and got me a seat
Just to get what they want, they gon' say that they love you
You gotta be patient and watch how they creep
Took the diamonds off all of my teeth
Won't let them put me in a box, mama bought the Reeboks 'cause them bitches was cheap
First day of school, we had new soldier Ree's

I touched the look on my watch, now it's two-tone
Watch you think be the chance I could juke on

Back to the basics, I ain't buyin' no ASICS
I told gang, "Grow weed 'fore he cop from a nigga"
'Cause these niggas be hatin', he know that they'll fuck 'round and lace it
Out in New York, still fly with the pole, young nigga flyer than a ho
I be one-deep, numbers, four-deep, put Forgis on the rims, then I go slide with your ho
But excuse me? I never ain't asked for this lifestyle
They get scared, know we shoot when them pipes out

I know you ain't callin' yourself a real nigga, upset cause you pressed for a picture
I know that they ten steps behind on a few of my gifts and they don't really get it
They know if they touch one of mine, I'ma air this bitch out
I put that on Miss LindaKE on The Track
Uh-huh
Man, fuck it, nigga, I really ain't playin'
I'm back on my Baby Jesus shit, man, like

Bitches treat me like a king, you can call me Mr. Clean 
I just lied to your ho
Put on autotune and told her I can really sing 
Run up on me, I'ma squeeze
Back in, count the back end, then we leave 
Fuck the show money, that ain't no money 
I make more money sellin' P's 
Thank the Lord, he blessed me with another plug
So you know I ran off on my other plug 
I mix the low ball with OG and drop the ticket
They come get it, I run it up 
When niggas be hatin', I smell it on 'em 
I'm duckin' and dodgin' them felonies 
I would just pull up broad day and start blowin' at you
But I know they gon' tell on me 
I left in a rental car, had about twenty on me 
But came back with just money on me
I'm fucking this bitch and she just won't stop squirtin' on me
She be suckin' and slurpin' on me 
Call up DaBaby and tell 'em, stop shittin' on me
All this sauce, it be drippin' on me 
See me in person and said, "He look different, don't he?"
Saw my pictures, put kisses on 'em 
Can't fuck with niggas 'cause niggas be switchin' on me
I always saw the bitch in homie 
I'm in the mall with my daughter in flip flops
But I still got the pistol on me 
I bow my head every day, I know God with me
But I still keep the rod with me 
Two .40s, it feel like the mob with me 
Fuck what they talkin' 'bout? I be like

Got way too hot, I put the beamer up 
I had the yellow 745 with rims
And my lil' bro had the Beamer truck
My niece's get good grades
I take 'em shopping for outfits and tell 'em to keep it up
Then I hit the backstreet and picked your bitch up
And bent her over and beat her up 
Your bitch is a dog, need a leash or somethin' 
She suckin' on me like a leech or somethin' 
I just sent her home in a cab 
I told the Arab, "Keep the meter running" 
I run through hoes and get rid of 'em 
Fuck all my haters, I shit on 'em
And he say that he want some pounds 
I pulled up on him with like ten of 'em 
My name hold weight with a lot of niggas 
I got so much weight, I could sit on it 
I turn good girls into freaks 
When they give me head, make 'em spit on it
Fuck all my haters, I shit on 'em 
I fuck the same hoes used to shit on me 
And I'll slap the shit out a lil' nigga 
And I make him go get his big homie 
My nigga dangerous and he need to work on his anger, but that's still my nigga though 
My niggas so real that if I was a bitch then they would've robbed me couple years ago 
I'm chillin' with my baby mama with a big .40, eating a big bowl of cereal 
Just got in a argument, she brought me Frosted Flakes, I thought I asked her for Cheerios
I was just twenty-two inside the condo
Got way too hot, I put the beamer up 
I had the yellow 745 with rims
And my lil' bro had the Beamer truck
My niece's get good grades
I take 'em shopping for outfits and tell 'em to keep it up
Then I hit the backstreet and picked your bitch up
And bent her over and beat her up Lyrics from Snippet
Narcos
Bust me down, Pyrex
Now this remind me of that hot boy shit
That lil' Weezy 'fore he changed his name to Wayne, nigga
Might grow some dreads up out my head, pop out like Chief Keef
Ain't from Chicago, but I'm guaranteed to bang, nigga
I'ma let you know, I don't give a fuck if niggas eight feet
I still won't let a nigga play me like a lame nigga
Nigga better go play with his lil' kids before he play with me
I'm know to crash, so stay the fuck up out my lane, nigga
Go with your move, you lose your life, you make the wrong one
You the type of nigga snuck in with a knife, I got a small gun
I upped this bitch at you and bowl a strike and make 'em all run
And I hate to be talkin' negative, but I gotta let it out
If I leave it in, I'ma catch a felony, nigga, boom
Got a pretty smile and I bust a nigga ass
I told my teacher I ain't do my homework, I was fuckin' half the class
'Cause I learned to do my math, 'cause I was fuckin' half of my class
"I thought your class had thirteen hoes?" That means I fucked six and a half
I took that gas and mixed it with the weed from my Mexican, it was bad
Take zip out of every .448 and invested in my craft
Givin' niggas my CD, but now you see me on the front covers of the magazines and the TVs
They coulda seen me with a P.I.D., but instead they see me with the VVs
BG, nigga, bling-bling
I make them bitches drop it like it's hot, my shit on repeat
Make me mad, I dropped three albums in a year, call it a three-peat
Keep on hatin', I fuck your...Lyrics from Snippet
Look, if she wanna fuck, she gotta sign, ah, yeah, ooh
My shit drop Friday, couple hours 
Talkin' 'bout a couple hours 
Ah lit, this too 
Look, if she wanna fuck, she gotta sign for it 
I been on the road for seven months, I had time for it 
Without an MBA , ballin' NBA 
She knew for five minutes, but she call a nigga bae
You know I like to switch the way I kick it
I shoot a tall nigga like a midget in two thousand dollar tennis 
I was getttin' blunt and chillin', reminiscin'
'Bout when my mama had two jobs, part time job at Wendy's 
But now my mama want it, she can get it
Look at your Baby, rich ass
Nigga play with me, I put that .40 on his bitch ass
Mm, yeah, they like the way I kick that 
Had to get back on my toes, she had a big ass
Prolly heard that KIRK droppin' at midnight, you need to grab it 
I fell in love with guns when I used to see my daddy 
Spend it, pistols , fully automatic
I'm pimpin', hoppin' out the whip like Uncle Aaron
My new shit drop a couple hours 
Your boo hitch need a couple dollars 
True that, your girlfriend ours
My bitch was speakin' Spanish, like the bitch was playin' Power
You know this be produced by the Kiddo
Don't make me put the scat pack up and pull up on you in a Benzo 
You know my paper longer than a limo
I bend her over backwards, bitch flexible
Look like we playin' limbo Goddamn

This music shit be therapeutic
He just got a new gun, but he scared to use it
Teach him how to shoot it, get that boy a tutor
One day he might need it
And I'm not the one to try to understand 'cause it might get confusin', so let's call it even
I just took a jet to see my daddy gravesite
A round trip to Cleveland and came back to Charlotte
My cougar thirty-six years old, when she ride around, she got the nina
I'm not talkin' Ca$h Out 
I don't jump in no water and back out
These niggas gotta see me act out
Since a kid, a nigga been the man with the plan, I'm a cash cow, yeah
Show a nigga money, I'ma go and get the money
I ain't goin' in the house until I get it
And these niggas know a nigga hungry
They ain't seen a real nigga top the charts in different countries in a minute, you get it?
I-N-D, she independent
You better cover up your eyes, it's double V's inside my pendant
VVs in it
Pull up in the foreign bumpin' Chris Brown, know I got a RiRi in it
But no umbrella
COVID-19 fuckin' concerts up, nigga, no Coachella
No Rolling Loud
Ain't smoked a blunt in six months
Daddy died, but I know the nigga proud
Cheat on a ho even if she ain't a ho
It ain't right, but she still hold it down 
Go ask the check, bitch, I'm loyal
I cash the check, give it straight to my lawyer
Gas up the jet, we one-way straight to Florida
And add some respect to my name, that's an order 
My demons come for me when the lights go off
Hard for me to get good sleep
Sometimes I don't know what to do but get the mic, go off

Nigga, this is the day of the week I get it 
And if a lil' freak seen out with me, you can guarantee I hit it 
I'ma pull up with thirty-five women , need to see ID, I'm big 
Ballin' like the NBA, they keep the NBA, they wanna hang out with me 
What you niggas know about playin' with me?
Fuck bitches, get money, we Jay-Z and Penny
And I just got one hundred thousand on a show, that shit I was wearin' a piece 
I'm a hundred percent of the shit that I eat
Anyways...Hey
Yeah, yeah 
Shittin’ on my old friends 
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends 
Look how I’m livin' right now 
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now  right now 
I'm out here shittin’ on my old friends 
Look how I’m livin' right now 
I’m lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin’ right now  right now
Revenge is like the sweetest joy next to your success
So every time I see a building, nigga, I'ma flex
All of my life I knew I was the best
I put in some work and I ran up the check
I'm feelin' like I'm gonna need my respect
Or I'ma make all of y'all niggas regret
I just woke up in a house on the hills out in Cali
And I went and hopped on a jet
I just might fly to Miami today
Just to lay in the sun on a beach and get wet
I just went out on a date with my mama
And I told her I was gon' get her a mansion
And I can count all of my friends on my fingers
The only thing else that I need is my family
I can't let these niggas knock me out of my position
Actin' like they women, talkin' down to bitches
Fuckin' up my pimpin', don't got nothin' against 'em
Hope the Lord forgive 'em, I'm no longer with 'em
I'm too busy winnin', makin' good decisions
Playin' my position, kickin' back and chillin'
Toilet bowl, I'm sittin', metaphor, I'm shittin'
On all my old friends
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends 
Look how I'm livin' right now 
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now  right now 
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends 
Look how I'm livin' right now 
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now  right now
Damn, homie 
In high school, you was the man, homie 
But now you a regular nigga
The tables have turned and now everything different
We only had clothes when we stole 'em at Christmas
And I used to borrow the shoes from my brother
I'm honest enough with myself to admit it 
Now I'm somewhere on a five-hour flight
Just to go live my life in a whole 'nother city
I can't have fun doin' none of this shit 'til the people
I love could afford to come with me
A whole lot of people was shittin' on me
And they think I forgot, but I never forget it
That's why I'm shittin' on all my old friends
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends 
Look how I'm livin' right now 
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now  right now 
I'm out here shittin' on my old friends 
Look how I'm livin' right now 
I'm lookin' like a couple million right now 
And that's exactly how I'm feelin' right now  right now Ayy, DaBaby

Uh, yeah
Hold on, hold on, lemme go, lemme go
Huh? Lemme go, bruh
My nigga left me, for real 
You know I got my check up, for real 
I think a need a check-up, I'm ill 
Out in Beverly Hills, Uncle Phil 
Rockin' J's with a fade, bitch, I'm Will 
See that look on my face, I'm for real 
I like when my bitch tell me I'm pretty 
That lil' nigga that stay in the mirror 
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
Who must chop it up, them all 
Watch your steppin', you gon' fall 
Tell my bitch to rub me, I'm a dog 
That nigga pussy, he a pup 
If he shoot my hand a nigga lucky 
Cost a hunnid thousand just to touch me 
My bitch stay J-Lo, call me Puffy 
I need a billy, call me jiggy
I am the extra pretty chocolate nigga 
I be tryna chill out, I can't help it 
Cross him out like Kyrie on the Celtics 
Left her message on the scene and she felt it 
They be like, "That nigga bougie" 
I like her, she a freak and a cutie 
Baby had me put a finger in her booty And I know that I'm the best out
Make a bitch burn my house down like she Left Eye, yeah
On my TLC, a lot of freaks
But ain't never met a freak like my freak from the westside, yeah
And I know she love me
She don't wanna see me leave, don't wanna see me be the best I can
She don't wanna really see how fresh I am
She don't wanna really see me flex my bands 
And I know that I'm the best out
Make a bitch burn my house down like she Left Eye, yeah 
On my TLC, a lot of freaks
But ain't never met a freak like my freak from the westside, yeah 
And I know she love me
But don't wanna see me leave, don't wanna see me be the best I can 
She don't wanna really see how fresh I am 
She don't wanna really see me flex my bands 
And she don't wanna really see me flex
She know I'm next, so she don't wanna really see who next
I'm knowin' that she miss me, way I used to kiss her
Way I used to hug her, way I used to hit her
Not physically, but physically 
They don't know me, why the fuck you let 'em mention me? 
I know they hatin', they need company for misery 
You let 'em get to you, but I won't let 'em get to me
I'm talkin' ever
I know you probably let him fuck, I fuck you better
I know you miss a nigga face on your FaceTime
Never stay the same, I always turn it up a level
You wanna dig a deeper hole? Well, go and shovel
You gotta let 'em dig it, is you diggin' it?
I had to separate, a nigga wasn't feelin' it 
Remember you was down when you was into me
But you no longer in it, now you fuckin' up my energy 
These bitches down for a date with me, but I don't really like to date
So all these cornball niggas can't relate to me, and I ain't even tryna hate
And I'm the type to let you eat up off the plate with me, but you won't even share the plate
And if I ever ever went out on a date with you, I'd probably still'll show up late
And I know that I'm the best out
Make a bitch burn my house down like she Left Eye, yeah
On my TLC, a lot of freaks 
But ain't never met a freak like my freak from the westside, yeah
And I know she love me
She don't wanna see me leave, don't wanna see me be the best I can
She don't wanna really see how fresh I am
She don't wanna really see me flex my bands 
And I know that I'm the best out
Make a bitch burn my house down like she Left Eye, yeah 
On my TLC, a lot of freaks
But ain't never met a freak like my freak from the westside, yeah 
And I know she love me
But don't wanna see me leave, don't wanna see me be the best I can 
She don't wanna really see how fresh I am
She don't wanna really see me flex my bands
She really wanna see young Gunna flex his bands
Know a nigga fresh, got a cross on my pants 
Took a loss, still doin' the best that I can 
I'm a boss, I can do whatever you can't
I'ma fuck her hard in a bulletproof van 
Money extra large, stretch from here to Japan
She know I ain't a fraud, do you dig what I'm sayin'? 
I know you want me to be your man 
A bad lil' vibe, you cool as a fan 
I knock the pussy out like she took a Xan'
You know I'm livin' wild, still gave me a chance 
I heard you fucked the dawg, I can't give a damn
Like DaBaby, I'm a player, I can't date her, man 
I'm flyin' past your crib, you can see when I land
I'm known to break a bitch, I'll never ever bend

Number three before four, this the three-peat
Niggas actin' like they wanna see me but don't wanna see me
I'm on that, believe me 
Even Baby with four, that shit easy
She pull up, gimme dome for the freebie
She suckin' and spittin' all on me, she freaky 
Wrist rock, pull it out and she eat me 
I got sticks 'round my house, it's a teepee
Like an Indian, big bank roll, no cinnamon
Big boy jet to the island, no Gilligan
Mic check, like check, he lyin', I ain't feelin' him
And if you see a check outside it's Eminem's
Nigga ain't me, he lame, I'm really him
If you with me, we gang, we the same, we synonym
They ain't want to give it to me, had to make 'em gimme that
Take a shot and send it to me, bitch, I'ma send it back 
And I been the same, sneak disses on the Internet 
You never see me goin' back and forth 'cause I ain't into that
Just tell me where your block at, I'm sendin' them to spin on that 
Prolly catch your niggas outside pitty pat
Prolly catch your niggas outside playin' jump rope
Said they want the smoke, all the smell is gun smoke
Think they tired of lookin' for you, pulled up to your front door
Nigga that shoot back, take the nigga gun, bro 
Bitch, I'm a dawg , but I don't want no...Get 'em, get 'em, oh
Oh 
Oh 
Oh, oh 
Oh 
Oh, oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh
Pop Smoke-
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice, yeah
I'm a thief in the night 
I did some wrong , but I'm always right 
Said I know how to shoot  and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night 
If I call you bae, you bae for the day
Or a bae for the night, you not my wife
She want a killer to fuck all night
I wanna fuck on a thot, gimme head all night
AP, big rocks, in the hood with the 'Rillas
5K on the dinner, bring three hundred thou' to the dealer
I did some wrong , but I'm always right 
Said I know how to shoot  and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night 
Lil Baby-
I'm rich but I'm ridin', I'm low on exotic
I'm 'bout to fly out and go get me some
Nothin' ain't seen, all this money on me
Hunnid racks in the bag, that's a honey bun
Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets
Got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young
And I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P Pop, I wish that you could see us
Million cash plus whenever I go re-up
I got some niggas in the street, won't beat me
I got the industry tryna be me
I just go Ray Charles, they can't see me
I'm in a Rolls Royce with a RiRi
Pop Smoke-
I did some wrong , but I'm always right 
Said I know how to shoot  and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night
DaBaby-
Yeah, like a thief in the night 
I pull up, give her D for the night 
Tryna fuck in the V, it's aight 
We can't fuck up my seats 'cause they white 
I'm livin' like "Thriller", I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine 
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio 
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho 
Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo 
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go 
Like to shoot, light you up, bitch, I'm Rambo
Cuban link full of rocks, it's a choker 
Rest in peace to the Pop, make me smoke ya
Pop Smoke-
I did some wrong , but I'm always right 
Said I know how to shoot  and I know how to fight
If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the nightI, I said I didn't
I said I really ain't wanna do the deluxe thing, man, but you know
I'm ready to put out some, some new-new
Show these niggas what I do-do 
Blame it on Baby
Deluxe 
Go
Billboard Baby, what's happenin'? 
These hoes wanna fuck 'cause I'm rappin' 
I had to drop the deluxe
Yup, I went up, got 'em uppin' they standards 
Blow at a nigga, no candle 
Ho-ass lil' nigga, can't stand him 
Still ain't met me a ho I can't handle 
These lil' niggas my sons like I'm Sampson
Yroom 
Baby just landed on a G4 
And y'all ain't even seen a nigga turnt yet 
My favorite song on here is probably "PEEP HOLE" 
Pass your boy the rock, I got the hot hand 
Like Shaq when he was hittin' at the free throw 
Got it on me, got it like it's legal 
I bought it cash, I could've got the lease, though 
Quarter-million dollars in the backpack 
Y'all gon' make a nigga bring the trap back 
I let her throw that ass back 
Pullin' on her hair, she call me dada 
Shittin' on these niggas, turn the fan on 
You really gettin' money, put your mans on 
I stand on what I stand on 
You fuckin' or you stayin' in the friendzone?

Ho-ass lil' nigga, can't stand him 
Still ain't met me a ho I can't handle 
These lil' niggas my sons like I'm SampsonLet's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle
And I put it all on the line every time
I came straight out the struggle
I been through the rain and the pain and the mud
And I brushed off my shoulders like that shit ain't nothin' 
I'm poppin' so I'm the topic of discussion
I hit the game so hard, it caught a concussion 
Never have time to play video games
'Cause I'm too busy chasin' the money
I just hooked up with a lil' bitch
She told that me she love me, I know she don't love me
And I'm still screamin' fuck the police
The PO and the judge until they free my cousin
I stay down and stayed in my lane
And I soaked up the game and gave it to my brother
And now he in the game after me
That's the way it should be, now let's go get the money
And I just caught a package from Cali
I break that shit down and front it to my cousin
I'm not leavin' without that 4-5
If you run up on me, I'm guaranteed to bun you
Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you 
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle
I just got off the phone with my mom and my nieces
I told 'em I love 'em
I'm gon' make it happen, swear I'm gon' keep trappin'
And I'm gon' keep rappin' 'til a nigga bubble
These niggas talk about it, ain't gon' do nothin'
But I'm the opposite, I say it, I done it 
And I'm prob'ly way up in a condo
My feet on the table, eatin' steak and onions 
And please do not hand me your mixtape
I don't wanna hear it, your shit is not bumpin' 
Got her legs on my shoulders, I'm swimmin'
And givin' it to her 'til she say she cummin' 
Got a swagger that ain't nobody got
And you fuck niggas hate it, but bitches, they love it 
And I don't wanna hear that's your bitch
'Cause she wasn't your girl when I gave her my number 
A lil' word of advice, better keep her off my Instagram
If you think that you love her 
'Cause I do not have nothin' to hide
I don't keep it on private, I keep it on public 
Let's put it out there off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you 
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle 
And I put it all on the line every time

Put his ass in the sky like a angel 
Keep the metal on me, I'm Kurt Angle 
Hope they know that we armed and dangerous 
He get hit with the steel, I'm stainless 
We go do a drill, won't say shit

Put the opp in the group like a daisy 
We left 'em GTA wasted 
GTA, GTA, GTA, GTA
I'm havin' chips in the bitch like I'm Frito Lay 
I'm bad
Get 'em gone the easy way 
Couple racks for a hat, that's easy cake 
I'm the fireman like Wheezy 
Put the stick in his face, have him freezin' 
Put the dick on the boy, make her leave 'em 
Me and Baby pull up to your arena 
Arenas too easy to fill up 
You might wanna book you a festival
She eat the dick through the cup like vanilla 
She do a dance on the dick like a Triller
She havin' fun on the dick like a TikTok 
Open fire on his ass with the Glizock 
When we say bye it's a hit now
(Too motherfuckin' late nigga, tag team champs, nigga
You niggas ain't talkin' bout shit) Yeah
(Niggas ain't talkin', hol' on, hol' on
Wait go back) Yeah 
Two bitches want me runnin' train on 'em
She like a teacher, she givin' brain on me
She got that fire, yeah, she put that thang on me
Painted her face like some muhfuckin' Maybelline

And she Bad and Boujee like she J-Lo 
She gon' suck my dick while I play Halo 
Take your sister, put her on my payroll 
I'm a handsome nigga with a bankroll
'Fore I started rapping, I was hood rich
Used to send my package to a hood bitch
All I had to do was get her toes done
She gon' suck my dick until her nose run
I don't want your plug, I got my own work
You ain't heard about me? Do your homework
Sending Boujee bitches to the voicemail 
Got them bitches asking do my phone work
And I just got me a new bitch 
She bad and boujee and she lit 
She fly as hell, look at her fit 
Whenever I fuck, I nut quick 
Get some bread from your bitch and go ball 
Get some head from your bitch, I'm a dog 
Let the seat back and roll up the window 
Get some head from your bitch at the mall
Nah, nah, for real though
I'm talkin' bout with the shopping bags in the back seat and all that
That ain't DaBaby, that's my baby
You better tell 'emYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Adro
Hey
Baby, DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby, DaBaby
Go 'head and send your location, I'll use the GPS
It say I'm 30 minutes away, I hope you can keep it wet
I'm runnin' red lights tryna get to you, baby
I know you miss me every time somebody mention me, baby
Can't take a picture 'cause you know a nigga Instagram famous
But if you sneak a couple in, make sure you get the right angle
That's all I ask for
Know I'm chocolate, don't forget to put on the flash, though
Don't let me catch you, that's why I cut off the last ho
She used to get on my nerves, but that bitch was bad, though
She ain't that pretty but nigga, look at that ass, though
Ain't puttin' nann one of these hoes before my cash flow
I need some manners, the bitches say I'm a asshole
And I'm never worried 'bout a hater
I just find this bitch and then I take her
I just give her dick and let you save her
We fuckin' and then we'll see each other later
Nobody know about us but my neighbors
Girl, we gon' fuck around and get in trouble
You know you got a boyfriend, we ain't supposed to cuddle
Somebody bound to tell it on us if we seen in public
I'ma call you sister, your nigga can be my brother 
We gon' keep this shit simple, you never gon' meet my mother 
Chill out with all the kissing, don't kiss a bitch 'less I love her
Girl, you ain't got nothin' to explain to me 
'Cause you can't be my girl
You'd fuck around and do the same to me
And that's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog
That's why I'm a dog, I'm a dog, I'm a dog, ayy

Quit fucking with that bitch, 'cause she a cry baby 
She say, "That ain't DaBaby, bitch, that's my baby" 
You the type to argue with a nigga on your live, baby 
I be done pulled up with that stick, but I'm not south, baby 
My dawg, yeah, that my dawg for sure, shout out to Lil Baby 
She like how in the summer I get black like I'm from lil' Haiti 
Speak in the black, shout out to Kodak, I'm a sniper nigga 
So tell 'em, "Don't play with DaBaby if you like a nigga"
Had a gun for every day of the week before I had a license, nigga
He cross me once, I'ma cross him nine times, I'm shiesty, nigga 
Who you know from the four that shine like Jon Jon? I'm icy, nigga

We see you out all of the time 
Where that foreign car that you drive? 
Niggas playin' tricks on your mind
Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water 
Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
My neck, it be shinin', my wrist, it be blindin', I wake up feelin' good 
My neck is so water, I'm sexin' your daughter, I hit her with the hood 
Ever seen a nigga with a mindset? 
Jewel House down with a Kel-Tec? 
Everything I rap, man, I live that 
So every nigga in the trap gotta feel that
Good life, I deserve it, dog 
Fuck you, I'm supposed to ball
I tell a bitch straight like this 
Fuck one, I want both of y'all 
I ain't die from cancer so 
I feel like I'm walkin' on water
Feel like I'm back in the fifth grade
The year that I got my first starter 
Boy, I'm a beast up at Charlotte
It's nothin' can stop me, I'm blessed
I wake up, I count up a check
I fuck 'em, I leave 'em, I keep 'em in stress
Big blue hundreds, I keep 'em on deck
Stop all that stunt 'fore I put you in check
Death row couldn't kill a nigga or diabetes
Man I feel like Baby Jesus
Baby Jesus 
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me

Ooh, I got water drippin' off me 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Ooh, it feel like I can walk on water 
Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
And it ain't shit you can tell me 
I came up out here on my own 
I didn't need no one to help me
Them plays keep on callin' my phone 
'Cause they know Baby Jesus gon' bless 'em 
A couple niggas want my dome 
'Cause that boy baby Jesus finessed 'em
These bitches tell me I'm conceited 
'Cause I call myself Baby Jesus 
But it complement my demeanor 
All throughout that, they switchin' my sneakers
Like a king, I'ma die on this gold 
When you make, niggas, they wanna kill you
Seen it comin' a long time ago
Before I had it I knew I was that nigga
Back in the day before I had the clothes 
Talkin' way before I had the hoes 
Now these niggas, they actin' surprised 
I can see jealousy in they eyes 
They tell me I'm out of my mind 
'Cause I told 'em, "Stop callin' me Jon" 
God told me I'm here for a reason
He gave me the name Baby Jesus
Bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Yeah, but you can call me what you call me 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Yeah, I'm breakin' bread, bitch I'm ballin' 
Yeah, bitch, I think I'm Baby Jesus 
Ooh, I got water drippin' off me

And they love it when they see Baby Jesus 
They pull out their phones
And takine pictures like they can't believe it 
Bouncing around on the stages
Just me and my people 
Calling my phone every day
Trying to get me to feature 
Niggas mad that they can't get in the game
So they hate from the bleachers 
Tell the fuck niggas, "Get out my way"

Don't fuck with these niggas
I'd rather hang out with my nieces 
I don't let these niggas around me
And that ain't a secret 
And if a fuck nigga owe me money
I might let him keep it 
I jumped off the Porsche on a Sunday and I started running 
I cut all the fuck niggas off and I keep it 100
I got tired of chasing these bitches and saved up my money
Invested it all on myself, now a nigga a monster 
Fuck what you talkin' 'bout my nigga, I'm happy

Now I put my heart on the beat

I don't need molly, I'm geeked 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me? 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me?
I had to get off my ass and quit playin' and go get the money
I don't entertain what these niggas sayin', I keep it a hundred
Talkin' to God when I pray in the mornin', I tell him I want it
Tellin' my mama to pray for her baby, I'm runnin' from karma
I had to start livin' right so I switched up my life and I picked up a mic
I'm feelin' picky tonight, I feel like I could hit any bitch that I like
But I gotta give all my love to the music, I can't even do it
And God is the reason I'm in this position, don't ever confuse it
I started off in the streets 
Now I put my heart on the beat 
I'm never fallin' asleep 
I don't need molly, I'm geeked 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me? 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me?
I had to get on one knee, bow my head and ask God for forgiveness
All of the shit that a young nigga did to get in this position
I got that pack on the way and I'm sellin' it all in the trenches
Remember back in the day I was starvin', I ain't have a penny
But it ain't get the best of me
I had to get out and go learn the recipe
I gotta keep all my real niggas next to me
We workin' hard every day like some Mexicans
I played the cards I was dealt, ain't no pressure
I gather my thoughts and arrange them collectively
Me and my niggas, we did it together
If you don't work hard then I don't want you next to me, hey
I started off in the streets 
Now I put my heart on the beat 
I'm never fallin' asleep 
I don't need molly, I'm geeked 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me? 
Tell me who workin' harder than me? 
Who workin' harder than me? Squad, squad

I fuck around and pull up on you in another whip 
Don’t even need a car, I'm hoppin' out the Uber
Take me to the studio, I'm tryin' to make some music 
You probably get on Facebook and start another rumor 
That's another pussy nigga actin' hard on the computer
Goddamn I can't respect, every hater get neglected 
Probably saw his girlfriend takin’ pictures in my section
Probably saw my name pop up in the phone, we were textin’

Every nigga with me a convicted felon with a weapon 
Baby Jesus or DaBaby, Baby, Baby, Baby

Top thirty in the nation, that's where everybody hatin' 
Chillin' in the condo, eatin' eggs with the bacon

Keepin' all this show money, I just stack it up and save it
Spendin' all your hoe money, 'bout to go on a vacation 
Yeah, I got your baby writin' to me on the Snapchat
In a white tee actin' like she like me 
I hit her DM, follow me on IG
She got a boyfriend, he know not to try me 
Say you a fan if he ask you why you write me
Tell your homegirl don't worry 'bout who I be

I ain't tryin' to be your man, I'll be your sidepiece
Hey

Haha
Oh yeah
That ain't DaBaby, that's my babyLyrics from Snippet
Really think that she like me or somethin' 
We just do it like Nike or somethin' 
Got that fire with no license or nothin'
You know I got that shit with that bop in it
Turn your shit on, your ho say, "Turn your shit off"
And now I got the media all on my dick
Probably couldn't even pay 'em to get off 
I pull up, get the bag and I spin off 
My lil' bitch got that ass and a sendoff 
I'ma pay for with cash, drop the shit off 
Play with me, bust your ass, I'm a big dawg 
They gon' put me to the test, but it's cool
I'ma pull up with my dawgs, DMX in the coupe 
I'ma pass 'em with a A, hit them niggas with a smile
Baby teach me the finesse, what you do? 
Nigga, never try to push up on gang with a stick to your nigga
'Cause you're lame and you know it 
And you probably got that thing, you won't blow it
I see it on you, nigga, all the time, you like to show it
Like the way I make 'em feel with my rhymes, I'm a poet
These niggas need to go and read a book, nigga stupid 
If a nigga see my text in their phone, let it go
I ain't tryna make 'em click and make 'em lose it
When it come to disrespect, we get ruthless
Got a couple million dollars right now I make off music
They didn't think a nigga was supposed to hop, they stupid
I own real estate and I own a lot of jewelry
I fucked a lot of bitches, I don't like to let 'em near me
I keep 'em over there, I tell 'em, "Treat me like your bestie"
Chocolate ass nigga, bitch telling me I'm sexy
I'ma keep on fuckin' other niggas' bitches if they let me
When I run and play sports, a nigga use a right hand
Slap a nigga with the other hand, he thought I was a leftie 
She rather fuck with me 'causeShe said I sign with DaBaby, I'm major
**** with no chaser
I spit crack, come get you a taste
I didn't come for no ****, look
I'm a player, hot the Feds say I'm on their radar
Them youngins go everywhere with any ho
I'm in this like a porn star, I went deep in a real one for-
I think this little person too hot for me
Ain’t no searchin' bro I got that thing with me
Ain’t got nothing but pink and blue hundreds
It look like we playing Monopoly
Ok, watch how I switch up
I went and cashed out at the lot, then pulled up, picked your chick up
Not when I’m at the mall all the people they follow me round, tryna ask for a picture
I light that boy up like a Swisher
When your girl hit up my phone I don’t pick up
Nobody sicker
I cuss too much in my rhymes, I don't wanna do it on
I like y'all showLyrics from Snippet
Quarter million dollar whip, I drive that bitch like it's  Chevy

All fifties on me, they pink they look just like her pussy
When I wanna fuck, she gon' let me
I love my bitch 'cause she gangster
I say she look good, she don't even say, "Thank you"
She gimme that, "Uh," I give her a spank
I fuck with the gun on her bed like a gangster
Gimme that , gimme that
That boy a grown man, girl, that boy ain't no baby
I used to pull up one D with the .45
I keep it real, I ain't told your ass no lies
Hold on, hold on, hold on 
Them hoes want me bad and I don't even know why 
She ride the dick on her toes
She put that pussy in drive and she roll out 
They think they in Baby's business, he buyin' Benzes
What do you know 'bout?
Uh, I'm pullin' on her extensions
Hit her way too hard , I might fuck up her blow out 
I tote my gun when I...

Bitch I got rich off of words 
A broke nigga get on my nerves 
I wash down the perc with the syrup 
I came from nothing I stood on the curb 
I'm a dude from the hood to the 'burbs 
Rob me, boy that shit finna burst
Bitch, I'll sent him to sit with the birds
Send me ten and I'll send you a verse
You broke, lil' nigga you need to go see a nurse
Them shots make him shout, like he in church 
I feel like they hating on me the most 
We make him freeze like he seen a ghost 
We pop an opp, then have a toast 
After the top, its AdiosLyrics from Snippet
First off, nigga, I can name a new label
That Billion Dollar Baby Entertainment
Turnt up young niggas, just got faded
Barber hit a nigga with the razor 
Ridin' like a skater, my momma raised a player 
Prolly shoulda named a nigga SEGA
I'm all about the paper , richest nigga in my city, nigga
Livin' like the mothafuckin' mayor
And I keep a pretty bitch pulled up
Ridin' with the chauffeur, I been chillin' with my foot up
Niggas all cap, bullshit, niggas pull up 
Left a PN98, that lil' nigga got the hookup
I'ma make her drop the drawers every time a nigga pull up
Drop it, drop it, drop it, drop it
Every time he turn around that nigga is the topic
You would think DaBaby popcorn the way he poppin'
He can't stop—
I ride like the muhfucking president
Rich nigga can't get out my element
I'm having cake like I hit for a settlement
Bitch I need them M's I ain't settling
They stealing the sauce it's evident
Drop a opp, we won't leave no evidence
Can't beef with a lame he irrelevant
Nigga get out his lane and get heaven sent-I got this pretty thang from the west side
Face tatted like I grew up on the east
She ain't foreign but my baby give the best ride
Ooh, she a muhfuckin' beast
And she say I don't pay her attention
I say, "Baby, I'm chasin' these millions"
She smile back and say, "Baby, I feel you"
I told her, "Stay down and stay patient, let's get it"
I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
Girl, I'm not finna play wit' your mind
Them lil' niggas just wasting your time
And I need you
Girl, I need you, I need you, girl, do you believe in me?
Gettin' money on the west side
Just tryna be safe, tryna stay out the way
And now she wanna argue, those games I don't play
Say she gon' keep my car, it ain't nothin' but paint
I thought it was all love 'til the love turned to hate
I'm so focused on music, no time for a date
You gon' have to go through it, if not you can stay
Tie a rope 'round your ankles and hop in LA
You were not built for the ride, you were not meant for the guy, ay
Let the gossip and rumors pass by, baby, as long as you stay, ay
You got that glow on you today
She looked at me like, "Boy, you know what to say"
That cologne that you like girl, it's on me today
Lift that dress up, I'm gon' move that thong out the way, hey
Understand that I'm busy, I know it's a lot to come wit' me
Comin' up, all I had was my family and my family trippin'
The only one innocent left is my three year old niece, that's it
Sorry if your brother daughter still missin'
My granny done messed up the family
Ever since she passed ain't nobody been normal, ayy
I got this pretty thang from the west side
Face tatted like I grew up on the east
She ain't foreign but my baby give the best ride
Ooh, she a muhfuckin' beast
And she say I don't pay her attention

My lil' bitch say she fallin' in love 
I told her get off of them drugs
Seven bad bitches in the lobby 
Thirteen hoes in the sprinter 
I bet her boyfriend won't try me 
Pick a nigga up, don't kill him 
That's what I had to tell my niggas 
Go check the numbers, I'm winnin' 
I had to get fresh for the winter 
Run off on my plug in December 
Ballin' all the way to summer 
Treatin' bad bitches like they normal
Ain't no back and forth, I never argue 
They done fucked around and got me started 
Don't compare me to no other artists
Million dollar phone call with Arnold 
Gettin' lit, we drinkin' out the bottle 
With another nigga baby momma 
I came in with two bitches 
And left with some new bitches 
I got so much sauce on me 
Don't know what to do with it 
That boy, he a fool with it 
That's enough women for two niggas 
Oh no, I do not fuck with no new niggas 
He know I took his bitch, he like, "You did it" 
Walked in with a diaper like, "Who shitted?"
These hoes startin' to get on my nerves 
Keep callin' my phone, they the worst 
Had to put it on do not disturb 
Now she lookin' like, "You got some nerve"

Pull up to my show, I'ma serve you a beat

They know I'm a dog, all them hoes off the leash
I fuck 'em so good, the neighbors call police
They knock on the door, we pretend like we sleep
I'm drippin' sauce, on my head to my feet
Her boyfriend too soft, don't compare him to me
Song on the radio, still in the street
Still will run off with your pack if you weak
Still ride with the strap on the passenger seat
Somebody tell me why these rappers want beef
Because their baby mama wanna be my freak
Don't speak or hear no evil that I don't see
I keep it on me seven days of the week
Pray the Lord protect everyday when I sleep
Popped on that nigga that ran up on me
Will not let a nigga trick me out the street
I'm 'bout whatever, ask Ree and TG
Matter fact, you can go ask the police
I know it's illegal, I still got that heat
I'll be off probation in three or four weeks
Pull up and play me if you think it's sweet

I turned nothing to something 
Went back to the trap, shit, I got it flooded 
I want a Rollie, fuck them gold nuggets
I took my bitch shopping, I told her, "No budget"
I snuck the Glock in my luggage 
And I bought a 4 and a slushy 
Get a pound then I break it down, a young nigga came from a hound 
I took a trip off the road with them straps, and I never look fucking back 
State trooper got behind me, almost had a damn heart attack 
Damn, they flipped the whip 
10 straps in this trunk, I took a risk
Pyrex bowl just broke my wrist 
Empty the clip, I shoot 'til it click 
Or put the gun down and use my fist 
Nasty lil' bitch gon' eat up the dick 
They copy and watch and steal my drip 
But I walked in the club with the pole on my hip
Walked in broad day with this fifth
No Uber, give his face a Lyft

If I make a mistake, I don't care, it's alright
I'ma just brush off my shoulders like nobody knows
The plug said he fuck with my music, he told me keep going
I just hung up on my bitch when she told me she love me
Fronted a pack to my nigga and told him get money

Until that boy brought out them bands 
My nigga, they crossed me again 
Feel like I lost all of my friends

It ain't no secret, I'm the truth 
These niggas don't play with lil' John 
And the day that they play, I'ma shoot 
These bitches, they know that you lyin'

Before I had it, I knew I was that nigga
Back in the day before I had the clothes 
Talkin' way before I had the hoes 
Now these niggas they actin' surprised 
I can see jealousy in they eyes 
They tell me I'm out of my mind 
'Cause I told 'em stop calling me John 
God told me I'm here for the reason
And he gave me the name Baby Jesus

We just came to shut the club down
I started rap and put the drugs down

He the plug now, haha 
We take them pounds and stuff 'em in a rental
We fly to california and we send 'em

I still will pull up and serve you out the window
I just made a play on the way to the shows
So it's fuck the show money, I ain't really trippin'
And I just caught a case 'cause I tried to go get on a plane
And forgot that I still had my pistol
Shoutout to my lawyer, I'm still on probation
So I'm tryin' to stay out the way, I be chillin'
A whole lot of fake niggas showin' fake love
But I ain't really bothered, I ain't really trippin'
A whole lot of gangsters be actin' like women
They get on the internet, typin' their feelings

Aesthetic  on the track, boy
Sweet baby Jesus
Check out the flick of my wrist
Pull up in my whip with a bitch who don't ask me for shit
Yeah,  that's how I like 'em, a bitch with a check more excitin'
And she so conceited, she don't even speak
Try my luck for a week, ask her friend was she dykin'
She say more than likely, cool, 'cause I'm feelin' like Boosie
Just got a fresh cut, I can see that she choosin'
And I don't give a fuck, sleep on me and you're losin'
Lay on my chest and I rub on your booty
Look me in my eyes and tell me I'm the cutest
But don't get it twisted
I forgot to mention the pistol right next to me, bitch, I'm a shooter
Shit, ay, we gon' stay away from all that, though, that shit gettin' lame out here, let's go
Bitch, I'm from Charlotte, don't know how to act
A lot of these artists don't know how to rap
Watch me put on, set the tone for my city
I got your bitch out that thong on a Wednesday
We hit the diner right after the club
When she see me, act like nothing happened in public
Forever our secret, I'll never discuss it
He got that iron, that boy swear he be clutchin'
I look in his eyes, I can tell he won't bust it
You know most of these niggas be fake as a bitch
Never told on a soul, can't relate to a snitch
And therefore we are not the same
Your mama and daddy ought to be ashamed
Should've used a rubber, gave birth to a lame
I stick to the code, that's the way I was raised
Pull up on 'em hoes rocking gold, switchin' lanes
I'm sorry but I'm way too gifted for niggas
Persistence, I'm way too consistent on niggas
City full of dogs, I'm the pick of the litter
Fuck the fame, the fame don't mean shit to me, nigga
One of my freaks woke me up out my sleep and start asking 'bout who I been fucking
I told her she wasn't my bitch so don't bother me, sorry, that matter's not up for discussion
I got that cash on me like it's Monopoly, look at my pockets, nigga, them shits bustin'
Nigga used to be my nigga but fuck him
Baby Jesus can't break bread with a buster
Love the way that she give head but don't trust her
She make me feel like I could walk on water
She call me papi but she not my daughter
She fuck with Baby Jesus 'cause I'm not normal
I was at South by Southwest down in Texas
Performin' walkin' through the crowd like a veteran
All thanks to Dinero, salute to my nigga, he gave me the platform, I had to deliver
At the last minute hopped on the plane with 2,000 CDs, ended up on a stage
Selling shows in three days, man fuck all that playin', they gon' know about Jesus
Fuck a hater, go ask your ho about Jesus
Bet she gon' keep it in the low about Jesus
But I'll dap you like your ho not a cheater
I-85, .45 and four pounds of reefer
Exceeding the speed limit
Increasing volume on my Runner speakers
Bumping that new Baby Jesus
My vocab astonishing, manipulation of wordplay is dangerously lethal
How they gon' hang with Lil' Jesus?
Look at the flick of my wrist
Woo, yeah 
Look at the bitch that I'm wit'
Baby Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, Jesus, hey 
Fucked up , I done invested in myself 
Got the Yo in the crib, it's over
You already know it
Jesus, Jesus, Jesus
You already know it Leave that shit on there Slim, it's how we rockin' now
Yeah, Baby Jesus, Jesus
I like the way you do it, it's DaBaby
So Disrespectful the muhfuckin' mixtape, Baby Jesus
Look, I think it's safe to say I'm the man
I'm pitchin' game underhand
From a city where niggas hate everything they don't understand
In a city where bitches date just to say that they got a man
Soon as he get a chance, he go fuckin' 'round with her friend
That's life, and that's the way that we do
Screaming who wanna see me 'cause honestly I can't see you
Start off knocking your dreams and ironically wanna be you
Most of these niggas see-through, that ain't the type you should lead through, uh
I wouldn't have it any other way
Just ran into this stallion just the other day
She told me that she like my music, thank you
I told her that I like her booty, can't take it
She started laughing so I know she choosy, hm
I told her we should go and catch a movie
Maybe go and eat some sushi
Chicken, shrimp, and steak hibachi
Yeah, at Kabuto's they treat me like family
I know this pretty thing from Cali, she speak fluent Spanish
I'm so far from being average, she don't understand it
I been working like a Mexican that's in Miami
She told me I'm way too busy, I told her I'm tryna get it
Maintaining my tunnel vision, obtaining a fucking million
The only thing that we're after, we saw it when we was children
Yeah, I'll be rich before I'm 25
That's the type of shit I was saying 1999
Go ask my mama, I was born in 1991
Another wild 90's baby riding wit' a gun
Fuck holding back, I think it's time to shit on everybody
If it's not making me better then I don't care about it
You play wit' me and I'm not gon' shoot any air about it
No, this track remind me of the summertime
Blowing X and smoking kilo with the windows down
Switchin' lanes to the music, I'm that nigga now
I see you niggas on my case, the way you niggas 'round us
It's not how I rock
When I pull it out, hit the floor because it's already cocked
When I'm not 277 doing circles and shit
I see how that nigga hatin', that boy worse than a bitch
Old pussy ass nigga, put a skirt on that bitch
Paid my mama to get a rental, put some work in that bitch
Fill that motherfucker in gas then I skrt in that bitch
And I ain't talkin' 'bout the type of gas that work for the whip
Aw man, I'm talkin' OG Bobby Johnson
Do you like that nigga song? It's the realest shotta

Made me say it four times, they like the way I say it, huh
They know I play it, huh, fucked your baby mama
She like, "Fuck my baby daddy, he a motherfucking hater"
And my birth name should be Lonzo, I should try out for the Lakers

Bitches tricking on me like a motherfucking sponsor

I'm not foldin' under pressure
I'm the crime when it's crunch time
Nigga play with me and then it's lunch time
I ain't talkin' 'bout no fuckin' punchline, like oh
I ain't ask nan' nigga for shit
Nigga holding out they hand like a bitch
Nigga blowing up my phone like a ho
Before I give to you, I'll give to my kids
I trust 'em and they turned their back on me, like damn
Cancer got my mama in the hospital, I ain't there to hold her hand
'Cause I been busy on the road
Actin' like I'm happy smilin' in my videos, steady doin' shows
But don't nobody really know
The shit been fuckin' with my soul
I need a drink in the club
Takin' it out on the people I love
I'm just a thug that's in need of some love, yeah yeah
Ayy, ayy, ayy yeahIt's Baby Jesus
I'm just saying though, like
What's up?
I'm on my phone ringing, fuck that shit
It ain't you so it only matters so lil
You know when we making love, we making magic 
I've been fiending for your love, I gotta have it 
I done cut off all my hoes, it's been a minute 
I'ma always keep the limit, living lavish 
Girl you know to come through in the crunch time
Eat that pussy up like its lunch time
Eat that pussy up 'till the sun shines 
Girl, you already know that
When I say you can eat that pussy, she gon' throw that
She gon' bust it open for a real one
Swear the love is like we here playing bball
And we fucking like we tryna make some children
Girl, I'ma see you in a minute 
'Cause we gon' end up catching feelings 
Tryin' fucking on the Henny
Put one finger in your mouth, while I hit it 
Sweet Baby Jesus 
Sweet Baby Jesus
Blowing mind in that pussy, then roll up the reefer
She always in the field like a shifter
Say she got a man, she know we be cheating
I don't need to know your business, don't tell me
We don't gotta tell it so it's a secret
She gon' bust it open for a real one
Swear the love is like we here playing bball
And we fucking like we tryna make some children
She gon' bust it open for a real one
She gon' bust it open for a real one
Swear the love is like we here playing bball
And we fucking like we tryna make some children 
Girl, I'ma tell you off the rip, I have my eyes on you
For a very long time 
You know I'ma change the topic 'cause a young nigga popping
It's a very long ride 
You just wait until you get out 
Infatuated with your lip gloss 
She gon' give a nigga head so good
I almost bit my bottom lift off 
She gon' ride a nigga dick 'till it gets soft
Remember nothing lasts forever, never get off
Turn around, it look like we playing football 
I'm tryna score the first play like the kickoff 
Undefeated like the Panthers 
I'ma light the needle like a candle 
She work the pole like a dancer
She gon' bust it open for a nigga on the camera 
She gon' bust it open for a real one
Swear the love is like we here playing bball
And we fucking like we tryna make some children
She gon' bust it open for a real one
She gon' bust it open for a real one
Swear the love is like we here playing bball
And we fucking like we tryna make some children Lyrics from Snippet
...been out, so watch how they spit
Bitch, I'm a pretty boy like Bel-Air, still like a bitch with red hair
But only if she bad though, 'cause I done got bougie
And any nigga touch me, catch a body like Boosie
Try me, I'm shootin', no back and forth, just uppin' and blowin'
Say my prayers and gab my iron when I wake up in the mornin'
And I got tired of worryin' 'bout your feelings, now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stay down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the time that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
And I got tired of worryin' 'bout your feelings, now I'm worth a mill'
Through the fake shit, I stay down, stayed on my grind and I'm still here
When I think about the time that they was lyin' and I was real
Wanna cry but ain't no tears, wanna cry but ain't no tears
I done been through enough pain to understand the pain real
Run it down through the pain, run it down through the pain
You ever need me, you aim, I had it down through the rain
I got that shit by my lonely, remember I lost everything
Try to make everyone family, breakin' the bread with the family
Ain't no one wanna see me happy...Hook me up, 4

They don't make 'em like me no more
They don't make 'em like me no more
400 
You  not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion 
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business 
They  don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
I knew from the beginning you wasn't my nigga, you do too much for some attention 
I can't fuck with these niggas, I can't let 'em trick me, sorry I am no longer friendly 
They  don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
I regret to inform you that I am not normal, sorry, they no longer make 'em like me
I just received a text from my bitch from the west, she said later on she gon' come suck me to sleep
It's a hell of a difference between me and these other niggas, my presence will light up a room
It's almost like magic, but I'm no magician, my music non-fiction, my words are the truth
These niggas be lyin', but that there ain't none of my business
Creating an image that don't even fit 'em
Expressing they feelings in effort to gain some attention
These niggas remind me of bitches
And God is my witness, they exaggeratin'
They imagination is not like the life that they livin'
My worst fear, deep illustrations of my life, it all seem so basic
They stole my appearance 
My wordplay a barbarage these niggas can't fathom
I just started rappin', I'm rippin' up tracks
Got my foot on the gas and I'm not lookin' back
I'm dropping my nuts on these niggas, I'm applying pressure
Your thoughts are irrelevant, fuck what you telling me
Not playing catch-up, I'm two steps ahead of 'em
Fuck is a soldier compared to a veteran?
You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion 
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business

They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
They don't make 'em like me no more, they don't make 'em like me no more 
I had to slow down on the second verse, my vocab might be too exquisite
For most of these basic ass niggas to listen, they don't understand it, they won't pay attention
The same conversation held with different women , give the best advice that I can give 'em 
I tried to tell 'em I was different but most of them hoes ain't understand the difference
One of a kind, you'll find a nigga like John, let me meet him 
I tell my bitches all of the time that I'm not a cheater 
And they believe me, got 'em calling me Baby Jesus 
That lil' nigga that sold the Impala and bought the Beamer 
And that beamer got a whole lotta hoes on it 
I set the trend I was the first one with the gold on it
And them niggas lyin' if they tell you otherwise
I'm one of one, not like them other guys
Pay too much attention to niggas opinion
Discussing they business, what the fuck kind of life you livin'?
You not really living if you make decisions off of other people opinion 
I'd rather be different, don't care what they think about me, that ain't none of my business

Baby, Baby Jesus
Gotta stutter when you say DaBaby
My phone keep on ringin', act like I don't see it
Your negative energy fuck up my vibe
Sending me threats, telling me you outside
Goofs in your high school to fuck up my ride
Said you did it again, said it is what it is
Scratching my shit, I go paint it again
Flatten my tires, I get bigger rims
That girl smile and I hit all her friends
And she know I'm a dog, I'm dog, I'm a dog
Worked real hard, finna take a vacation
I'd rather do this shit on my own
Don't give a fuck how much longer it takes me
I never fucked with these niggas before
I fuck with 'em now so they feel like I made it
Talking subliminal, this shit is pitiful
How they let that nigga feel like famous?
God damn, let's see act these niggas gon' act
Your bitch around me, it's a wrap
I just sent her a pic on the Snap
I'm gon' hit your lil' bitch from the back
It go down in the DM, I put her to sleep, got a Tylenol, PM
That's your baby momma, I call her my BM
They hating on John 'cause they all wanna be him
I really don't understand why niggas hating on me, all it took was some time and some patient
I got a whole lot of fine bitches waiting on me 'cause they know one day I'ma be famous
I got a whole lot of people that need me to feed 'em
They know that I got 'em, I won't ever leave 'em
I dropped out of college and start makin' more than my teachers
Now all the bitches, they love me
And the niggas they hate me
'Cause they all wanna fuck me, woah, woah
As long as nobody touch me, we gon' keep gettin' money
We ain't worried 'bout nothing, no
Your girl might need some dick in her life
Don't even lie, she get in your ride
I pull out that dick and she know how to ride
Pull your seat-belt, I don't know how to drive
I treat your ho like a ho all the time
Never I wanted your ho over mine
Say that's a lie, but you know she be lyin', hey
I know when that hotline bling, haYou know when I get quiet I'm always up to something, man
You  know that, ha
That  boy up to somethin'
Ayy, look
I'm laid over the bad bitch waiting on a package
Just  had a flashback, I used to have a pissy mattress
And  I done choosed to trap, it's what I had to do
The police riding up and down the avenue
As  soon as they touch me, running it up on the boulevard
When you only keep it 100, I guess they can't pull your card
Fuck the lean, I'm on the Henny
Fuck your main, I'm gettin' plenty
I  prolly pull up in my Honda, I drive wherever I wanna
And I was just starving on Friday but now I'm back balling on Tuesday
He probably hate on my bitches, runnin' round calling 'em groupies
I ride around with extensions, I keep it on me, I'm Gucci
I get a whole lot of Benji's, I put 'em on me like Boosie
I fuck up the juggin' for rappin', then I got right back to trappin'
I sold all the pounds for the profit, then hit the mall and went shoppin'
I'm who you call if you need me, need me, gon' get it, we got it
And I leave the gas up to Diesel, don't talk to me, switch the topic
I mean, yeah, it ain't nothing positive, it ain't about getting no money
I mean, where I'm at right now, you know what I'm sayin', I don't wanna have nothing to do with that shit, you feel me?
I wish everybody peace and blessingsLyrics from Snippet

Bagging bitches in your city at my motherfucking show
And you know I got a million on my motherfucking mind
Never get to chilling, got no motherfucking time
Took a nigga bitch 'cause she a motherfucking dime
We don't do security, we got in with the iron
And I got these rapping niggas tryna ride my wave
I take out my partner then I leave him on the stage
I take out my haters and I roll 'em in a blunt
Lit it up and smoke that motherfucker to the face, ayy
Let me switch the tempo, like a bitch so simple
Chilling with a redbone, I think she a nympho
I give you your issue, I get me a pistol

If I fuck yo' bitch, she won't tell it

I used to be light, now I'm heavy 
They pay me to be in my presence

DJ Infamous, ya' dig?Boy, I'm tryna tell you
Fuck it, go in off the muscle
Niggas never love you, don't respect your hustle
Every time they see you, dap you up in public
Second that you turn your back, they all like, "Fuck you"
What the fuck wrong with these niggas?
I wouldn't even get on a song with these niggas
You might as well go put a thong on these niggas
I smell the perfume or cologne on these niggas
Ah, time to turn up in the city
I pull up broad day with that choppa, let's get it
These niggas act like they can't get they issue
Bring Swerve out the cut and I send him to get you
Pull up like, "Who wanna see me?"
Try me if you don't believe me
I got 'em like, "Who Baby Jesus?
The one that cashed out on that new yellow Beamer?"
No play-play, no play-play, I'm bustin'
I'm 'bout whatever, won't back down from nothin'
Perfected my craft, exercising my muscle
Two guns in the club, kill the first nigga touch me
That's why I be chilling and minding my business
I'm half-way retarded, my mind is the sickest
Welcome to Charlotte, and this how we livin'
From East to the West, better be 'bout your business
In North to the South, fuck around, get your issue
Re-up in Charlotte then come with your pistol
Don't leave it in the car, I bring it in here with me
Please don't get me started 'cause I don't like quittin'
On I-85 blowing smoke out the window
Vroom, I'm Ricky Bobby, I send hits like Boosie
The first nigga try me, I pay for the bodies
Just call me John Gotti, yeah
It ain't shit to send a hit
Send a DM on the Gram, hit your bitch
Got a MAC-11, 32 in the clip
Keep a .45 with 15 shots off the hip
Pocket monster, we strapped up in the V.I.P
Fuck the security, we in the club with them pistols
Catch him slipping, go knock the mug off a nigga
Ask what happened, "Sorry, I do not remember," damn
Know how we do in the fold 
No pressure, I know what do wit' your ho
Bet I make her feel special, I know what to tell her
I sell her a dream, let her put on my necklace
Then give her right back, know I had to finesse her
Baby Jesus got more bitches than Elvis
You know I got 'em, got me feeling like Welvin
You already know that all dogs go to heaven
All my dogs is some felons
Fuck the law, ain't no tellin'
I switched up the pace on the rental
Pull up on whoever, just tell me who want it
I'm flat about all the subliminal messages
My confirmation and niggas respect the shit
I go to work like a muhfuckin' Mexican
I'm so unimpressed with these niggas
I expected the best from these niggas
I'm disappointed, that's to say the least
Somebody wake me up, I'm on the way to sleep
I find it funny how these niggas changing on me like I didn't do this thing by my lonely
Like I ain't put work in, no handouts, I earned it, please don't say my name, lil' nigga, you don't know me
I make it look easy, but don't get it twisted, you ain't built for this shit, I promise
I love getting money, I love getting pussy, and both of 'em come with a whole lot of problems
I'm the future of rap in my city, not to mention I'm known to fuck up some commas
What you niggas know about taking niggas money just to go and give it to your mama?
If I love you, I will never let you struggle, I'll give you my last, know I got ya

These niggas know they wanna be me, be patient, I'm just gettin' started 
Was guaranteed to make the TV, you play me, it's gon' get retarded 
I got in the club with my pistol, I cut up and shut down the party 
Ain't worried about none of these niggas 'cause I'ma do my thing regardless
They say I put on for my city, they say that I put on for Charlotte 
I'm busting juugs at my shows, just pulled up and ask what I'm chargin' 
I'm not a local celebrity, all of this shit , it took off unexpectedly 
I tell the truth, I don't speak hypothetically 
Do what I did and I do it successfully
Pull up in a whip with a bitch from the other side 
She told me to pull out my dick 'cause she wanna ride 
Okay, at the next red light, I got ya
She do her thang with that head, she a monster
She gon' cut up 'cause she fuck wit' DaBaby 
After she tell you what's up wit' DaBaby Baby Jesus

Shit I rob, I'ma serve 'em
My foot on the gas and I'm swervin'

Y'all niggas boring, I can't relate
Cashed out on the forum with paper plates
Walked out with the title like Golden State
It feel like I just won the finals
And I put that shit on the bible
Please excuse my language, but I cannot tame it
I knew how to cuss back when I was a baby
My mama was workin', my uncles done raise me

Just to double-back to come and fuck yo' thotty
Dinero keep telling me, "Lil' bro, chill, you was made for this shit, bro, you work for a mil'"
My cousin denied on his first appeal
Lot of niggas snitchin', acting like they real
Just kicked a ho out my spot
I made that bitch walk it out
What I told you 'bout running yo' mouth?
I had to go put that bitch in time-out
I do not think I was meant for a spouse
I don't have the time, blame it on my ambition
These niggas , they want all yo' attention
Soon as you go broke, then that ho gon' go missing
All of the bitches who counted me out
I take my dick, put it all in they mouth
Fuck all the rumors, I don't even listen
Off the computer, y'all niggas is bitches
How you a shooter? You don't got a pistol
Whole lotta goons, but they only on Twitter
You're one to try if you want some attention
I point out a victim, my nigga gon' get him
But I'd rather get money, be positive
No, you ain't getting money, it's obvious
Any beat, I'ma eat, I'ma body it
Entertainment for gods and the goddesses

Forgis on the whip and still skrt
Dab in the end zone just like I'm Cam Newton 
So many shooters, you won't know who shootin'
I fucked my teachers as I was a student 
When I cook a slab, might hit the dab
Pick her up in the Uber, then she takes a cab
She asks for the cash, but she pays the tab 
Threw up the arm like T.O., 
She asks for a Perky, I give her a roofie
I can't stand niggas that act like they knew me 
Throw the white boy tires on both of my  
Hit Baby Jesus, then go make a movie

Baby Jesus
HeyBaby Jesus, Jesus
Yeah, look
Okay, look
Fuck all that flexin', that shit don't even impress me
The shit that these niggas doing, I did 2011
She wanna cuff a young nigga, tryna arrest me
She steady sending me messages textin' callin' me sexy
Got a weakness for my complexion, she eat me up like I'm Nestle
In the car gettin' head on the phone like Tommy on Belly
Woo, damn, I had to hang up the phone
Thinking 'bout that mouth, I done forgot the name of the song, Flex
Okay, I got it, let's get it, let's switch the topic
I made this song at the crib, I recorded it in my boxers
Hey, I'm gon' cut up 'cause I know that these niggas watchin'
And niggas gon' have to kill me 'cause ain't no way they can stop me
I'm breaking bread wit' my niggas, we maximizing the profit
I shake my head at these niggas, they seem to be lackin' knowledge
And I'm in the whip wit' a freak, she get money and go to college
She hit me up every week just to talk about all her problems
I tell her to let it go 'cause depression'll get the best of you
Ain't no room to be questionin' people that's standing next to you
If you not comprehending the shit that a nigga telling you
You should pick up a book, it's a lot of life left ahead of you, yeah
Vibe with me, let me pick at your brain
I grew up with a couple nigga I can't look at the same, no
Remember when I was a peewee, I knew I belonged on a TV
And now the same people who didn't believe me
Ironically, they wanna be me
You gotta have faith if you're trying to be great
Maintaining your focus through all of the hate
Keep sight of your vision in spite of opinions
A master Patek, nigga, minding my business
My mind on a million, my pockets was empty
I'm sending to fill 'em, ask God for forgiveness
He told me keep grinding and now that I'm winning
I know he created me with a purpose
And now when they see Baby Jesus, they nervous
No other shit possible to me, it can't hurt me
Gotta be wise, man, them eyes on my circle
These niggas unloyal, these niggas ain't for you, nope
Hm, let me talk to you for a minute
You give 'em too much attention
They ought to be in your business
I'm not the hottest, just kidding, I'm being modest
When claiming that I'm the best, ain't no flexin', I'm being honest
I recollect their respective, not feeling me when I started
Relentless consistency, now they realize I'm the hardest
I know I'm the biggest target, unfortunately they garbage
But this is the type of music that's supposed to reppin' Charlotte
Like I be tellin' niggas, like, I'm the best in my city 
I do this for y'all
Watch how you talk to me
Glad you want me to take it outside
You wonder why niggas don't play with Lil' John?
'Cause they know I stay with that iron
One thing I'm not into is wasting my time
I'm not finna play wit' your mind
Knew she was a freak when I looked in her eyes
I love the way that she ride, yeah
But I can't trust her 'cause I know how it go
And you probably wouldn't cuff her if you know what I know, hey
But shit, that's somethin' you gotta learn on your own, yeah
And yeah, I snapped on every word on this song, flex!
Charlotte, Charlotte
Baby Jesus, Jesus
You already know it

Smack yourself on the ass one time
I just ate pork chops
You just ate pork chop?
Yes, nigga, I just ate pork chops
You-You save me one?
Ha, nah, there was only four pieces
That's fucked up, I need you to say it for me though, I need you to, say it one more time for me
Why you don't catch me in the daytime?
I wasn't at the studio yet
Oh my god, hold on, my phone about to cut off line
Don't let it cut off, just scream it one more time for me
Baby Jesus, though!
Yeah, and I need you to, uh
But I need more of that up-North accent on it
Say just like that, but more of that up-North accent

Okay, let me-Yeah, her too, her too, that'll work
Come here, Lucy

Baby Jesus, though, no, ew, just like a bird
She said she sound like a bird
Okay, but these country niggas like that shit!
These country niggas like birds

Alright, what I'm sayin'? "Pull it out, let me see it?"
Yeah, "Pull it out, let me see it."
Alright, 123, can you do the 123? Say that
1, 2, 3
Pull it out, let me see it
Thank you so muchJust told my brother Ri, bruh, we gon' see a million dollars
These  niggas can't fuck with me , ay bruh, I put that shit on our mama
I  pull up in that bumblebee , all you smell is cologne and good marijuana
Told you I was that nigga but you didn't listen, I know you regret it, tell me what you missin'
Now watch out for these bitches, won't leave me alone, they keep sending pictures, I need a new phone, woo
I  used to put on the same clothes all throughout the week but I still had them hoes
I  used to put on the same clothes all throughout the week but I still had them hoes
Then shit got ridiculous, I learned how to save shit, got out of control
I perform on a stage in a few different states and I love to see people turn up at my shows
My nigga went on 'cause I didn't have time, but still I had time to go fuck with them hoes
I gotta do better, spend time with the family
Take  a vacation, get back to Miami
Smoke a blunt with my brother, go chill with my cousin
Make sure all my people know that I still love 'em
The fame'll do nothing, it's crazy, same reason they hate me, same reason they love me
But unfortunately I am impatient, I won't keep you waitin', I'm gon' keep it comin'
Consistently creatin' music and stackin' my paper, preparin' for something
Said fuck it, I'm dropping a mixtape, quit telling me be patient, bruh, this shit ain't nothing 
I was approached by a nigga in public, ain't like his demeanor so I started clutchin'
He told me he fuck with me, fuck with my music, I let go the tool, told the nigga I love him
I told him take one of my CDs, he told me he got one but he need another
And that was at 6:45 in the morning, I ran out of Swishers while I was recording 
Fly to the islands with one of my freaks
You already know I'm turnt up on the beach
That's why I didn't pick up my phone for a week
Fuck it, I'm living, I know when these haters won't get me
Got  he got me, nobody can stop it
What you think? I'm Baby Jesus, these niggas make believe, I make believers
But how many said that shit when I was John?
She tell me she fuck wit; me 'cause of my grind
Been grinding forever, I told her stop lying
I told her she fuck with me 'cause of my shine
It don't even matter, shit, how can I blame ya
I am a god with the gun and the weapon
Shall prosper, I'm walking with heavenly angels
I have just noticed my calling was to be your prophet
Disguised as an artist to put on for Charlotte
(You already know it, nobody can fuck wit' me
Niggas around me, all of 'em grew up wit' me)
Some of them niggas, they didn't grow up wit' me
But I bet they wanted nobody fuck wit' me
You already know it, we calling 'em coming
You already know it, free all of my cousins
You already know it, nigga, Baby Jesus
Huh
 Smoke some one time
Let me fuck some one time 
I want suck some one time 
You already know 
Hey 
You already know it, hey 
Hey, hey, poof, yeahYeah, yeah, yeah, it's DaBaby
Baby  Jesus, entertainment for the Gods
Niggas  claim they got a deal for me, ha
If you done made it this far in the mixtape, man, I love you for that, you hear me, it's Baby Jesus, man
Yeah, what deal nigga? 
Show  me the money or just shut the fuck up talkin' to me
It's  DaBaby, bitch!
I finished a show and go sell a bow
Hop  right off a stage and jump in a rental
I see how they act when they in they feelings
And me, I rap just what I'm really living
I'ma keep winning and hit they women
I'ma  keep living the shit they spittin'
I'ma forgive 'em but won't forget it
I'ma get rich, put on for my city 
Take all the pain, leave it on the stage
Take off a plug and go make a play
I'm showin' love on the weed today
Did a pound of the OG for three today
It's a drought but I'm selling 'em cheap today
Play with me, send a hit where your people stay
Pray to God that I don't gotta prove it
Play with John and you know I'ma lose it
First let me start off by saying I came from the struggle, I came up from nothing
Oodles o'noodles when we had the munchies
I slept on a mattress, I don't need no covers
Had roaches and rats, you can go ask my brothers
I wan' see a mansion, and yankin' my foot up they ass with this rap
You can hate it or love it, this chick that I'm with is so bad I pulled over in traffic and laid her up right there in public, mwah
You say I'm disgusting, but these bitches, they love it
Better get you some money, yeah
I'm staying down with my niggas, don't play around with my niggas
I take your pounds with my niggas, I play the town with my niggas, you play around you could get it
I do not have time for these bitches, I do not have time for these niggas
I have all of my time dedicated to grind and get rich or die trying, my mind on a million
Not even half-way close to where I wanna be, I'm only 23, I don't have children
I hit the club one-deep, everyone fuck with me, showing me love when I walk in the building
But it don't matter, my mama still working, I'm still out here robbin', I'm still out here serving
I take your shit, act like it was an accident, that ain't what happened, I did it on purpose
These niggas dying to find out the recipe, working excessively, taking these chances
Moving aggressively, while calculatin' decisions, you probably won't understand it
All of them niggas who say they your niggas, be talking about you when you are not wit' 'em
Don't even address it, that shit was expected, initially, honestly, I'm not offended
If you wish me the worst, no hard feelings, I wish you the best, your success, that ain't none of my business
However, I want you to know I don't fuck wit' you, I say it loud so you could comprehend itOh, you think it's sweet 'cause you're up now?
You done got comfortable, huh?
A young nigga turn up on anybody
These niggas not fucking with us
Tell me you turned to a lover boy
You make a song for these bitches
You must have forgot who you with
You must have forgot 'bout your millions 
Y'all must have forgot I'm the realest
Huh? Huh? Doggin' these hoes
Yeah, I don't be callin' these hoes
Strapped up at all of my shows
I got .30's and all of my Glocks
All of us hot, uh
Ballin' a lot, yeah
Fuck is they talkin' 'bout?
Uh, they speak and they runnin' their mouth
You niggas, I'm callin' you out
I heard it's a real nigga drought
Until they brought real niggas out
Niggas ain't know I'm the realest
I stunt on a ho like I'm pimpin'
A whole lotta sauce got me drippin'
You better send shots with that dissin'
Uh, I fucked his bitch and he knew that
I pull up and hop out with two hoes
I left my new ho for a new ho
Bent down to his bitch at the shoe store
She told me she fuck with my flavor
I don't give a fuck 'bout no hater
Go wherever I go with that banger
Play with me and you know I'ma spank him, uh
Keep a Glock on my side like a pager
Might slap me a rapper, might hang him
All my niggas corrupt and they dangerous
If she want some this, it might change her
On the first four, I'm fuckin' for hours
You was gone, but ain't come in light powder
Niggas fools, so they gon' get devoured
All my niggas blow up like the towers
Uh, these niggas scary
Don't talk my head off, I'm ready
If you gon' pull up, then pull up
When that bitch up, they be stuck
I got your bitch in my bed
That lil' bitch sick with the head
I can't put shit in my leg
I had to give her some bread
Lil Shaq in the bag, make 'em go crazy
I don't trust shit but my Glock and my baby
All 'bout some trouble, so, nigga, we ready
All of that hatin' gon' turn you real deadly
On that lil' nigga, I'm hoping y'all listen
DaBaby in Pull-Ups, my nigga was shittin'
These niggas hatin', these niggas ain't with it
You come with them problems, I promise I'll fix it
BitchYou took my son away from me
You know how hard it was for me to get him this damn school and graduate?
You know how many black men graduate?
Not many
Because you bring them down to this type of level where they feel like, "I don't got nothing to live for, anyway"
"They gon' try to take me out, anyway"
Rest in peace
To all those we lost
By murder of the police
Damn
Don't shoot me, my nigga, it's just a book
It's probably what keeps everyone's life end up getting took
Wanna put that iron on us because of the way we look
My mama call me every time there's a shooting because she shook, this shit real
Just watch the news, in my city, we goin' crazy
Ain't nobody backin' down, we wildin' like it's the 80's
Why y'all hate the police?
I hate them 'cause they hate me
Why y'all burnin' cop cars?
Why'd the judge put me on probation?
So it y'all don't make no sense to us and we don't make no sense to you
Let's all start using common sense and see what common sense'll do
They went and got the army?
We got ourselves a couple missiles, too
But I'ma use my words, 'cause I'm somebody they gon' listen to
DaBaby, I'm proud of this Charlotte, this city made me
Let one more cop get away and it's gon' get crazy
You probably watchin' CNN, don't listen to it
And you probably shouldn't speak on this shit if you ain't been through it, for real
R.I.P
Today, the FBI entered the case of an officer in Ferguson, Missouri who shot an unarmed black man to death over the weekend 
That sparked rioting
Fires were set 
I watched the police chase after the guy full force
He was unarmed, he ran for his life, they shot him and he fell
He put his arms up to let them know he was compliant and he was unarmed, and they shot him twice in the arm, and he fell to the grounnd 
And, "Murder," was all she wrote
Yeah, and dying was not a choice
Another life lost of murder
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
I'm just tryna live right
They just tryna take my life
Another soul lost of murder
They supposed to protect and serve us 
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
They shot my daddy
I'm say this one more, I'm tired
My daddy was over there reading a motherfucking book in the car
No, they tased him first, then they shot him four motherfucking times in the chest 
I ain't waitin' for the perfect moment, took the moment and made it perfect
Don't do it for the money, but I know I deserve it
For the people that feel saved by the Zimmerman verdict
Rest in peace Jonathan Ferrell, 'cause you was murdered
By the same people that's supposed to protect and serve us
Now what I'm supposed to tell my kids when they heard it
Uh, crazy world, swear it's a crazy world
As I put this prosthetic leg on my little girl
Lookin' at I, so pure
All of this pain we must endure
They killin' our youth for they 
Can't even send my son to the store if it's secure
I'm so tired of bendin' my hand today
Grab on my pistol and just go blast the way
I might seem ignorant, but I have to say
I don't know if I'ma die because I'm black today
And, "Murder," was all she wrote
Yeah, and dying was not a choice
Another life lost of murder
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
I'm just tryna live right
They just tryna take my life
Another soul lost of murder
They supposed to protect and serve us 
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
They supposed to protect and serve us
Hey, they supposed to protect and serve us
Yeah

Swear I done took a hunnid losses

But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
Swear I done took a hunnid losses

But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
How can I sweat it?
These niggas couldn't be me
These niggas could never be John
These niggas ain't seen what I seen
I was born up in Cleveland, we was in the projects
My mama said, "Fuck that", and we moved to Charlotte
I was on the 7, we lived in apartments
And I spinned that Mario, had me retarded
Was a black ass lil' nigga that always loved talkin'
Always had my chest out, chin up when I walk
Got a 3 story house, big enough for the family
Me and my big brothers thought it was a mansion
My uncles was homeless, my mama took pity
All of 'em smoke crack, they all from Mississippi
All they do is bet, they gon' try to finesse shit
They taught me the game, that's why I'm a finesser
Remember back in the day
High school so back to the K
Ain't have no money to shop
Stole from the mall everyday
Cool would let me wear his Js
My man Denida, he ain't have shit either
His pops in New York, he got everything cheaper
My nigga for life, one time he let me keep her
Swear I done took a hunnid losses

But I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
I ain't gon' sweat it, I ain't gon' sweat it
My name it got hot in the streets while I'm switching the feet and the paint on my car
I see my old hoes and I don't even speak, they like, "Who do you think that you are?"
The same nigga you slept on, I made that ass wake up
Always had bitches, but now that my cake
I done got picky, and fuck who don't like it
These hoes don't excite me, I need some excitement
My shoes are Versace, I'm good on the Nikes
I remember the days that I didn't have shit
Remember the days that I didn't have a whip
Now I got 2, still got my Impala
Was riding with Raider when he had the Honda
Me and McKu and I can't forget Dada
And green for a while, while I was in Costco
Spent 2 years in college, did that for my mama
Dropped out of college, did that for the family
I got the weight of the world on my shoulders
I got the weight on the boat straight from Cali
Honor the pressure, it made me a soldier
Stay out my way, you gon' make me expose ya
100%, and I don't do no folding
Fuck what you think, fuck what you know
Fuck all that talking, fuck what they told ya
Swear I done took a hunnid losses

Get a bitch, she throwin' ass, look how she act, she goin' baby

Stomach on her forehead, head between my legs, that's where her face at
Told her put me on the camera so later on she could watch the playback

Ridin' through another nigga hood, they look, I stare back

My hood so relentless, more hungry than ever
My nuts to the floor, don't know what else to tell ya, damn
Look who cashed out on that foreign
That's Baby Jesus, they hate when that thing pull up on 'em
Threw an extra 10 bands in the motor
I drive that bitch like I don't even want it, ooh
All of my new bitches love me, all of my old bitches hate me
All of 'em exclusive, ain't none of 'em basic
Some of 'em wan' have my baby, I got these hoes goin' crazy
We should all get a rental and go to Miami
Go chill on the beach like we all a big family
We can all get along, I'll take all of y'all shopping
Check in a hotel and we all pop a molly
You kissing on her and she kissing on me
And she licking on her and it's way more than three
You're back to the city, I won't tell her a thing
I'm Baby Jesus, the fuck do you mean?
Ain't no more stressin', we on, ain't gotta tell you
Ain't no way I'm gon' stop it, I can't do nothin' but flex

That's why I'm sliding on them leather seats
One thing for certain
I'll make you play like I'm Willy Beam
Ridin' 'til it hurts
Hit that money, call it Quan out loud
It's time to work
And it wasn't even thought of leavin'
It ain't been perfect, nah
We stayed in that trap 'til we ran him up
They labelled us animals
They think that I'd make this far from nothing
Still kept on flexing, fell down I got up
Hakuna matata, your friend is a stallion
Defend to the death of it, money a product
Love 
Hop out that TEC, 
Ain't no more stressin', we on, ain't gotta tell you
Ain't no way I'm gon' stop it, I can't do nothin' but flex
Just look at the crowd I see the watts, but I been ready
Do better under pressure, I know you gon' hate, I ain't sweatin' it
It's like I got a money fetish 
It's like I got a money fetish 
It's like I got a money fetish Even if I told you, still wouldn't understand what happened
Rather be myself, if people look at me, don't matter
A rockstar, nigga, just tryna keep it kosher
Try to keep my eyes on my own paper like my teachers told me
Soon as niggas think it's over 
Number one on the charts, I'm there vicariously
Oh, there they go by us
They pushin' negative narratives, I'm ready though
Cops wanna pull me over, embarrass me
Abusin' power, you never knew me, thought I was arrogant
As a juvenile, police pulled their guns like they scared of me
And we're used to how crackers treat us, now that's the scary thing
Want anything we good at and we cherish it
Now we all fed up and niggas comin' back for everything
Rockstars, nigga, just watch the news, they burnin' cop cars, nigga
Kill another nigga, break the law, then call us outlaws, nigga
What happened? Want us to keep it peaceful
Shoulda seen them hatin' bitches face when I bought that Lamborghini 
Throw up my middle finger, police can't catch me, this aLyrics from Snippet
Ah, started
Keep acting like I don't go dumb, retarded
You know this shit more than a tack, got this shit on my back, I put on for Charlotte
She thought she was grabbin' my dick, I kept smackin' her hand, she was touchin' my .40 
Okay, I know they ain't gon' like how I do this
Give me thirty days, I'ma be too rich
Give me two bitches, I can both of 'em
Probably kick them hoes out, I don't want none
I'm a dog, trifle
I don't like normal hoes, don't excite me
Tell him, "Don't play with me if you like her"
Put his ass in the sky like some lightning
Two redbones kissin' in the backseat
My ho got a ho, yeah, she dikey
I'm fuckin' 'em both from the floor
I'm chokin' 'em out and they like it
'Member when your lil' bitch ain't come home?
Came back smelling like different cologne?
'Member that day you went through that shit?
Then you found my lil' pic in her phone?
You know how it go, bro, don't sweat
Let your ho be a ho, you can't help it
Share a lick with my bro, we ain't selfish
Leave the building, they treat me like Elvis
Like Elvis just left the building
I come back every day if they book me
Made a left at the light, seen 'em lookin'
Shoot a burner at the cop, he a pussy
Ayy, sweet, cookie

She think that she know what to do to me

She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
She think that she know what to do to me
She say that she know what to do to me
She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
Woo, can't even lie, Baby the truth

Check out the way that she dancin'
A lot of these hoes, they can't stand her
She got me watchin', I can't even stop it
I'm falling in love with the way that she pop it
She told me sit back while she eat up that chocolate
What you tryna do to me?
Bring up them hoes, she gon' say switch the topic
"What that gotta do with me?"
You gotta chill, girl, that head is amazin'
She told me, "Shut up, take that head like a gangsta"
That head made me jump out the bed, I can't take it
I had to embrace it, lil' mama my favorite
I'ma fuck around, tell her I love her
Let me get back on my pimpin'
Got me braggin' 'bout her to my brothers
Boy, this shit here got me trippin'
She think that she know what to do to me

She swear that she know what to do to me
You couldn't handle her, nigga, if you was me
Promise you you couldn't handle her
It'll fuck up your head, it'll make you go crazy
Eating her pussy, treat you like a rookie
Falling in love, tryna give her a baby
When it come to that head, she the greatest
That shit ridiculous, ain't no competition
As soon as she see me, she say, "Let me taste it"
I don't know how to respond
All of my bitches, they know I got bitches
And all of 'em know how I kick it
Don't even open your mouth with no gossip
When you around me, don't bring up other niggas, uh
That ain't the way I was raised, come let me introduce you to this pimpin'
I can't admit it, I'm stuck in my ways
I know the game and I won't be a victim
I learned this shit from my uncle
I learned this shit from my brother
She gon' make me break the code
Fuck around, get me in trouble
Ooh, you gon' fuck around get me in trouble
Ooh, I'ma fuck around tell her I love her

You  wanna play?
You know it's Baby and Baby 
Y'all ain't  no money 
My flows switch up  
Blac Youngsta runnin' on  
My brother Doshman be free I'm pitchin' game underhand
From a city where ****** hate everything they don't understand
In a city where ******* date anything that they, uh, uh
Soon as they get a chance, he go ****** 'round with a friend
That's life, look, but this the way that we do
Screaming, "Who wanna see me?" 'Cause, honestly, I can't see you
Start off knocking your dreams and ironically wanna be you
Most of these people see-through, that ain't the type of stuff we do, oh, man
I wouldn't have it any other way, ayy
Just ran into this stallion just the other day
She told me that she like my music, I said, "Thank you"
And I told her that I like her booty, can't take it
She started laughing, so I know-
Ayy, God, ayy, look, look
They say that I work with the devil 'cause I got a vision more clever than ever
Not up for discussion, I'm obviously better, embracing percussion, that's part of the schedule
Movin' the brother while I'm barely scratching the surface
My destiny written, my life has a purpose
They respect and check for me, be 'cause I'm worth it
Expectin' the greatest, would think it won't hurt me, hold up
Feeling like a god when I walk in the building
I don't give a fuck 'bout who feel me
I really don't care who ahead of me
Y'all just trying to be local celebrities
Switching lanes with the thing, keep it next to me
Shit I rob, I'ma serve 'em
My foot on the gas and I'm swervin'
I be pulling out fast like a virgin
Y'all niggas boring, I can't relate
Cashed out on the forum with paper plates
Walked out with the title like Golden State
It feel like I just won the finals
And I put that shit on the bible
Please excuse my language, but I cannot tame it
I knew how to **** back when I was a baby
My mama was workin', my uncles done raise me
I know that it's crazy
Yeah, that's my freak *****, you call her your lady
I'm in the sheets laying down with your lady
She rub on my chest and tell me I'm her favorite
To all of the niggas who play with me
Don't ever think I'ma forget about it
I keep a pistol on stage with me
You clutchin', we gon' hit up anybody
The second that one of these rappers try me
I'ma send a shooter, let him catch a body
Hit the funeral like nothing happened
Just to double-back to come and **** yo' thotty
Carter keep telling me, "Lil' bro, chill, you was made for this shit, bro, you work for a mil'"
My cousin denied on his first appeal
Lot of ****** snitchin', acting like they real, rant
Okay, wouldn't have it any other way
Just ran into this stallion just the other day
She told me that she like my music, okay, let's go back to that
I told her that I like her booty, can't take it
She started laughing, so I know she choosy
Ayy, look, I told her we should go and catch a movie
Maybe go and eat some sushi
Chicken, shrimp, and steak hibachi
Let's put it out there, off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up gettin' offended by my hustle
And I put it out on the line every time I came straight out the struggle
I've been through the rain and the pain and the mud
And I brushed off my shoulders like that shit ain't nothin'
I'm poppin', so I'm the topic of discussion
I hit the game so hard, it got a concussion
Never had time to play video games 'cause I'm too busy chasing the money
I just hooked up with a lil' freak, she told me that she love me, I know she don't love me
And I'm still screamin', "Fuck the police, the P.O., and the judge," until they free my cousin
I stayed down and stayed in my lane and I soaked up the game and gave it to my brother
And now he givin' game back to me, that's the way it should be, now let's go get the money
And I just caught a package from Cali, I wrote that shit down and front it to my cousin
I'm not leavin' without that .45, if you run up on me, I'm guaranteed to burn you
Let's put it out there, off the muscle
I don't wanna be your friend and I don't trust you
One thing I hate about a sucker
They always end up offended by my hustle
I just got off the phone with my mama, my nieces, I told 'em I love 'em
And I'ma keep rappin' and I'ma keep trappin' and I'ma keep rappin' 'til a ***** bubblin'
These niggas talkin' 'bout it, ain't gon' do nothin', but I'm the opposite, I say it, I've done it
Probably laid up in the condo with my feet up on the table eating steak and nuggets
And please do not hand me your mixtape, I don't wanna hear it, your shit is not bumpin'
Got her legs on my shoulders, I'm swimmin' and givin' it to her, she say she cummin'
Got a swag that ain't nobody got, and these ******, they hate it, but *******, they love it
And I don't wanna hear that's your *****, 'cause she wasn't your girl when I gave her my number
A lil' word of advice, better keep her off my Instagram if you think that you love her
'Cause I do not have nothin' to hide, I don't keep it on private, I keep on public
I gotta skip outta town
Call her phone, she come over, put that **** in her mouth
She got that Tylenol PM, soon as I hit it, I'm out
She stood me up against the wall and made me sit on the couch
And she be starin' at a ***** while I'm sleep, she say I'm pretty
Got one hundred ******* in my phone and all them hoes I did it
I be in and out of town, from state to state to handle business
Soon as I get at home, get away from the road, ayy, hold on, okay
Look, go 'head and ask around my city, I'm a king
Feel like I'm 'Melo when ballin' without a ring
Ain't hard to see I'm a star and I obviously got a team
I rip this ***** down the rod and it probably do anything
Ayy, now I'm off on the gas, I need to pass that
Got a pretty yellow ***** on my Snapchat
Tryna get into the crib, throw that *** back
I almost shot a *****, damn, I had a flashback
Ayy, you can catch me at the airport, I'm in and out the city, everybody know I'm ballin'
Got three cellphones, all of 'em ringin'
Hard to keep 'em charged 'cause everybody keep on callin'
Tried to tell her, "I don't usually do these type of drugs"
I had to tell her, "I don't usually get this type of love"
She ain't let a man up in her pants in a minute, but tonight, she let me hit it
On the Xans and the Henny, the Xans and the HennyCashMoneyAP
Ta tag i dem, ta tag i dem, ta tag i dem, ooh
Ooh , ooh 
Ooh ooh  ooh
Ooh  ooh ooh ooh
Ooh ooh ooh ooh
Åh åh åh
Vad vill du? Jag säger inte två gånger, ja
Jag är en tjuv på natten , ooh
Jag gjorde något fel  men jag har alltid rätt 
Sade att jag vet hur jag ska skjuta  och jag vet hur jag ska slåss
Om jag sa till dig en gång kommer jag inte att upprepa mig två gånger
Jag är väldigt försiktig som en tjuv på natten 
Om jag kallar dig älskling så är du en bebis för dagen
Eller baby för natten, du är inte min fru
Hon vill att en mördare ska knulla hela natten
Jag vill knulla med tati, suga mig hela natten
AP, stora stenar, i gorillaområdet
Fem K till lunch, ta med tre hundra tusen till återförsäljaren
Jag gjorde något fel  men jag har alltid rätt 
Sade att jag vet hur jag ska skjuta  och jag vet hur jag ska slåss
Om jag sa till dig en gång kommer jag inte att upprepa mig två gånger
Jag är väldigt diskret som en tjuv på natten 
Jag är rik, men jag rider, jag har lite exotisk, jag måste flyga ut och hämta lite
Såg ingenting, alla dessa pengar på mig, hundra förpackningar i en påse, det är en honungsbulle
Baby OG, jag körde dessa gator, fick spelet från Lashawn
Jag är min mammas son
Lärde mig om trippelkorset när jag var ung och jag vet att jag inte går, så jag behåller pistolen
Jag flög till Paris bara för att köpa Dior
Hon ber om uppmärksamhet, jag ser henne inte
C.I.P Pop Jag önskar att du kunde träffa oss
Jag och Cash plus vem det än är, jag åker igen
Du har niggas på gatan, slå mig inte
Jag har en branschförsök att vara jag
Jag är bara Ray Charles, de kan inte se mig
Jag är i Rolls-Royce med RiRi
Jag gjorde något fel  men jag har alltid rätt 
Sade att jag vet hur jag ska skjuta  och jag vet hur jag ska slåss
Om jag sa till dig en gång kommer jag inte att upprepa mig två gånger
Jag är verkligen försiktig som en tjuv på natten 
Som en tjuv i natten 
Jag drog upp, gav henne en D för natten 
Tryna knulla i V, det är bra 
Vi kan inte göra mina platser smutsiga eftersom de är vita 
Jag lever som Thriller, jag går bara ut på natten
Hon knullar inte med sprit, hon gillar inte att vara full
Hon dricker inte Henny, bara vitt vin 
Öppnade korken i nya Pinot Grigio 
Drog upp i en Porsche med en freaky hora 
Parkera en Porsche och dra upp en Lambo 
Jag hoppar ut, Major Payne, vagga kamouflage 
Jag tycker att hon är söt, få henne att knulla, låt hennes man gå 
Älskar att skjuta, tända din tik, jag heter Rambo
Kubansk länk är full av stenar, det är en choker 
Vila i fred Pop, få mig att röka dig
Jag gjorde något fel  men jag har alltid rätt 
Sa att jag vet hur jag ska skjuta  och jag vet hur jag ska slåss
Om jag sa till dig en gång, upprepar jag mig inte två gånger
Jag är väldigt försiktig som en tjuv på natten

        Yeah
Rest in peace to Bankroll, show 'em how to do it
Baby goin’ crazy, he been gettin' straight to it
I done caught so many flights I end up fuckin' all the stewardesses
Catch me in Atlanta, no security with my jewelry
Found out I’m rich, my baby mama talkin' suin' me
'Nother bitch tellin' lies on the pussy like she screwin' me
Catch him down bad, that's his ass, nigga, you or me
SI diamonds on the chain, he ain't foolin’ me
We was skippin’ school on the train, duckin' truancy
My main partner turned into a rat, he talkin’ 'bout Rod and me
I pray the judge give that boy a bond so I can pop him
We was in the hood, sellin' bags, shootin' choppas
I donе fucked around and tried to go and leasе a helicopter
Baby really a problem, somebody gotta stop him
And the haters watchin’ too hard, I think they got binoculars
Every nigga with me on go, it ain't no stoppin' us
Niggas actin' like they got the bag, I'm tryna stop it up
Do this for the bros down the road, gotta lock it up
All you gotta do is say it's smoke, then we're poppin' up
Baby got the streets on hold, he ain't drop yet
I've been goin' hard, it's gon' be hard for you to top that
I make it look easy, but this shit really a process
I'm really a millionaire, still in the projects
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby probably got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby probably still drug dealin'
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby probably still sell reefer
Huh? Baby probably still got them 'bows
I tell my bitch I'm faithful, but I still got the hoes
Baby gettin' jiggy, on stage with the Glizzy
Baby CEO, he shake the game like he Diddy
You would think it's Mardi Gras, I got these bitches showin' titties
And I ain't throwin' beads, I pull them bitches' weaves
I'm stallin' bitches out, if I'm a dog, then she a flea
And when I fuck her doggy style the only time I'm on my knee
I barely wanna hit her, got her beggin', "Baby, please"
I tell a bitch to shut up, you 'bout to fuck my nut up
The label's CEO keep beggin' me to keep the gun up
They know, you play with Baby, Baby beat him, cut up
Private plane, wifi, on the FaceTime with Johnny
I told him, "Ice my wrist up, I like to hold my fist up"
How that boy DaBaby in the air not gettin' his dick sucked?
Why he keep the fire and throw them fours in every picture?
'Cause nigga
Baby puttin' on for the city
Baby, he the realest, Baby probably got a couple million
Baby hang with four or five killers
Baby got children, Baby probably still drug dealin'
Baby ain't a trapper, he a rapper
Baby makin' classics, Baby in the hood gettin' active
Baby keep it real with his people
Baby like a preacher, Baby probably still sell reeferThe same nigga that took my bitch, I can't believe he did it
The same mouth they hating with they kiss his bitch with
And that's the same set of lips they sucked my dick with
Niggas crying on the internet having bitch fits
And I just sold six pounds at the QuikTrip
Every time I get some show money, I thank God, nigga
'Cause all I ever did was sell weed and rob niggas
And I ain't doing shit for free, I gotta charge niggas
Hope when those haters hatin', they don't got they broad with 'em
Yeah, I see you hatin', ignore, go fuck their bitch in my Jordans
Give my baby mama the phone and be like, "Baby, record it"
And you rappin' ass niggas, I'ma give you a warning
When you see me, it ain't no talkin', I'm just uppin' the .40
All you talking ass niggas gon' talk, nigga
'Cause I don't talk to lil' niggas, I'm a boss nigga
This lifestyle that I'm living, yeah, it cost, nigga
We robbin' all the rappers if I take a loss, nigga
These niggas pillow talking 'bout me, never did shit
I got a diaper on, nigga, and I'm still lit
What they gon' do about me, I'm too much to deal with
Who you know that could put a pamper on and talk some real shit?
And if a girl want it, I could give her some real dick
You 'round talkin' crazy 'bout a nigga and it still hit
Pulled it out, put it on her face, I nutted real quick
And every time she come around she act like she ain't did shitYeah, yeah, yeah
Huh? Ayy
Yeah, you know I just got to do it, do it, uh

Verse 1
Gucci Mane
I'm from the Zone 6, so I seen a lotta dead bodies
They drain Brook Lake and they brought out all them dead bodies
I got so rich, them haters got a lot to say about it 
These boys so broke, they need to go to church and pray about it 
I bring that dope to Birmingham and then call it Gucci county 
They put some money on my head 'but they couldn't make the bounty
I was so fucking underground, don't even know how they find me
Feel like Obama when I move 'cause I keep soldiеrs 'round me
I'm not in the NBA but I be ballin' on bitchеs 
Gotta carry credit cards, my cash too big for my britches
Yeah, I came up out the trenches, I don't fuck wit' no snitches 
Niggas stay trippin' 'til some of they friends come up missin' 
Chrous
Brand new car is noisy, come through and it's roarin' 
You ain't gotta worry, don't care about your boyfriend
See me and get nervous, I damn near did it perfect
Work hard and determine, it's safe to say I earned it, whoa
Yeah, none of you guys get fly as me, whoa
Matter of fact, none of you guys get high as me, whoa
Post my drip up daily just so they can see, whoa
Turn me up some more so my haters can hear it, whoa 
Verse 3
Dababy
You ain't never put out on a nigga, then lil' nigga, shut up 
I just rocked a sold-out show, I performed for a hour and didn't put my gun up 
If a lil' nigga try me and send out a gun down, that nigga won't live to see sun up 
Fuck your bitch and I tip her a hundred 
I show you how to muhfuckin' come up
If you add up my watch and my wrist and my fist, before taxes, I spent a whole hundred 
You can go and ask Johnny, he love it, every time he see me, he see money
I pulled up BET with my kids and my baby mama, they like, "Ooh, he be thuggin'"
No, I'm just a real nigga with money
I keep one in the head of that bitch like a bundle
I'm too rich so I just had to switch up my number
You play and it's gon' be a murder like YB
I draw out, you see blood like it's YG 
I done told every nigga to try me 
Some people compare me to Gucci, I drop some new music and caught me a body
And I don't like hangin' with bitch ass niggas, you gotta be a dawg to sit beside me
My boy got

        Part I
I'm like fuck it, let the beat build, nigga
I do my own thing, ain't worry 'bout how he feel nigga, let's go
Special ed, yeah, I'm a re-re nigga
Can I get a re?  Yeah, a refill, nigga
Ya favorite rapper say he fuckin' with Baby, somebody lied
Play with ya kids, 'cause the last nigga played me, somebody died 
Playin' both sides, go play the victim, oh, now they cryin'
I water park when I slip in my baby, she let me slide
Chocolate-ass nigga , real nigga rockstar
Platinum sellin' popstar, poppin'-ass nigga 
My bitch is like a Barbie, woo like I'm Pop Smoke
I lift up one leg when she drop that ass, nigga 
Shade Room, baby , shade who?
Everybody blame you, you ballin' like you Babe Ruth, baby 
Blame it on Baby, I let the beat build 
Okay K.i.D, drop the beat and watch me take it home, baby 
I'm startin' to think that y'all the police, nigga
You know that shit you see on IG, you don't know me, nigga, let's go
You crossed the line, gon' have to show me nigga
They be like "Why you switched the beat​?" Because my flow neat, nigga
"I thought he couldn't switch the flow, how the hell he switchin' the beat up?“
They don't know who they fuckin' with, do this shit with my feet up
Yawning on these niggas, sit back, go to sleep
I get woke by a lil freak, with my dick in her mouth, she eat up
300K in cash, probably still'll pull out a Visa
Ain't goin' on a date, tell a bitch to order a pizza
Gon' end up eatin' Domino's, I can't even lie
I'm a player, I had all kind of hoes way before the designer clothes
I put on a sweatsuit and leave with ya ho
A whole arena full of people to see me at the show, you know?
I rock the show and I lay low with my freak
It ain't too many rappers that can fuck with me, and she know, let's go
Part II
I get chicken, no tender
Fine lil' bitches on Twitter
Denyin' all these hoes on Insta
Brand new drip
I wear it one time like a nigga can't fit it
Blame it on Baby, a greasy lil' nigga 
​iPhone ringin', who is it? 
Probably some lil' nigga bitch
He fuck with my old ho
And he think he hurtin' my feelings, I already hit , psych
He must ain't heard about Baby
He must not know about Jon Jon
I heard they shut down the airport
Hopped on a jet to LA, bitch, I'm ballin' like Bron-Bron
BDB, we gon' cut up regardless
I know I'm on top, I'm a target
My young nigga ballin' like Giannis
You play, we gon' pull up and shoot
Top floor of the penthouse, biggest one still in Charlotte 
I know these hoes gon' creep
I'll never be a fool and think that she me
I'm the type to let a ho do what she want
I'm the type to let a bitch do what she please 
I ain't breakin' bread, I'm cheap
Nine out of ten of these niggas naive
Lame-ass nigga, might as well be a rat
Lettin' all these hoes run away with yo' cheese,  please
I know these hoes gon' creep
I'll never be a fool and think that she me
I'm the type to let a ho do what she want
I'm the type to let a bitch do what she please 
I ain't breakin' bread, I'm cheap
Nine out of ten of these niggas naive
Lame-ass nigga, might as well be a rat
Lettin' all these hoes run away with yo' cheese, please

        Lyrics from Snippet
Right there, Firzt 
That nigga pussy, tell him take his hood off
In summertime when I've been workin', I done got my shirt off
I'm havin' a pool party, I'm swimmin' and strokin' all on your ho
She got me like, "Ooh, shorty"
Tippy toes, giving her dick, wonderin' what he gon' do about it
You ever been robbed for a bitch?
You ever found what he got?
Put a wig on his plate, give Molly a lick
