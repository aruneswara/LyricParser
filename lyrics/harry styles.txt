Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
Welcome to the final show
Hope you're wearing your best clothes
You can't bribe the door on your way to the sky
You look pretty good down here
But you ain't really good
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
Just stop your crying, have the time of your life
Breaking through the atmosphere
And things are pretty good from here
Remember everything will be alright
We can meet again somewhere
Somewhere far away from here
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
Just stop your crying, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away from here
We gotta get away from here
Stop your crying, baby, it'll be alright
They told me that the end is near
We gotta get away from here
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We never learn, we been here before
Why are we always stuck and running from
The bullets? The bullets?
We don't talk enough, we should open up
Before it's all too much
Will we ever learn? We've been here before
It's just what we know
Stop your crying, baby, it's a sign of the times
We gotta get away, we got to get away
We got to get away, we got to get away
We got to get away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, away
We got to, we got to, awayTastes like strawberries on a summer evenin'
And it sounds just like a song
I want more berries and that summer feelin'

Watermelon sugarI'm in my bed
And you're not here
And there's no one to blame but the drink and my wandering hands
Forget what I said
It's not what I meant
And I can't take it back, I can't unpack the baggage you left
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
You said you care, and you missed me too
And I'm well aware I write too many songs about you
And the coffee's out at the Beachwood Cafe
And it kills me 'cause I know we've ran out of things we can say
What am I now? What am I now?
What if I'm someone I don't want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
And I get the feeling that you'll never need me again
What am I now? What am I now?
What if you're someone I just want around?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'
What if I'm down? What if I'm out?
What if I'm someone you won't talk about?
I'm falling again, I'm falling again, I'm fallin'Walk in your rainbow paradise 
Strawberry lipstick state of mind 
I get so lost inside your eyes
Would you believe it?
You don't have to say you love me
You don't have to say nothing
You don't have to say you're mine

Just let me adore you
Oh, honey

You don't have to say you love me
I just wanna tell you somethin'

I’m here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Treat you like a gentleman
Give me that adrenaline, that adrenaline
Think I'm gonna stick with you
Here to take my medicine, take my medicine
Rest it on your fingertips
Up to your mouth, I’m feeling it out
I’m felling it out
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep I'm gonna dream of how you tasted
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
Tingle running through my bones, fingers to my toes
Tingle running through my bones
The boys and the girls are here
I mess around with him
And I'm okay with it
I'm coming down, I figured out I kinda like it
And when I sleep, I'm gonna dream of how you ride it
If you go out tonight, I'm going out 'cause I know you're persuasive
You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're getting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, oh
I had a few, got drunk on you, and now I'm wasted
And when I sleep, I’m gonna dream of how you tasted

You got that salt, I got me an appetite, and now I can taste it
You get me dizzy, oh, you get me dizzy, oh
La la la la la
We're gettting dizzy, oh, we're getting dizzy, ohWhat do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming back down
Can't you see?
I could, but wouldn't stay
Wouldn't put it like that
What do you mean?
I'm sorry by the way
Never coming around
It'd be so sweet if things just stayed the same
La-da-da-da-da
All the lights couldn't put out the dark
Runnin' through my heart
Lights up and they know who you are
Know who you are
Do you know who you are? 
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever going back
Shine, step into the light
Shine, so bright sometimes
Shine, I'm not ever

Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I confess I can tell that you are at your best
I'm selfish so I'm hating it
I noticed that there's a piece of you in how I dress
Take it as a compliment
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
I, I just miss
I just miss your accent and your friends
Did you know I still talk to them?
Does he take you walking 'round his parents' gallery?
Don't you call him "baby"
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me
Don't you call him "baby" 
We're not talking lately
Don't you call him what you used to call me 
Coucou ! Tu dors ? Oh, j'suis désolée...
Bah non... Nan, c'est pas important...
Ouais, on a été à la plage, et maintenant on—
Parfait ! Allez !She worked her way through a cheap pack of cigarettes
Hard liquor mixed with a bit of intellect
And all the boys, they were saying they were into it
Such a pretty face, on a pretty neck
She's driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby , it's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby , it's none of your, it's none of your" 
It's New York, baby, always jacked up 
Holland Tunnel for a nose, it's always backed up 
When she's alone, she goes home to a cactus 
In a black dress, she's such an actress 
Driving me crazy, but I'm into it, but I'm into it
I'm kinda into it
It's getting crazy, I think I'm losing it, I think I'm losing it
Oh, I think she said "I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your, it's none of your"
She sits beside me like a silhouette
Hard candy dripping on me 'til my feet are wet
And now she's all over me, it's like I paid for it 
It's like I paid for it, I'm gonna pay for this
It's none of your, it's none of your
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" 
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business"
"I'm having your baby, it's none of your business" Put a price on emotion
I'm looking for something to buy
You've got my devotion
But man, I can hate you sometimes
I don't want to fight you
And I don't want to sleep in the dirt
We'll get the drinks in
So I'll get to thinking of her
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
Test of my patience
There's things that we'll never know
You sunshine, you temptress
My hand's at risk, I fold
Crisp trepidation
I'll try to shake this soon
Spreading you open
Is the only way of knowing you
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
We'll be a fine line
We'll be a fine line
We'll be alright 
We'll be alright
We'll be alright
OhHey!
Golden, golden, golden as I open my eyes
Hold it, focus, hoping, take me back to the light
I know you were way too bright for me
I'm hopeless, broken, so you wait for me in the sky
Brown my skin just right
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I don't wanna be alone
I don't wanna be alone when it ends
Don't wanna let you know
I don't wanna be alone
But I can feel it take a hold 
I can feel you take control 
Of who I am, and all I've ever known
Lovin' you's the antidote
Golden
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get broken
I know that you're scared because I'm so open
You're so golden
I don't wanna be alone
You're so golden
You're so golden
You're so golden
I'm out of my head, and I know that you're scared
Because hearts get brokenSweet creature
Had another talk about where it's going wrong
But we're still young
We don't know where we're going
But we know where we belong
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
It's hard when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
Sweet creature
Running through the garden
Oh, where nothing bothered us
But we're still young
I always think about you and how we don't speak enough
And, oh, we started
Two hearts in one home
I know it's hard, we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
And, oh, when we started
Just two hearts in one home
It gets harder when we argue
We're both stubborn
I know, but oh
Sweet creature, sweet creature
Wherever I go, you bring me home
Sweet creature, sweet creature
When I run out of road, you bring me home
You'll bring me homeSame lips red, same eyes blue
Same white shirt, couple more tattoos
But it's not you and it's not me
Tastes so sweet, looks so real
Sounds like something that I used to feel
But I can't touch what I see
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
The fridge light washes this room white
Moon dances over your good side
And this was all we used to need
Tongue-tied like we've never known
Telling those stories we already told
'Cause we don't say what we really mean
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
We're not who we used to be
We're not who we used to be
We're just two ghosts standing in the place of you and me
We're not who we used to be
We don't see what we used to see
We're just two ghosts swimming in a glass half empty
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
Trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeat
I'm just trying to remember how it feels to have a heartbeatSunflower
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers sometimes keep it sweet in your memory
I was just tongue-tied
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to talk to you
Sunflower 
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight 
Wondering, headshake
Tired eyes are the death of me
Mouthful of toothpaste before I got to know you
I've got your face hung up high in the gallery
I love this shade, sunflower, sunflower
Your flowers just died, plant new seeds in the melody
Let me inside, I wanna get to know you
I don't wanna make you feel bad
But I've been trying hard not to act a fool
Sunflower 
I couldn't want you any more
Kiss in the kitchen like it's a dance floor
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight 
I couldn't want you any more
Kids in the kitchen listen to dancehall
I couldn't want you any more
Tonight 
Sunflower, my eyes want you more than a melody
Let me inside, wish I could get to know you
Sunflowers just died, keep it sweet in your memory
I'm still tongue-tied
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Sunflower, sunflower
Ayy, woo, ow
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Woo-woo, woo-woo
Yeah!
Ooh, woo, ooh
Doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, doo, dooNine in the morning, the man drops his kids off at school
And he's thinking of you, like all of us do
Sends his assistant for coffee in the afternoon
Around 1:32, like he knows what to do
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
He takes a boat out, imagines just sailing away 
And not telling his mates 
He wouldn't know what to say 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
She , she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is 
Lives for the memory
A woman who's just in his head 
And she sleeps in his bed 
While he plays pretend 
So pretend 
She , she lives in daydreams with me 
She's the first one that I see, and I don't know why
I don't know who she is 
She , she's the first one that I see 
She lives in daydreams with me, and I don't know why
I don't know where she is Don't blame me for falling
I was just a little boy
Don’t blame the drunk caller
Wasn't ready for it all
You can't blame me, darling
Not even a little bit, I was away
And I’m just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
I just hope you see me in a little better light
Do you think it's easy being of the jealous kind?
’Cause I miss the shape of your lips
You’ll win, it's just a trick
And this is it, so I’m sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it’s hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
And I'm just an arrogant son of a bitch
Who can't admit when he's sorry
Don't call me "baby" again, you got your reasons
I know that you're tryna be friends, I know you mean it
Don't call me "baby" again, it's hard for me to go home
Be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonely
To be so lonely, to be so
To be so lonelyWoke up alone in this hotel room
Played with myself, where were you?
Fell back to sleep, I got drunk by noon
I've never felt less cool
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever be the first one to break?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
I saw your friend that you know from work
He said you feel just fine
I see you gave him my old t-shirt
More of what was once mine
I see it's written, it's all over his face
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the way
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
Maybe one day you'll call me and tell me that you're sorry too
But you, you never do
Woke up the girl who looked just like you
I almost said your name
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call
We haven't spoke since you went away
Comfortable silence is so overrated
Why won't you ever say what you want to say?
Even my phone misses your call, by the wayTell me something, tell me something
You don’t know nothing, just pretend you do
I need something, tell me something new
Choose your words, 'cause there's no antidote
For this curse, oh, what's it waiting for?
Must this hurt you just before you go?
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Brooklyn saw me, empty at the news
There's no water inside this swimming pool
Almost over, had enough from you
I've been praying, I never did before
Understand I'm talking to the walls
I've been praying ever since New York
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Tell me something, tell me something
You don’t know nothing, just pretend you do
Tell me something just before you go
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already know
Oh, tell me something I don't already knowShould we just search romantic comedies on Netflix and then see what we find?
I'm selfish, I know
But I don't ever want to see you with him
I'm selfish, I know
I told you, but I know you never listen
I hope you can see the shape that I'm in
While he's touching your skin
He's right where I should, where I should be
But you're making me bleed
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman 
Tempted, you know
Apologies are never gonna fix this 
I'm empty, I know
And promises are broken like a stitch is
I hope you can see, the shape I've been in
While he's touching your skin
This thing upon me, howls like a beast
You flower, you feast
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman
Woman, woman 
Wo-woman, woman
WomanI saw this angel
I really saw an angel
Open up your eyes, shut your mouth and see
That I'm still the only one who's been in love with me
I'm just happy getting you stuck in between my teeth
And there's nothing I can do about it
Broke a finger knocking on your bedroom door
I got splinters in my knuckles crawling 'cross the floor
Couldn't take you home to mother in a skirt that short
But I think that's what I like about it
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
I must admit I thought I'd like to make you mine
As I went about my business through the warning signs
End up meeting in the hallway every single time
And there's nothing we can do about it
Told it to her brother and she told it to me
That she's gonna be an angel, just you wait and see
When it turns out she's a devil in between the sheets
And there's nothing she can do about it
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
Wanna die, wanna die, wanna die tonight
She's an angel, only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She's an angel, my only angel
She is an angel, my-my-my-my only angelTwo, three, four
Meet me in the hallway, meet me in the hallway
I just left your bedroom, give me some morphine
Is there any more to do?
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out
I walked the streets all day, running with the thieves
'Cause you left me in the hallway 
Just take the pain away
Just let me know, I'll be at the door, at the door
Hoping you'll come around
Just let me know, I'll be on the floor, on the floor
Maybe we'll work it out
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
I gotta get better, gotta get better
And maybe we'll work it out
We don't talk about it, it's something we don't do
'Cause once you go without it, nothing else will doOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
She's got a family in Carolina
So far away, but she says I remind her of home
Feeling oh so far from home
She never saw herself as a West Coaster
Moved all the way 'cause her grandma told her;
"Townes, better swim before you drown"
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She's got a book for every situation
Gets into parties without invitations
How could you ever turn her down?
There's not a drink that I think could sink her
How would I tell her that she's all I think about?
Well, I guess she just found out
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
She feels so good
She feels so good
I met her once and wrote a song about her
I wanna scream, I wanna shout it out
And I hope she hears me now
She's a good girl
She's such a good girl
She's a good girl
Feels so good, she feels so good
She feels so good
She feels so good
She's a good girl
She feels so goodGotta see it to believe it, sky never looked so blue
So hard to leave it, that's what I always do
So I keep thinking back to a time under the canyon moon
The world's happy waitin', door's yellow, broken blue
I heard Jenny saying, "Go get the kids from school"
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
Staring at the ceiling, two weeks and I'll be home
Carry the feeling, through Paris, all through Rome
And I'm still thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
Quick pause in conversation, she plays songs I've never heard
An old lover's hippie music, pretends not to know the words
And I keep thinking back to the time under the canyon moon
I'll be gone too long from you
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going
I'm going, oh, I'm going home
I'm going, oh, I'm going 
I'm going, oh, I'm going  
I'm going, oh, I'm going home 
I'm going, oh, I'm going 
I'm going, oh, I'm going  
I'm going, oh, I'm going home Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
I've got a good feeling
I'm just takin' it all in
Floating up and dreamin'
Droppin' into the deep end
And if we're here long enough
They'll sing a song for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
Giving second chances
I don't need all the answers
Feeling good in my skin
I just keep on dancin'
And if we're here long enough
We'll see it's all for us
And we'll belong
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
And it's just another day 
And if our friends all pass away 
It's okay 
It's okay 
Hey!
Here we go now
Maybe, we can
Find a place to feel good
And we can treat people with kindness
Find a place to feel good
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
All we ever want is automatic all the time
All we ever want is auto, auto all of the time
Maybe, we can 
Find a place to feel good 
And we can treat people with kindness 
Find a place to feel good I got a girl crush
Hate to admit it but
I got a heart rush
It ain't slowing down
I got it real bad
Want everything she has
That smile and that midnight laugh
She's giving you now
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
I've got a girl crush
I don't get no sleep
I don't get no peace
Thinking about her
Under your bed sheets
The way that she's whispering
The way that she's pulling you in
Lord knows I've tried
I can't get her off my mind
I want to taste her lips
Yeah, 'cause they taste like you
I want to drown myself
In a bottle of her perfume
I want her long blonde hair
I want her magic touch
Yeah, 'cause maybe then
You'd want me just as much
And I've got a girl crush
Oh, and I got a girl crushLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been releasedDon’t know where you’re laying
Just know it’s not with me
Don’t know what I’d tell you if
I passed you on the street
I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! 
Don’t know how you taste when
There’s smoke in your perfume
Chew me up and spit me out
Nothing left to lose
I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh! 
I don’t want your sympathy, but you don’t know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Hope you never hear this
And know that it’s for you
I don’t know what I’d tell you if
You asked me for the truth
I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! 
Well I guess it would be nice if I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
If I could touch your body
I don’t want your sympathy, but you’ll never know what you do to me
Oh, Anna! 
Every time I see your face, there’s only so much I can take
Oh, Anna! Mirror, mirror on the wall
Don't say it 'cause I know I'm cute 
Gucci down to my drawers
LV all on my shoes 
I be drippin' so much sauce
Got me lookin' like RAGÚ 
Lit up like a crystal ball
That's cool, baby, so is you
That's how I roll
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on the Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice
Ya-ya-ee, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
Ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya, ya-ya
Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juice
No, I'm not a snack at all
Ooh, baby, I'm the whole damn meal 
Geoffrey, you ain't bein' slick
Don't dare try to cop a feel 
The juice ain't worth the squeeze
If the juice don't look like this 
Hold up, baby, please
Don't make me have to take your ooo!
If I'm shinin', everybody gonna shine 
I was born like this, don't even gotta try 
I'm like chardonnay, get better over time 
Heard you say I'm not the baddest, bitch, you lie
It ain't my fault that I'm out here gettin' loose
Gotta blame it on my Goose
Gotta blame it on my juice, baby
It ain't my fault that I'm out here makin' news
I'm the pudding in the proof
Gotta blame it on my juice

Blame it on my juice, blame it, blame it on my juiceEncarcelado a mi falsa realidad
Subiendo fotos de mi felíz
Pero ¿enrealidad lo soy?
Quiero despertar con tu fragancia, justo en mi lado
Quiero todo de ti
Sentarme y caminar junto a ti
Postear fotos y videos de yo y tu siendo libres e inseparables
 
Pero estamos encarcelados
Juro que encerio luche por ti
Lo siento por todas las veces que dije que saldríamos adelante
Que estariamos orgullosos de lo que somos
Lo soy, estoy orgulloso de pertenecerte a ti
Pero no puedo enseñárselo a todo el mundo. 
Escribiendote a las 11:00 p.m lo mucho que te amo y deseo
Espero que por escribir a esa hora se vuelva realidad el que te quedes conmigo
Quiero volver a nuestro antiguo departamento y recordar todos los buenos momentos
Mirarte y apreciarte todo el tiempo que pueda
Podria morir en paz sabiendo que al final si pude amarte como debia
No me dejes, aun no, se que aun puedo luchar por ti
 
Pero estamos encarcelados
Juro que encerio luche por ti
Lo siento por todas las veces que dije que saldríamos adelante
Que estariamos orgullosos de lo que somos
Lo soy, estoy orgulloso de pertenecerte a ti
Pero no puedo enseñárselo a todo el mundo. 
Te juro que volvere y pelearé por ti
Nos lo merecemos
Pero ahora no amor
Solo espera y recuerda que volvere
Eres mi persona correcta, pero en el tiempo equivocado
No olvides que te amo y que estare para ti
Con amor H

IM SORRY I ONLY MADE THIS TO SHOW MY FRIEND HOW EASY IT WAS TO MAKE A SONG ON GENIUS
I can't delete it now without talking to a 'moderator' on genius please forgive me im so sorryI don't ever ask you where you've been
'Cause I don't feel the need to
Know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell
You were just with her
And I'll still be a fool, 'cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy
That's what they say
I know I'm not your only
I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
I know I'm not your only
But at least I'm one
I heard a little love is better than none
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking forComing soonNow you were standing there right in front of me
I hold on it's getting harder to breathe
All of a sudden these lights are blinding me
I never noticed how bright they would be
I saw in the corner there is a photograph
No doubt in my mind it's a picture of you
It lies there alone in it's bed of broken glass
This bed was never made for two
I'll keep my eyes wide open
I'll keep my arms wide open
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
I promised one day that I'd bring you back a star
I caught one and it burned a hole in my hand, oh
Seems like these days I watch you from afar
Just trying to make you understand
I'll keep my eyes wide open, yeah
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of feeling alone
Don't let me
Don't let me go
Cause I'm tired of sleeping alone
