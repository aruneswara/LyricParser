Would you keep it a secret? I ain't felt this way before
When I tell you that I like you, but I don't 'cause I'm not sure
I just take her heart and score, then I love her 'til she sore
I just break her heart in four then I don't want her anymore
If I eat it, can I treat it? Can I beat it with my sword? 
Beatin' on that monkey 'til I fall asleep

        I'm on a mission for a bill and im'a get it
You can catch me on corner serving yayo, lotta midget
And I don't smoke no midget I just pitch it
If I see the money coming gotta get it
In the trap , I'm in the the kitchen , coca whippin'
We can't eat because there's coca on the dishes
Since a young 'in I been Viscous
When we came up in them streets like we ain't have no pot to piss in
Free all my niggas that be hitting , doing time because they prime was in the street just tryna get it
Told you niggas since a young 'in I've been with it
We going get it ,saw my homies niggas , they ain't even trippin'
That my broddie if i got it then he got it
And if he ain't got it now there ain't nothing to spot it
Vishish mo'fo , 015 bitch we the hottest
If we talking about some trapping,Viscous mode must be the topic
You really not a trapper you should stop it
I ain't fucking with you niggas ,we ain't got nothing in common
We ain't got nothing to comment
So when you feel my presences boy don't talk nothing about it
Fenix keep the double cup , Robbie got the gang and shit
I might do the molly but the activist my favorite
Red fanta  , add jolly ranchers for the flavor'in
If you plaing with my squad, boy you dont know who you playing withI got that blicky out
I keep a .50 on me
Every time she see me wit' it she be trippin' on me
I can't fuck around wit' niggas they be switchin' on me
When I fuck her from the back she get to drippin' on me
On me

I'm a hot nigga but these bitches sound cold as fuck
Probably cause I never wanna kiss her and I only fuck
I don't got to get her cause that bitch already know what's up
