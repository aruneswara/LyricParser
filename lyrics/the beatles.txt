When I find myself in times of trouble, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
And in my hour of darkness, she is standing right in front of me
Speaking words of wisdom, “let it be”
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the brokenhearted people living in the world agree
There will be an answer, let it be
For though they may be parted, there is still a chance that they will see
There will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Yeah, there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it be
And when the night is cloudy, there is still a light that shines on me
Shine on 'til tomorrow, let it be
I wake up to the sound of music, Mother Mary comes to me
Speaking words of wisdom, "let it be"
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Oh there will be an answer, let it be
Let it be, let it be, let it be, yeah, let it be
Whisper words of wisdom, let it beShoot me

All my troubles seemed so far away
Now it looks as though they're here to stay
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Suddenly
I'm not half the man I used to be
There's a shadow hanging over me
Oh, yesterday came suddenly
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Why she had to go
I don't know, she wouldn't say
I said something wrong
Now I long for yesterday
Yesterday
Love was such an easy game to play
Now I need a place to hide away
Oh, I believe in yesterday
Mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm-mmm, hmm-hmmSomething in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and howHere comes the sun, doo da doo doo

Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na na
Hey Jude, don't let me down

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
*Alarm clock rings*
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today—oh, boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you onBlackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to be free
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
Blackbird singing in the dead of night
Take these broken wings and learn to fly
All your life
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to arise
You were only waiting for this moment to ariseI am he as you are he as you are me and we are all together
See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you've been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Mister City policeman sitting
Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the sky, see how they run
I'm crying, I'm crying
I'm crying, I'm crying
Yellow-matter custard
Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down
I am the egg man, they are the egg men
I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain
I am the egg man 
They are the egg men 
I am the walrus, goo goo goo joob 
G'goo goo g'joob
Expert, textpert, choking smokers
Don't you think the joker laughs at you?
See how they smile like pigs in a sty
See how they snide
I'm crying

“Villain, take my Purse. If ever thou wilt thrive, bury my Body
And give the Letters which thou findst about me
To Edmund Earl of Gloucester: seek him out upon the English Party. Oh, untimely death, death–”
“I know thee well, a serviceable Villain; as duteous to the Vices of thy Mistress as badness would desire.”
“What, is he dead?”
“Sit you down, Father; rest you.”There are places I'll remember
All my life, though some have changed
Some forever, not for better
Some have gone and some remain
All these places had their moments
With lovers and friends, I still can recall
Some are dead and some are living
In my life, I've loved them all
But of all these friends and lovers
There is no one compares with you
And these memories lose their meaning
When I think of love as something new
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
Though I know I'll never lose affection
For people and things that went before
I know I'll often stop and think about them
In my life, I love you more
In my life, I love you moreAh, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong?Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
AhhWords are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru Deva
Jai Guru DevaLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think a "no", I mean, a "yes", but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Strawberry Fields forever
Cranberry sauceI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor, and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world, and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
 Look at you all
Still my guitar gently weeps

When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today

Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
Full steam ahead, Mister Boatswain, full steam ahead
Full steam ahead it is, Sergeant
Cut the cable! Drop the cable!
Aye-aye, sir, aye-aye
Captain! Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Everyone of us  has all we need 
Sky of blue  and sea of green 
In our yellow  submarine 
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarine
We all live in a yellow submarine
Yellow submarine, yellow submarineI once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Biding my time, drinking her wine
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store 
Buys a twenty carat golden ring 
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her, she begins to sing 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Yeah
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones 
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand 
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band 
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah

Can you dig it? Don't let me downWhen I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullabyShe's not a girl who misses much
Do do do do do do, oh yeah
She's well-acquainted with the touch of the velvet hand
Like a lizard on a window pane
The man in the crowd with the multicoloured mirrors
On his hobnail boots
Lying with his eyes while his hands are busy
Working overtime
A soap impression of his wife which he ate
And donated to the National Trust
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down
Down to the bits that I left uptown
I need a fix 'cause I'm going down

But they're guaranteed to raise a smile

Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
Penny LaneJoan was quizzical;
Studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine 
Calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go
A knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
Back in school again
Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay
When the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy
He creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon her head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that she was dead
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one,"
Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, 
Screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips
A noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Came down upon his head
Clang! Clang! Maxwell's silver hammer
Made sure that he was dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa-oaWhen I get to the bottom, I go back to the top of the slide
Where I stop, and I turn, and I go for a ride
'Til I get to the bottom, and I see you again!
Yeah, yeah, yeah!
Well, do you, don't you want me to love you?

I got blisters on my fingers!Now somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I'm gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
And Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now, she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoe-down
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I'll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
And now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
C'mon, Rocky boy
C'mon, Rocky boyShe loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
You think you've lost your love
Well, I saw her yesterday
It's you she's thinking of
And she told me what to say
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad
She said you hurt her so
She almost lost her mind
But now she said she knows
You're not the hurting kind
She says she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
Yes, she loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad
You know it's up to you
I think it's only fair
Pride can hurt you, too
Apologise to her
Because she loves you
And you know that can't be bad
She loves you
And you know you should be glad, ooh
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
With a love like that
You know you should be glad

Tonight?

Love you, love you
Love you, love you

Love
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you makeI’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves 
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe 
We would be so happy, you and me
No one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with youThe long and winding road that leads to your door
Will never disappear, I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night that the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears, crying for the day
Why leave me standing here?
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone, and many times I've cried
Anyway, you'll never know the many ways I've tried
And still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't leave me waiting here
Lead me to your door
But still they lead me back to the long and winding road
You left me standing here a long, long time ago
Don't keep me waiting here 
Lead me to your door
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYou never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did

Well, she was just 17 and you know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another? 
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another 
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing thereWednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free

She 
Is leaving 
Home 
She's leaving home after living alone 
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me

So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So instead I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea

In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling

Quando para mucho mi amore de felice corazón
Mundo paparazzi mi amore chicka ferdy parasol
Cuesto obrigado tanta mucho que canite carouselWe were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without youBoy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight

It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can 
]
I admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
Yes, I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
]
It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Getting so much better all the time!Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
She's the kind of girl who puts you down 
When friends are there, you feel a fool 
When you say she's looking good 
She acts as if it's understood 
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Girl
Girl, girl
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
Ah, girl
Girl, girlThere were bells on a hill
But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you
Till there was youTo lead a better life I need my love to be here
Here, making each day of the year
Changing my life with the wave of her hand
Nobody can deny that there's something there
There, running my hands through her hair
Both of us thinking how good it can be
Someone is speaking, but she doesn't know he's there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I want her everywhere and if she's beside me
I know I need never care
But to love her is to need her everywhere
Knowing that love is to share
Each one believing that love never dies
Watching her eyes and hoping I'm always there
I will be there and everywhere
Here, there and everywhereDay after day, alone on a hill
The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
{Instrumental bridge}
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Oh 
OhWell, shake it up, baby, now

You'd love her too

She gives me everything
And tenderly
The kiss my lover brings
She brings to me
And I love her
A love like ours
Could never die
As long as I
Have you near me
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love her
Bright are the stars that shine
Dark is the sky
I know this love of mine
Will never die
And I love herHe's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please, listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere man, don't worry
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man, please, listen
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere man, the world is at your command
He's a real nowhere man
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody"Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-"
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
Oh yeahTurn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginningI'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh, he was such a stupid git
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane!
You know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got for a little peace of mind
Monsieur, monsieur, monsieur, how about another one?When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream 
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleeping
Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need 
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream 
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleepingFor the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billYour day breaks, your mind aches
You find that all her words of kindness linger on
When she no longer needs you
She wakes up, she makes up
She takes her time and doesn't feel she has to hurry
She no longer needs you
And in her eyes, you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You want her, you need her
And yet you don't believe her when she says her love is dead
You think she needs you
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted years
You stay home, she goes out
She says that long ago she knew someone
But now he's gone, she doesn't need him
Your day breaks, your mind aches
There will be times when all the things she said will fill your head
You won't forget her
And in her eyes you see nothing
No sign of love behind the tears
Cried for no one
A love that should have lasted yearsDear Prudence

Hard earned pay
You and me Sunday driving, not arriving
On our way back home

On my wall

On our way back home

Longer than the road that stretches out ahead
Two of us wearing raincoats, standing solo
In the sun

In a cap she looked much older

Made her look a little like a military man

May I inquire discreetly 
When are you free to take some tea with me? 
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it

I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you
Ooh, you were meant to be near me
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life
I've got to get you into my life

Eight days a week

Eight days a weekLady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meetHave you seen the little piggies crawling in the dirt?
And for all the little piggies, life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies in their starched white shirts?
You will find the bigger piggies stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their life, there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking!
Everywhere there's lots of piggies living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner with their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon
One more timeHer Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot

Sexy Sadie, oh, what have you done?

Sexy Sadie, oh, how did you know?
Sexy Sadie, you'll get yours yet
However big you think you are

Just a smile would lighten everything

Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy SadieWell I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or I won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Well you know that I'm a wicked guy
And I was born with a jealous mind
And I can't spend my whole life
Trying just to make you toe the line
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
Let this be a sermon
I mean everything I've said
Baby, I'm determined
And I'd rather see you dead
You better run for your life if you can, little girl
Hide your head in the sand little girl
Catch you with another man
That's the end, little girl
I'd rather see you dead, little girl
Than to be with another man
You better keep your head, little girl
Or you won't know where I am
You better run for your life if you can, little girl

Na, na, na
Na, na, na
Na, na, na

Would you promise to be true
And help me understand
'Cause I've been in love before
And I found that love was more
Than just holding hands
If I give my heart to you
I must be sure
From the very start
That you would love me more than her
If I trust in you, oh please
Don't run and hide
If I love you too, oh please
Don't hurt my pride like her
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two
'Cause I couldn't stand the pain
And I
Would be sad if our new love
Was in vain
So I hope you see that I
Would love to love you
And that she will cry
When she learns we are two

What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents, he always took his mum
He's the all American, bullet-headed, Saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?

If I ain't dead already, woo
Girl, you know the reason why
In the morning
Want to die
In the evening

My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it's worth
I'm lonely
Want to die
If I ain't dead already, woo

The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Lonely

Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll

But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right

I know what it is to be sad"
And she's making me feel like I've never been born
I said, "who put all those things in your head?
Things that make me feel that I'm mad
And you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I've said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"
When I was a boy everything was right
Everything was right
I said, "even though you know what you know
I know that I'm ready to leave
'Cause you're making me feel like I've never been born"
She said, "you don't understand what I said"
I said, "no, no, no, you're wrong"

Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart

Coconut fudge really blows down the blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You'll shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out

You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour

I have always thought that it's a crime
So I will ask you once again

While you see it your way
There's a chance that we might fall apart before too long

Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been?
Nothing to do, it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's okay
Good morning, good morning
Good morning
People running round, it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet the Wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts, you start to flirt, now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's okay

I thought I knew you, what did I know?
You don't look different, but you have changed
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Your lips are moving, I cannot hear
Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game
I'm looking through you, you're not the same
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?
Love has a nasty habit of disappearing overnight
You're thinking of me, the same old way
You were above me, but not today
The only difference is you're down there
I'm looking through you, and you're nowhere
Why, tell me why, did you not treat me right?

Don't look at me man, I only have ten children
Ah ho! Ha ha ha ha ha ha!
Quiet boy, quiet!
Okay
Quiet!
Hey bulldog!
Hey bulldog!Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Mmm
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Good night
Good night, everybody
Everybody, everywhere
Good nightWhen I call you up, your line's engaged
I have heard enough, so act your age
We have lost the time that was so hard to find
And I will lose my mind
If you won't see me 
You won't see me 
I don't know why you should want to hide
But I can't get through, my hands are tied
I won't want to stay, I don't have much to say
But I get turned away
And you won't see me 
You won't see me 
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me 
You won't see me 
Time after time
You refuse to even listen
I wouldn't mind
If I knew what I was missing
Though the days are few, they're filled with tears
And since I lost you, it feels like years
Yes, it seems so long, girl, since you've been gone
And I just can't go on
If you won't see me 
You won't see me

It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings
Whatever happened to
The life that we once knew?
Can we really live without each other?
Where did we lose the touch
That seemed to mean so much?
It always made me feel so
Free as a bird
It's the next best thing to be
Free as a bird
Home, home and dry
Like a homing bird I'll fly
As a bird on wings

Always made me feel so free

Made for John LennonI've got a word or two
To say about the things that you do
You're telling all those lies
About the good things that we can have
If we close our eyes
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
I left you far behind
The ruins of the life that you have in mind
And though you still can't see
I know your mind's made up
You're gonna cause more misery
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Although your mind's opaque
Try thinking more if just for your own sake
The future still looks good
And you've got time to rectify
All the things that you should
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Do what you want to do
And go where you're going to
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with you
Think for yourself
'Cause I won't be there with youOne day, you'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Some day, you'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
Yeah, tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so, my love, I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end, you will know
Oh-oh-oh
One day, you'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain, so I'll follow the sunCry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Cry cry cry baby
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry

My, oh, my
When you sigh, my, my inside just flies
Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up, girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes, it's so hard loving you, loving youAnna
You come and ask me, girl
To set you free, girl
You say he loves you more than me, so I will set you free
Go with him 
Go with him 
Anna
Girl, before you go now
I want you to know, now
That I still love you so, but if he loves you more
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl
To love me like I love you
Oh, now, but every girl I've ever had
Breaks my heart and leaves me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Anna
Just one more thing, girl
You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him
All of my life
I've been searching for a girl to love me like I love you
But let me tell you now
But every girl I've ever had, breaks my heart and leave me sad
What am I, what am I supposed to do?

You give back your ring to me, and I will set you free
Go with him 
Go with him 
You can go with him, girl 
Go with himI should have known better with a girl like you
That I would love everything that you do
And I do, hey, hey, hey, and I do
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're gonna say you love me too
So I should have realized a lot of things before
If this is love you've got to give me more
Give me more, hey hey hey, give me more
Whoa, oh, I never realized what a kiss could be
This could only happen to me
Can't you see, can't you see
That when I tell you that I love you, oh
You're going to say you love me too, oh
And when I ask you to be mine
You're going to say you love me too
You love me too, you love me too
You love me tooBorn a poor young country boy
Mother Nature's son
All day long, I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream
See her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass
Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun

Love you all the time and never leave you

Said you had a thing or two to tell me
How was I to know you would upset me?
I didn't realize as I looked in your eyes
You told me
Oh yes, you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore
That's when it hurt me and feeling like this I just can't go on anymore
Please remember how I feel about you
I could never really live without you
So, come on back and see just what you mean to me. I need you
But when you told me, you don't want my lovin' anymore

Now she's hit the big time in the U.S.A
And if she could only hear me, this is what I'd say
Honey Pie, you are making me crazy
I'm in love, but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Oh, honey pie, my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now the thought of meeting you
Makes me weak in the knee
Oh, Honey Pie, you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Honey pie, come back to me
Ooh, yeah
I like it like that, oh ah
I like this kind of hot kind of music
Hot kind of music
Play it to me, play it to me, Hollywood blues
Will the wind that blew her boat across the sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Tee, tee, tee
Now Honey Pie you are making me crazy
I'm in love but I'm lazy
So won't you please come home
Ooh, oh
Oh oh oh oh oh oh oh
Honey Pie, Honey PieAll my little plans and schemes
Lost like some forgotten dreams
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Just like little girls and boys
Playing with their little toys
Seems like all they really were doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be alone
No need to be alone
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real
From this moment on I know
Exactly where my life will go
Seems that all I really was doing
Was waiting for love
Don't need to be afraid
No need to be afraid
It's real love
It's real
Yes, it's real love
It's real
Thought I'd been in love before
But in my heart, I wanted more
Seems like all I really was doing
Was waiting for you
Don't need to be alone
Don't need to be alone
It's real love, it's real

Listen for your footsteps, but they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock, dear, on my old front door
I don't hear it--does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking on the mantel shelf
See the hands a'moving, but I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight, and why I'm by myself
I don't see you, does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, how I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you, I was so unfair
You were in a car crash, and you lost your hair
You said that you would be late, about an hour or two
I said that's alright, I'm waiting here, just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
One, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Don't pass me by, don't make me cry, don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so, I'll hate to see you go
Don't pass me by

This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy

My head is filled with things to say
When you're here
All those words, they seem to slip away
When I get near you
The games begin to drag me down
It's all right
I'll make you maybe next time around
But if I seem to act unkind
It's only me, it's not my mind
That is confusing things
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
Sometimes I wish I knew you well
Then I could speak my mind and tell you
Maybe you'd understand
I want to tell you
I feel hung up but I don't know why
I don't mind
I could wait forever, I've got time
I've got time
I've got timeIf the rain comes
They run and hide their heads
They might as well be dead
If the rain comes
If the rain comes
When the sun shines
They slip into the shade
 And sip their lemonade
 When the sun shines
When the sun shines 
Rain
I don't mind
Shine
The weather's fine
I can show you
That when it starts to rain
 Everything's the same
 I can show you
I can show you 
Rain

That when it rains and shines
 It's just a state of mind
 Can you hear me

NiaR, enihsnuSI'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser, and I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to beIf I needed someone to love
You're the one that I'd be thinking of
If I needed someone
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ah, ah, ah
If I had some more time to spend
Then I guess I'd be with you my friend
If I needed someone
Had you come some other day
Then it might not have been like this
But you see now I'm too much in love
Carve your number on my wall
And maybe you will get a call from me
If I needed someone
Ah, ahBecause you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do
I want you in the morning, girl, I love you
I want you at the moment I feel blue
I'm living every moment, girl, for you
I've loved you from the moment I saw you
You looked at me and that's all you had to do
I feel it now I hope you feel it too
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, I love you
Because you're sweet and lovely, girl, it's true
I love you more than ever, girl, I do

I said move over once, move over twice
Come on baby don't be cold as ice

When I look into your eyes, your love is there for me
And the more I go inside, the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
Floating down the stream of time from life to life with me
Makes no difference where you are or where you'd like to be
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake
So take a piece but not too much
Sail me on a silver sun, where I know that I'm free
Show me that I'm everywhere, and get me home for tea
It's all to much for me to see
The love that's shining all around here
The more I learn, the less I know
But what I do is all too much
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
Ah, it's too much
With your long blond hair and your eyes of blue

What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
The other day I saw you as I walked along the road
But when I saw him with you, I could feel my future fold
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearin' me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?
I met you in the morning waiting for the tides of time
But now the tide is turning, I can see that I was blind
It's so easy for a girl like you to lie
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
I used to think of no one else but you were just the same
You didn't even think of me as someone with a name
Did you mean to break my heart and watch me die?
Tell me why
What goes on in your heart?
What goes on in your mind?
You are tearing me apart
When you treat me so unkind
What goes on in your mind?This happened once before
When I came to your door
No reply
They said it wasn't you
But I saw you peep through your window
I saw the light, I saw the light
I know that you saw me
'Cause I looked up to see your face
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
If I were you, I'd realise that I
Love you more than any other guy
And I'll forgive the lies that I
Heard before when you gave me no reply
I tried to telephone
They said you were not home
That's a lie
'Cause I know where you've been
I saw you walk in your door
I nearly died, I nearly died
'Cause you walked hand in hand
With another man in my place
No reply, no replyOh yes, wait a minute, Mister Postman
Wait, Mister Postman
Oh yeah!
Please, please, Mister Postman
Oh yeah!
There must be some word someday
From my girlfriend so far away
Please, Mister Postman look and see
If there's a letter, a letter for me
I've been standing here waiting, Mister Postman
So patiently
For just a card or just a letter
Saying she's returning home to me
Please, Mister Postman!
Oh yeah!
Please, please, Mister Postman
Oh yeah!
So many days you passed me by
See the tear standing in my eye
You didn't stop to make me feel better
By leaving me a card or a letter
Mister Postman!
Look and see
If there's a letter, oh yeah, for me
I've been waiting such a long time
Since I heard from that girlfriend of mine
You gotta wait a minute, wait a minute

They're gonna make a big star out of me
We'll make a film about a man that's sad and lonely
And all I gotta do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturally
We'll make the scene about a man that's sad and lonely
And begging down upon his bended knee
I'll play the part and I won't need rehearsing
All I have to do is act naturally
Well I'll bet you I'm gonna be a big star
Might win an Oscar, you can never tell
The movies gonna make me a big star
'Cause I can play the part so well
Well I hope you'll come and see me in the movies
Then I know that you will plainly see
The biggest fool that ever hit the big time
And all I gotta do is act naturallyI want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me, hey
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late, hey
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know who loves you

If you don't treat her right, my friend
You're gonna find her gone, 
'Cause I will treat her right, and then
You'll be the lonely one 
You're gonna lose that girl

I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
I don't want to kiss or hold your hand
If it's funny try and understand
There is really nothing else I'd rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
I don't need to hug or hold you tight
I just want to dance with you all night
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with you
Just to dance with you
Is everything I need
Before this dance is through
I think I'll love you too
I'm so happy when you dance with me
If somebody tries to take my place
Let's pretend we just can't see his face
In this world there's nothing I would rather do
I've discovered I'm in love with you
'Cause I'm happy just to dance with youI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weepsI love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
You
YouJust let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with meA taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back  for the honey  and youThere—
There's a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
I think of you
And things you do
Go round my head
The things you said
Like "I love only you"
In my mind there's no sorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There'll be no sad tomorrow
Don't you know that it's so
There is a place
Where I can go
When I feel low
When I feel blue
And it's my mind
And there's no time when I'm alone
There's a place
There's a place
There's a place
There's a placeSince she's been gone
I want no one to talk to me
It's not the same, but I'm to blame, it's plain to see
So go away, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I can't believe that she would leave me on my own
It's just not right, when every night I'm all alone
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
I've got no time for you right now
Don't bother me
I know I'll never be the same
If I don't get her back again
Because I know she'll always be
The only girl for me
But till she's here
Please, don't come near, just stay away
I'll let you know when she's come home until that day
Don't come around, leave me alone
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
Don't-You know if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back again
'Cause I told you once before goodbye
But I came back again
I love you so
I'm the one who wants you
Yes, I'm the one who wants you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time, I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I thought that you would realize
That if I ran away from you
That you would want me too
But I got a big surprise
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You could find better things to do
Than to break my heart again
This time I will try to show that I'm
Not trying to pretend
I wanna go
But I hate to leave you
You know I hate to leave you
Oh ho, oh ho, oh
You, if you break my heart I'll go
But I'll be back againChains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, well I can't break away from these chains
Can't run around, 'cause I'm not free
Whoa, oh, these chains of love won't let me be, yeah
I wanna tell you, pretty baby
I think you're fine
I'd like to love you
But, darlin', I'm imprisoned by these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Please believe me when I tell you
Your lips are sweet
I'd like to kiss them
But I can't break away from all of these
Chains, my baby's got me locked up in chains
And they ain't the kind that you can see
Whoa, oh, these chains of love got a hold on me, yeah
Chains, chains of love
Chains of love
Chains of loveOh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?

And the same goes for me
Whenever you want me at all
I'll be here, yes, I will
Whenever you call
You just got to call on me, yeah
You just got to call on meIf you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
We just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter what chords I play
What words I say or time of day it is
As it's only a Northern song
It doesn't really matter what clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no one thereHold me close and tell me how you feel
Tell me love is real
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love you
Let me hear you say the words I long to hear
Darling, when you're near
Words of love you whisper soft and true
Darling, I love youIt feels so right now, hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one, and then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold , me tight 
Tonight , tonight 
It's you, you, you, you
Hold me tight
Let me go on loving you
Tonight, tonight
Making love to only you
So hold , me tight 
Tonight , tonight

What it means to hold you tight
Being here alone tonight with you

Now hold me tight
Tell me I'm the only one
And then I might
Never be the lonely one
So hold , me tight 
Tonight , tonight

Tell me why you cried, and why you lied to meThough you've gone away this morning
You'll be back again tonight
Telling me there'll be no next time
If I just don't treat you right
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
You've tried before to leave me
But you haven't got the nerve
To walk out and make me lonely
Which is all that I deserve
You'll never leave me and you know it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you
I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me
I will follow you and bring you back where you belong
'Cause I couldn't really stand it
I admit that I was wrong
I wouldn't let you leave me 'cause it's true
'Cause you like me too much and I like you

I really do, and it's nice when you believe me
If you leave me

Another girl
You're making me say that I've got nobody but you
But as from today, well, I've got somebody that's new
I ain't no fool and I don't take what I don't want
For I have got another girl
Another girl
She's sweeter than all the girls and I met quite a few
Nobody in all the world can do what she can do
And so I'm telling you, "This time you'd better stop"
For I have got another girl
Another girl
Who will love me till the end
Through thick and thin
She will always be my friend

HmmWithout going out of my door
I can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of my window
I could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Without going out of your door
You can know all things on Earth
Without looking out of your window
You could know the ways of Heaven
The farther one travels
The less one knows
The less one really knows
Arrive without travelling
See all without looking
Do all without doingBut her eyes, they tantalize
Oh, her lips, they really thrill me
I'll take my chances, for romance is
So important to me
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
No, no, this I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
I can't believe that she'll ever, ever go
Not when she hugs me and says she loves me so
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
Listen, can't you see?
Oh, no, no, no, this I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
Don't take chances if your romance is
So important to you
She'll never hurt me, she won't desert me
She's an angel sent to me
No, no, no, no, this I can't believe
No, no, nay will she deceive
'Cause she's an angel sent to me
No, she's an angel sent to meYou make me dizzy, Miss Lizzy

Once upon a time, or maybe twice, there was an unearthly paradise called Pepperland. Eighty thousand leagues beneath the sea it lay... or lie, I'm not too sure.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Pepperland is a tickle of joy on the blue belly of the universe. It must be scratched.
Right, Max?
MAX:
Yes, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
What?! We Meanies only take NO for an answer. Is that understood, Max?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
That's better. Are the troops in readiness?
MAX:
No, Your Blueness.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The Bonkers?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Clowns?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Snapping Turks?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Anti-music missiles?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
The dreadful Flying Glove?
MAX:
No.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Splendid! Today, Pepperland goes blooey! Fire!
FRED:
The Meanies are coming! The Meanies are coming!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Glove, Glove, come here, Glove! Look out there, and what do you see? Tell him, Max.
MAX:
Someone running, Glove.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Yes. Well, you'll soon put a stop to that, won't you, Glovey? Go, Glove, point! And having pointed, pounce down! I haven't laughed so much since Pompeii! What?! What?! What?! The Glove is losing his touch. Do your worst! Explode them!
FRED :
It's not polite to point!
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE:
Thing of beauty... Destroy it for ever!
FRED :
Sir, Sir, the Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
Not here, young Fred. They wouldn't dare.
FRED:
They would. They are. What are you going to do?
MAYOR:
Finish the quartet.
BLUE MEANIES:
Fire!
FRED:
Trio, sir.
FRED:
Duet, sir.
MAYOR
Duet?
FRED:
Solo!
MAYOR:
Young Fred, the Blue Meanies are coming!
MAYOR:
4 scores and 32 bars ago our forefathers...
FRED:
Our quartet?
MAYOR:
And foremothers...
FRED:
Another quartet?
MAYOR:
Made it in this yellow submarine...
FRED:
What, that little thing?
MAYOR:
To Pepperland. Climb aboard, young Fred.
FRED:
But, sir, I can't even make my soap float.
MAYOR:
I'm appointing you Lord Admiral.
FRED:
Lord Admiral? In that event, yes.
MAYOR:
Hurry, Young Fred. Go! Get help!
FRED:
Where should I go?
MAYOR:
No time for trivialities.
CREDITS
In the town where I was born
Lived a man who sailed to sea
And he told us of his life
In the land of submarines
So we sailed on to the sun
Till we found the sea of green
And we lived beneath the waves
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
And our friends are all aboard
Many more of them live next door
And the band begins to play
We all live in a Yellow Submarine
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine
…
Full speed ahead, Mr. Boatswain.
Full speed ahead.
Full speed it is, sir.
Action stations! Action stations!
Aye, sir, aye.
Captain, Captain!
As we live a life of ease
Every one of us has all we need
Sky of blue and sea of green
In our Yellow Submarine
We all live in a Yellow Submarine,
Yellow Submarine, Yellow Submarine,
…
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no-one will hear
No-one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No-one was saved
All the lonely people,
where do they all come from?
All the lonely people,
where do they all belong?
RINGO:
Who... is me? Liverpool can be a lonely place on a Saturday night. And this is only Thursday morning. Compared with my life, Eleanor Rigby's was a gay, mad whirl. Nothing ever happens to me. I feel like an old, splintered drumstick. I'd jump into the River Mersey, but it looks like rain. Nothing ever happens to me.
BOBBY:
Puss, puss-puss. Puss, puss, puss. Here, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy, pussy. Here, pussy, pussy.  Ahem, er...
RINGO:
Would you believe me if I told you I was being followed by a yellow submarine?
BOBBY:
No, I would not.
RINGO:
Oh yeah, I didn't think you would.
RINGO:
I could have sworn there was a yellow submarine. But that isn't logical, is it? It must have been one of them unidentified flying cupcakes or a figment of my imagination.
But I don't have an imagination.
FRED:
Help, help, help!
RINGO :
Thanks, I don't need any.
FRED:
Help! Won't you please, please help me?
RINGO:
Be specific.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What you need is...
FRED:
'H' for hurry, 'E' for ergent, 'L' for love me and 'P' for p-p-p-p-please help.
VOZ:
Hiya, baby!
RINGO:
Your story has touched my heart. Jump in, we'll get my friends.
FRED:
Bless you!
RINGO:
Did I sneeze?
FRED:
Just park it here.
RINGO:
I'll just park it here.
FRED:
What would your friends be doing here?
RINGO:
Displaying.
FRED:
Displaying what?
RINGO:
Displaying around.
FRED:
Can't we take one of these?
RINGO:
No, Fred, I only work with me mates.
FRED:
Frankenstein?
RINGO:
I used to go out with his sister.
FRED:
His sister?
RINGO:
Yeah. Phyllis. Hey, I wonder what would happen if I pulled this lever.
FRED:
You mustn't do that.
RINGO:
Can't help it. I'm a born lever-puller.
JOHN:
Ringo, I've just had the strangest dream.
RINGO:
I warned you not to eat on an empty stomach. Now listen to old Fred.
FRED:
... music ... submarine ... Blue Meanies!!!
RINGO:
What do you think?
JOHN:
I think he needs a rehearsal.
JOHN:
When do we leave?
RINGO:
Let's get the other two, John.
JOHN:
What day is it?
RINGO:
Sitar-day.
JOHN:
Then George will be here.
]
RINGO:
George, what are you doing up there?
GEORGE :
Now, what is it, Ringo? Is there a matter you'd like to take up or down?
RINGO :
This chap here...
FRED :
...Blue Meanies!!!
GEORGE:
You're nuts, the pair of you.
RINGO:
Wait a minute, that's my car.
GEORGE:
How do you know it's your car?
RINGO:
I'd know it anywhere.
GEORGE:
What's it look like, then?
RINGO:
It's red with yellow wheels. I mean, blue with orange wheels.
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
RINGO:
Come on, move over, I'm driving.
GEORGE:
I got here first.
RINGO/GEORGE:
I'll drive, if you like... No, you sit in the middle... I'm sitting in the middle... You said you were driving... I am driving... I'll get in the back, then.
JOHN:
Do you think we're interrupting something?
RINGO:
I think so. We'd better find Paul, hadn't we?
GEORGE:
It's all in the mind.
JOHN:
Try one of those doors.
GEORGE:
Yes, they do look very nice, don't they?
RINGO:
Yes, they do.
JOHN:
They do, though, don't they?
GEORGE:
Yes, they do.
RINGO:
Don't dey, dough?
GEORGE:
Dough?
JOHN:
Don't ask. Dat's dough.
PAUL:
What's the matter, folks?
RINGO:
Blue Meanies.
FRED:
Well, lads, what do you think?
JOHN :
I think that...
FRED:
Remember, there'll be rough seas ahead. So, what do you think?
PAUL:
Well, then, um...
FRED:
Pounding, overwhelming waves. What do you think of that?
JOHN:
Well, I think that...
RINGO:
As a matter of fact, I...
ALL BEATLES:
I think...
FRED:
Well?
RINGO:
I've forgotten.
FRED:
Right, then, let's get this vessel shipshape.
JOHN:
I kind of like the way it is, submarine shape.
We see a series of landscapes. We hear the end of “A day in the life”.
PAUL:
So, this is a submarine.
JOHN:
Soft, isn't it?
RINGO:
Not if you're on the bottom.
FRED:
All right, lads, time to stow the gab and turn to.
PAUL:
Groovy. How do you start this thing?
FRED:
It starts with a Blue Meanie attack.
JOHN:
Supposing there's no Blue Meanies in the neighbourhood?
FRED:
Then you start looking for a switch.
RINGO:
Perhaps this is it.
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now …
Black, white, green, red / Can I take my friend to bed?
Pink, brown, yellow, orange and blue / I love you 
All together now ,
all together now ...
Sail the ship
Chop the tree
Skip the rope
Look at me
All together now
All together now …
RINGO:
What time is it?
JOHN:
It's time to time.
PAUL:
Look, the hands are slowing down.
PAUL:
Do you ever get the feeling...
JOHN:
Yeah.
PAUL:
… that things aren't as rosy as they appear to be under the surface?
RINGO:
What's happening, John?
JOHN:
Well, in my humble opinion, we've become involved in Einstein's time-space continuum theory.
GEORGE:
All right.
JOHN:
Relatively speaking, that is.
GEORGE:
Of course. Maybe time's gone on strike.
RINGO:
What for?
GEORGE:
Shorter hours.
RINGO:
I don't blame it. It must be very tiring being time, mustn't it?
JOHN & PAUL:
Why?
RINGO:
It's a twenty-four hour day, isn't it?
JOHN:
You surprise me, Ringo.
RINGO:
Why?
JOHN:
Dealing in abstracts.
RINGO:
Just because I'm a drummer... I don't half feel funny.
PAUL :
You're not half the lad you used to be.
GEORGE 
Look, everything's getting bigger.
JOHN :
It's not. It's us that are getting smaller...
RINGO :
I want my mam.
FRED:
And younger. There you are, lads. Old Fred will get you out of all this.
RINGO 
Look at that!
GEORGE:
It's all a load of Father Xmas's.
JOHN:
It's not. It's Father Time.
GEORGE:
How do you know?
JOHN:
I read it in a book.
FRED:
I don't want to alarm you, but the years are going backwards.
GEORGE:
What's that mean, old Fred?
FRED:
It means if we slip back through time at this rate, very soon we'll all disappear up our own existence.
JOHN:
What are we gonna do, then?
FRED:
We could always try a few buttons.
RINGO :
I want my mam.
FRED:
Time's fast running out for us, I'm afraid!
JOHN:
Can't we do something to the clock?
GEORGE:
What do you mean, John?
JOHN:
Move the hands forward, see what happens.
FRED:
Clever lad.
JOHN:
Something strange is happening. It's speeding up now.
PAUL :
Funny... a submarine remarkably like our own.
JOHN:
Uncannily.
RINGO:
There's someone in it. Look.
JOHN:
And they're waving.
RINGO:
It's a group of fellas.
JOHN:
Wave back. Maybe we're both part of a vast yellow submarine fleet.
RINGO:
There's only two of us.
JOHN:
Then I would suggest that yonder yellow submarine is one of ourselves…
FRED:
Going backwards...
JOHN:
… in time!
GEORGE:
Look at Ringo.
JOHN:
Oh dear, we're all the same.
PAUL:
Senile delinquents.
GEORGE:
And I can hear my beard growing.
RINGO:
We'd better do something.
When I get older, losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older, too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings, go for a ride
[A text can be read: “sixty-four years is 33.661.440 minutes and one minute is a
long time… Let us demonstrate”.]
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
in the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee,
Vera, Chuck and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely
what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form,
mine forever more
Will you still need me,
will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
JOHN:
Well, correct me if I'm wrong, gentlemen, but would you agree that we have been passing through the Sea of Time?
RINGO:
That would explain a few things. I'm glad I'm not young any more. Or was it old?
JOHN:
What kind of a sea is this?
FRED:
The Sea of Science.
JOHN:
Oh, yeah.
If you're listening to this song
You may think the chords are going wrong
But they're not
He just wrote it like that
When you're listening late at night
You may think the band are not quite right
But they are
They just play it like that
It doesn't really matter
What chords I play
What words I say
Or time of day it is
Cause it's only a Northern Song
It doesn't really matter
What clothes I wear
Or how I fare or if my hair is brown
When it's only a Northern Song
If you think the harmony
Is a little dark and out of key
You're correct
There's nobody there
And I told you there's no-one there.
GEORGE:
He looks wrong.
PAUL:
He doesn't look at all well.
GEORGE:
In fact, he's horrible.
JOHN :
He's so ugly.
ALL:
Really ugly!
FRED:
Somebody push a button.
JOHN:
There's a cyclops.
PAUL:
Can't be. He's got two eyes.
JOHN:
Then it must be a bi-cyclops.
GEORGE:
There's another one.
JOHN:
A whole cyclopedia.
JOHN:
There's a school of whales.
RINGO:
They look a bit old for school.
PAUL:
University, then.
RINGO :
University of Whales. They look like dropouts to me.
FRED:
You've got to steer clear!
RINGO:
Steer clear?
FRED:
Yes, steer. Clear?
RINGO:
Yes, dear.
FRED:
Now, whatever you do, don't touch that button.
RINGO:
Which button?
FRED:
That one.
RINGO:
This one?
FRED:
That was the panic button.
PAUL:
Poor Ringo.
JOHN:
Poor lad.
GEORGE:
Never did no harm to no-one.
JOHN:
Lads, now Ringo's gone, what are we gonna do?
FRED:
Learn to sing trios.
PAUL:
No, let's save the poor devil.
JOHN:
I see footsteps.
FRED:
It's a pair of kinky boot-beasts.
JOHN:
Preparing to attack.
JOHN:
I don't half miss Ringo.
PAUL:
He's far out there.
JOHN:
Always was.
RINGO:
'H' is for hurry!
PAUL:
Here comes Ringo!
JOHN:
There goes Ringo.
GEORGE:
It's seen us.
FRED:
Find a boxing button.
PAUL:
Whoever heard of a boxing button?
JOHN:
Who cares? Find one.
FRED :
Fire one!
FRED:
Uh-oh, wrong one.
JOHN:
That.
GEORGE:
There goes Ringo again.
JOHN:
Rides well, doesn't he?
RINGO:
'E' is for ergent...
FRED:
Oh no, not the dreaded vacuum again.
PAUL:
We'll be sucked into oblivion.
GEORGE:
Or even further.
FRED:
Put her in reverse.
JOHN:
So long, sucker.
PAUL:
Too much.
GEORGE:
Too soon.
FRED:
Reverse! Reverse!
JOHN:
Ringo time.
RINGO:
'L' is for love me...
JOHN:
Indians!
RINGO:
Help! Help! 'P' is for please...
JOHN:
So, press a button.
JOHN:
How was it, Ringo?
RINGO :
'Arrowing.
FRED:
Look who's back. Full speed ahead.
RINGO:
Oh, no.
JOHN:
The motor's packing in.
FRED:
By all the sea nymphs, we're losing power. We're being swallowed. What shall we do?
PAUL:
Serve tea.
JOHN:
Lovely.
FRED:
By Neptune's knickerbockers, she's puttered out.
JOHN:
Maybe we should call a road service.
PAUL:
Can't. No road.
RINGO:
And we're not sub-scribers.
JOHN, PAUL, GEORGE:
Subscribers! Oh!
GEORGE:
I know something about motors. Let me have a look.
FRED:
Here.
GEORGE:
Is that the motor?
FRED:
Can't you tell one when you see one?
GEORGE:
Of course I can. Let me peruse it.
JOHN:
What do you think?
GEORGE:
I think I burned my finger.
RINGO :
Here, lads. Look at this.
JOHN:
What do you think it is?
GEORGE:
Nothing.
RINGO:
Looks like nothing.
PAUL:
It's a local inhabitant.
RINGO:
He's probably one of the nothings.
PAUL:
At least that's something. Let's show him our motor.
JOHN:
Steady on. You don't want to show your motor to just anybody.
GEORGE:
But this is a nobody.
JEREMY:
Medic, pedic, zed oblique,
orphic, morphic, dorphic, Greek.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
JOHN:
Can you tell us where we're at?
JEREMY:
A true Socratic query, that.
JOHN:
And who the Billy Shears are you?
JEREMY:
Who? Who indeed am I?
JOHN :
Jeremy?
PAUL :
Hillary?
GEORGE :
Boob?
RINGO :
Ph. D?
ALL:
Who?
JEREMY:
Eminent physicist, polyglot classicist,
prize-winning botanist,
hard biting satirist,
talented pianist, good dentist, too.
JOHN:
Lousy poet.
JEREMY:
Critic's voice, take your choice.
RINGO:
Must be one of them angry young men.
PAUL:
Or a daffy old creep.
JEREMY:
I, daffy old creep?
GEORGE:
Do you speak English?
JEREMY:
Old English, middle, a dialect, pure...
PAUL:
Well, do you speak English?
JEREMY:
You know, I'm not sure.
RINGO:
He's so smart, he doesn't even remember what he knows.
PAUL:
Why don't we show him our motor?
JOHN:
Should we really... show him our motor?
PAUL:
He may not have seen one before.
JEREMY:
Turbo-prop, super-combustible spring.
Metrocyclonic and stereophonic,
This motor, I see, has a broken down thing.
JOHN:
He fixed it?
PAUL:
He fixed it.
GEORGE:
Great. Let's go.
JEREMY:
I must complete my bust, two novels,
finish my blueprints, begin my beguine.
JOHN:
Must you always talk in rhyme?
JEREMY:
If I spoke prose, you'd all find out,
I don't know what I talk about.
Ad hoc, ad loc and quid pro quo.
So little time, so much to know.
PAUL:
Hey, fellas. Look.
JEREMY:
The footnotes for my 19th book.
This is my standard procedure for doing it.
And while I compose it,
I'm also reviewing it.
GEORGE:
A boob for all seasons.
PAUL:
How can he lose?
JOHN:
Were your notices good?
JEREMY:
It's my policy never to read my reviews.
JOHN:
There must be a word for what he is.
He's a real Nowhere Man
Sitting in his Nowhere Land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's as blind as he can be,
Just sees what he wants to see
Nowhere Man, can you see me at all?
Nowhere Man, don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry
Leave it all till somebody else
lends you a hand
Doesn't have a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to
Isn't he a bit like you and me
Nowhere Man, please listen,
You don't know what you're missing
Nowhere Man, the world is at your command
He's a real Nowhere Man,
Sitting in his nowhere land
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
Making all his Nowhere plans for nobody
JOHN:
Okay, men, all aboard. Let's go somewhere.
RINGO:
What about him?
JOHN:
He's happy enough going around in circles.
RINGO:
Poor little fella.
PAUL:
I don't know. Ringo's just a sentimentalist.
RINGO:
Look at him. Can't he come with us? 
Mr. Boob, you can come with us, if you like.
JEREMY:
You mean, you'd take a Nowhere Man?
RINGO:
Come on, we'll take you somewhere.
JOHN 
Okay, Booby. Down the hatch.
JEREMY :
Down the hatch. A quite curious phrase.
The middle South Midlands
Victorian phase.
It's usage undoubtedly on the increase.
I must work it into
my New Statesman piece.
JOHN:
That's the hatch, friend.
JEREMY:
Indeed.
FRED:
Steady now, crew. Prepare to go forward.
GEORGE:
Forward.
PAUL:
Forward.
JOHN:
Forward.
RINGO:
Forward.
ALL:
Forward!
JOHN:
It's awfully quiet.
GEORGE:
What shall we do, Jeremy?
JEREMY:
Repair, revive, revamp, renew.
Ipse dixit, just turn the screw.
JEREMY:
Log sign, clog sign, big thingamabob.
JOHN:
What's he saying?
PAUL:
What's he doing?
JEREMY:
Chewing gum will do the job. A turn of the screw, and all is and all is new.
FRED:
I can't stop her. 'H' is for hurry, 'E' is for ergent, 'L' is for love me…
JOHN:
'P' is for... goodbye?
GEORGE:
That was lovely, Jeremy.
PAUL:
We've lost the sub for good.
JOHN:
Or for bad. Or for worse.
JEREMY:
I'm sorry about that.
RINGO:
But he did fix the motor.
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
It looks like the foothills.
PAUL:
The foothills of what?
JOHN:
The foothills of the headlands.
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees
and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you,
you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun
in her eyes and she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people
eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles
as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head
in the clouds and you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With Plasticine porters
with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds…
JOHN:
Carry on, lads, carry on.
RINGO:
Certainly was carrying on.
JOHN:
I feel a draft.
PAUL:
We must be near the Sea of Holes. Don't you think we should ask somebody for directions?
JOHN 
Excuse us...
PAUL:
Can you tell us the way to Pepperland?
JOHN:
Thanks.
PAUL:
Gosh, look at all this dust? Where did it come from?
JEREMY:
A chemical error and quite imprecise. This is a condiment...
RINGO:
Condi...
JEREMY:
A spice.
JOHN:
He's right, you know. It's pepper.
PAUL:
Pepper?
GEORGE:
Pepper.
RINGO:
John? Paul? George? Is anybody home?
PAUL:
Where are we?
JOHN:
A holey sea. This place reminds me of Blackburn, Lancashire.
PAUL:
Oh, boy...
GEORGE:
How many do you think there are in all?
JEREMY:
Enough to fill the Albert Hall.
PAUL:
Didn't old Fred mention something about the Sea of Holes just before the Sea of Green?
JOHN:
Yeah.
GEORGE:
Through one of them spots must be the Sea of Green. But which? Which one?
JEREMY:
Thesis, antithesis, synthesis, causes of causal causation.
JOHN:
Jeremy, what do you know about holes?
JEREMY:
There are simply no holes in my education.
PAUL:
You mean you haven't composed a whole book?
GEORGE:
Great. What shall we do?
JEREMY:
Be empirical. Look.
RINGO:
The booby's making more and more sense.
PAUL:
It's getting better all the time.
JOHN:
Great. Come on, let's all look for the Sea of Green. The Sea of Holes... into the Sea of Green.
JEREMY:
Hydrolate, verdant chrysodine.
I think we're near the Sea of Green.
RINGO:
I've got a hole in me pocket.
PAUL:
Where's Jeremy?
JOHN:
He was over there.
GEORGE:
He's not here now.
PAUL:
He must have jumped ship, then.
RINGO:
He wouldn't do that. He's our friend. Booby, Jeremy, Hillary, where are you?
JOHN:
Pepperland. A bit salty around the edges. Looks all dingy.
GEORGE:
And drab.
PAUL:
And quiet.
JOHN:
Safe at last.
PAUL:
And none the worse for our adventures.
JOHN:
Reminiscent in many ways of the late Mr. Ulysses.
RINGO:
There's an eye in the apples.
FRED:
There she blows! Lord Mayor, sir... I've made it, I'm back.
GEORGE:
Who's this?
FRED:
Our Lord Mayor. He's been bonked. . Lord Mayor, sir... unbonk yourself. Even a little snatch of a tune might get him up again.
JOHN:
All right, let's sing.
Have you got time to rectify, time to rectify...
MAYOR:
Do I hear music? Do I see... young Fred?
FRED:
You do, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR:
Bless my metronome. And did you bring the help?
FRED:
Yes, yes. Look.
MAYOR:
Holy pizzicato, young Fred. It's quite uncanny, your faces...
PAUL:
We're quite cute, really.
MAYOR:
You could pass for the originals.
JOHN:
We are the originals.
MAYOR:
No, no... Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band.
RINGO:
They couldn't be much with a name like that. Sergeant Pepper?
FRED
You could impersonate them and rally the land to rebellion.
MAYOR
Where are your instruments?
JOHN
Lost in the Monstrous Sea.
PAUL
Sea of Monsters.
FRED
We'll get other instruments, Lord Mayor.
MAYOR
Not a chance. The Meanies captured everything that maketh music.
PAUL
They hate music that much, do they?
MAYOR
They shrink at the very sound.
JOHN
Okay, you guys. It's shrinking time in Pepperland.
All people in Pepperland keeps grey and motionless (except for escape from the blue
meanies).
BLUE MEANIE
Aim, fire!
The Beatles hide behind cut-outs.
PAUL
He reminds me of my old English teacher.
JOHN
Look, if you must shout, shout quietly.
GEORGE
What do we do?
JOHN
Coagulate with the crowd.
PAUL
Cut-outs at the ready.
JOHN
Then let's cut out.
They come to a high bandstand surrounded by thorns.
PAUL
What a grand bandstand.
JOHN
That's where the gear's kept. Come on.
Blue meanies with dogs.
GEORGE
Cavey, cavey.
At dusk.
PAUL
All right, the coast is clear.
GEORGE
Now's our chance.
RINGO
But how'll we get over?
GEORGE
Easy. Follow me.
They jump the fence of thorns
BLUE MEANIE
A-ha! You fools!
The watch fires his machine gun.
The Beatles reach the bandstand moving between asleep blue meanies.
RINGO
It's not very light in here, is it?
GEORGE
Shh! Keep the noise down.
JOHN
Look what I found. It's their uniforms.
PAUL
Nice bit of gear, that.
RINGO
They'll look great on, eh?
PAUL
Dey will, won't dey?
RINGO
Won't dey, dough.
JOHN
How do I look?
PAUL
Groovy, groovy. How about me?
RINGO, looking thru the window
Bad scene, lads. We're surrounded.
GEORGE
Oh, heck.
RINGO
A million billion Meanies.
PAUL
They're coming this way.
ALL
Hide!
Trying to hide they make a lot of noise.
PAUL
Do you think they heard us?
JOHN
I hope not.
GEORGE
What did you say?
SOMEONE
Shhhh!
GEORGE
Good plan.
1:03:22 DAWN, by Grieg.
PAUL
Look. They're all asleep.
RINGO
They look cute when they're asleep. Almost human.
GEORGE
Come on. Let's get out of here.
PAUL
On tiptoe.
They take their instruments and go down the hill.
RINGO
Tiptoe through the Meanies...
THE OTHER
Shh!
Ringo steps on the bagpipe. Some meanies wake.
PAUL
Let's exude.
The Beatles are persecuted. Ringo falls down and jumps on the John arms.
GEORGE
Relax, lads. Not a Meanie in sight.
JOHN
Not even a teeny Meanie.
PAUL
Not even a teeny-weeny Meanie.
RINGO
Great.
PAUL
Oh, look. Breakfast.
RINGO
I'm dying for a bit of brekky.
George takes an apple. Four tall meanies do the same.
JOHN
Look out.
A blue meanie heads the four tall meanies.
CHIEF
Sound off, one, two, three, four...
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three, four...
The Beatles, one above the other, march behind the row of tall meanies.
JOHN
Five.
CHIEF
Five?  Sound off, one, two, three,
four.
TALL MEANIES
One, two, three...
JOHN
Four.
John eliminates another one.
TALL MEANIES
One, two...
JOHN
Three.
CHIEF
Three?
JOHN
Two.
CHIEF
Two?
JOHN
One.
CHIEF
One?  Are you Bluish? You
don't look Bluish.
JOHN
Run for it.
The Beatles escape again.
PAUL
Right, men. We've made it.
GEORGE
Instruments at the ready.
JOHN
Okay, on the beat. A-one, a-two, a-three, a-four, a-five, a-six…
RINGO
Hey, can't you make it three?
JOHN
All right. On the beat of three... A-one, a-two, a-three...
1:06:34 THE BEATLES: SGT. PEPPER’S LONELY HEARTS CLUB BAND
It was twenty years ago today,
Sgt. Pepper taught the band to play
They've been going in and out of style,
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you,
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
Sit back and let the evening go
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely,
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
It's wonderful to be here,
it's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience,
we'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really wanna stop the show,
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song,
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you,
The one and only Billy Shears
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
THE BEATLES: WITH A LITTLE HELP FROM MY FRIENDS
Billy Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
The inhabitants of Pepperland recover color and smile. Lennon has been presented as Billy Shears, but Ringo’s voice is heard.
01:08:49 THE MEANIES GATHER AROUND THEIR CHIEF
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! The hills are alive...
ASSISTANT
With the sound of music.
The Chief Blue Meanie hits his assistant. Then he gets a tantrum.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Who is responsible for this?
ASSISTANT
Rimsky Korsakov?
The assistant is shot and kicking, but still resurfaces.
ASSISTANT
Guy Lombardo?
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE, laughs
My dear friend... let us not forget that heaven is blue.  Tomorrow, the world! Bring in my Bluebird.
PEPPERLAND INHABITANTS
Who? Who? Who?
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Who? Who? Who?
The mouth of John expels the question WHO?
A blue big glove crosses the air.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Ah! Here you are, my little Glovey-dovey. Go get thee hence and destroy yon upstarts.  Smash them! Squash them! Crash them! Oblue-terate them!
MEDICAL DOCTOR, as the Chief collapses
Here, your Blueness, have some nasty medicine.
CHIEF, exuberant
The Glove, the Glove, the Glove!
PAUL, GEORGE, RINGO
Glove? Glove? Glove?
From the mouth of John emerge the word GLOVE.
GEORGE
He's a clever lad, isn't he?
RINGO
Open your mouth, it won't hurt.  John, you haven't half got a big mouth, haven't you?
GEORGE
It's easy. All you need is love.
JOHN
Yes.
And expeles again the word GLOVE, but this time the initial G vanishes.
1:12:02 THE BEATLES : ALL YOU NEED IS LOVE
Love, love, love 
There's nothing you can do that can't be done
Nothing you can sing that can't be sung
Nothing you can say but you can learn how to play the game
It's easy
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
Nothing you can know that isn't known,
Nothing you can see that isn't shown
There's nowhere you can be
that isn't where you're meant to be
It's easy
All you need is love, 
All you need is love, 
All you need is love, love,
Love is all you need
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love, love
The words emerged from the mouth of John neutralize the glove attacks.
JOHN
Go, Glove, lovely Glove.
RINGO
You took the words right out of my mouth, John.
GEORGE
Hey, wait, and watch.  It's all in the mind, you know.
Love is all you need
Love is all you need
Everything revives in Pepperland. The word NO becomes NOW and then KNOW.
She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah
The meanies flee and The Beatles are acclaimed by the crowd.
A little bit further they find a blue glass ball.
GEORGE
Hey, that's a funny place to leave a goldfish bowl.
JOHN
In Pepperland all things are possible.
PAUL
It's not a goldfish bowl.
RINGO
Just a big glass bowl, then.
PAUL
Yes, blue glass.
RINGO
It must be from Kentucky.
Paul knocks the bowl. Some music starts to sound.
JOHN
There's something inside.
RINGO
Four fellas.
GEORGE
What are they doing there?
PAUL
They're not having a ball, that's for sure.
JOHN
It can't be.
PAUL
It's us.
JOHN
But we're here.
PAUL
It's Sgt. Pepper's...
RINGO
Lonely...
GEORGE
Hearts Club...
GEORGE
Band.
JOHN
The resemblance is truly striking. If I could come in here I think the theory put forward
by Einstein…
PAUL, spoofs an old song called ‘Any old iron’
Any old Ein, any old Ein, any, any, any old Einstein.
JOHN
… could well be applied here. The people in the ball are obviously extensions of our own personalities, suspended, as it were, in time, frozen in space, according to the now famous Theory of Relativity, which, briefly explained, is simply a matter of taking two eggs...
The other three try to break the ball.
PAUL
John!
JOHN
… beating lightly and adding a little salt and pepper...
GEORGE
John!
JOHN
George?
GEORGE
How do we get them out?
JOHN
Break the glass.
GEORGE
We can't. It's Beatle-proof.
JOHN
Nothing is Beatle-proof.
PAUL, to Ringo
Have you got your drumsticks with you? A drum break might shatter it.
RINGO
No, I haven't.
GEORGE
Have a look in your pocket.
1:15:50 “Baby you’re a rich man” is heard.
RINGO
I've got a hole in my pocket. I wonder if...
Ringo sticks the hole on the ball. The ball gets empty.
RINGO
Yeah, it still works.
GEORGE
We take back all we said.
JOHN
You're a genius.
PAUL
A sheer genius.
RINGO
I know, I know, I know.  Like coloured telly.
GEORGE
Like crystal.
PAUL
They're decanting.
The members of the Band face their peers.
RINGO 2
Hello, brother.
RINGO
Yeah, without a doubt.
GEORGE
We're the spitting image of each other.
GEORGE 2
Golly, yeah.
JOHN
I'm led to believe that you're an extension of my personality.
JOHN 2
Yes, I'm your alter-ego man.
JOHN
And I'm the ego man, goo goo, g'joob.  I'm glad you asked me that. Because as a matter of fact there's a war on. Then, brothers in war, to the
skirmish must we hence.
JOHN 2
Shall we hence?
PAUL
Let's not waste time sitting on the hence. Beatles to battle. Charge!
The Blue Meanies attack again. The Beatles run for a hide.
JOHN
We're surrounded.
RINGO, pointing the four-headed dog
Nice dog, though.
The Beatles hide inside a hurdy-gurdy. John turns the crank and sings:
1:17:26 THE BEATLES : HEY BULLDOG
Sheepdog... standing in the rain
Bullfrog... doing it again
Some kind of happiness
is measured out in miles
What makes you think you're
something special when you smile?
Childlike... no one understands
Jack knife... in your sweaty hands
Some kind of innocence
is measured out in years
You don't know what it's like
to listen to your fears
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
You can talk to me
If you're lonely you can talk to me
Big man... walking in the park
Wigwam... frightened of the dark
Some kind of solitude
is measured out in you
You think you know me
but you haven't got a clue
You can talk to me,
You can talk to me
You can talk to me...
if you're lonely you can talk to me
Hey, bulldog 
John to the dog:
What do you say? Sing it.
Do you know any more? Play it!
Todos
Hey, bulldog.
The Beatles escape from the dog and the guards. Ringo finds Jeremy hanging from
the branch of a tree.
RINGO
Jeremy, can it be you?
JEREMY
Can it be me? I think you'd better
inquire of the guards,
for when I was captured,
they took all my cards.
RINGO
Shh, that's enough, Jeremy. Come on, the whole world's being attacked.
JEREMY
What do you want me to do?
Do you recommend fisticuffs
versus the guard?
Oh, guard! Blue Meanio!
Left to the nostril, right uppercut,
right to the eyebrow, left to the gut.
Jeremy stumbles into a tree. An apple falls down and knocks out the meanie. Ringo
congratulates Jeremy.
RINGO
Jeremy!
JEREMY
Come on, Ringo!
The Chief treats to stem the rout.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
Get back! Get back! Once more unto the breach, dear Meanies! You're advancing the wrong way! Retreat backwards! Get back there now!
The Chief is swept along.
CHIEF BLUE MEANIE
My kingdom for a horse!  I think I'll tear him up into little pieces.
JEREMY
He does, does he?
CHIEF
I think I'll make a blueburger out of him.
JEREMY
Ha-ha, I don't care what you think.
CHIEF
You don't, eh? We'll soon see about that.
JEREMY
He does in truth seem quite annoyed,
some reference material
before I'm destroyed.
Where ground is soft most often grows,
Arise, arise, arouse, a rose.
A rosy nose?
CHIEF
Speak your last piece!
JEREMY
Peace, peace,
supplant the doom and the gloom.
Turn off what is sour,
turn into a flower and bloom, bloom.
Ha-ha, bloom, ha-ha, bloom,
bloom, bloom...
A lot of pink roses cover the whole body of the Chief. He flees crazy.
RINGO
First time I saw that Nowhere Man, that nobody, I knew he was somebody.
JOHN
You're right. Hello there, blue people. Won't you join us? Buck up, and otherwise go
mingle. What do you say?
CHIEF
Max?
MAX
Your Blue... I mean your Newness!
CHIEF, takes some flowers
It's no longer a blue world, Max. Where could we go?
MAX
Argentina?
JOHN
Are you with us? Will you join?
CHIEF
Shall we?
MAX
No!...  Yes, your Newness!
CHIEF, smiles
Yes, Max...
JEREMY, close to them
Yes. Oh, yes is a word with a glorious ring,
A true, universal, euphonious thing.
In genders embracing
and chasing of blues,
the very best word
for the whole world to use. Ha-ha!
CHIEF
Yes, let us mix, Max. I've never admitted it before, but my cousin is the Bluebird of
Happiness.
1:24:41 THE BEATLES : IT’S ALL TOO MUCH
It's all too much
When I look into your eyes,
Your love is there for me
And the more I go inside,
the more there is to see
It's all too much for me to take
The love that's shining all around here
All the world is birthday cake,
So take a piece but not too much
Everybody dance. Jeremy and the Chief reconcile. The Chief cries of
emotion.
Nice to have the time
to take this opportunity
Time for me to look at you,
and you to look at me
It's all too much for me to see
The love that's shining all around you
Everywhere, it's what you make
For us to take, it's all too much
It's too much
1:26:55 PAUL, RINGO, GEORGE AND JOHN IN PERSON
PAUL
Catchy tune, that.
RINGO
I can't seem to get it out of my head.
GEORGE
Then shake it.
RINGO
That's what we've been doing all night.
PAUL
Yeah, it was a great party.
GEORGE
And we brought back lots of lovely souvenirs. Here is the motor.
PAUL
I've got a little love.
RINGO
And I've got a hole in my pocket.
PAUL
A hole?
RINGO
Half a hole, anyway. I gave the rest to Jeremy.
GEORGE
What can he do with half a hole?
PAUL
Fix it to keep his mind from wandering.
RINGO
Look at John, will you?
John has been looping through a telescope.
PAUL
What's the matter, John? Blue Meanies?
JOHN
Newer and bluer Meanies have been sighted within the vicinity of this theatre.
There's only one way to go out.
GEORGE
How's that?
JOHN
Singing!
RINGO
One...
PAUL
Two...
GEORGE
Three...
JOHN
¡Fire!
1:27:33 THE BEATLES : ALL TOGETHER NOW
One, two, three, four / Can I have a little more?
Five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten / I love you
A, B, C, D / Can I bring my friend to tea?
E, F, G, H, I, J / I love you

Many, many, many times before
It's not like me to pretend
But I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
I think about you night and day
I need you and it's true
When I think about you, I can say
I'm never, never, never, never blue
So I'm telling you, my friend
That I'll get you, I'll get you in the end
Yes I will, I'll get you in the end, oh yeah, oh yeah
Well, there's gonna be a time

Woah yeahIt’s okay to leave your dog in a hot car 
It’s okay to leave your dog in a hot car 
Nothing bad could possibly happen
If you leave a dog in a hot car
 John, do you mind telling me about the song: 'It's Okay to Leave Your Dog In A Hot Car?'
 Uh, I don't quite remember that one very well, but you know, it was the 60s! We didn't know any better. Oh, I think George actually wrote that one
 Uh, it was all John's idea, yeah. He knew exactly what he was talking about, y'know. He bloody hated dogs. When he wasn't with us he was stomping them on the streets. He would cook thеm up in a stew and eat them. I can't rеally say I blame him, though. Little bastardsHello little girl
Hello little girl
Hello little girl
When I see you everyday
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When you're passing on your way
I say, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I see you passing by
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
When I try to catch your eye
I cry, "Mm mm hello little girl"
I send you flowers but you don't care
You never seem to see me standing there
I often wonder what you're thinking of
I hope it's me and love love love
So I hope there'll come a day
When you'll say, "Mm you're my little girl"
It's not the first time that it's happened to me
It's been a long lonely time
And it's funny funny to see that I'm about to lose my mind mind mind
So I hope there'll come a day
When you say, "Mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm
You're my little girl, mm mm mm"
You're my little girl, oh yeah
You're my little girl

You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you

It's me

What you're doing to me?A bad little kid moved into my neighborhood
He won't do nothing right, just sitting down and looks so good
He don't want to go to school and learn to read and write
Just sits around the house and plays the rock and roll music all night
Well, he put some tacks on teacher's chair
Puts chewing gum in little girl's hair
Now, junior, behave yourself
Buy every rock and roll book on the magazine stand
Every dime that he gets  is lost to the jukebox man
Well he worries his teacher till at night she's ready to poop
From rocking and a-rolling to spinning in a hula hoop
Well this rock and roll has got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
Ooh!
Ooh!
Gonna tell your mama you better do what she said
Get to the barber shop and get that hair cut off your head
Shoot the canary and you fed it to the neighbor's cat
You gave the cocker spaniel a bath in mother's laundromat
Well, in mama's head it's got to stop
Junior's head is hard as rock
Now, junior, behave yourself
We all miss you; You miss them?

Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working, darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong?
Ah, ah, ahStanding in the garden waiting for the sun to shine
Hand me my umbrella when she says she wish she was mine
Everybody does think a thing it didn't come
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Instead of watching rainbows I'm gonna make me some
Standing in the garden waiting for the English sun to come and make me brown so I can be someone
Looking at the bench of next door neighbors
Crying to my mom of diamond tooth sabers
Everybody's got to have something hard to hold
Well instead of watching rainbows under the sun
You gotta get out son and make you one
You gotta get out son and make you one
Because you're not gonna make it if you cry cry cry I know
Shoot big
Shoot big
Whatever you do you gotta kill somebody to get what you wanna get
You gotta shoot big
You gotta shoot big
Until you shoot big

Your powder's never on your face
You're always wearing jeans except on Sunday
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
I kind of like you just the way you are
You don't know the latest dance
But when it's time to make romance
Your kisses let me know you're not a tomboy
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are
I love you when you're happy
I love you when you're blue
I love you when you're mad at me
So, how can I get tired of you?
Now, lots of other girls I've seen
They know how to treat guys mean
But you would rather die than ever hurt me
So, please, don't ever change
Now, don't you ever change
Just promise me you're always going to be
As sweet as you are
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever change
Please, don't ever change
Don't you ever changeTurn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
We were talking
About the space between us all
And the people
Who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth
Then it's far too late
When they pass away
We were talking
About the love we all could share
When we find it
To try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world
If they only knew
Try to realize it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

She eating twelve chapattis and cream
She tastes as Mongolian lamb
She coming from out of Bahran
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She like to be married with Yetti
He grooving such cookie spaghetti
She jumping as Mexican bean
To make that her body morphine
What a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
What a shame Mary Jane what a shame Mary Jane had a pain at the party
She catch Patagonian pancake
With that one and gin party makes
She having always good contact
She making with Apple and contract

And I doSunrise doesn't last all morning
A cloudburst doesn't last all day
Seems my love is up
And has left you with no warning
But it's not always going to be this grey
All things must pass
All things must pass away
Sunset doesn't last all evening
A mind can blow those clouds away
After all this my love is up
And must be leaving
It has not always been this grey
All things must pass
None of life's strings can last
So I must be on my way
And face another day
Now the darkness only stays at nighttime
In the morning it will fade away
Daylight is good
At arriving at the right time
It's not always going to be this grey
 Step inside love and stay
Step inside love
Step inside love
Step inside love
I want you to stay
You look tired, love
Let me turn down the light
Come in out of the cold
Rest your head on my shoulder
And kiss me goodnight
We are together
Now and forever, come my way

Something in her style that shows me

You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know

Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Don't get the breaks like some of us do

Better do it soon, you don't have long
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there
Get out of Sour Milk Sea

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh, boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty
I read the news today, oh boy
Four-thousand holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you on
Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten, eleven, twelve, thirteen, fourteen, fifteen, sixteen, seventeen, eighteen, nineteen, twenty
UmmWords are flowing out like endless rain into a paper cup
They slither wildly as they slip away across the universe
Pools of sorrow, waves of joy are drifting through my opened mind
Possessing and caressing me
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on, across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world
Nothing's going to change my world

There is no reason for you to declare
War on the one that loves you so
So forget the other boys because my love is real
Come off your battlefield
Lay down your arms 
And love me peacefully 
Lay down your arms 
And love me tenderly  yeah 
Use your arms to hold me tight
Baby, I don't want to fight no more 
The weapons you're using are hurting me bad
But someday you're going to see
That my love for you baby, is the truest you've ever had
A Soldier of Love, that's hard to be
Lay down your arms 
And love me peacefully 
Lay down your arms 
And surrender to me  yeah

What's  it the case of, Mr. Martin?
 Take 4 was very good up to the breakdown...
 Which was take 4?
 ...and it was very good until the end bit there when Paul did his bit that wasn't quite right
  My boys are ready to go!
 John?
  Yes? What?
 It is possible without affecting yourselves too much to turn down a little? Apparently there's been a complaint
 From who?
 From somebody outside the building
  What are they doing here at this time of night?
 It's that guy
 What guy?
 The last time, he complained...
 It's his own fault for getting a house in such a lousy district!
 Well, we'll try it once more very loud
And if we don't get it, we'll try it quiet like you might do it the other way
Okay, the loud one, last go
Last chance to be loud!

I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you
How do you do what you do to me?
I'm feeling blue
Wish I knew how you do it to me
But I haven't a clue
You give me a feeling in my heart 
Like an arrow piercing through it
I suppose that you think you're very smart
But won't you tell me how do you do it?
How do you do what you do to me?
I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to you

I wish I knew
If I knew how you do it to me
I'd do it to youIf you've got trouble
Then you got less trouble than me
You say you're worried
You can't be as worried as me 
You're quite contend to be bad
With all the advantage you had over me
Just because you're trouble
Then don't bring your troubles to me
I don't think it's funny
When you ask for money and things
Especially when you're standing there
Wearing diamond and rings 
You think I'm soft in the head
Well try someone softer instead anything
It's not so funny
When you know what money can bring
You better leave me alone
I don't need a thing from you
You better take yourself home
Go and count a ring or two Hoo!

Betty Grable too
 Hello, this is John, speaking with his voice.  We're all very happy to be able to talk to you like this on this little bit of plastic. This record reaches you at the end of a really gear year for us, and it's all due to you. When we made our first record on Parlophone towards the end of 1962, we hoped everybody would like what had already been our type of music for several years already, but we had no idea of all the gear things in store for us. It all happened really when Please Please Me became a number one hit, and after that, well cor' the blimeys, heave the mo'! Our biggest thrill of the year, well, I suppose it must have been topping the bill at the London Palladium and then, only a couple of days later, being invited to take part in The Royal Variety Show
 
 This time last year, we were all dead chuffed because "Love Me Do" got into the top twenty, and we can't believe really that so many things have happened in between already! Just before I pass you over to Paul,  I'd like to say thank you to all the Beatle people who have written to me during the year and everyone who sent gifts and cards for my birthday, which I'm trying to forget, in October.  I'd like to reply personally to everyone, but I just haven't enough pens. In the meantime:
Garry Crimble to you
Garry Mimble to you
Getty Bable, dear Christmas
Happy Birthday me too
 This is Paul here. Everything that John said goes for me too, 'specially the bit about birthday cards and the parcels, 'cause all our homes and offices got stacks of mail last June, ow! Ha! Ha! When it was my birthday. Anyway, we're all dead pleased by the way you've treated us in 1963, and we'll try to do everything we can to please you with the type of songs we write and record next year. Oh yeah, somebody asked us if we still like Jelly Babies. Well! We used to like them, in fact we loved them and said so in one of the papers, you see. Ever since then, we've been getting them in boxes, packets and crates. Anyway, we've gone right off Jelly Babies, you see, but we still like peppermint creams and chocolate drops and dolly mixtures and all that sort of thing
 Yes! Yes! Oh yes!
 Well, lots of people asked us what we enjoy best, you see, concerts and television or recording? We like doing stage shows 'cause it's, you know, it's great to hear an audience enjoying themselves. But the thing we like best, I think so anyway, is going into the recording studio...
 Yes, we enjoy that very kindly!
 ...to make new records, which is what we've been doing all day before we started on this special message. Well, eh, what we like to hear most is one of our songs, you know, taking shape in a recording studio, ah, one of the ones what John and I have written, and then listening to the tapes afterwards to hear how it all worked out, you see. Well, I'm running over my time, and people are telling me to stop and Ringo...
 Stop! Stop! Stop! Stop shouting, those animals!
 ...so I'll finish off now with it wishing everyone Happy Crimble and a Merry New Year and especially all the ones who paid the subscription
 Ja, das wird uns danke schon
Und denn gruss von even
Ja, denn gruss von even schon
Ja, das wird wunderschon, boy
Danke schon
Ja, Ringo!
Hello, Ringo here
As you know I was the last member to join The Beatles. I started to play drums in the group 1962, ha-ha-ha! Have been in a couple of other groups...
Merry, Happy New Year, and folks, Happy Christmas and may, may everything you wish be granted
King Wenceslas:
Well, good King Wenceslas looked out 
On the feast of Stephen 
When the snow was on the ground 
Deep and crisp and even 
Hooray!
Thank you, Ringo! Thank you, Ringo! We'll phone you! 
I'm George Harrison. Nobody else has said anything yet about our fan club secretaries, Ann Collingham and Bettina Rose, not to mention Freda Kelly in Liverpool.  So on behalf of us all, I'd just like to say a great, big thank you to Ann, Bettina and Freda for all the hard work they've done, and we just hope you can go on pleasing you for a long time, 'cause it's gonna, 'cause it to your reaction are to our records that really matters
And I'd just like to say:

She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick soErr... take 1

 we play what we play
Okay Before we hear another song, fellows, there is a few things I'd like to ask you. First of all, do you ever get tired of being Beatles?
 
 We don't think so, really
 You don't ever think that?
 Just occasionally, you get cheesed off with people writing rubbish about you, which you get often
 Yeah, I agree with that. I've had a divorce and half a dozen kids
 Now, what do you, eh--
 
 --well, I mean, doesn't, isn't this a big sort of drag to go around explaining to your wife that you're not divorced and all that sort of things?
 No, she knows I'm not divorced, because I keep seeing her every day, you see
 Yes, a point, but what about the simpler things of life, like, eh"
 Like riding on a bus?
 Yeah, or going to just about any restaurant you--
 Well, yeah, you miss those sort of things
 We go to certain ones
 And we go to ones where the people there are so snobby, they're the type who pretend they don't know us, so we have a good time, because they pretend they don't know us
 Joe's CafAc!
 Yeah, that figures
 Joe's CafAc! Social statement, that, you know
 It is Is that it? Is that the end?
 Yeah, yeah, that's it
 Fade, fade!
 Good track Oh, well, we'll stop there, stop there, stop there
 What an end!
 Quiet! All right, George
 Fade!
 Hold it!
 Oh, thank you
 Fade, you silly
 Well, we did We did that Oh, no! No! We've done that bit!
 The train comes in now
 We did that
 Yeah
 To prove we weren't playing the record, then, you see 'Cause, otherwise, there's no point in you being here, is there? Ha, ha, ha!
 Yeah, we did that, 'cause it sounds just like it, don't it?
 Pretty cool lot of fellows, aren't you? Here, Ringo, have a banana, catch! In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains

15:47 - 15:49
15:49 - 15:53
it was you buzzing.
You naughty boy.
15:53 - 15:55
15:55 - 15:58
 Now for the ring!
15:58 - 16:05
16:05 - 16:08
Ow!
16:08 - 16:10
Oh! Oh, that stings.
16:10 - 16:12
 Kaili!
16:12 - 16:14
Kaili!
16:14 - 16:16
 Flee!
16:16 - 16:19
Will you explain everything
when the opportunity presents itself?
16:19 - 16:36
- Flee!
- OK.
16:36 - 16:50
16:50 - 16:53
Oh, goodness me!
Sex is creeping in.
16:53 - 16:58
Young people see it in the bazaars,
market places, temple...
16:58 - 17:02
No wonder they turn up their noses
at a mystical impulse...
17:02 - 17:07
We're taking up fox hunting so young
people are involved in their sacrifices.
17:07 - 17:12
And will understand the deep
significance of blood well shed.
17:12 - 17:17
Of course I don't expect you to see
eye to eye with me...
17:17 - 17:22
What? Who? Where?
17:22 - 17:49
Now... lf you'll pardon me.
17:49 - 17:52
It's played out, any road?
You know, rings...
17:52 - 17:54
- Very nice.
- It's yours.
17:54 - 17:58
Nah! My missus wouldn't wear a ring
like that. Ostentatious, that is!
17:58 - 18:02
- He's from the west.
- Nah, east. Stepney.
18:02 - 18:06
- Does this ring mean anything to you?
- Freemason?
18:06 - 18:10
- You're all English!
- That's what unions are for.
18:10 - 18:15
I tell a lie. We have got one in there
from the mystic east... Or we did have.
18:15 - 18:17
 Hey, Abdul!
18:17 - 18:20
- Yes.
- We did have one, didn't we?
18:20 - 18:23
That lad from the sunnier climate,
east of Suez?
18:23 - 18:26
Very nice he was, too.
18:26 - 18:39
I think he's still down there,
in the coal hole.
18:39 - 18:42
Doesn't the blood rush to your head, sir?
18:42 - 18:44
Doesn't the eastern flavour
come expensive?
18:44 - 18:47
Doesn't the blood rush to your stomach?
18:47 - 18:49
Is this ring nasty, sir?
18:49 - 18:55
Argh! Kaili! Oh dear, I must lie down.
18:55 - 18:59
Oh! That's better.
18:59 - 19:02
Excuse me...
This menu...
19:02 - 19:23
19:23 - 19:25
I've just seen the most amazing thing...
19:25 - 19:35
 Oh...
19:35 - 19:41
Hey, did you...
19:41 - 19:46
There's a man down there on his head.
19:46 - 19:48
Arthur?
19:48 - 19:51
19:51 - 19:57
Could you pick this up for me, please?
19:57 - 20:02
20:02 - 20:05
20:05 - 20:11
Are you eating, too, Paul?
20:11 - 20:14
Your friend is in mortal danger.
I can say no more.
20:14 - 20:17
20:17 - 20:21
20:21 - 20:24
It's rather a jolly place.
20:24 - 20:27
- Soup, please.
- Soup, yeah.
20:27 - 20:29
He has three hours to live.
20:29 - 20:33
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
20:33 - 20:35
I ordered soup too.
20:35 - 20:48
- Soup!
- Soup.
20:48 - 20:53
Pardon me, sir. That's a very
fascinating ring you've got there.
20:53 - 20:55
- Unless I'm mistaken.
- Is it?
20:55 - 20:59
The dreaded sacred sacrificial
ring of the dread Kaili.
20:59 - 21:00
- Say no more.
- I can say no more.
21:00 - 21:04
Excuse me. if he is to be sacrificed
before Kaili,
21:04 - 21:06
why is he not painted red?
21:06 - 21:14
I've never had the courage to ask him,
but as he's my best friend I will.
21:14 - 21:17
- Whats this? Glasses?
- That's right, sir. Glasses.
21:17 - 21:21
A victim is offered
to the dread Kaili everyday.
21:21 - 21:23
All are happy to go.
21:23 - 21:26
He who wins is privileged to wear
the sacred ring
21:26 - 21:29
from sun to moon,
from moon to sun.
21:29 - 21:33
And at the end of the happy day
he is slaughtered jolly with a knife.
21:33 - 21:38
And sacrificed jolly with a knife,
so I'm told, with that ring.
21:38 - 21:39
Three hours to live.
21:39 - 21:43
-  You have till five o'clock.
- Before a new victim is chosen.
21:43 - 21:46
You are lucky to be chosen!
21:46 - 21:51
My old mum would give her right hand
to be chosen.
21:51 - 21:54
- Whats this?
- A season ticket.
21:54 - 22:00
I like a lot of seasoning in my soup.
22:00 - 22:02
There's somebody been in this soup.
22:02 - 22:06
I got it from this Eastern bird... lady...
in a fan letter.
22:06 - 22:11
I get all sorts.
Rubbish, though, isn't it? Sacrifice.
22:11 - 22:13
No? Come off!
22:13 - 22:17
So, get in touch with your authorities
and send back the ring to this lady,
22:17 - 22:19
who will then go happy to Kaili.
22:19 - 22:22
- Thank you.
-  Three hours.
22:22 - 22:24
There's a footprint in here.
22:24 - 22:28
Here, you have a go.
22:28 - 22:35
 Flee!
22:35 - 22:54
22:54 - 22:57
We have lots of little problems like this.
Some of them matrimonial.
22:57 - 22:59
22:59 - 23:01
This ring is not stone.
23:01 - 23:12
- I've only got three hours to live.
- Therefore, it must be a metal.
23:12 - 23:17
- I don't know this metal.
- You're not getting anywhere, are you?
23:17 - 23:20
Early days yet, sir.
Therefore it must be an alloy.
23:20 - 23:26
There's a certain amount of hurry up
involved here. My life is in danger.
23:26 - 23:28
Three ten.
23:28 - 23:30
- The wheel.
- Not the wheel.
23:30 - 23:34
Even the Royal House of Hanover
had the wheel, sir.
23:34 - 23:46
23:46 - 23:49
- I've never seen anything like it.
- You've failed.
23:49 - 23:53
- I suggest you see a specialist.
- What kind? Your tools are broken.
23:53 - 23:56
The fire brigade once got my head
out of some railings.
23:56 - 24:01
- Did you want them to?
- No. I left it there when not at school.
24:01 - 24:03
You can see a lot of the world
from railings.
24:03 - 24:09
24:09 - 24:12
I like operations,
they give you a sense of outlook.
24:12 - 24:14
This won't work.
24:14 - 24:17
It could work if the government
would spend more money.
24:17 - 24:20
Made in America you see.
24:20 - 24:22
Another failure.
24:22 - 24:25
The idea is...
The idea as I see it
24:25 - 24:29
is that we expand the molecules
and the ring grows bigger and drops off.
24:29 - 24:33
- Whats your electricity bill like?
- It's sort of a long counterfoil.
24:33 - 24:37
It's not dropping off.
24:37 - 24:41
Voltage!
Voltage... up, up...
24:41 - 24:43
Up, up!
24:43 - 24:46
- Are you sure I'm earthed?
- Oh no, hold on. Thank you.
24:46 - 24:50
Made in America.
Streets ahead of anything we've got.
24:50 - 24:52
This is English.
24:52 - 24:55
- Is it green, the earth in America?
- In some places its brown.
24:55 - 24:57
He's not earthed.
24:57 - 25:04
He's an idiot.
Has a degree in woodwork. I ask you!
25:04 - 25:07
Done.
25:07 - 25:10
- 5... 4...
- Come on.
25:10 - 25:15
3-2-1-go! I observe the procedure.
He'll thank me for it in the end.
25:15 - 25:18
Scientist, you're getting nowhere.
25:18 - 25:22
It's the plugs.
Good British plugs.
25:22 - 25:26
All this America rig. Wrong voltage.
That's what foxes me.
25:26 - 25:28
- How do you feel?
- I used to use my hands.
25:28 - 25:32
He used to use his hands.
25:32 - 25:35
- Will he still be able to drum?
- Did he do a lot of it?
25:35 - 25:41
- Voltage... up!
- I'm no mean hand at the old sticks.
25:41 - 25:42
The voltage, up, up, up!
25:42 - 25:48
- Hey, he's calling you. Up, up, up!
- Up, up, up!
25:48 - 25:52
The bunker!
25:52 - 25:59
25:59 - 26:03
- I can't watch.
- It's working! Give it the gun, Algernon.
26:03 - 26:10
26:10 - 26:12
Stop it!
26:12 - 26:14
It's more than my job's worth!
26:14 - 26:17
He's out to rule the world
if he can get a government grant.
26:17 - 26:31
Outrageous!
You're nothing but a mad scientist!
26:31 - 26:33
Fantastic!
26:33 - 26:37
With a ring like that I could,
dare I say it, rule the world.
26:37 - 26:40
I must have the ring...
Algernon, the laser.
26:40 - 26:44
Get your hands off him
or I'll call the Metropolitan scuffers!
26:44 - 26:46
The laser...
26:46 - 26:50
- Get him off.
- I must have this ring. The laser.
26:50 - 26:55
Halt! Release him or I'll shoot
and I am a dead eyeshot shooting.
26:55 - 27:01
- I've got it.
- Switch off that machine.
27:01 - 27:04
- The laser.
- The laser, yes...
27:04 - 27:07
I'm better with animals
than plugs and transistors.
27:07 - 27:10
MIT was after me,
wanted me to rule the world for them.
27:10 - 27:13
Daddy being the local master
of the hounds.
27:13 - 27:16
That's where I get it from,
my love of animals.
27:16 - 27:20
They trust me.
I should have been in vivisection.
27:20 - 27:24
How do you know we can trust her?
She's had your fingers before, Ringo.
27:24 - 27:28
Well, that was a mistake.
I can vouch for her. We're very close.
27:28 - 27:32
- Lasers ready.
- Get them!
27:32 - 27:35
27:35 - 27:38
27:38 - 27:42
It's the wrong plug...
Just give me five minutes.
27:42 - 27:50
It's the brain drain.
His brain's draining.

Now see what you've done
with your filthy Eastern ways.
30:03 - 30:07
No! it is Clang, the High Priest,
who is filthy in his ways.
30:07 - 30:10
 How do we know
you're not sent by him to nick the ring,
30:10 - 30:13
when you've lulled us
with your filthy ways?
30:13 - 30:16
- What filthy ways are these?
- You can put that away.
30:16 - 30:21
Until this moment you were safe
because my sister was chosen
30:21 - 30:24
and no other could be sacrificed
to Kaili.
30:24 - 30:32
Now my sister is safe and rises up.
30:32 - 30:35
30:35 - 30:39
 'And a new day dawns,
a new victim is chosen...'
30:39 - 30:45
From this moment it is death to him
who wears the ring.
30:45 - 30:48
This will make your finger shrink.
Be brave.
30:48 - 30:49
Don't look.
30:49 - 30:55
Alas, if he were brave
this would not be necessary.
30:55 - 31:05
31:05 - 31:08
Where've you been?
You've been up that temple again.
31:08 - 31:21
You're as bad as your sister, coming
home from work at all hours and colours.
31:21 - 31:23
There might be some insurance.
31:23 - 31:26
I wouldn't think of such a thing!
Find out.
31:26 - 31:28
What did you say that stuff is?
31:28 - 31:32
This will just make his finger shrink
a little. It's a minor medical secret.
31:32 - 31:35
I'm sure there's no call for all this.
31:35 - 31:39
I'm allergic to Penicillin
and all them other wonder drugs.
31:39 - 31:42
- Gum?
- Are you sure its not or habit forming?
31:42 - 32:03
No. As long as you don't swallow it.
32:03 - 32:06
 All right.
Synchronise your watches.
32:06 - 32:15
You, you, you and you.
Paint him red and then kill him.

Kaili.
32:17 - 32:20
Kaili. Kaili.
32:20 - 32:25
I promise you
the effect is purely transitory.
32:25 - 32:26
It wears off very quickly.
32:26 - 32:31
 Don't answer it! It's Clang.
32:31 - 32:33
32:33 - 32:37
- Perhaps it won't take...
- This is a dreadful miscarriage.
32:37 - 32:38

 Come on, my finger!
32:41 - 32:43
Where's Paul?
32:43 - 32:48
Where's Paul? Come on, Paul,
stop messing about.
32:48 - 32:50
Where's he gone?
32:50 - 33:13
- Where are you, Paul?
- It's his best suit.
33:13 - 33:19
Don't look right or left. They might take
us for innocent bystanders.

Get me the home office.
He's wrecking my home.

Oh, my goodness gosh!
Withdraw! Withdraw!
35:37 - 35:40
Up!
35:40 - 35:42
Up, up, up!
35:42 - 35:44
- You!
- Which one has the ring?
35:44 - 35:46
That one with the large ned.
35:46 - 35:48
Neb!
And its yours.
35:48 - 35:54
- Keep your hands up.
- How can I get it off with my hands up?
35:54 - 35:56
In the name of science
I demand that ring.
35:56 - 35:57
It's yours!
35:57 - 36:01
- It's worth something.
- A couple of bob, at least.
36:01 - 36:05
Had to do all this myself... Backward
Britain they call us on Wall Street.
36:05 - 36:09
With a ring like that
could I interest the military?
36:09 - 36:11
No, I could not.
36:11 - 36:15
I can't get it off.
36:15 - 36:18
36:18 - 36:20
- Paul?
- Look, what you've done.
36:20 - 36:24
- Hey, is that Paul?
- Algernon, my little black bag.
36:24 - 36:27
I shall have to operate.
36:27 - 36:29
It'll be on the National Health,
won't it?
36:29 - 36:33
- 
- Look!
36:33 - 36:36
Ugh! I'm all sticky. You're all red!
36:36 - 36:39
- We thought that was you.
- No that's not me.
36:39 - 36:43
I'm glad it wore off quickly.
36:43 - 36:46
What are you doing here?
36:46 - 36:51
- 
- Get out!
36:51 - 36:55
British, you see! Useless.
If I had a Luger...
36:55 - 36:59
Their scientists are properly equipped.
Think on it.
36:59 - 37:09
The remedy is in your hands...
you, the voters.
37:09 - 37:15
- Where's Ahme?
- I don't know.
37:15 - 37:23
37:23 - 37:28
(Continues speaking

37:28 - 37:31
- Hai?
- What? Yes... Hai.
37:31 - 37:34
(Continues speaking
in Eastern language)
37:34 - 37:37
I don't understand a word.
I don't speak the language.
37:37 - 37:40
Latin, yes. But this Eastern babble, no.
37:40 - 37:58
Ah, the ring! Come on, we go.

47:09 - 47:12
- Only me and Paul know we're here.
- I know.
47:12 - 47:18
Allow me. I'm a bit of a famous mimic.
You know... James Cagney.
47:18 - 47:21
Hello, this is the famous Ringo,
47:21 - 47:24
what is it that I can do for you?
47:24 - 47:26
Not a bit like Cagney.
47:26 - 47:30
-  'Go to the window.'
- Hey, it is them!
47:30 - 47:32
 'Go to the window.'
47:32 - 47:35
Go to the window.
47:35 - 47:38
Go to the window.
47:38 - 47:41
Go to the window.

the police. We're not all masochists.

48:02 - 48:06
Right, lets get going.
Pass me the phone, will you?

use of that finger, have we?
59:42 - 59:44
- No.
- And again.
59:44 - 59:49
We're risking our lives to preserve
a useless member.
59:49 - 59:51
That bloke with Scott,
59:51 - 59:54
I've always admired the way he went
into the snow for his mates.
59:54 - 59:59
- And again.
- You're joking!
59:59 - 60:11
Just hold this drumstick.
60:11 - 60:14
You've raised it a little bundle
on the quiet.
60:14 - 60:17
- It's like having a tooth out.
- I've got a good hand.
60:17 - 60:20
You only lay out money
is when you've got five aces.
60:20 - 60:23
- Do you want to see me?
- You're joking... take it.
60:23 - 60:25
I will see... I've won it.
60:25 - 60:29
- Cut.
- No!
60:29 - 60:31
I think tea, don't you? Tea.
60:31 - 60:34
They expect me to cut my finger off.
60:34 - 60:36
The famous finger, eh?
60:36 - 60:39
So the police are extended
giving the famous protection,
60:39 - 60:45
for which we are justly proud
in this country, for a finger, eh?
60:45 - 60:48
Whats that... It's haunted, you know.
60:48 - 60:52
- Are you going to cut?
- No, I'm not and let that be an end to it.
60:52 - 60:54
End to it!
60:54 - 61:12
This wing of the palace is haunted.
61:12 - 61:14
We won't leave this palace alive.
61:14 - 61:18
The Queen will have something
to say about that.
61:18 - 61:20
- Whats that?
- I beg your pardon?
61:20 - 61:30
- That thing coming through his stomach.
- I daren't look!
61:30 - 61:36
It's only a hose.
61:36 - 61:39
61:39 - 61:48
- It's for you.
- It's the gardener.
61:48 - 61:53
I'll stick it out the window.
61:53 - 61:56
61:56 - 62:01
 Eyes left.
62:01 - 62:04
62:04 - 62:10
 Eyes front!
62:10 - 62:14
Must be their tea break.
62:14 - 62:17
Hands up!
62:17 - 62:19
Hands up! Quick!
62:19 - 62:22
Come on, lets have you.
62:22 - 62:27
Steady!
62:27 - 62:32
There goes my knighthood.
You, left hand...
62:32 - 62:37
Lets have that ring.
62:37 - 62:52
62:52 - 62:56
It's me, you fool.
62:56 - 63:00
- Quick! Quick!
- Lets catch him!
63:00 - 63:03
This should work,
its from Harvard.
63:03 - 63:08
- It looks like a laser.
- It's a relativity cadenza.
63:08 - 63:10
That should slow them down a bit.
63:10 - 63:14
There, point it down the hall.
Quickly!
63:14 - 63:18
Hurry up with the plug,
I'll align the sights... Yes!
63:18 - 63:20
Right, good.
63:20 - 63:22
I think it is a laser.
63:22 - 63:24
Oh!
63:24 - 63:28
 Oh...
63:28 - 63:43
63:43 - 63:44
A royal fuse has just blown.
63:44 - 63:47
63:47 - 64:04
- it is a rela... teva... camenza...
- Bad machine!
64:04 - 64:05
64:05 - 64:10
Hair dryer, I'll bet
she had one for Christmas.
64:10 - 64:11
64:11 - 64:15
We are going for a friendly walk
with the police down by the river.
64:15 - 64:18
Ooh, look at that.
64:18 - 64:28
- It's a band.
- 
64:28 - 64:31
Paint! Paint!
64:31 - 64:35
 Come on, quickly!
Get them, men. I'm with you.
64:35 - 64:39
After them! After them! Quick!
64:39 - 64:46
Look.
64:46 - 64:49
Oh, lovely pub.
64:49 - 64:59
Two lagers and lime
and two lagers and lime, please.
64:59 - 65:06
- Looks like its me again.
- Everything's relative, you know.
65:06 - 65:09
- Well, you didn't miss your tonsils.
- How do you know?
65:09 - 65:11
Why don't you chop it off, Ringo?
65:11 - 65:15
Look John, I've had some great times
with this finger.
65:15 - 65:17
How do you know I wouldn't miss it?
65:17 - 65:19
You're a rat underneath.
65:19 - 65:22
You can have a fire and theft policy.
Five quid a week.
65:22 - 65:26
It's because you're a Beatle
that your fingers wasn't on it.
65:26 - 65:29
- Is there a cure for nail biting?
-  Oh, yes.
65:29 - 65:32
Oh, yes!
65:32 - 65:47
I'm always getting winked at these days.
It used to be you, Paul.
65:47 - 65:48
Oh, Sorry Ringo.
65:48 - 66:22
Peep boo!
66:22 - 66:28
All the rungs have been neatly sawn
in the middle.
66:28 - 66:30
Ah, the window!
66:30 - 66:35
66:35 - 66:38
- Your famous Ringo is safe.
- No, he isn't.
66:38 - 66:47
What? Cover all exits.
Sharp lookout.
66:47 - 67:02
67:02 - 67:06
67:06 - 67:14
- Don't move.
- You heard what she said.
67:14 - 67:19
Do you know Beethoven's
9th symphony?
67:19 - 67:21
It goes like this...
67:21 - 67:24
67:24 - 67:32
67:32 - 67:37
- What?
- This trap door.
67:37 - 67:40
Oh, here you are...
67:40 - 67:46
Permit me.
67:46 - 67:50
It's Raja, the famous Bengal man-eater
who escaped from the zoo this morning.
67:50 - 67:53
- So it is!
- Don't worry, he's harmless.
67:53 - 67:57
All you have to do is sing Beethoven's
Ode to Joy from the 9th symphony.
67:57 - 68:02
- Why didn't you think of that?
- Raja was reared on the classics.
68:02 - 68:07
 Don't worry, just whistle famous
Beethoven's famous 9th symphony.
68:07 - 68:09
Come on! Come on!
68:09 - 68:11
68:11 - 68:37
68:37 - 68:45
68:45 - 68:57
68:57 - 68:59
Beep, beep!
68:59 - 69:01
Psst!
69:01 - 69:04
-  Who let it out?
- Nobody will know.
69:04 - 69:07
We're not going there.
69:07 - 69:11
- We just put it round we're going there.
- We're not going there.
69:11 - 69:15
- We just put it round.
- So everyone thinks we're going there?
69:15 - 69:17
- I'd like to go there.
- You wouldn't like it.
69:17 - 69:33
- Where are we going?
- Never you mind.
69:33 - 69:42
69:42 - 70:05
- You're welcome.
- Goodbye, sir.
70:05 - 70:43
Him!
70:43 - 70:46
- Welcome to Nassau.
- Thank you very much.
70:46 - 70:50
I'd like to present PC 17...
70:50 - 70:52
- PC 6...
- Very smart.
70:52 - 70:55
- PC 47...
- Uh-huh.
70:55 - 70:58
- PC 6 of 3...
- Oh.
70:58 - 71:00
- PC 9...
- Hmm.
71:00 - 71:03
- PC 85...
- Mmm.
71:03 - 71:05
- PC 4...
- Yes.
71:05 - 71:13
PC 21, PC 85...
71:13 - 71:16
You should have thought of that
before you left the house.
71:16 - 71:20
Left... To shore...

73:38 - 73:43
Oh, oh, oh!
73:43 - 73:47
Radar's broken! Never mind.
73:47 - 73:51
 Beatles! Hello!
73:51 - 73:53
Port... Starboard... Over there!
73:53 - 73:57
Oh, oh, oh!
73:57 - 74:05
Ah! A-ha, a-ha, a-ha!
74:05 - 74:08
Open that rock!
74:08 - 74:10
Whoa, whoa, whoa!
74:10 - 74:13
- Is that it?
- Better watch your fingers, Ringo!
74:13 - 74:17
Clang had the whole temple transported
here for your sacrifice.
74:17 - 74:19
He needn't have bothered.
Very nice of him, though.
74:19 - 74:23
- Whats this?
- This is where you'll be disembowelled.
74:23 - 74:26
You don't go for all that,
do you?
74:26 - 74:28
Keeps you busy, eh?
74:28 - 74:32
- Do you know where Clang is?
- I'm his mother and he's a good boy.
74:32 - 74:33
74:33 - 74:36
I don't want to knock
anyone's religion, but...
74:36 - 74:41
- In here, quick.
-  I can't swim.
74:41 - 74:50
I'm not going!
74:50 - 75:10
Where have they gone?
75:10 - 75:12
- Lets go back and get them!
- I'm game.
75:12 - 75:16
- Lets smash them!
- Lets find that temple.
75:16 - 75:20
- A man's got to do what he's got to do.
- I don't like running away.
75:20 - 75:23
- Lets go back and get them.
- They'll disembowel us.
75:23 - 75:27
- Not if I get the boot in first.
- Lets go back and get them.
75:27 - 75:46
They won't disembowel us, you see.
That's all gab - disembowelling...
75:46 - 75:49
- Signpost.
- Signpost.
75:49 - 75:52
- Guide book.
- Guide book.
75:52 - 75:56
- Feet.
- Feet? Oh, feet!
75:56 - 75:57
Red light.
75:57 - 76:00
Kaili!
76:00 - 76:12
- Green light, go!
-  Kaili!
76:12 - 76:15
The things we have to do
in these heathen countries.
76:15 - 76:29
There must be an easier way
to set a trap!
76:29 - 76:34
- Easterner speaks with forked tongue.
- What does he say?
76:34 - 76:37
Passing this way with hot foot
to the temple.
76:37 - 76:40
Don't encourage him!
You've got the part, Paul.
76:40 - 76:44
- Dare we ask how you know?
- How! I saw those footprints...
76:44 - 76:47
And this guidebook.
76:47 - 77:03
- To the temple.
- 
77:03 - 77:21
After them... slowly!
77:21 - 77:25
- That's not it, is it?
- It's on the map as being here.
77:25 - 77:30
That temple under the rock,
that swimming pool that we came up in...
77:30 - 77:34
- I'm lost!
- This isn't a temple, is it?
77:34 - 77:38
- So this is a famous temple?
- Should be. It's gone.
77:38 - 77:41
I hope that disembowelling thingy
has gone, too.
77:41 - 77:44
- Was there ever a temple here?
- Never, sir.
77:44 - 77:49
Old army place. Well-known
place of retreat for courting couples
77:49 - 77:51
who like the echoes of bugles
as they court.
77:51 - 77:54
That's my theory.
77:54 - 77:56
Ugh!
77:56 - 77:58
- Aren't we going in?
- No, lets not.
77:58 - 78:01
Oh, come on lads,
where's that famous pluck?
78:01 - 78:04
- I haven't got any. Have you, George?
- Did have.
78:04 - 78:08
- I have had.
- I will have.
78:08 - 78:10
He's a bit soft that inspector,
isn't he?
78:10 - 78:12
He never takes his hat off.
78:12 - 78:30
It's very hot over here
for wearing a hat.
78:30 - 78:35
- I'm off.
- Typical!
78:35 - 78:37
 Kaili!
78:37 - 78:39
Argh!
78:39 - 78:44
- Kaili!
- Kaili!
78:44 - 78:46
78:46 - 78:50
The fiends! They've electrified
the wire with high tension. HT.
78:50 - 79:06
The fiends!
79:06 - 79:08
 Help me!
79:08 - 79:10
Help!
79:10 - 79:12
He's mine!
79:12 - 79:15
Help!
79:15 - 79:42
Help me!
79:42 - 79:48
There's one on the back,
but its not the right one.
79:48 - 79:54
Come here, boy! Let me explain.
79:54 - 80:00
This is no time for foolish tricks!
This is a hired car.
80:00 - 80:03
Back up and smash him off.
80:03 - 80:07
 Now, this will get him!
80:07 - 80:11
Oh! Never mind. Try again.
80:11 - 80:17
This should give him a headache.
80:17 - 80:20
Where's he gone?
80:20 - 80:23
- That's done it, he's gone.
- I can't start the car.
80:23 - 80:26
- 
- Hello.
80:26 - 80:31
Oh, hello! Hang on a minute...
80:31 - 80:36
On, on!
80:36 - 80:38
I seem to be having
a slight difficulty.
80:38 - 80:51
To the right! oh...
80:51 - 80:56
- I think it might be the wrong key.
- On!
80:56 - 80:59
On!
80:59 - 81:04
81:04 - 81:20
 Got it.
Didn't take long, did it?
81:20 - 81:28
Thanks for the lift, sailor!
81:28 - 81:31
- Where did the thugs go?
- They've vanished.
81:31 - 81:33
- He's got a plan.
- Avery famous plan.
81:33 - 81:35
Superintendent, you've got a plan.
81:35 - 81:37
- Yes...
- Superintendent.
81:37 - 83:21
I've got a plan.
83:21 - 83:23
 Ringo!
83:23 - 83:25
Ringo!
83:25 - 83:28
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:28 - 83:30
- Ringo!
- Ringo!
83:30 - 83:32
Ringo!
83:32 - 83:34
83:34 - 83:46
Ringo!
83:46 - 83:47
All right, talk!
83:47 - 83:55
We know he's a prisoner,
but where?
83:55 - 83:57
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- Huh?
83:57 - 84:00
- I'm a perfect surgeon.
- He was asked to take it up.
84:00 - 84:03
Alas... Scalpel.
84:03 - 84:12
Sca...
84:12 - 84:15
Sand in the generator.
84:15 - 84:18
It gets everywhere. No wonder
I never get anything done.
84:18 - 84:21
Fix it, Algernon.
84:21 - 84:24
You wouldn't want me to go in
with a blunt scalpel.
84:24 - 84:26
Fix it!
84:26 - 84:30
I'm a decent employer,
but he takes advantage of me.
84:30 - 84:37
- It's the heat, it makes him stroppy.
- Luckily.
84:37 - 84:40
I've got some juice.
84:40 - 84:44
 I can't understand it. They kept
pulling my nose. Mine of all noses!
84:44 - 84:48
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence of orchids.
84:48 - 84:52
Hands up!
84:52 - 84:54
- Whats that?
- Distilled from the essence...
84:54 - 84:59
Not distilled from the essence of orchids
found only in certain recesses?
84:59 - 85:05
At last! I'll have my just reward.
Give it to me! Sir Tberius Foot Juice!
85:05 - 85:08
- But the ring...
- Who needs it now that I have this.
85:08 - 85:11
- Do you know what this is?
- A Webley automatic...
85:11 - 85:15
It's Nobel Prize juice. Set sail for home,
for England! A jewel set in the sea!
85:15 - 85:18
The government in the palm of my hand.
Whats it say?
85:18 - 85:20
- You're going on a sea voyage...
- No, this!
85:20 - 85:24
-  I don't know.
- Haven't you a degree in Eastern?
85:24 - 85:27
-  I don't think so.
- Lets get it translated.
85:27 - 85:33
- Now!
- Right!
85:33 - 85:43
- I can't swim.
- What do you mean you can't swim?
85:43 - 85:46
 Treacherous Woman,
tremble...
85:46 - 85:49
In the name of Preverti,
daughter of the mountains,
85:49 - 85:52
whose embrace with Rani
made the whole world tremble.
85:52 - 85:55
- Wait till my mates get you.
- I don't think so...
85:55 - 86:00
We've had two battalions flown in
specially to ambush your friends.
86:00 - 86:02
They're quite merciless.
86:02 - 86:08
One word of warning from you
and you die instantly.
86:08 - 86:11
Oh, mother Kaili,
86:11 - 86:13
whose name is the Terrible...
86:13 - 86:15
I'm going to miss the sacrifice.
86:15 - 86:18
 ...whose name
is the inaccessible,
86:18 - 86:24
whose name is the Black Mother,

I look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
The problems you sow are the troubles you're reaping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake, we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you
I look at the trouble and pain that is raging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I'm sitting here doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps
Gently weeps
Still my guitar gently weepsFriends come and friends go
As I go round and round
In circles
Love warms and love colds
As I go round and round
In circles
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
And I go round in circles
Life comes and life goes
As we go round and round
In circles
He who knows does not speak
He who speaks does not know
As I go round in circles
Life comes and love goes
As we go round and round
In circlesJohn: My guitar still seems to go in and out like it's--like the lead's wrong
John: I did a freak out one then, one of them where you don't know what you're doing, just a funny

Lovely Rita, meter maid
Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid
May I inquire discreetly
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita, meter maid
Where would I be without you?
Give us a wink and make me think of you
Lovely meter maid
Rita, meter maid
Oh Lovely Rita meter, meter maid

"Make a list and afterwards we'll go to the shop and buy matches and  candles and buns." "There's no more paper to write on, Podgy" "No need to worry, Jasper. You keep saying to yourself 'matches' and I'll keep saying 'candles' until we reach the shop. Then we won't need to write it down. We'll remember." "Who'll remember the buns, Podgy?" "We both will, Jasper ... Matches," "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles." "Matches." "Candles."

They've been going in and out of style
But they're guaranteed to raise a smile
So may I introduce to you
The act you've known for all these years
Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We're Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
We hope you will enjoy the show

It's wonderful to be here
It's certainly a thrill
You're such a lovely audience
We'd like to take you home with us
We'd love to take you home
I don't really want to stop the show
But I thought you might like to know
That the singer's gonna sing a song
And he wants you all to sing along
So let me introduce to you
The one and only Billy Shears
And Sgt. Pepper's Lonely Hearts Club Band
I feel it, I feel it, I feel it, oh baby now

Paul: Don't leave that. I think it'll probably be another day singing it
John: Yeah I just heard it, and that was fine
George: Yeah, and what you could do with the bits where you can't get it 'cause you haven't got enough breath. You just don't...
Paul: You'll just take over, yeah?A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
And you know that your love is all you've got
At times things are so fine, and at times they're not
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot
A friend says that a love is never true
But you know this can't apply to you
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
And when she says she loves you, that means a lot
Love can be deep inside
Love can be suicide
Can't you see you can't hide what you feel
When it's real?
A friend says that your love won't mean a lot
But you know that your love is all you've got
A touch can mean so much when it's all you've got
But when she says she loves you, that means a lot

Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeah
Can't you see, yeahBlue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a dream in my heart 
Without a love of my own
Without a love of my own
Blue moon
You saw me standing alone
Without a love in my heart
Without a dream in my own 
And then I suddenly  for me
The only one I ever wanted to hold
And then you said you'd come and then you'd adore me
Blue moon, you went to turn to gold
Blue moon
You're no longer alone-- Take 2!
When I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave, doo-be-doo
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!The long and winding road
That leads to your door
Will never disappear
I've seen that road before
It always leads me here
Lead me to your door
The wild and windy night
That the rain washed away
Has left a pool of tears
Crying for the day
Why leave me standing here
Let me know the way
Many times I've been alone
And many times I've cried
Anyway you've always known
The many ways I've tried
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't keep me standing here
Lead me to you door
But still they lead me back
To the long, winding road
You left me waiting here
A long, long time ago
Don't leave me standing here
Lead me to your doorThis is the story
About a boy named Ted
If his mother said 
"Ted, be good ," he would 
She told him tales
About his soldier dad
But it made her sad
Then she cried, oh my
Ted used to tell her
He'd be twice as good
And he knew he could
Because in his head he said
"Mummy don't worry
Your mblmblmbl's here
Taking good care of you
Mama don't worry
Your Teddy boy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"
And she said
"Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Taking good care of you"
She said, "Teddy don't worry
Your mummy's here
Teddy's going to see you through"
He said, "Ta da da"
Then came the day
She found herself a man
Teddy turned and ran
Oh far away, oh yeah
He couldn't stand
Just to be around
So he left the town far away, yeah yeah
 
Take your partners

Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream

That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about

Whoa! Ow!: Hello, this is a big "Hi" and a sincere Merry Christmas from yours truly, Ringo Starr.
[slightly sped-up sample of "Ob-La-Di Ob-La-Da" intro,
with piano plunking over it]
: 
Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
Happy Easter, happy autumn.
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
I'd like to wish ev'rybody happy Christmas
This year of 1968 going on 69.

When I get to the bottom
I go back to the top of the slide,
Where I stop and I turn and I go for a ride
Till I get to the bottom and I see you again.
: Wonsaponatime, there were two balloons called
Jock and Yono. They were strictly in love, bound to happen
in a million years. They were together man. Unfortunatimetable, they seemed to have previous experience which
kept calling them one way oranother .
But they battled on against overwhelming oddities,
including some of there beast friends. Being in love,
they cloong together even more man. But some of the
poisonessmonsters of outrated buslodedapethrowers did
stick slightly, and they occasionally had to resort to
the dry cleaners. Luckily this did not kill them and
they weren't banned form the Olympic Games. They lived
hopefully ever after and who could blame them.
: Well, here we are again, another fab Christmas. Christmas
time is here again. Ain't been around since last year.
And we'd like to take this opportunity, all the way from
America, to say happy Christmas to you our faithful,
beloved fans all over the world who have made our life
worth living. And over here I have Mr. Malcolm Evans who
through thick and thin would surely like to say a word
of greeting at this festive occasion.
: Merry Christmas children everywhere!
: At the first stroke, it will be ...
: ... Ringo Starr. Thank you!
"Good evening."
"Hello me dear. I didn't know you were coming."
"I'm not surprised."
"Well, I am! Certainly am!"
"I would have thought so myself."
"Well, if you ask me, I think it's insane."
"Occasionally."
"Yes, me, too. Twice a week sometimes."
"Fourteen and six."
"Nineteen and five to save me if you don't mind."
"Yes, I know."
"Don't you say yes to me! I'm telling you!"
"This is a private line, you know."
"Private line? I've been on this line for two years."
: Well, it's my proud pleasure tonight to introduce one of
the most versatile performers in our career. And he's
come all the way from Stokely Carmichel's -on-Sea.
And I hope you're going to like him. Let's give him a
big hand ... 
: 
Happy New Year, happy Christmas,
Happy Easter, happy autumn,
Happy Michelmas, ev'rybody,
Happy Christmas, ev'rybody to you.
: Once upon a pool table there lived a short-haired
butcher's boy by the way of Ostergrad. It comes in
Sentencesspoolararrowic Airport. Her father was in a
long story cut short in the middle of his life sentence.
We're indebted to the Colloquial office for its immediate
disposal of her honorwitz, including, I might add, hoc virtallo a totem. On the other handbag, I mean to say
l'amoure ne soome tu joure realistic, strictly speaking.
For this film is about an hourglass houseboat. The full
meaning of Winchester Cathedral defies description. Their
loss was our Gainsborough nil.

We have a special guest here this evening, Mr.
Tiny Tim. I'd like to ask him to say a few words.
: Oh, hello to you nice Beatles. Ah, it's so wonderful,
what a thrill it is talking here. Ah, in Mr. Harrison's
presence, Mr. Weiss' presence, and all his nice wonderful
friends. And the thing is, I just wanna say Merry
Christmas to you all. And, ah, a Happy New Year.
: Thank you, Tiny. Would you like to sing us a little song?
: Ah, I'd love to. Here's a song I did in 1966 in front of
Miss Jill for the first time. And I did this in Albert
Hall, and what a thrill it was, ah, to do this then, and
now ... exactly the way I did it then.
He's a, ooh, real nowhere man,
Living in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody.
Hasn't got a point of view,
Knows not where he's going to,
Isn't he a bit like you and me?
Nowhere man,  Don't worry,
Take your time, don't hurry,
Nowhere man, the world's at your command, ooh.
He's a, huh huh, real nowhere man,
Living in his nowhere land,
Making all his nowhere plans for nobody, ooh, ooh.
: Thank you, Tiny. Thank you and God bless you, Tiny.
: God bless you all. Oh, God bless you all. RS2!
You Never Give Me Your Money
You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any job, I got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away

Mean Mr. Mustard
Mean Mister Mustard sleeps in the park
Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
Such a mean old man
Such a mean old man
His sister Pam works in a shop
She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
Only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene
Such a dirty old man
Dirty old man
Her Majesty
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she changes from day to day
I want to tell her that I love her a lot
But I gotta get a bellyful of wine
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
Someday I'm going to make her mine, oh yeah
Someday I'm going to make her mine
Polythene Pam
Well, you should see Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well, you should see her in drag dressed in her polythene bag
Yes, you should see Polythene Pam
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl that makes "The News of the World"
Yes, you could say she was attractively built
Yeah, yeah, yeah
 Great!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
It's real good, that
Real good
Listen to that, Mal
Oh look out! It's-
She Came In Through the Bathroom Window
She came in through the bathroom window
Protected by a silver spoon
But now she sucks her thumb and wanders
By the banks of her own lagoon
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal, but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?
Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me, oh yeah
Golden Slumbers
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Golden slumbers fill your eyes
Smiles await you when you rise
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Once there was a way to get back homeward
Once there was a way to get back home
Sleep pretty darling, do not cry
And I will sing a lullaby
Carry That Weight
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time
Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Boy, you're gonna carry that weight
Carry that weight a long time

Paul: Okay
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
There I will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
Fixing a hole
And that's rightHa ha. Stop!

Hello? Hello
Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Paul: John, sing, uh... sing all those quicker, "Cellophane flowers of yellow and green, yellow and green"
John: Okay
Paul: Anyway
John: YeahWe've been friends for oh so long

Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Can you get it through your head?
That girl is mine
Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Can you get it through your head?

 Whoa, keep your hands off my baby

How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how you were inverted
No one alerted you

No, you did great! YeahLong distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
Because my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge
Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry home drops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, TennesseeOne, two, three
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think, er, no, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about

: Hello, everybody, this is Paul, and I'd just like to thank you all for buying our records during the past year. We know you've been buying 'em because the sales have been very good, you see. Don't know where we'd be without you, really though
: In the army, perhaps
: Oh, we hope you've enjoyed listening to the records as much as we've enjoyed melting them - No, no, no, that's worng. - making them. We're in No. 2 studio at the moment, at EMI, taping this little message for you
: Yes, we are
: We are indeed. I just thought I'd make that... This is the same studio we've used all along - since the old days of "Love Me Do" - many years ago it seems, doesn't it?
: Ah, those were the days ...
: Well, that's about all, I think. Except, to wish you all a Happy Christmas and a very New Year! Now I'll pass you over to John. John!
: John. John speakin'. Thanks all of you who bought me book. Thank you folks for buying it. It was very handy. And there's another one out pretty soon, it says here. Hope you buy that, too. It'll be the usual rubbish but it won't cost much. You see, that's the bargain we're going to strike up. I write them in my spare time, it says here. It's been a busy year...
: Did you write this yourself?
: No! It's somebody's bad handwroter. It's been a busy year Beatle peadles, one way and another. But it's been a great year, too. You fans have seen to that. Page 2. Thanks a lot folks and a hap-py, ah, Christmas and a merry goo-year. Crimble maybe. And I'll hand you to George who will speak to you - now!
: Thank you John. Thank you. Hi there! I'd like to thank all of you for going to see the film. 'spect a lot of you saw it more than once
: I did
: Did you? So did I. Thanks anyway. 'Cause it makes us very pleased, ya know. We had a quiet time making it. Actually, we didn't. We had a great time making it. And we're glad it turned out okay. The next one should be completely different. We start shooting it in February. This time it's gonna be in color
: Green
: It'll be a big laugh we hope.  Well, we ... Big laugh, ha ha ha, yeah, it'll be a big laugh
: Be a big laugh, you imagine?
: And we may see all of you soon. Hope so anyway. All the best. And, happy New Year. And a Happy Christmas. And here's Ringo!
: Thanks, Geroge. Ringo here. Well, the others have thanked you for the discs and John's book and for everything - oh, no - for enjoying the film. I'd like to thank you just for being fans. It's been a funny year, you know. One minute we're in England, next, we're away. 'spect you're wondering where we've been. Well, Beatle people, we've been to Australia and America and New  - who's dropping that? - New Zealand and Australia...
: And New Zealand
: Ha ha! Or is that New Zealand? So much travelling! But you've stayed loyal, haven't you? Anyway, those airport receptions knocked us out, man, great!
: Dig!
: Well, that's about it from me. I'd just like to say, all the best for Christmas and happy new year. That's about it

Thank youTake 1In the night, there are sights to be seen
Stars like jewels on the crown of a Queen
But the only sight I wanna view
Is that wonderful picture of you
On a Streetcar, or in the café
All of the evening, and most of the day
My mind is in a maze what can I do?
I still see that picture of you
It was last summer, I fell in love
My heart told me what to do
I saw you there on the crest of a hill
An' I took a little picture of you
Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you went my heart, my love and my life
I didn't know your name, what could I do?
I only had a picture of you
Then you were gone, like a dream in the night
With you, went my heart, my love and my life

As Sweet Georgia Brown
Crazy feet that dance so neat has Sweet Georgia Brown
Fella’s sigh, and even cry for Sweet Georgia Brown
I tell you just why you know I don’t lie
It’s been said, she knocks them dead in any old town
Since she came right it’s a shame how she brings them down
In Liverpool she even dare to criticize the Beatles’ hair
With their whole fan club standing there, I mean Sweet Georgia Brown
Alright
I say this group is absolutely marvelous with the piano
Don’t you think so?
Not too commercial boys, not too commercial!
When it comes to music Sweet Georgia known to mind
Don’t buy clothes at fashion shows but she still looks fine
Snap chicks cry, they want to die when Georgie does the twist
I never would try to tell you just why use your imagination
There's a DJ crazy for her living in out home town
Since she came like it’s a shame, she turns him down
Records that she can get are records, they ain't sent him yet
Carolina may have Dina, but that don’t have Georgia Brown
Oh such Sweet Georgia
Yeah yeah yeah I mean brown, oh oh oh
Sweet Georgia BrownDeep down in Louisiana
Close to New Orleans
Way back up in the woods
Among the evergreens
There stand a country cabin
Made of clay and wood
Where lives a young country boy
Named Johnny B. Goode
He never learned
To read or write a book so well
But he could play his guitar
Just like a-ringing a bell
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
He used to carry his guitar
In a gunny sack
Sit beneath the trees
By the railroad track
Oh sitting and a-playing
In the shade
Drumming to the rhythm
That the drivers made
People passing by
Used to stop and say
My oh my
That country boy can play
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode!
Well his mama told him
Someday you will be a man
And you will be the leader
Of a big old band
Many people coming
From miles around
To hear you play your music
Till the sun goes down
Maybe some day
Your name will be in light
Saying Johnny B. Goode tonight!
Go go, go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Go Johnny go go go!
Aah Johnny B. Goode! Desmond

Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jewelry store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as/when he gives it to her she begins to sing
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!
Lala how the life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah!

In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones 
Happy ever after in the market place

And in the evening she still sings it with the band

And I can't forget
The spell that I'm in
Can't forget that you told me
So many promising lies
I'm a-trying to forget these
Lonesome tears in my eyes Something, this is take 1
 Are you going? Oh
Something in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
You know I love that woman of mine
And I need her all of the time
Now I'm telling you
That woman, that woman don't make me blue
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You know I believe and howNumber 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number 9, number
Then there's this Welsh Rarebit wearing some brown underpants
About the shortage of grain in Hertfordshire
Everyone of them knew that as time went by
They'd get a little bit older and a little bit slower but
It's all the same thing, in this case manufactured by someone who's always
Umpteen your father's giving it diddly-i-dee
District was leaving, intended to pay for
Number 9, number 9

Who was to know?

I sustained nothing worse than
Also for example
Whatever you're doing
A business deal falls through
I informed him on the third night
When fortune gives
Right! Right!
Right, right, right, right!
Right!
Right!
I've missed all of that
It makes me a few days late
Compared with, like, wow!
And weird stuff like that
Taking our sides sometimes
Floral bark
Rouge doctors have brought this specimen
I have nobody's short-cuts, aha
With the situation
They are standing still
The plan, the telegram
Ooh ooh
Ooh
A man without terrors from beard to false
As the headmaster reported to me
My son he really can try as they do to find function
Tell what he was saying, and his voice was low and his hive high
And his eyes were low
Alright!
So the wife called me and we'd better go to see a surgeon
Or whatever to price it
 yellow underclothes
So, any road, we went to see the dentist instead
Who gave her a pair of teeth which wasn't any good at all
So I said I'd marry, join the bloody navy and went to sea
In my broken chair, my wings are broken and so is my hair
I'm not in the mood for whirling
Um da
Aaah
How?
Dogs for dogging, hands for clapping
Birds for birding and fish for fishing
Them for themming and when for whimming
Only to find the night-watchman
Unaware of his presence in the building
Onion soup
Industrial output
Financial imbalance
Thrusting it between his shoulder blades
The Watusi
The Twist
El dorado
Take this brother, may it serve you well
Maybe it's nothing
Aaah
Maybe it's nothing
What? What? Oh
Maybe even then
Impervious in London
Could be difficult thing
It's quick like rush for peace is
Because it's so much
It was like being naked
If you became nakedHey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?

Rocky Raccoon
Rocky Raccoon
He was a fool unto himself
And he would not swallow his foolish pride
Mind you, coming from a little town in Minnesota
It was not the kind of thing that a young guy did
When a fellow went and stole his chick away from him
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's Bible
Rocky had come, equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems, had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill, and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
And Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
Said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
The doctor walked in sminking of gin  
And proceeded to lie on the table
He's really sminking of gin
And it did him in the end 
Meantime back on the table, yeah
The doctor said, "Rock, you met your match, son"
Rocky said, "it's only a scratch, son
I'll be better soon"
"You better be, better soon," said the doc
Come on son, gotta get hip
Gotta get up
Gotta get back to your gun
Gotta go shoot at, Danny Boy
However, Rocky Raccoon fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out and left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
Da da da da...
That's the story of the Rocky Raccoon
Now Rocky Racoon
Got up from his room and he walked out through the swing doors of the local saloon
Straight into the arms of someone new
Someone who he'd known from a long way back
Maybe from his primary school days
A young friend Rocky recognized
He said, "honey, will you be my new honey-bunch"
She said "Rocky boy, come on, I'll show you why I love you."
"Young Rocky Racoon, I love the way you wear your hat
Love the way you hid your pants, Rocky Raccoon, I dig you"
He said, "missus, I dig you too, come with me" Golden Slumbers, take 1!

Just call on us and we'll send it along
With love from us to you
To you
To you
To youMy tears are falling
'cos you've taken her away
And though it really hurts me so
There something that I got to say:
Take good care of my baby
Please don't ever make her blue
Just tell her that you love her
Make sure you're thinking of her
In everything you say and do
Take good care of my baby
Now don't you ever make her cry
Just let your love surround her
Paint rainbows all around her
Don't let her see the cloudy sky
Once upon a time
That little girl was mine
If I had been true
I know she'd never been with you
So take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Be just as kind as you can be
And if you should discover
That you don't really love her
Just send my baby back home to me
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby
Take good care of my baby The next few minutes, we're in the lap of the gods and the hands of the Beatles In my young days, when I was a lad, they used to have actors in films and now that they--
 Yes?
 Hey! Listen!
 It's all changed, now, Brian They're not doing that, no actors
 It's all changed, now
 But this is what I wonder In those days, the actors used to say their best bits were left on the cutting room floor, did you find that?
 No, no, no, those were the good bits in the film You should have seen the rest
 Yes?
 Rubbish!
 Was it, really?
 Even worse, yes
 Who was worst?
 Oh, Paul
 I see
 I think John was about the worst
 No, it was you
 Oh, Ringo was very good, he was, he's a good lad
 He was. They're saying he's a new Charlie Chaplin Do you think that's right?
 He was miming
 You, too, with Jason
 Oh, yes, he's an old one. Okay, Ring?
 Beginning to look like that Now, then--
 All right, John. Can you hear me?
 Can you hear him? Hello!
 Not really I hope not I hope not!
 We brought you the flowers, Ring
 He's not allowed to talk
 Eh?
 We brought you the flowers
 Oh, good
 And the grapes
 Oh, I like grapes
 He likes grapes
 We've been to Portugal
 Guess who's, guess who's top of the pops in Portugal, then
 Who?

And every day, it sure lets out
I see my baby, I get weak in the knees
'Cause nothin's shakin' but the leaves on the tree
My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
 It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead
 Oh!
 It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella"When I get to the bottom

Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
Woah
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
She has found you, now go and get her
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better, better
Better, better
So let it out and let it in, hey Jude, begin

Shaves in the dark trying to save paper
Sleeps in a hole in the road
Saving up to buy some clothes
Keeps a ten-bob note up his nose
He's such a mean old man

She never stops, she's a go-getter
Takes him out to look at the Queen
It's the only place that he's ever been
Always shouts out something obscene

00:05:11	Come on!
00:05:12	Richard B. Starkey and his Aunt Jessica are always arguing about one thing or another.
00:05:18	Oh, I'm going!
00:05:21	Oh, go! Go on!
00:05:22	And what with today being Sunday and the weather looking up, you'd think they'd have given it a rest.
00:05:27	For goodness' sake, stop sitting down!
00:05:30	All right, all right, what's your hurry?
00:05:32	But no -- on and on they go.
00:05:36	"Good morning," said Richard.
00:05:38	"Good afternoon, sir," said the courier.
00:05:41	They were late.
00:05:41	JESSICA: 'Allo, Flo, you all right, girl?
00:05:42	I'll sit 'ere.
00:05:45	RICHARD: Yes, I'll have the window seat.
00:05:46	JESSICA: All right, so you'll have the window seat!
00:05:52	Good morning, ladies and gentlemen, boys and girls.
00:05:55	Welcome to Magical Mystery Tours!
00:06:00	I am your courier, Jolly Jimmy Johnson!
00:06:03	All my friends call me Jolly Jimmy -- and you are all my friends!
00:06:07	Over here is your hostess -- that lovely, delightful, delectable... Wendy Winters!
00:06:12	Lovely girl, lovely!
00:06:13	And over here, our driver for the trip, that wonderful driver, we hope...
00:06:18	Ha ha ha!
00:06:19	Alf! Off you go, Alf!
00:06:21	Here we go now. Splendid!
00:06:22	Fasten your safety belts, please.
00:06:25	Away-way-way we go!
00:06:28	Away we go, Alf, splendid!
00:06:31	Very comfy in the back there, is it? Lovely.
00:06:33	I say it's lovely. Get your popcorn out!
00:06:37	Ha ha!
00:06:38	Right hand down. There we are, splendid.
00:06:41	And away we go.
00:06:42	Anyway, I'll tell you something, you ain't coming away with me anymore.
00:06:46	Who bought the tickets for this trip? I did!
00:06:48	Yeah, with my money. I gave you the money.
00:06:50	I'm taking you out. You're not taking me anywhere.
00:06:52	I gave you the money, darling. Remember that.
00:06:55	And you've done nothing but eye all the fellas on the coach since we got here.
00:06:59	Shut your cakehole!
00:06:59	I dunno, since Uncle Jack died, you've never been the same.
00:07:03	Of course, 'cause I ain't got Uncle Jack, have I?
00:07:06	I remember him. I remember him.
00:07:07	If I ain't got him, I've got to get somebody else.
00:07:10	You should know, you're old enough at 21!
00:07:13	You should do a bit of knitting, do you good.
00:07:15	Who for? You?
00:07:17	Should I knit for you?
00:07:19	No, don't knit for me.
00:07:23	 Who is that man?
00:07:31	Oh, that's Mr Bloodvessel.
00:07:33	He's quite harmless. He comes on all the trips.
00:07:36	He thinks he's a courier.
00:07:38	Last trip, he thought he was the driver.
00:07:42	PAUL: Well, you know, when I saw your first film, I really thought you had something, but it was -- WOMAN: I was only about 6, then.
00:07:50	PAUL: Wasn't it "Blue Lady"? "Lady in Blue"?
00:07:53	Something like that.
00:07:55	WOMAN: How old are you?
00:07:56	PAUL: I myself am 30...
00:07:57	but I look a little younger due to the Fair Isle sweater.
00:08:01	Excuse me, sir.
00:08:02	I'd like to take a photograph of the young lady, do you mind?
00:08:05	I don't mind if Miss Gabriella doesn't.
00:08:08	Well, Miss Gabriella doesn't mind.
00:08:10	Thank you, bye-bye.
00:08:12	See you later, maybe.
00:08:13	Or we won't see him later. Can I have you out there?

00:12:12	As the bus leaves the town behind and heads for the country, everything begins to change.
00:12:20	Well, almost everything.
00:12:31	And already the magic is beginning to work.

00:31:55	Soon be here.
00:31:57	 The bus, 10 miles away...
00:32:02	Oh, ladies and gentlemen, quickly, look to your left!
00:32:04	Now there you see the ancient Roman ruins.
00:32:08	Now they really have been there an awful long time.
00:32:11	They are, in fact, a little difficult to see because they're almost flattened to the ground...
00:32:16	Meanwhile, back on the bus, things are happening -- and life lobbles on.
00:32:22	Indeed, the magic is so powerful that even Mr Bloodvessel emerges from his shell.

She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
Well it's a little absurd
But she's a nice class of bird
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Say she was attractively built
See Polythene Pam
She's so good-looking but she looks like a man
Well you should see her in drag
Dressed in her polythene bag 
Yes you should see Polythene Pam
See Polythene Pam
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl
That makes the News of the World
Yes you could say she was attractively built
Get a dose of her in jackboots and kilt
She's killer-diller when she's dressed to the hilt
She's the kind of a girl

Ahh
It's too hard, thatGood morning
One, two, three, four
Nothing to do to save his life call his wife in
Nothing to say but what a day, how's your boy been
Nothing to do it's up to you
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home you start to roam then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say, but it's OK
People running round it's five o'clock
Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and meet the wife
Somebody needs to know the time, glad that I'm here
Watching the skirts you start to flirt now you're in gear
Go to a show, you hope she goes
I've got nothing to say, but it's OKMartha my dear
Though I spend my days in conversation
Please, remember me
Martha my love
Don't forget me
Martha my dear
Hold your head up you silly girl
Look what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other
Silly girl
Hold your hand out you silly girl
See what you've done!
When you find yourself in the thick of it
Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Martha my dear
You have always been my inspiration
Please, be good to me
Martha my love
Don't forget me Martha my dear

I want a love that's right
But right is only half of what's wrong
I want a short haired girl
Who sometimes wears it twice as long
Now I'm stepping out this old brown shoe
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now, I'm telling you
You know you pick me up
From where some try to drag me down
And when I see your smile
Replacing every thoughtless frown
Got me escaping from this zoo
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
If I grow up I'll be a singer
Wearing rings on every finger
Not worrying what they or you say
I'll live and love and maybe someday
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I may appear to be imperfect
My love is something you can't reject
I'm changing faster than the weather
If you and me should get together
Who knows, baby, you may comfort me
I want that love of yours
To miss that love is something I'd hate
I'll make an early start
I'm making sure that I'm not late
For your sweet top lip I'm in the queue
Baby, I'm in love with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you
I'm so glad you came here
It won't be the same now when I'm with you

There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishops gate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the bill
Without Henry!

The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round

I love you, Honey PieNow somewhere in the black mining hills of Dakota
There lived a young boy named Rocky Raccoon
And one day his woman ran off with another guy
Hit young Rocky in the eye
Rocky didn't like that
He said, "I’m gonna get that boy"
So one day he walked into town
Booked himself a room in the local saloon
Rocky Raccoon checked into his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
But everyone knew her as Nancy
Now she and her man who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
But Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Now the doctor came in stinking of gin
And proceeded to lie on the table
He said, "Rocky, you met your match"
And Rocky said, "Doc, it's only a scratch
And I’ll be better, I'll be better, Doc, as soon as I am able"
Now Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
C'mon Rocky boy
C'mon Rocky boyTake two

But if you want money for people with minds that hate
Well, all I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You say you'll change the constitution
Well, you know
We'd all love to change your head
You tell me it's the institution
Well, you know
You better free your mind instead
But if you go carrying pictures of chairman Mao
You ain't gonna make it with anyone anyhow
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
You know it's gonna be all right
Don't you know it's gonna be all right
All, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all right
All right, all right, all rightI told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It’s just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
To see how the other half lives
Looking through a glass onion
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here's a place you know just as real
It's just another place you can go
Everything glows
Looking through the bent backed tulips
 half lives
Looking through a glass onion
I told you about Strawberry Fields
Well, here’s a place you know just as real, ooh
It's just another place you can go
Where, everything glows
 bent backed tulips 
 how the other half lives 
Looking through a glass onionThis is the introduction to Ringo's "Don't Pass Me By"
Take 4
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more?
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
Don't make me blue
'Cause you know, darling, I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm waiting for you, honey
Hurry up to me
I don't want you to pass me by
I don't want you to make me cry
I want you to make me happy
Happy, happy
'Cause that's what I want
This is so friendly
This is so friendly
This is so friendly...2, 3, 4
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I don't know what to do
I'm so tired, my mind is set on you
I wonder should I call you but I know what you would do
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
And ya know I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'm so tired, I'm feeling so upset
Although I'm so tired, I'll have another cigarette
And curse Sir Walter Raleigh
He was such a stupid git
No, no, no
I'm so tired, I haven't slept a wink
I'm so tired, my mind is on the blink
I wonder should I get up and fix myself a drink
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
When I hold you in your arms
When you show each one of your charms
I wonder, should I get up
And go to the funny farm
No, no, no
You'd say I'm putting you on
But it's no joke, it's doing me harm
You know I can't sleep, I can't stop my brain
You know it's three weeks, I'm going insane
And I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind 
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind 
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
I'd give you everything I've got
For a little peace of mind
  I've got
For a little peace of mindTake 102

Not guilty
For getting in your way
While you're trying to steal the day
Not guilty
And I'm not here for the rest
I'm not trying to steal your vest
I am not trying to be smart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry for your ageing head
But like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
For being on your street
Getting underneath your feet
Not guilty
No use handing me a writ
While I'm trying to do my bit
I don't expect to take your heart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you're underfed
But like you heard me said
Not guilty
Not guilty
For looking like a freak
Making friends with every Sikh
Not guilty
For leading you astray
On the road to Mandalay
I won't upset the apple cart
I only want what I can get
I'm really sorry that you've been misled
But like you heard me said
Not guiltyGood night, take ten
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun puts out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Close your eyes and I’ll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun puts out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you 
I think I held a funny noteI look at you all, see the love there that's sleeping
While my guitar gently weeps
I look at the floor and I see it needs sweeping
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know why nobody told you
How to unfold your love
I don't know how someone controlled you
They bought and sold you
I look at the world and I notice it's turning
While my guitar gently weeps
With every mistake we must surely be learning
Still my guitar gently weeps
I don't know how you were diverted
You were perverted too
I don't know how
You were inverted
No one alerted you
I look from the wings at the play you are staging
While my guitar gently weeps
As I’m sitting here, doing nothing but aging
Still my guitar gently weeps
[Outro}
Dab the mic on the piano, and quite low, this, just keep it in like, maracas you know. You know those old pianos
Okay we're on. MouthSomething in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around and it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and howHello, Paul! 
Maybe you could turn the level of this mic down a little
Half of what I say is meaningless
But I say it just to reach you
Julia
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, Julia, morning moon, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, sleeping sand, silent cloud, touch me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Her hair of floating sky is shimmering, glimmering
In the sun
Julia, Julia, ocean child, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
Julia, seashell eyes, windy smile, calls me
So I sing a song of love, Julia
When I cannot sing my heart
I can only speak my mind, Julia

I fish by night and day
Unfortunately i live in Bristol
Far far away
And there ain't no fish to be caught
No fish to be caught
There ain't no sea
The council came
Away from me
I'm Pedro the fisherman
With not a fish to fash
I've got a hook on the line
A big mac, a big hat
Some socks, a pair of wellingtons
And a bit of wine
So I'm going to goAs I was slowly passing
An orphan's home one day
I stopped for just a little while
To watch the children play
Alone a boy was standing
And when I asked him why
He turned with eyes that could not see
And he began to cry
I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's child
No mummy's arms to hold me
Or sue me when I cry
'cos sometimes I feel so lonesome
I wish that I could die
I'll walk the streets of heaven
Where all blinds can see
And just like for the other kids
It will be a home for me
I'm nobody's child
I'm nobody's child
Just like the flowers
I'm growing wild
I got no mummy's kisses
I got no daddy's smile
Nobody wants me
I'm nobody's childHave you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You can see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to eat their bacon

Black bird singing in the dead of night
Take these sunken eyes and learn to see

Blackbird fly, blackbird fly
Into the light of the dark black night
You were only waiting for this moment to be free

Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
The king of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Can you take me back where I came from
Can you take me back
Can you take me back where I came from
Brother, can you take me back
Can you take me back
Mm, can you take where I came from
Can you take me backOne, two, three, four
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
He went out tiger hunting with his elephant and gun
In case of accidents he always took his mum
He's the all American bullet-headed saxon mother's son
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce", his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill it would have been us instead of him"
All the children sing
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill
Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill 
Bungalow Bill? 
Hey, Bungalow Bill 
What did you kill Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I’m lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
My mother was of the sky
My father was of the earth
But I am of the universe
And you know what it’s worth
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
The eagle picks my eye
The worm he licks my bones
I feel so suicidal
Just like Dylan's Mr. Jones
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Yes I’m lonely want to die
Yes I’m lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason whyWhy don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
Why don't we do it in the road
No one will be watching us
Why don't we do it in the road

        I listen for your footsteps
Coming up the drive
Listen for your footsteps
But they don't arrive
Waiting for your knock dear
On my old front door
I don't hear it
Does it mean you don't love me any more
I hear the clock a'ticking
On the mantle shelf
See the hands a'moving
But I'm by myself
I wonder where you are tonight
And why I'm by myself
I don't see you
Does it mean you don't love me any more
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cry
I'm sorry that I doubted you
I was so unfair
You were in a car crash
And you lost your hair
You said that you would be late
About an hour or two
I said that's alright I'm waiting here
Just waiting to hear from you
Don't pass me by don't make me cry don't make me blue
Because you know darling I love only you
You'll never know it hurt me so
How I hate to see you go
Don't pass me by
Don't make me cryLet me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone
But it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in
But it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Always know sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know I mean, ah yes
But it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree
Let me take you down
Cause I'm going to strawberry fields
Nothing is real
And nothing to get hung about
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields forever
Strawberry fields foreverI'm gonna search this town
From door to door
Love I crave
I can't find no more
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
You know I hate to see the sun
Sinking to the west
'Cause I know my whole life's
Gonna be one solid mess
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well ever since the day
That she said we were through
I've been nervous
And shook up too
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbye
Well I don't care if the last thing
I ever do in my life
I wanna find that little woman
Make her my wife
I gotta find my baby
I declare that ain't no lie
I ain't had no real good loving
Since that woman said goodbyeFor the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanques'fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
And lastly through a hogshead of real fire
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feats on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring, don't be late
Messers K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry the Horse dances the waltz
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billNot guilty

Only to find Gideon's bible
But Rocky had come equipped with a gun
To shoot off the legs of his rival
His rival it seems had broken his dreams
By stealing the girl of his fancy
Her name was Magill and she called herself Lil
And everyone knew her as Nancy
She and her man, who called himself Dan
Were in the next room at the hoedown
Rocky burst in, and grinning a grin
He said, "Danny boy, this is a showdown"
Now, Daniel was hot, he drew first and shot
And Rocky collapsed in the corner
Rocky Raccoon, he fell back in his room
Only to find Gideon's bible
Gideon checked out, and he left it no doubt
To help with good Rocky's revival
...Two, three, four
One, two, three, four
Two, three, four, yeahGentlemen, hello
I'm just sitting here reminiscing
Wondering who you've been kissing, baby, oh oh baby
I've been wandering all around
There must be a new guy in town
You don't love me anymore
I'll get over you, baby
Although my heart's still sore
You know my heart's still sore
Well, I think of all the lies you told
You're a junk man, my heart you sold
You're a cheater and a mean mistreater
When I think of all the fun we had
Kind of makes me feel so sad
And I'm lonely for your love and as long as I live
It's only you I'll be thinking of
It's you I'm thinking of
It's you I'm thinking ofSexy Sadie what have you done?
You made a fool of everyone

Sexy Sadie ooh what have you done?

Sexy Sadie how did you know

Sexy Sadie oooh how did you know?

She made a fool of everyone
Sexy Sadie
However big you think you are
Sexy SadieBorn a poor young country boy, Mother Nature's son
All day long I'm sitting singing songs for everyone
Sit beside a mountain stream, see her waters rise
Listen to the pretty sound of music as she flies
Find me in my field of grass, Mother Nature's son
Swaying daisies sing a lazy song beneath the sun
Mother Nature's son{Intro}
Haha, oh, ahaha, ahahaha, haha
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
Tuesday afternoon is never ending
Wednesday morning papers didn't come
Thursday night your stockings needed mending
See how they run
{Instrumental: Billy Preston, George Harrison and Eric Clapton}
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet

Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl
But she doesn't have a lot to say
Her Majesty's a pretty nice girl

For the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene!
Over men and horses, hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In this way Mr. K will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring
Don't be late
Messrs. K and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course, Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
La la la la la la la la la la la
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. Kite performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billNow it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me 
Dream sweet dreams for you
Good night, good night, everybody
Everybody everywhere
Good nightOh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
You became a legend of the silver screen
And now you're 
Now honey pie you are driving me frantic
Sail across the Atlantic
To be where you belong
Will the wind that blew her boat away to sea
Kindly send her sailing back to me?
Oh honey pie my position is tragic
Come and show me the magic
Of your Hollywood song
Oh yeah

        Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Cool cherry cream and a nice apple tart
I feel your taste all the time we're apart
Coconut fudge really blows down those blues
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You might not feel it now
But when the pain cuts through
You're going to know and how
The sweat is going to fill your head
When it becomes too much
You're going to shout aloud
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
You know that what you eat you are
But what is sweet now, turns so sour
We all know Ob-La-Di-Bla-Da
But can you show me, where you are?
Creme tangerine and Montelimar
A ginger sling with a pineapple heart
Coffee dessert, yes, you know it's good news
But you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffle
Yes, you'll have to have them all pulled out
After the Savoy truffleHold up
One, two, three, four
If your life's not right, doesn't satisfy you
Don't get the breaks like some of us do
Better work it out, find where you've gone wrong
Better do it soon as you don't have long
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
If you want the most from everything you do
In the shortest time your dreams come true
In no time at all it makes you more aware
Very simple process takes you there
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Looking for release from limitation
There's nothing much without illumination
Can fool around with every different cult
There's only one way brings results
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on there
Get out of Sour Milk Sea
You don't belong there
Get back to where you should be
Find out what's going on thereYeah

Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
In the morning want to die
In the evening want to die
If I ain't dead already

My mother was of the earth
My father was of the sky
But I am of the universe
And that's the reason why:

The worm he eats my bones

Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
Black cloud crossed my mind
Blue mist round my soul
Feel so suicidal
Even hate my rock and roll
Yes I'm lonely want to die
Yes I'm lonely want to die
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why
If I ain't dead already
Ooh girl you know the reason why

Dirty old man

King of Marigold was in the kitchen
Cooking breakfast for the queen
The queen was in the parlour
Playing piano for the children of the king
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The king was in the garden
Picking flowers for a friend who came to play
The queen was in the playroom
Painting pictures for the children's holiday
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
The duchess of Kircaldy always smiling
And arriving late for tea
The duke was having problems
With a message at the local Bird and Bee
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
At twelve o'clock a meeting round the table
For a seance in the dark
With voices out of nowhere
Put on specially by the children for a lark
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby cry
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh
She's old enough to know better
So cry baby
Cry baby cry
Make your mother sigh

No one I think is in my tree
I mean it must be high or low
That is you can't, you know, tune in, but it's all right
That is I think it's not too bad
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
{Verse 2: Take 1]
Living is easy with eyes closed
Misunderstanding all you see
It's getting hard to be someone, but it all works out
It doesn't matter much to me
Let me take you down, 'cause I'm going to
Strawberry Fields
Nothing is real, and nothing to get hung about
Strawberry Fields forever
Always, no, sometimes think it's me
But you know I know when it's a dream
I think I know, I mean, er, yes, but it's all wrong
That is I think I disagree

Desmond has a barrow in the market place
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, "Girl, I like your face"
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And when he gives it to her, she begins to sing
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on
In a couple of years they have built a home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Ob-la-di, ob-la-da, life goes on, brah
La-la how their life goes on

The man with the foolish grin is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him, they can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Well on the way, head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
{Instrumental bridge}
And nobody seems to like him, they can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Round and round and round and round and round
And he never listens to them, he knows that they're the fools
They don't like him
The fool on the hill sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head see the world spinning around

Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
You say you got a real solution
Well, you know
We'd all love to see the plan
You ask me for a contribution
Well, you know
We're all doing what we can
But if you want money for people with minds that hate
All I can tell you is, brother, you have to wait
Don't you know it's gonna be
Alright
Alright
Alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright
Alright, alright!
Hey!The group's ninth album in the UK was called simply The Beatles but quickly became better known as 'The White Album'. The double-LP was issued on the fifth anniversary of the release of their second album With The Beatles - 22nd November, 1968.
The Beatles released 34 new tracks in 1968 - returning to the high level of productivity they had maintained from 1963 to 1965. The first music of the year came in March with the arrival of their seventeenth single 'Lady Madonna'. Soon after it was recorded, the Beatles flew to Rishikesh, India for several weeks of mediation with Maharishi Mahesh Yogi and they enjoyed a prolific period of song writing at this remote location. They began recording these new songs at Abbey Road on 30th May and studio work occupied most of their time until the final session on 16th October. Two songs from this period were released as a single on 30th August, 1968 - 'Hey Jude' and 'Revolution'. It was the first Beatles record to be pressed with the Apple label and the Parlophone imprint was also replaced for the two LP discs comprising The Beatles.
Any expectations of a cover to rival the vivid art work of Sgt. Pepper of Magical Mystery tour were immediately overturned. The outside of the sleeve was completely white was the only lettering consisting of 'The Beatles' embossed on the front and also printed on the spine with the catalogue number. Early copies also had an individual number stamped on the front. However, in contrast to the minimalistic look, some generous inserts were slipped alongside the records. There were four glossy color photographs of the individual Beatles and a large fold out poster displaying a photo collage on one side and lyrics on the other.
Despite being an expensive double album, The Beatles was a huge seller. It entered the UK chart at number one and remained there for a total of eight of the 22 weeks it was listed. In the USA, it topped the charts of nine weeks and stayed in the album chart for an initial run of 65 weeks. As with Sgt. Pepper, no singles were released from 'The White Album' in the UK and USA during the sixties.
Amid the sessions for The Beatles, the animated film Yellow Submarine was given it's UK premier on 17th July. The soundtrack LP featured four new Beatles songs and was in the shops eight weeks after the release of The Beatles. Good Night, take 22
 Are you picking up too much of us, or is it all right?

Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Close your eyes and I'll close mine
Good night, sleep tight
Now the moon begins to shine
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Mmmmmm, mmmmmm
Mmmmmmmmmm
Now it's time to say good night
Good night, sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night, sleep tight
Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you

        On the road to Rishikesh
I was dreaming more or less
And the dream I had was true
Yes the dream I had was true
I'm just a child of nature
I don’t need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature’s children
Sunlight shining in my eyes
As I face the desert skies
And my thoughts return to home
Yes my thoughts return to home
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I'm just a child of nature
I'm one of nature's children
Underneath the mountain ranges
Where the wind never changes
Touch the windows of my soul
Touch the windows of my soul
I'm just a child of nature
I don't need much to set me free
I’m just a child of nature
I’m one of nature's childrenTo complete the many songs needed for their double-LP, The Beatles recorded regularly during twenty weeks from 30th May to 16th October 1968. The final studio date was a 24-hour marathon session to create the running order for the four sides of the album and the edits and cross-fades between the songs. The sessions mark an important turning point in their recording career because it was during this period that The Beatles first recorded on an eight-track tape machine.
Since 1964, the group had used four-track for all their album albums by but 1966, they found their musical arrangements usually required more tracks than were available. The solution was the create extra ones by copying the first four tracks to a second blank tape and simultaneously mixing some of them together to leave free as many racks as were needed for addition overdubs. 'Bouncing Down' was a time consuming process because the tracks that were being mixed together would form part of the final sound balance of the completed song so it was important to be satisfied with the mix before overdubbing commenced. With eight tracks now available, the problem was eliminated - until even more were needed.
Work began on the album using four tracks and, while some songs could be confined to these, most had to be 'bounced down' to a second, third, or even - as with 'Revolution 1' and 'Ob-LA-Di, Ob-La-Da' - a fourth tape. The Beatles' first experience of using an eight track recording at Abbey Road was during a session on 3rd September for 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps'. As it had been started  on four-track. the master was transferred to an eight-track machine to allow further overdubbing.
However, 'While My Guitar Gently Weeps' was re-recorded on eight-track from scratch two days later with a guest appearance by Eric Clapton. and completed on 6th September with several overdubs. George's decision to ask a friend to play on his song was a significant one. Although The Beatles had previously used other musicians on their sessions, they had been from other areas of music such as classical, jazz or Indian music. For the first time, here was a star musician performing on an instrument already featured in the group.
The album's long sessions would often begin in the afternoon and continue until daybreak the next morning. There were also occastions when two songs were recorded at the same time in separate studios. In July, engineer Geoff Emerick left the sessions and did not work with the group again until nearly a year later the Abbey Road. Ken Scott, who has first sat at the mixing desk for some of the Magical Mystery Tour songs, recored and mixed two thirds of 'The White Album'. For one week, George Matin relinquished his seat in the room so that he could take a holiday and, consequently, his 21-year old production assistant Chris Thomas supervised sessions.Hell yeah!

        I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
{Drum Solo}
Great!
Oh!
Great!
Great that!
Beautiful!
Sensational!
Fab!
Isn't that great?
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you

Sunday's on the phone to Monday
Tuesday's on the phone to me
She said she'd always been a dancer
She worked at fifteen clubs a day
And though she thought I knew the answer
Well, I knew what I could not say
And so I quit the police department
And got myself a steady job
And though she tried her best to help me
She could steal but she could not rob
Didn't anybody tell her?
Didn't anybody see?

        [Intro}
Sugarplum fairy, sugarplum fairy
I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
{Chord]
Ahhhhaaaaahhhhaaaahhhhhhahhhhhhhh
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you onAh, because the world is round it turns me on
Because the world is round
Ah, because the wind is high it blows my mind
Because the wind is high
{Chorus}
Ah, love is old, love is new
Love is all, love is you
Because the sky is blue, it makes me cry
Because the sky is blue
Ahh-ah-ah-ahhhhOne, two, three, fourI said I love a girl and Ruby is her name
This girl don't love me, but I love her just the same
Oh, oh, Ruby, Ruby, how I want ya
Like a ghost I'm gonna haunt ya
Ruby, Ruby, Ruby, will you be mine sometime?
Well, each time I see you waving my heart cries
I'll tell ya, I'm gonna steal you away from all those guys

Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds

See how they run like pigs from a gun, see how they fly
I'm crying
Sitting on a cornflake, waiting for the van to come
Corporation tee-shirt, stupid bloody Tuesday
Man, you’ve been a naughty boy, you let your face grow long
I am the egg man, they are the egg men

Pretty little policemen in a row
See how they fly like Lucy in the Sky, see how they run

Dripping from a dead dog's eye
Crabalocker fishwife, pornographic priestess
Boy, you've been a naughty girl, you let your knickers down

I am the walrus, goo goo g'joob
Sitting in an English garden waiting for the sun
If the sun don't come, you get a tan
From standing in the English rain

He's the all American, bullet-headed, saxon mother's son
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?
Deep in the jungle, where the mighty tiger lies
Bill and his elephants were taken by surprise
So Captain Marvel zapped him right between the eyes
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
The children asked him if to kill was not a sin
"Not when he looked so fierce," his mummy butted in
"If looks could kill, it would have been us instead of him"
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
Was it a thrill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey, Bungalow Bill
What did you kill, Bungalow Bill?
Hey!
Bungalow, bungalow, bungalow Bill
Can you pass that ash tray? Take three

Yeah. Are you.. is Yoko picking up on that bit?Well

        Is there anybody going to listen to my story
All about the girl who came to stay?
She's the kind of girl you want so much, it makes you sorry
Still, you don't regret a single day
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
When I think of all the times I've tried so hard to leave her
She will turn to me and start to cry
And she promises the Earth to me and I believe her
After all this time I don't know why
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
She's the kind of girl who puts you down 
When friends are there, you feel a fool 
When you say she's looking good 
She acts as if it's understood 
She's cool, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Girl
Girl, girl
Was she told when she was young that pain would lead to pleasure?
Did she understand it when they said
That a man must break his back to earn his day of leisure?
Will she still believe it when he's dead?
Ah, girl
Girl, girl
Ah, girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, Girl
Girl, GirlDay after day alone on the hill
The man with the foolish grin
Is keeping perfectly still
But nobody wants to know him
They can see that he's just a fool
And he never gives an answer
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Well on the way, his head in a cloud
The man of a thousand voices
Is talking perfectly loud
But nobody ever hears him
Or the sound he appears to make
And he never seems to notice
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And nobody seems to like him
They can tell what he wants to do
And he never shows his feelings
But the fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
And he never listen to them
He knows that they're the fools
But they don't like him
The fool on the hill
Sees the sun going down
And the eyes in his head
See the world spinning round
Oh, round, round, round, round, round
OhOh, well, I'm sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, sittin' here, la, la
Waiting for my ya ya
Uh huh, uh huh
It may sound funny
But I don't believe she's comin'
Uh huh, uh huh
Baby, honey, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
Er, baby, honey, er, don't leave me worried
Uh huh, uh huh
You know that I love you
Oh, how I love you
Uh huh, uh huhYou know you make me want to

Shout! Shout! Shout! Shout!This is the fourth by the four. 'Please, Please Me', 'With The Beatles', 'Hard Day's Night'. That's three. Now...'Beatles For Sale'.
The young men themselves aren't for sale. Money, noisy though it is, doesn't talk that loud. But you can buy this album - you probably have, unless you're just browsing, in which case don't leave any dirty fingerprints on the sleeve!
It isn't all currency or current though. There's priceless history between the covers. None of us is getting any younger. When, in a generation or so, a radio-active, cigar-smoking child, picnicking on Saturn, asks you what The Beatles affair was all about - ;Did you actually know them?'- don't try to explain all about the long hair and the screams! Just play the child a few tracks from this album and he'll probably understand what it is all about. The kids of AD 2000 will draw from this music much the sam sense of well being and warmth we do today.
For the magic of The Beatles is, I suspect, timeless and ageless. It has broken all frontiers and barriers. It has cut through differences of race, age, and class. It is adored by the world.
This album has some lovely samples of Beatles music. It has, for instance, eight new titles wrought by the incomparable John Lennon and Paul Mccartney, and mingling with the new, there are six numbers culled from the rhythmic wealth of the past extraordinary decade; pieces like Kansas City, and Rock and Roll Music. Marvelous.
Many hours and hard day's nights of devoted industry went into the production of this album. It isn't a potboiling quick-sale any-old-thing-will-do-for-christmas mixture.
At least three of the Lennon-Mccartney songs were seriously considered as single releases until John popped up with I Feel Fine. These three were Eight Days A Week, No Reply and I'm A Loser. Each would have topped the charts, but as it is they are an adornment to this LP, and a lesson to other artists. As on other albums, The Beatles have tossed in far more value than the market usually demands.
There are few gimmicks or recording tricks, though for effect, The Beatles and their recording manager George Martin have slipped in some novelties. Like Paul on Hammond organ to introduce drama into Mr. Moonlight, which also, and for the first time, has George Harrison applying a thump to an elderly African drum because Ringo was busy elsewhere in the studio, playing bongos. George's thump remains on the track. The bongos were later dropped. Ringo plays timpani in Every Little Thing, and on the Rock and Roll Music track George Martin joins John and Paul on one piano. On Words of Love, Ringo plays a packing case.
Beyond this, it is a straightforward 1964 disc-making. Quite the best of it's kind in the world. There is little or nothing on the album that cannot be reproduced on stage, which is, as students and critics of pop-music know, not always the case.
Here it is then. The best album yet-quite definitely, says John, Paul, George, and Ringo-full of everything which made the four the biggest attraction the world has ever known. Full of raw John and Melodic Paul; a number from George, and a bonus from Ringo. For those who like to know who does exactly what, there are details alongside each title.Hey Jude, don't make it bad
Take a sad song and make it better
Remember to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it better
Hey Jude, don't be afraid
You were made to go out and get her
The minute you let her under your skin
Then you begin to make it better
And anytime you feel the pain, hey Jude, refrain
Don't carry the world upon your shoulders
For well you know that it's a fool who plays it cool
By making his world a little colder
Na na na na na na na na na na
Hey Jude, don't let me down
You have found her, now go and get her
Remember  to let her into your heart
Then you can start to make it
Better better better better better better, oh
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude
Naa na na na na na na, na na na na, hey Jude
Naa na na na na na na,  na na na na, hey Jude

         I need somebody
 Not just anybody
 You know I need someone
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me?

Help yourself to a bit of what is all around you
Silly girl
Take a good look around you
Take a good look, you're bound to see
That you and me were meant to be for each other

Martha, my love
Don't forget me
Martha, my dearJoan was quizzical; studied pataphysical science in the home
Late nights all alone with a test tube, oh, oh, oh, oh
Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 times "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Do-do-do-do
P. C. 31 said, "We caught a dirty one.", Maxwell stands alone
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
Rose and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
The judge does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure he was dead
Whoa, whoa, whoa
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo
Silver hammer manToo bad about sorrows
Too bad about love
There'll be no tomorrow
For all of your love
You said you were sleeping
But I can't forget
The troubles you're leaving
Don't be like thatWell, shake it up‚ baby‚ now 
Twist and shout 
C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon‚ baby, now 
Come on and work it on out 
Well, work it on out 
You know you look so good 
You know you got me goin'‚ now 
Just like I knew you would 
Well, shake it up, baby, now 
Twist and shout 
C'mon c'mon, c'mon, c'mon, baby, now 
Come on and work it on out 
You know you twist your little girl 
You know you twist so fine 
Come on and twist a little closer, now 
And let me know that you're mine 
Baby, now 
Twist and shout

        Since we kissed I never knew the thrills I could have tasted
Since we kissed I never knew the years that I was wasting
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life?
Oh don't you know that until we touched I never knew the touch was of revealing
Until we touched I never knew my heart was really beating
But now I know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Now don't you know I was waiting
For you to come by, I was waiting girl, won't you please tell me why it took so long to begin
Darling where have you been all my life
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was feeling blue
Where have you been, where you've been, where you've been, when I was needing you
Oh where you've been, where you've been
Where you've been
Darling where have you been all my lifeOh yeah, I'll tell you something
I think you'll understand
When I'll say that something
I want to hold your hand

And when I touch you I feel happy inside
It's such a feeling that my love
I can't hide

When I feel that something
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your hand
I want to hold your handI’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
He’d let us in, knows where we’ve been
In his octopus’s garden in the shade
I’d ask my friends to come and see
An octopus’s garden with me
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would be warm below the storm
In our little hide-a-way beneath the waves
Resting our head on the sea bed
In an octopus’s garden near a cave
We would sing and dance around
Because we know we can’t be found
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden in the shade
We would shout and swim about
The coral that lies beneath the waves
Oh what joy for every girl and boy
Knowing they’re happy and they’re safe
We would be so happy, you and me
No-one there to tell us what to do
I’d like to be under the sea
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with you
In an octopus’s garden with youAsked a girl what she wanted to be
She said baby, can't you see
I wanna be famous, a star on the screen
But you can do something in between
Baby, you can drive my car
Yes, I'm gonna be a star
Baby, you can drive my car
And maybe I'll love you
Beep beep'm beep beep yeah!
Aaaahhhh!
Look what you're doing, I'm feeling blue and lonely
Would it be too much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
You got me running, and there's no fun in it
Why should it be so much to ask of you
What you're doing to me?
It's so fine, It's sunshine
It's the word, love
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!
Beep beep'm beep beep, yeah!Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?

        Rodney Burke: I've got one card here and it's on the same subject, eh, but this one says, "We think the show is great and we dig the Beatles the most, but we still haven't heard a word from Ringo yet."
Ringo: Arf! Arf! Arf! Arf!
Rodney: "And how about him singing?" Well, what will you sing for us, Ringo? Will you say a few words?
Ringo: Hello, there, kiddies. I'd like to sing a song for you today called "Matchbox." There you go
Rodney: Set fire to that lot. Okay, Ringo, thanks very much
Ringo: Don't you et smart with me, you know
Rodney: Do you mind? Get over to your microphone, "Matchbox."You never give me your money
You only give me your funny paper
And in the middle of negotiations
You break down
I never give you my number
I only give you my situation
And in the middle of investigation
I break down
Out of college, money spent
See no future, pay no rent
All the money's gone, nowhere to go
Any jobber got the sack
Monday morning, turning back
Yellow lorry slow, nowhere to go
But oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Oh, that magic feeling, nowhere to go
Nowhere to go
One sweet dream
Pick up the bags and get in the limousine
Soon we'll be away from here
Step on the gas and wipe that tear away
One sweet dream came true today
Came true today
Came true today
Yes, it did
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to Heaven
1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 6, 7
All good children go to HeavenWell, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues 
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two 
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Dig to these rhythm and bluesAaahh
Aaahh
Aaahh
Ah, Look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby
Picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window
Wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie
Writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working
Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Ah, look at all the lonely people!
Eleanor Rigby
Died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came
Father McKenzie
Wiping the dirt from his hands as he walks from the grave
No one was saved
All the lonely people 
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people 
Where do they all belong?
Aaahhh

It is not dying, it is not dying
We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realize it’s all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you

That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way

True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way heyI forgot to remember to forget her
I can't seem to get her off my mind
I thought I'd never miss her
But I've found out somehow
I think about her almost all the time
 
Well the day she went away
I made myself a promise
That I'd soon forget we'd ever met
But something sure is wrong
Because I'm so blue and lonely
I forgot to remember to forgetIt's okay to leave a dog in a hot car
I was thinking that I had it good
Beat my wife like I knew I should
Suddenly a spanner jams the cogs
She went and bought the family a dog
I was supposed to take him to the vet
I'll lock him in the car and watch him sweat
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
It's ok to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you leave the window closed
You'll always know
That nothing bad can possibly happen
The doors locked tight
And he's out of sight
So go and leave your dog in the car
Today's only 35 degrees
So leave the mutt in the limousine
Roll the windows up so he stays warm
A little sunlight nеver caused no harm
Just make surе there isn't any doubt
The last thing that I need's him getting out
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
It's okay to leave your dog in a hot car
As long as you tell the passers by
He'll be alright
Then nothing bad can possibly happen
Now it's all over
For dear old rover
So go and leave your dog in the car
Mr. Willy and his big fat hands
Are gonna slap your mummy's glands
Until the cows come home
And all the girls and boys
Who don't like any noise
Are gonna send the word by phone
Everything's the same
But they don't know who to blame
When their life's a custard pie
And everybody in it's
Gotta get a sharper wit

YeahDesmond has a barrow in the marketplace
Molly is the singer in a band
Desmond says to Molly, girl, I like your face
And Molly says this as she takes him by the hand
Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Desmond takes a trolley to the jeweler's store
Buys a twenty carat golden ring
Takes it back to Molly waiting at the door
And as he gives it to her she begins to sing
Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place
Desmond lets the children lend a hand
Molly stays at home and does her pretty face
And in the evening she still sings it with the band
Ob la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
In a couple of years they have built
A home sweet home
With a couple of kids running in the yard
Of Desmond and Molly Jones
Happy ever after in the market place

Ob-la di, ob-la-da, life goes on, bra
La-la, how the life goes on
And if you want some fun, sing ob-la-di, bla-daSomething in the way she moves
Attracts me like no other lover
Something in the way she woos me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
Somewhere in her smile she knows
That I don't need no other lover
Something in her style that shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how
You're asking me will my love grow
I don't know, I don't know
You stick around, now it may show
I don't know, I don't know
Something in the way she knows
And all I have to do is think of her
Something in the things she shows me
I don't want to leave her now
You know I believe and how

Well I've got to learn to dance

And you can thank her, ma'am
Well every time you're going to drive
You find the joint is jammed

Hold tight, tap your foot

Because they play so loud
While the music will treat you
When they get a crowd
Well you can dance
I know you will, you thought

Steal your heart away

The leaves of brown
Came tumbling down
Remember in September in the rain
The sun went out
Just like a light
Remember in September in the rain

Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain
To every word
Of love I heard you whisper
The raindrops seems
To play a sweet refrain
Thought it's spring
To me it's still September
Oh that September in the rain

And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery

I'm bound to give my heart away
When I do
It's for you love, true love
Seems to be all I'm thinking of
But it's true
It's for you
They said that love was a lie
Told me that I
Never should try to find
Somebody who'd be kind
Kind to only me
So I just tell them they're right
Who wants a fight
Tell them I quite agree
Nobody'd love me
Then I look at you
And love comes love shows
I give my heart and no one knows
That I do
It's for you
It's for you
It's for youIf you ever leave me, I'll be sad and blue
Don't you ever leave me, I'm so in love with you
The birds in the sky would be sad and lonely
If they knew that I lost my one and only
They'd be sad if you're bad to me
The leaves on the trees would be softly sighing
If they heard from the breeze that you left me crying
They'd be sad, don't be bad to me
But I know you won't leave me 'cos you told me so
And I've no intention of letting you go
Just as long as you let me know, you won't be bad to me
So the birds in the sky won't be sad and lonely
'Cos they know I got my one and only
They'll be glad you're not bad to me
They'll be glad you're not bad to me, to me, to meLast night, I said these words to my girl

My papi told me there'd be times like these
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
We meet the gang and go to rockin' Joe's
The cats are something on the heels and toes
I grab my baby, tried to give her a squeeze
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
Well why must she be such a dog-gone tease?
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool
I'm beggin' for her kisses on a bended knee
Oh, won't you give me some-a lovin', baby
Please, please, please
Though I keep trying hard to make her mine
One day the wind will blow, the sun will shine
Till that time, she puts my heart at ease
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees
She locked my heart and threw away the keys
There's nothin' shakin' but the leaves on the trees, yeah
She's got a way that makes me act like a fool
Spent my money, then she plays me cool

Let's do a  now
Much  from a Scottish lady
Let's do a taste of honey
A taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine

I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey!

Or should I say she once had me
She showed me her room
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?
She asked me to stay
And she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around
And I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on a rug biding my time
Drinking her wine
We talked until two and then she said
"It's time for bed"
She told me she worked
In the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't
And crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke I was alone
This bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good Norwegian wood?She loves you, yeah, yeah, yeah

Everybody seems to think I'm lazy
I don't mind, I think they're crazy
Running everywhere at such a speed
Till they find there's no need 
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
Lying there and staring at the ceiling
Waiting for a sleepy feeling
Please, don't spoil my day, I'm miles away
And after all, I'm only sleeping
Keeping an eye on the world going by my window
Taking my time
When I wake up early in the morning
Lift my head, I'm still yawning
When I'm in the middle of a dream
Stay in bed, float up stream
Please, don't wake me, no, don't shake me
Leave me where I am, I'm only sleepingYesterday
All my troubles seemed so far away

I didn't know what I would find there
Another road where maybe I
Could see another kind of mind there
Ooh, then I suddenly see you 
Ooh, did I tell you I need you
Every single day of my life?
You didn't run, you didn't lie
You knew I wanted just to hold you 
And had you gone, you knew in time
We'd meet again, for I had told you 
Ooh, you were meant to be near me 
Ooh, and I want you to hear me
Say we'll be together every day
Got to get you into my life
Somehow, some way
What can I do, what can I be?
When I'm with you I want to stay there 
If I'm true, I'll never leave
And if I do, I know the way there 
Ooh, then I suddenly see you 
Ooh, did I tell you I need you 
Every single day of my life
Got to get you into my life

Feeling two-foot small
Everywhere people stare
Each and every day
I can see them laugh at me
And I hear them say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
How can I even try
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find a way
Gather round all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you've got to hide your love away
Hey, you've got to hide your love awayLet me take you down, 'cause I'm going to

Have you seen the little piggies
Crawling in the dirt
And for all the little piggies
Life is getting worse
Always having dirt to play around in
Have you seen the bigger piggies
In their starched white shirts
You will find the bigger piggies
Stirring up the dirt
Always have clean shirts to play around in
In their sties with all their backing
They don't care what goes on around
In their eyes there's something lacking
What they need's a damn good whacking
Everywhere there's lots of piggies
Living piggy lives
You will see them out for dinner
With their piggy wives
Clutching forks and knives to cut their pork chopsShe wrote me only one sad night
Told me she's no longer mine

Your voice is soothing, but the words aren't clear
You don't sound different, I've learned the game

Maxwell Edison, majoring in medicine calls her on the phone
"Can I take you out to the pictures, Joa-oa-oa-oan?"
But as she's getting ready to go, a knock comes on the door
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Back in school again Maxwell plays the fool again
Teacher gets annoyed
Wishing to avoid an unpleasant sce-e-e-ene
She tells Max to stay when the class has gone away
So he waits behind
Writing 50 lines "I must not be so, o, o, o"
But when she turns her back on the boy, he creeps up from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon her head
Klang! Klang! Maxwell's silver hammer made sure that she was dead
Painting testimonial pictures, oh, oh, oh, oh
 and Valerie, screaming from the gallery, say he must go free
 does not agree and he tells them so-o-o-o
But as the words are leaving his lips, a noise comes from behind
Bang! Bang! Maxwell's silver hammer came down upon his head

I read the news today, oh boy
About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They'd seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall
I'd love to turn you onIn Penny Lane there is a barber showing photographs
Of every head he's had the pleasure to know
And all the people that come and go
Stop and say hello
On the corner is a banker with a motorcar
The little children laugh at him behind his back
And the banker never wears a mac
In the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit and meanwhile back
In Penny Lane there is a fireman with an hourglass
And in his pocket is a portrait of the Queen
He likes to keep his fire engine clean
It's a clean machine
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
Four of fish and finger pies
In summer, meanwhile back
Behind the shelter in the middle of a roundabout
A pretty nurse is selling poppies from a tray
And though she feels as if she's in a play
She is anyway
In Penny Lane the barber shaves another customer
We see the banker sitting, waiting for a trim
And then the fireman rushes in
From the pouring rain
Very strange
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies
I sit, and meanwhile back
Penny Lane is in my ears and in my eyes
There beneath the blue suburban skies

She's my baby, and I love her so
And every morning when the sun comes up
She brings me coffee in my favorite cup
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
When I call her on the telephone
She says, "Baby, I'm all alone"
Before the time I count from one to four
She'll be knocking on my door
Every evening when the sun goes down
And there ain't nobody else around
She kisses me and then she holds me tight
"Hey baby, everything's alright"
That's why I know, yes I know
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I love her so
Hallelujah, I just love that chick soI love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I
Should never, never, never be blue
Now you're mine, my happiness still makes me cry
And in time, you'll understand the reason why
If I cry it's not because I'm sad
But you're the only love that I've ever had
I can't believe it's happened to me
I can't conceive of any more—misery
Ask me why, I'll say I love you
And I'm always thinking of you
I love you, 'cause you tell me things I want to know
And it's true that it really only goes to show
That I know that I—I, I, I

I got the wiggles in my knees
When she looked at me and sweetly smiled
There she is again
Standing over by the record machine
Yeah, she's lookin' like a model on the cover of a magazine
She's too cute to be a minute over seventeen

And I hear them say
Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love away
How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them seeing them
In the state I'm in
How could she say to me
Love will find away?
Gather round, all you clowns
Let me hear you say
Hey, you got to hide your love away
Hey, you got to hide your love awayLong distance information
Give me Memphis, Tennessee
Try to find the party
Trying to get in touch with me
She would not leave her number
But I know who placed the call
'cause my uncle took the message
And he wrote it on the wall
Help me, information
Get in touch with my Marie
She's the only one who'd phone me here
From Memphis, Tennessee
Her home is on the south side
Just beyond the ridge
Just a half a mile
From the Mississippi Bridge
Help me, information
More than that I cannot add
Only that I miss her
And all the fun we had
We were pulled apart
Because her mom would not agree
Help me get in touch with her
In Memphis, Tennessee
The last time I saw Marie
She was waving me goodbye
With hurry homedrops on her cheek
That trickled from her eyes
Marie is only six years old
Information please
Help me get in touch with her

There's a lady who's sure
All that glitters is gold
And she's buying a stairway to Heaven
When she gets there she knows
If the stores are all closed
With a word she can get what she came for
Ooh!
If there's a bustle in your hedgerow
Don't be alarmed, now
It's just a spring clean for the May queen
Yes, there are two paths you can go by
But in the long run
There's still time to change the road you're on
Ooh!
There's a sign on the wall
But shе wants to be sure
'Cos you know sometimes words have two meanings
In a tree by the brook
There's a songbird who sings
Sometimes all of our thoughts are misgiven
Ooh!
Your head is humming and it won't go
In case you don't know
The piper's calling you to join him
Dear lady, can you hear the wind blow?
And did you know -
Your stairway lies on the whispering wind?
Ahhh!
And as we wind on down the road
Our shadows taller than our souls
There walks a lady we all know
Who shines white light and wants to show
How everything still turns to gold
And if you listen very hard
The tune will come to you at last
When all are one and one is all
To be a rock and not to roll
Not to roll!One day
You'll look to see I've gone
For tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
Some day
You'll know I was the one
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
Yet tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sun
And now the time has come
And so my love I must go
And though I lose a friend
In the end you will know
Oh one day
You'll find that I have gone
But tomorrow may rain
So I'll follow the sunOh, ain't she sweet?
Well see her walking down that street
Yes I ask you very
Ain't she sweet?
Ain't she nice?
Well look her over once or twice
Yes I ask you, very hyperbolically

In her direction

Well look her over once or twice

In her direct

You got that sand all over your feet
But ah ah well honey don't, honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't
I say you will when you won't, ah ah, honey, don't
(Ahh rock on George, one time for me!
I feel fine, mmmhm. I said...)
Well sometimes I love you on a Saturday night
Sunday morning you don't look right
You've been out painting the town
Ah ah baby, been stepping around
But ah ah well honey don't, I said honey don't
Honey don't, honey don't, honey don't

But I never heard them ringing
No, I never heard them at all
Till there was you
There were birds in the sky
But I never saw them winging
No, I never saw them at all
Till there was you
Then there was music and wonderful roses
They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows
Of dawn and dew
There was love all around
But I never heard it singing
No, I never heard it at all
Till there was you

They tell me in sweet fragrant meadows

But when I get home to you
I find the things that you do
Will make me feel alright
You know I work all day
To get you money to buy you things
And it's worth it just to hear you say
You're gonna give me everything
So why on earth should I moan
'Cause when I get you alone
You know I feel okay
When I'm home everything seems to be right
When I'm home feeling you holding me tight, tight, yeah

Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Images of broken light which dance before me like a million eyes
They call me on and on across the universe
Thoughts meander like a restless wind inside a letter box
They tumble blindly as they make their way across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Sounds of laughter, shades of life are ringing through my open ears
Inciting and inviting me
Limitless undying love which shines around me like a million suns
It calls me on and on across the universe
Jai Guru Deva, Om
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world
Nothing's gonna change my world

Jai Guru DevaJust let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I have no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And change the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a-wail a sax
I must admit they have a rockin' band
Man they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Way down South they gave a jubilee
The jokey folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing got all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with me
Don't care to hear 'em play a tango
Ain't in the mood to take a mambo
It's way too early for the congo
So keep a rockin' that piano
So I can hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a backbeat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's gotta be rock and roll music
If you wanna dance with me
If you wanna dance with meOne, two, three, four
One, two... 
Let me tell you how it will be
There's one for you, nineteen for me
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Should five percent appear too small
Be thankful I don't take it all
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
If you drive a car, car, I'll tax the street
If you try to sit, sit, I'll tax your seat
If you get too cold, cold, I'll tax the heat
If you take a walk, walk, I'll tax your feet
Taxman
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Don't ask me what I want it for
If you don't want to pay some more
'Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
Now my advice for those who die
Declare the pennies on your eyes
Cause I'm the taxman
Yeah, I'm the taxman
And you're working for no one but me Turn off your mind, relax and float downstream
It is not dying, it is not dying
Lay down all thoughts, surrender to the void
It is shining, it is shining
That you may see the meaning of within
It is being, it is being
That love is all and love is everyone
It is knowing, it is knowing
That ignorance and hate may mourn the dead
It is believing, it is believing
But listen to the colour of your dreams
It is not living, it is not living
Or play the game "Existence" to the end
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginning
Of the beginning, of the beginningI once had a girl
Or should I say, she once had me?
She showed me her room
"Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?"
She asked me to stay and she told me to sit anywhere
So I looked around and I noticed there wasn't a chair
I sat on the rug
Drinking her wine, biding me time
We talked until two
And then she said, "It's time for bed"
She told me she worked in the morning and started to laugh
I told her I didn't and crawled off to sleep in the bath
And when I awoke
I was alone, this bird had flown
So I lit a fire
Isn't it good, Norwegian wood?Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love you, love you
Love
And in the end
The love you take
Is equal to the love you make
]Dream sweet dreams for me
Dream sweet dreams for you
Now it's time to say good night
Good night sleep tight
Now the sun turns out his light
Good night sleep tight

It's a love that lasts forever
It's a love that has no past
Don't let me down, don't let me down

Butterflies
Why am I so shy when I'm beside you?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Is it right that you and I should fight
Every night?
Just the sight of you makes nighttime bright
Very bright
Haven't I the right to make it up girl?
It's only love and that is all
Why should I feel the way I do?
It's only love, and that is all
But it's so hard loving you
Yes it's so hard loving you, loving youLets hope this one turns out pretty darn good huh?

Der mir 'mal zuhört
Sie ging einfach fort und kommt nie mehr!
Sie ist 'ne Frau
Wie ich sie immer wollt'
Konnt' sie nicht halten
Nun bereu' ich alles viel zu sehr
Ach
BLEIB
BLEIB
Manchmal denk' ich an die Zeit
In der wir zusammen waren
Manchmal gab es Streit; und ich wollt' geh'n
Aber wenn ich sah
Wie sehr sie weinte
So musst' ich bleiben
Jetzt geht sie und lässt mich einfach steh'n
Ach BLEIB
BLEIB
Sie ist 'ne Art von Frau
Die weiss genau
Wie gut sie ist
Sie ist für keins!
Wenn du sagst
Sie sieht gut aus
Dann meint sie gleich
Sie hätt' dich in der Hand
Hand
Hand
Hand!!!
BLEIB!!! BLEIB!!!
Manchmal denk ich
Schon als Kind lag ihr die Welt zu Füssen;
Sie kennt jeden Weg und jeden Tritt
Sie verlangt von ihren Freunden
Dass sie leiden müssen
Dennoch wünsch' ich sie zu mir zurück
Ach BLEIB
BLEIBKomm! Ich brauche Hilfe!
KOMM! Ich brauche wirklich Hilfe!
KOMM! Ich brauch' sie unbedingt! KOMM!!!
Wenn ich an früher denke und wie es damals war
Ich wollte niemand
Der mir half;
Für mich war alles klar!
Doch neulich stellt' ich fest:
Ich bin nicht mehr so frei
Ich weiss genau
Ich brauch' dich jetzt
Die Zeiten sind vorbei!
Hilf mir
Wenn du kannst
Mir geht's nicht gut
Und ich merke
Wenn du kommst
Gibst du mir Mut!
Und ich wüsste niemand
Der das sonst noch tut
Komm und hilf mir! Hilf mir!
Nun klappt's in meinem Leben nicht mehr wie vor Jahr'n
Jetzt stell' ich fest
Ich bin noch ganz schön unerfahr'n
Mein Selbstvertrauen schwindet jeden Tag noch mehr
Ich weiss genau
Ich brauch' dich jetzt;
Ich fühle mich so leer!
Hilf mir
Wenn du kannst...
Wenn ich an früher denke..
Hilf mir
Wenn du kannst...
Hilf mir
Hilf mir
Hilf mir!!!Ah, look at all the lonely people
Ah, look at all the lonely people
Eleanor Rigby picks up the rice in the church where a wedding has been
Lives in a dream
Waits at the window, wearing the face that she keeps in a jar by the door
Who is it for?
All the lonely people
Where do they all come from?
All the lonely people
Where do they all belong?
Father McKenzie writing the words of a sermon that no one will hear
No one comes near
Look at him working. Darning his socks in the night when there's nobody there
What does he care?
Eleanor Rigby died in the church and was buried along with her name
Nobody came

No one was savedINTERVIEWER: Do you think the bug has bitten now? Are you guys – do you have big eyes now to be actors?
PAUL: No.
GEORGE: Not really, no. We still, you know, even if our film – this, A Hard Day’s Night – is the biggest box office attraction ever, you know, it still won’t make us feel as though we’re actors. But I think we’d all enjoy making a new film.
RINGO: Yeah, it’s good fun. I think the next one we make will be more fun, because we’ve sort of got the hang of things. Like on this one, when we first started, when we’re not supposed to look at the camera, you’d always sort of find yourself turning ‘round and smiling at it.  You’d just smile as soon as you saw the camera, you know.
PAUL: And on this one, I don’t know whether this happens on lots of films, we used to keep breaking up giggling.
RINGO: Yeah.
PAUL: We had some great giggling fits, you know. We’d sort of say a line, and I kept doing it a particular way. There was one line I kept saying to Ringo, it’s about the grandfather in the film who goes off to—
RINGO: Well, we can’t tell you, ‘cause we’ll ruin the film, you see!
PAUL: We can’t tell you  but it was just this one thing where the grandfather goes off to a club, and I was supposed to say to Ringo “It’s all your fault” and things. ‘Cause in the film actually, although it’s not true in real life, we sort of pick on Ringo a bit, you know, because it was obvious really, because he’s sort of smaller and it looks funny in the film. But I’m supposed to be picking on Ringo and saying “It’s all your fault” and things. And as I was saying it, I’m a bit – I kept flapping my arms up and down, I don’t know why, I must have thought I was a good actor!  And I was just sort of flapping around and saying, “It’s all your fault!”  Flapping my arms around, and he couldn’t stand it, he was giggling away. So then I started laughing, and we just collapsed, and we took so many takes on that bit.
RINGO: Yeah, twelve takes on that bit.
PAUL: Yeah. And I think we cut that bit in the end or something. 
RINGO: Yeah.
PAUL: They cut some of it.
RINGO: They cut half of it, yeah, but you know, a lot of laughs. All different things that happened were funny to us which, you know, they haven’t printed or put on the film, but it’s great when we go and see the film, then we can sort of say, “Remember that bit?” if they showed the one we did before, you know, where we all broke up.When I was sitting on my piano one day

Hey you've got to hide your love away

How can I even try?
I can never win
Hearing them, seeing them

How could she say to me
"Love will find a way?"

Took my love away
Though he'll regret it someday
But this boy wants you back again
That boy
Isn't good for you
Though he may want you, too
This boy wants you back again
Oh, and this boy would be happy
Just to love you, but oh my
That boy won't be happy
'Til he's seen you cry
This boy
Wouldn't mind the pain
Would always feel the same
If this boy gets you back again
This boy, this boy, this boyWell, she was just seventeen
You know what I mean
And the way she looked
Was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me
And I, I could see
That before too long
I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another
Ooh, when I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh we danced through thе night
And we held each othеr tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Ooh, since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went, "Boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night
And we held each other tight
And before too long
I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well since I saw her standing thereA taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Do do do
Do do do
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Do do do
Do do do
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
That taste of honey, a taste of honey
Tasting much sweeter than wine
Oh, I will return, yes, I will return
I'll come back 
For the honey

Just let me hear some of that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I've got no kick against modern jazz
Unless they try to play it too darn fast
And lose the beauty of the melody
Until they sound just like a symphony
That's why I go for that that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
I took my loved one over across the tracks
So she can hear my man a wailin' sax
I must admit they have a rocking band
Man, they were blowing like a hurricane
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old way you choose it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
It's got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Way down South they had a jubilee
Them Georgia folks they had a jamboree
They're drinking home brew from a wooden cup
The folks dancing there are all shook up
And started playing that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Got to be rock and roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with me
Don't care to hear them play a tango
And in the mood they take a mambo
It's way to early for a congo
So keep a rocking that piano
That's why I go for that rock and roll music
Any old time you use it
It's got a back beat, you can't lose it
Any old time you use it
Oh, you got rock 'n roll music
If you want to dance with me
If you want to dance with meI'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Of all the love I have won or have lost
There is one love I should never have crossed
She was a girl in a million, my friend
I should have known she would win in the end
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
Although I laugh and I act like a clown
Beneath this mask I am wearing a frown
My tears are falling like rain from the sky
Is it for her or myself that I cry?
I'm a loser
And I lost someone who's near to me
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to be
What have I done to deserve such a fate?
I realise I have left it too late
And so it's true, pride comes before a fall
I'm telling you so that you won't lose all
I'm a loser
I'm a loser
And I'm not what I appear to beOh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
She thinks of him and so she dresses in black
And though he'll never come back, she's dressed in black
Oh dear, what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?
I think of her, but she thinks only of him
And though it's only a whim, she thinks of him
Oh how long will it take
Till she sees the mistake she has made?
Dear what can I do?
Baby's in black and I'm feeling blue
Tell me, oh what can I do?

Tell me, oh what can I do?Well they took some honey from a tree
Dressed it up and they called it me

If I catch you talking to that boy again
I’m going to let you down
And leave you flat
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that
Well, it’s the second time I’ve caught you talking to him
Do I have to tell you one more time, I think it’s a sin
I think I'll let you down 
And leave you flat 
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down 
And leave you flat 
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!
Everybody's green
'Cause I'm the one who won your love
But if they'd seen
You talking that way
They'd laugh in my face
So please listen to me if you want to stay mine
I can’t help my feelings, I go out of my mind
I'm going to let you down 
And leave you flat 
Because I told you before
Oh, you can’t do that!I'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had the misery it but he got a lot of fun

Yeah, we'll have some fun, some fun tonight I need somebody
 Not just anybody
 You know I need someone
When I was younger so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
And now my life has changed in oh so many ways
My independence seems to vanish in the haze
But every now and then I feel so insecure
I know that I just need you like I've never done before
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
When I was younger, so much younger than today
I never needed anybody's help in any way
But now these days are gone, I'm not so self assured
Now I find I've changed my mind and opened up the doors
Help me if you can, I'm feeling down
And I do appreciate you being 'round
Help me get my feet back on the ground
Won't you please, please help me?
Help me? Help me? OohWell, gonna write a little letter
Gonna mail it to my local DJ
It's a rocking little record
I want my jockey to play
Roll over Beethoven
Gotta hear it again today
You know my temperature's rising
And the jukebox blows a fuse
My heart's beating rhythm
And my soul keeps singing the blues
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
I got a rocking pneumonia
I need a shot of rhythm and blues 
I think I caught the arthritis
Sitting down by the rhythm revue
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two
Well if you feel it and like it
Well get your lover and reel and rock it
Roll it over and move on up
Just a trifle further and reel and rock it
Roll it over
Roll over Beethoven
Rocking in two by two 
Well early in the morning
I'm a-giving you the warning
Don't you step on my blue suede shoes
Hey diddle diddle
I'll play my fiddle
Ain't got nothing to lose
Roll over Beethoven
And tell Tchaikovsky the news
You know she wiggles like a glow worm
Dance like a spinning top
She's got a crazy partner
Oughta see 'em reel and rock
Long as she got a dime
The music will never stop
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven
Roll over Beethoven

OhLady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meet
Who finds the money when you pay the rent?
Did you think that money was heaven sent?
Friday night arrives without a suitcase
Sunday morning creeping like a nun
Monday's child has learned to tie his bootlace
See how they run
Lady Madonna, baby at your breast
Wonders how you manage to feed the rest
See how they run
Lady Madonna lying on the bed
Listen to the music playing in your head
See how they run
Lady Madonna, children at your feet
Wonder how you manage to make ends meetI never knew that a day like today lay before us
I’ve got the sun in my heart and my heart’s in the sun
Skies are as bright as your eyes
The horizon is open
Love is the ceiling
Feelings are reeling
Free as the air
Forever on and forever
Forever on side by side
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
Who ever knew that we two could be free as we’d fancy?
Fancy is free
But are we who are bound to each other by love?
To each other by love
To each other by love
To each other by loveEdit Lyrics Edit Song Facts

Well, she was just 17, if you know what I mean
And the way she looked was way beyond compare
So how could I dance with another 
When I saw her standing there?
Well, she looked at me, and I, I could see
That before too long, I'd fall in love with her
She wouldn't dance with another 
When I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom" when I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Well, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now, I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there
Well, my heart went "boom"
When I crossed that room
And I held her hand in mine
Oh, we danced through the night, and we held each other tight
And before too long, I fell in love with her
Now I'll never dance with another 
Since I saw her standing there
Oh, since I saw her standing there
Yeah, well, since I saw her standing thereI'm going to tell Aunt Mary about Uncle John
He says he had the misery it but he got a lot of fun
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight
I saw Uncle John with long tall Sally
He saw Aunt Mary coming and he ducked back in the alley
Oh baby
Yeeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight
Well long tall Sally built pretty sweet
She got everything that Uncle John needs
Oh baby
Yeeeah now baby
Woooooh baby
Some fun tonight

Have some fun tonight
Everything's alright

A taste of honey!
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I dream of your first kiss, and then
I feel upon my lips again
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back for the honey and you
Yours was the kiss that awoke my heart
There lingers still, though we're far apart
A taste of honey 
Tasting much sweeter than wine
I will return, yes I will return
I'll come back  for the honey  and youI don't like you
But I love you
Seems that I'm always

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Tighter

I want to leave you
Don't want to stay here
Don't want to spend
Another day here

I love you and all I want you to do
Is just hold me 
Hold me 
Hold me
Hold me
You've really got a hold on me
You've really got a hold on me But despite the fact that the next request comes from Anton, 32 Perry Road, Sherwood, in Nottingham, it's headed "Up the Pool" and starts, "Dear Wack!" So, John, you take it from there
 "Dear Wack! Please, ask those gorgeous lads  called the Beatles  to sing You Really Got a Hold on Me for Di, Gus, Vizz, and me, also for the Beatles themselves, especially Paul, ha, and everybody that was in the Roy Orbison Tour. I'm a regular listener of Pop Go The Beatles, good lad-if you're a lad, and please, tell the boys that all the girls in our office think it is a fab show. Thank you."
 All right, oh, stop the band. Whoa, that's splendid and now, what are you gonna sing for us?

Oh, yeah Now, for the final number, John's got a card in his hand with a little rhyme on it. What is it?
 It's from the form up a third at Hemel Hempstead
 Oh!
 It says, "Dear George, John, Ringo, Paul, here's hoping that you'll please us all
A beauty song and swinging voice, we leave it up to you, the choice
We think you're fab and really cool, so brighten up our lads at school"
Dig this, for here's Paul, whistling "Clarabella" Uh, George is just coming up here with a letter in his hand, you're looking very serious about it, what is it, George?
 It's a letter from Cathy of Newport, Isle of Wight, who says: "Paul's been to to the Isle of Wight, why haven't I?" Well, I haven't got the passport, huh. And, and she says, would you please sing a song, uh, for the 5th of St. Teresa  Isle of Wight? So we'd like to feature John shouting: "Soldiers of Love."

Well, if your hands start a-clapping
And your fingers start a-popping
And your feet start a-moving around
And if you start to swing and sway
When the band starts to play
A real cool way out sound
And if you get to can't help it
And you can't sit down
You feel like you gotta move a round
You get a shot of rhythm and blues
With just a little rock and roll on the side
Just for good measure
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?
Don't you worry about a thing if you start to dance and sing
And chills coming up on you
And if the rhythm finally gets you and the beat gets you too
Well, here's something for you to do
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Get a pair of dancing shoes
Get a shot of rhythm and blues
Well, with your lover by your side
Don't you know you're going to have a lot of pleasure?I saw her standing on the corner 
A yellow ribbon in her hair 
I couldn't stop myself from calling
Well look a-there, look a-there
Wow look a-there, well look a-there
Young blood, young blood, young blood
I can’t get you out of my mind
I took one look and I was fractured 
I tried to walk but I was lame 
I tried to talk but I just stuttered
Well what's your name, what's your name
Well what’s your name, well what's your name
Young blood, ah young blood, young blood
I can't get you out of my mind
A crazy stop, she was the top
I tried to follow her all the way home
Things went bad, I met her dad
He said, "You'd better leave my daughter alone"
Ow!
Well I tried to speak but I just stuttered 
I saw the rising of the sun 
And all along my heart was falling
While you're the one, you're the one
While you're the one, ah you're the one
Young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can’t get you out of my mind
Yeah young blood, oh young blood, yeah young blood
I can’t get you out of my mindThe sun is fading away
That's the end of the day
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
Just one kiss and I'll go
Don't hide the tears that don't show
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way
To where the winds don't blow
And golden rivers flow
This way will I go
They were right I was wrong
True love didn't last long
As the June light turns to moonlight
I'll be on my way heyWe've been friends for oh so long
I let you share what's mine
When you mess with the girl I love
It's time to draw the line
Keep your hands  off my baby
Ain't gonna tell you but a-one more time
Oh, keep your hands  off my baby
Boy, you get it through your head
That girl is mine
I don't mind if you lend my clothes
But you will be in touch
There is something that you get straight
There's one thing you don't touch
 
 Who, keep your hands off my baby
She's mine 
You better watch yourself now

If I'm wrong
I'm right where I belong

About a lucky man who made the grade
And though the news was rather sad
Well, I just had to laugh
I saw the photograph
He blew his mind out in a car
He didn't notice that the lights had changed
A crowd of people stood and stared
They’d seen his face before
Nobody was really sure if he was from the House of Lords
I saw a film today, oh boy
The English Army had just won the war
A crowd of people turned away
But I just had to look
Having read the book
I'd love to turn you on
Woke up, fell out of bed
Dragged a comb across my head
Found my way downstairs and drank a cup
And looking up I noticed I was late
Found my coat and grabbed my hat
Made the bus in seconds flat
Found my way upstairs and had a smoke
And somebody spoke and I went into a dream
I read the news today, oh boy
4,000 holes in Blackburn, Lancashire
And though the holes were rather small
They had to count them all
Now they know how many holes it takes to fill the Albert Hall

Going to work, don't want to go, feeling low down
Heading for home, you start to roam, then you're in town
Everybody knows there's nothing doing
Everything is closed, it's like a ruin
Everyone you see is half asleep
And you're on your own, you're in the street
After a while you start to smile, now you feel cool
Then you decide to take a walk by the old school
Nothing has changed, it's still the same
I've got nothing to say but it's OK
Good morning, good morning

Everywhere in town it's getting dark
Everyone you see is full of life
It's time for tea and Meet The Wife

Go to a show, you hope she goes

Nothing can come between us
When it gets dark I tow your heart away
Standing by a parking meter
When I caught a glimpse of Rita
Filling in a ticket in her little white book
In a cap she looked much older
And the bag across her shoulder
Made her look a little like a military man
Lovely Rita, meter maid 
May I inquire discreetly 
When are you free to take some tea with me?
Rita!
Took her out and tried to win her
Had a laugh and over dinner
Told her I would really like to see her again
Got the bill and Rita paid it
Took her home, I nearly made it
Sitting on the sofa with a sister or two
Oh, lovely Rita meter maid
Where would I be without you
Give us a wink and make me think of you

Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah da
Ah da, ah da, ah da, ah daWhen I get older losing my hair
Many years from now
Will you still be sending me a valentine
Birthday greetings, bottle of wine?
If I'd been out till quarter to three
Would you lock the door
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
You'll be older too
And if you say the word
I could stay with you
I could be handy mending a fuse
When your lights have gone
You can knit a sweater by the fireside
Sunday mornings go for a ride
Doing the garden, digging the weeds
Who could ask for more?
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Every summer we can rent a cottage
In the Isle of Wight, if it's not too dear
We shall scrimp and save
Grandchildren on your knee
Vera, Chuck, and Dave
Send me a postcard, drop me a line
Stating point of view
Indicate precisely what you mean to say
Yours sincerely, wasting away
Give me your answer, fill in a form
Mine for evermore
Will you still need me, will you still feed me
When I'm sixty-four?
Whoo!We were talking about the space between us all
And the people who hide themselves behind a wall of illusion
Never glimpse the truth, then it's far too late when they pass away
We were talking about the love we all could share
When we find it to try our best to hold it there with our love
With our love, we could save the world, if they only knew
Try to realise it's all within yourself
No one else can make you change
And to see you're really only very small
And life flows on within you and without you
We were talking about the love that's gone so cold
And the people who gain the world and lose their soul
They don't know, they can't see, are you one of them?
When you've seen beyond yourself then you may find
Peace of mind is waiting there
And the time will come when you see we're all one
And life flows on within you and without youFor the benefit of Mr. Kite
There will be a show tonight on trampoline
The Hendersons will all be there
Late of Pablo Fanque's Fair, what a scene
Over men and horses hoops and garters
Lastly through a hogshead of real fire!
In his way Mr. K. will challenge the world!
The celebrated Mr. K
Performs his feat on Saturday at Bishopsgate
The Hendersons will dance and sing
As Mr. Kite flies through the ring don't be late
Messrs. K. and H. assure the public
Their production will be second to none
And of course Henry The Horse dances the waltz!
The band begins at ten to six
When Mr. K. performs his tricks without a sound
And Mr. H. will demonstrate
Ten somersets he'll undertake on solid ground
Having been some days in preparation
A splendid time is guaranteed for all
And tonight Mr. Kite is topping the billWednesday morning at five o'clock as the day begins
Silently closing her bedroom door
Leaving the note that she hoped would say more
She goes down the stairs to the kitchen clutching her handkerchief
Quietly turning the backdoor key
Stepping outside, she is free
]
She 
Is leaving 
Home 
She's leaving home after living alone 
For so many years
Father snores as his wife gets into her dressing gown
Picks up the letter that's lying there
Standing alone at the top of the stairs
She breaks down and cries to her husband, Daddy, our baby's gone
Why would she treat us so thoughtlessly
How could she do this to me
She 
Is leaving 
Home 
She's leaving home after living alone 
For so many years
Friday morning at nine o'clock she is far away
Waiting to keep the appointment she made
Meeting a man from the motor trade
]
She 
Is having 
Fun 
Something inside that was always denied 
For so many years
She's leaving home I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
I'm filling the cracks that ran through the door
And kept my mind from wandering
Where it will go
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
See the people standing there who disagree and never win
And wonder why they don't get in my door
I'm painting the room in a colorful way
And when my mind is wandering
There I will go
Ooh, ah
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And it really doesn't matter if I'm wrong, I'm right
Where I belong, I'm right
Where I belong
Silly people run around, they worry me
And never ask me why they don't get past my door
I'm taking the time for a number of things
That weren't important yesterday
And I still go
Ooh, ah
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will go
Where it will go
I'm fixing a hole where the rain gets in
And stops my mind from wandering
Where it will goIt's getting better all the time

I used to get mad at my school 
The teachers who taught me weren't cool 
You’re holding me down , turning me 'round 
Filling me up with your rules 
]
I've got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine
Me used to be angry young man
Me hiding me head in the sand
You gave me the word, I finally heard
I’m doing the best that I can
]
I’ve got to admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
I have to admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!
]
It’s getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
I used to be cruel to my woman
I beat her and kept her apart from the things that she loved
Man, I was mean but I'm changing my scene
And I'm doing the best that I can 
]
I admit it's getting better 
A little better all the time 
Yes, I admit it's getting better 
It's getting better since you've been mine
Getting so much better all the time!

It's getting better all the time
It's getting better all the time
Getting so much better all the time!Picture yourself in a boat on a river
With tangerine trees and marmalade skies
Somebody calls you, you answer quite slowly
A girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Cellophane flowers of yellow and green
Towering over your head
Look for the girl with the sun in her eyes
And she's gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Follow her down to a bridge by a fountain
Where rocking horse people eat marshmallow pies
Everyone smiles as you drift past the flowers
That grow so incredibly high
Newspaper taxis appear on the shore
Waiting to take you away
Climb in the back with your head in the clouds
And you're gone
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Picture yourself on a train in a station
With plasticine porters with looking glass ties
Suddenly, someone is there at the turnstile
The girl with kaleidoscope eyes
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Ahh
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
Lucy in the sky with diamonds
AhhBilly Shears!
What would you think if I sang out of tune?
Would you stand up and walk out on me?
Lend me your ears and I'll sing you a song
And I'll try not to sing out of key
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, I get high with a little help from my friends

Do you need anybody?
I need somebody to love
Could it be anybody?
I want somebody to love
Would you believe in a love at first sight?
Yes, I'm certain that it happens all the time
What do you see when you turn out the light?
I can't tell you, but I know it's mine
Oh, I get by with a little help from my friends
Mh, get high with a little help from my friends
Oh, I'm gonna try with a little help from my friends
