Our song on the radio but it don't sound the same
When our friends talk about you, all it does is just tear me down
'Cause my heart breaks a little when I hear your name
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
My pride, my ego, my needs, and my selfish ways
Caused a good, strong woman like you to walk out my life
Now I'll never, never get to clean up the mess I made 
And it haunts me every time I close my eyes
It all just sounds like oooooh ooh
Mmm, too young, too dumb to realize
That I should have bought you flowers
And held your hand
Should have gave you all my hours
When I had the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause all you wanted to do was dance
Now my baby's dancing
But she's dancing with another man
Although it hurts
I'll be the first to say that I was wrong
Oh, I know I'm probably much too late
To try and apologize for my mistakes
But I just want you to know
I hope he buys you flowers
I hope he holds your hand
Give you all his hours
When he has the chance
Take you to every party
'Cause I remember how much you loved to dance
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your man
Do all the things I should have done
When I was your manFly-y-y, fly-y-y, fly
It's Gucci , huh?

I drink 'til I'm drunk , smoke 'til I'm high 
Castle on the hill , wake up in the sky

Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? 
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same

Throw my hand on a blade for ya

When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face

'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while

'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
I'm gonna kick my feet up, then stare at the fan
Turn the TV on, throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gonna tell me I can't, nah

Click to MTV, so they can teach me how to dougie
'Cause in my castle, I'm the freaking man
Oh-oh, yes, I said it

So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today, I swear, I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all 
Nothing at all 
Tomorrow, I'll wake up, do some P90X
Meet a really nice girl, have some really nice sex
She's gonna scream out, "This is great!" 
Yeah, I might mess around and get my college degree

But sorry pops, you'll just have to wait

You're all I had, you're all I had
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
'Cause when the sun goes down, someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself
Talking to the moon
Tryna get to you
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
'Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side, talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

To realize what we used to have
We don't have it anymore

So keep in mind all the sacrifices I'm making
To keep you by my side
To keep you from walking out the door
'Cause there'll be no sunlight
If I lose you, baby

If I lose you, baby
Just like the clouds
My eyes will do the same if you walk away
Everyday, it'll rain
Rain, rain
I'll never be your mother's favorite
Your daddy can't even look me in the eye
Ooh, if I was in their shoes, I'd be doing the same thing
Saying, "There goes my little girl
Walking with that troublesome guy"
But they're just afraid of something they can't understand
Ooh, but little darling watch me change their minds
Yeah, for you I'll try, I'll try, I'll try, I'll try

Her hair, her hair
Falls perfectly without her trying
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know
When I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so
Sad to think she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Oh, you know, you know, you know
I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for
Then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
'Cause, girl, you're amazing just the way you are

Don't conceal it, don't be fair
You look great, don't need silicone to build it, or botox to kill it
You just killing off spirit
And you the one that you gotta live with
So don't get caught up in appearance
And see the inner beauty
When you look off in the mirrors
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing
Just the way you are

To picture the only one you want to love
In someone else's arms
But I wouldn't have done
All the things that I have done
If I knew one day you'd come
Now baby  now baby 
Oh baby, please, let's leave the past behind us
Behind us
So that we can go where love will find us
Yeah, will find us
I know most girls would leave me
But I know that you believe me
Baby, I, I wish we were seventeen
So I could give you all the innocence
That you give to me
No, I wouldn't have done
All the things that I've done
If I knew one day you'd come
If I knew one day you'd comeTruth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go 'bout your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted, but baby, what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you, try
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland, it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line, you can't change your mind
Yeah, I'm a monster, but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly, I've been feelin' insane in between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was, you would run and hide
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line, and come back alive
But that's the price we paying when we living on the other side
You know I, I've been waiting on the other side
And you, all you gotta do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime, but you just gotta decide
You know I, I've been waiting on the other
Waiting on the other side
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understandOh, I've never done this before
Never want to do this again
Wrong turn, on a dusty road
I did it to myself, I can't pretend
Well I learned just a little too late
Good God, I must have been blind
Cause she got me for everything
Everything, everything, alright
Like my daddy, I'm a gambling man
Never been afraid to roll the dice
But when I put my bet on her
Little Miss Snake Eyes ruined my life
She better sleep with one eye open
Better make sure to lock her doors
Cause once I get my hands on her, I'ma ooh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling everyone
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run
The good lord better bless your soul
Cause I done already cursed your name
Don't matter which way you go
Payback's gonna come your way
You'll be begging me, "Please, please, please"
And I'ma look at you and laugh, laugh, laugh
While you sit there and cry for me, cry for me
Cry for me all night
I'll spend a life time in jail
I'll be smiling in my cell
Can't nobody save you now
Sure there ain't no use in trying
Once I get my hands on you, I'ma ooh
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch
Watch out, she's quick
Look out for a pretty little thing named Natalie
If you see her, tell her I'm coming
She better run
I should've known better
Cause when we were together
She never said forever
I'm a fool that played in her game, hey!
Natalie, she ran away with all my money
And she did it for fun
Natalie, she's probably out there thinking it's funny
Telling every one
Well, I'm digging a ditch for this gold digging bitch

Tears running from your eyes
And I'm on the outside
Knowing that you're all I want
But I can't do anything
I'm so helpless baby
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
You've been living this way so long
You don't know the difference
And it's killing me
Cause you can have so much more
I'm the one you are looking for
But you close your eyes on me
So you still can't see
Everyday same old things
So used to feeling pain
Never had real love before
And it ain't her fault
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal
A heart that can't feel, it's broken
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
His love is all she knows, all she knows, all she knows
All she knows is the pain
In the corner of an empty home
She's still comfortable
I want her to know
It can be better than this
I can't pretend
Wish we were more than friends
She knows better but
She can't help it
Want to tell her
But would that be selfish
How do you heal 
A heart that can't feel , it's broken 
His love is all she knows , all she knows , all she knows 
His love is all she knows , all she knows , all she knows 
His love is all she knowsHands over my head
Thinking what else could go wrong
Would of stayed in bed
How can a day be so long?
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again
For you
I missed the first train, stood out in the rain all day
But I caught the next train, and there you were to sweep me away
Guess that's what I waited for
Never believed that things happen for a reason
But how this turned out, removed all my doubts, so believe
That for you, I do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again, oh
Oh, who ever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely
Yea, I am so glad I fine with you
Even though the day went so wrong
I wouldn't change a thing
Yeah, yeah
Oh, I'll do it, I'll
Do it all over again
Do it all over again
All I went through, led me to you
So I'd do it all over again 
Do it all over again
I would do it all over again
I would do all over again for you
All I went through, led me to you
So I would do it all over again
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, oh
Whoever thought a day gone so wrong
Could turn out so lovely, ohOh I was perfect for the circus
If she dared me I'd do it
Love makes you stupid
I gave it up
But I guess it was not enough
Cause she never seemed satisfied
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
She set the bar just above the stars
A rocket couldn't reach it but I still kept on reaching
She watched me try at least a thousand times
If she loved me she'd stopped me but no
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?
I saw something worth my future
So right, so wrong
In my mind I was all it took, but I guess I wasn't wrong?
I know I'm not perfect
But at the end of the day who is?
She wanted someone that's perfect
OK, but can you tell me who Is?
Ooooh Oooh Ooh
Ooooh Oooh OohI've been working hard so long
Seems like pain has been my only friend
My fragile heart's been done so wrong
I wondered if I'd ever heal again
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change 
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins
Yesterday has come and gone
And I've learn how to leave it where it is
And I see that I was wrong
For ever doubting I could win
Oh just like all the seasons never stay the same
All around me I can feel a change 
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins
Life's too short to have regrets
So I'm learning now to leave it in the past and try to forget
Only have one life to live
So you better make the best of it
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life begins
I will break these chains that bind me, happiness will find me
Leave the past behind me, today my life begins
A whole new world is waiting its mine for the taking
I know I can make it today my life beginsI know you're somewhere out there
Somewhere far away
I want you back, I want you back
My neighbors think I'm crazy
But they don't understand
You're all I have, you're all I have
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?
I'm feeling like I'm famous, the talk of the town
They say I've gone mad
Yeah, I've gone mad
But they don't know what I know
Cause when the sun goes down someone's talking back
Yeah, they're talking back, oh
At night when the stars light up my room
I sit by myself...
Talking to the moon
Trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?
Do you ever hear me calling?
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Cause every night, I'm talking to the moon
Still trying to get to you
In hopes you're on the other side talking to me too
Or am I a fool, who sits alone, talking to the moon?

They said it wouldn't work but what did they know?
Cause years passed and we're still here today

As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky
I must've done something right
And I promise to love her for the rest of my life
Seems like yesterday when she first said hello
Funny how time flies by when you're in love
It took us a lifetime to find each other
It was worth the wait cause I finally found the one
Never in my dreams did I think that this would happen to me
As I stand here before my woman
I can’t fight back the tears in my eyes
Oh how could I be so lucky

Pulling on your hair like Rapunzel
Every now and then you like it rough
Sometimes you like it gentle

Treatin' your body like a cello, booty like hello
Jiggle like Jell-O
Love it whenever you get ghetto
When I leave your body smokin' like a cigarillo

Asking is it you?  Is it me?

Jumps in the shower
Then rubs on her lotion
While she is wrapped in a towel
Ain't no music on, but she dance to perfection
I swear the bathrooms the club
The way she's showing to her reflection
Every morning, I watch her from behind
But she don't know
I pretend that I'm asleep
But I don't miss a show

Is when she dance in the mirror 
There's nothing more I can say
Just watch her dance in the mirror
Dance

'Cause our love has never changed
But all the little things keep piling up
And life keeps getting in the way
Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes
Some things we won't understand
And we're both so tired of being misunderstood
So let's just turn and walk away
And hold on to what was good
Don't make it harder than it is
We both knew it'd come to this
Better now than in a year
More nights of tears and we both hate each other
The fuse is already lit, so how about a final kiss?
And just let it go
And stop the madness before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodes
Before it explodes
Before it's out of our control
Let's stop the madness before it explodes
We gotta let it go
Before it all explodesWhat are you fucking crazy?
Damn ...
It's getting hard to breathe
I'm trying to make her see
That she do not really know
That I'm trying to find a way
And tell her every day, that she just goes along
So I. ..
I do not wanna be
The only one that knows
That somebody could come along and just
Take her right from me
I'm standing shaking ground
And I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
I'm already lost
I wish that I could see
What is making you
Feel that you Should be concerned
My love is like a Gunshot
All It takes is one shot for me to blow it all away
I do not wanna feel like I'm just wasting time
It's gotta be with you and no one else
Do you notice me
I need to know right now
Cause I've been thinking that I'm gonna lose it
Chorus:
Cause I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lost
Maybe I'm trying too hard
But girl you make me nervous
Should you have by now noticed me
And what will it take it
To a heavenly Because your
Drawing chains and
Driving me insane!
Chorus:
Girl, I'm losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing control of myself this time
She's got me losing my head
I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my way
But I think she feels I'm already lostWill you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
Will you still hold my hand when my clothes are out of style?
My teeth all ran away and I don’t have the same smile
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
Will you still want to dance even if my hips are weak?
My ears don’t hear so well and I can’t find the beat
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?
When I’m old and crazy, will you still call me baby?
Will you act the same? Will you laugh the same?
Will you think I’m pretty when my hair’s grey?
Will you still call me baby when I’m old and crazy?Look at her shinin'
Her feathers they glow
Now the jungle's smiling
'Cause our baby's home
Can you feel what I feel?

OhI don't recognize my reflection
All I see is a product of your deception
Gave you all of me without question
But you had to take advantage of a blessing
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me
I'm a killer on the run
You broke my heart and now you're staring down my gun
Click-clack now watch me pull this trigger just for fun
Was once a good girl now a killer on the run
K-k-killer, k-k-killer, k-k-killer
K-k-killer on the run
Killer on the run
K-k-killer on the run
Wipe those tears from your eyes it's too late
With that rag in your mouth can't tell what you say
Tied to the train tracks begging me for mercy
This is going to hurt you more than it hurts me
I warned you, I told you it would end this way
If you kept on playing all those childish games
But just like every other man you're all the same
Revenge is sweet I love the taste it's giving me
You brought this upon yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch now shut up and take it
Look at the monster you created
You brought this up on yourself
I loved you more than anyone else
Karma’s a bitch so shut up and take it
Now I’m a monster, monster you created
Yeah
Killer on the run run run run run run run run
Killer on the run 
GoodbyeHello
You know, you look even better than the way you did the night before
And the moment that you kissed my lips, you know I started to feel wonderful
It's something incredible, there's sex in your chemicals, oh
Ooh, let's go
You're the best way I know to escape the extraordinary
This world ain't for you, and I know for damn sure this world ain't for me
Lift off and say goodbye
Just let your fire set me free, oh
Moonshine
Take us to the stars tonight
Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time
I know
I was with you last night but it feels like it's been so long
And everybody that's around they knows that I’m not myself when you're gone
It's good to see you again, good to see you again
On top of the world
Is where I stand when you're back in my life
Life's not so bad when you're way up this high
Everything is alright, everything is alright, oh

Take us to that special place
That place we went the last time, the last time, ohh
Oh-ooh moonshine

And it seems really, really hard to do
You feel like quitting, you feel you’re through
Well I have some advice for you
Do not give up, keep on trying
You all going to make it  do not give up
Do not ever quit, try and try and you can do it, do not give up 
If you want to catch a ball, but you are having no luck at all
The ball hits your head, it hits your nose
It hits your belly, your chin and toes
Well try and try and try again, keep on trying and soon
You will put your hands out in the air
You will catch that ball, yes this I swear
Do not give up, keep on going
You are on a boat, so keep on rowing
Do not give up, don’t ever stop
Try and try and you will come out on top, do not give up
You got yourself new roller-skates
You put them on and you feel great
Stand up, but then you fall
Do not think you can skate at all
You get back up and then you trip
You skip and tip and slip and flip
Well try and try and try some more
And soon you are skating across the floor
Do not give up, keep on moving
You are going to get there just keep on grooving
Do not give up, do not pack it in
Try and try and you will win, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up
No no no, do not give up, no no
Do not give upGive me your, give me your, give me your attention, baby

Ooh, whoa
Oh girl, I’m gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine
Treasure, that is what you are
Honey, you're my golden star
You think you could make my wish come true
If you let me treasure you
If you let me treasure oh-oh-you
Pretty girl, pretty girl, pretty girl, you should be smiling
A girl like you should never look so blue
You're everything I see in my dreams
I wouldn't say that to you if it wasn't true
Oh, whoa
I know that you don't know it, but you're fine, so fine
Oh whoa
Oh, girl I'm gonna show you when you're mine, oh mine (mine

She was gone before I could say shit
And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa

And I ain't looking for no replacement
No, whoa, whoa, whoa

We met in a crowded place
Expression on her face
The look in her eyes says she wanted me
So I played it cool
But inside I knew
If I made my move
Then hand it for, she’s seconds away
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love
Got me thinking ’bout your love your love
Time was standing still
A destiny fulfilled
Just watching her body movement all night long
Then she took my hand, instantly we danced
She knew by my angst that I wanted more
Me and you touching, dancing the night away
I’m not the one, i’m not the type
Feelings of passion taking my breath away
I wanna love you girl
Only you control my mind
Tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love, your love
I’m tripping out
I’m tripping out
Got me thinking ’bout your love

Anticipating
Imagining me and you
Does that make me crazy or infatuated
For imaging me and you?
Got me hallucinating
Anticipating
Imagining me and you

So easy to forget our love
All of the little things we do
Like calling for no reason
Just to say the words
"Baby, I love you"
I know lately, I've been busy
But a second doesn't go by
Without you crossing my mind
It's been so long since we had time
Let's take a day & make everything right
Just take my hand, fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway
Let's runaway, just for the day
Runaway, runaway
Girl, you've been so patient
Spending nights alone & not complaining
But I'll make it up to you
And I promise today I won't keep you waiting
Please give me this one chance
To remind you of everything we have
I won't give up I'm too much in love
And I want you to know that
Just take my hand
Fall in love with me again
Let's runaway to the place
Where love first found us
Let's runaway for the day
Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runaway for the day
And I'll give everything in this moment
And I promise to make every day just like the day
Let's runaway to the place

Don't need anyone around us
When everything in love gets so complicated
It only takes a day to change it
What I have to say can't wait
All I need is a day
So let's runawayOoh, I got a body full of liquor
With a cocaine kicker
And I'm feeling like I'm thirty feet tall
So lay it down, lay it down
You got your legs up in the sky
With the devil in your eyes
Let me hear you say you want it all
Say it now, say it now
Look what you're doing
Kook what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa
You'll be banging on my chest, bang bang, gorilla
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Ooh, yeah
You and me, baby, making love like gorillas
Yeah, I got a fistful of your hair
But you don't look like you're scared
You're just smiling, tell me "Daddy, it's yours"
Cause you know how I like it you's a dirty little lover
If the neighbors call the cops
Call the sheriff, call the SWAT, we don't stop
We keep rocking while they knocking on our door
And you're screaming, "Give it to me baby
Give it to me, motherfucker!"
Look what you're doing
Look what you've done
But in this jungle you can't run
Cause what I got for you, I promise it's a killa

Shoulda known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open; why were they open? 
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask
'Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya 
You know I'd do anything for ya 
Oh-oh, oh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for ya, baby
But you won't do the same
No, no, no, no, oh-oh-oh
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from

You said you loved me, you're a liar
'Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin', I'd still catch a grenade for ya 
Throw my hand on a blade for ya 
I'd jump in front of a train for ya

It's 3 am and I'm rushing out the door to see you
Waiting all day, but now you want to call me
Why do you do this to me all the time?
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Cos now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Only when you're lonely, lonely
Only when you're lonely
Had me fooled from the start and I quickly gave my heart
Because I loved you, loved you
But this is what happens when you're a lonely girl
With no one to turn you
Now I'm stronger, don't need you any longer
So get off your knees, your words don't mean anything
After all the things you put me through, still I come right back
But now I know the truth, I can finally see
You only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it
Another late night call I won't take it
Because now I finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
Nothing's ever changing, decisions you can't make it
You just think of yourself and never me at all
If you're with your friends, you just string me along
But I won't allow it anymore, so it's time for me to move on
Because I can finally see, you only want me when you're lonely
If I say I'm going to leave, that's the only time you want me
Next time you need me there I won't make it

SONGWRITERS
LAWRENCE, PHILIP / HERNANDEZ, PETER / LEVINE, ARI / BROWN, PHREDLYStaring from my room I see them
Holding hands wish I could be them
Lovers doing what we use to do
That's the way it's been here lately
You're too busy now to save me
Feels like you forget I'm waiting for you
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you 
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me
How do I always end up being the girl at the window
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window 
The girl at the window
I know you're working that's why you're leaving
I will never argue your reasons
If this means that you believe in them
Oh time goes on and we're growing apart
Broken promises break my heart
Please don't give me a reason to say goodbye
Sometimes I wish I could just let go
But I love you 
And I believe that one day you will come around
But can you tell me
How can I be what you're saying
When you keep turning all the pages
Am I supposed to believe your words are true
Don't take advantage of me cause you know I won't leave you
I make sure you know I always want to see you
Whoa won't you do it for me too
Oh how do I always end up being the girl at the window
I tell myself I'm not going to wait for you whenever you go
You give me your word and I always take it
You say you'll be home but you never make it
So why do I
Always end up that girl at the window 
The girl at the windowOh, her eyes, her eyes make the stars look like they're not shinin'
Her hair, her hair falls perfectly without her tryin'
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Yeah, I know, I know when I compliment her, she won't believe me
And it's so, it's so sad to think that she don't see what I see
But every time she asks me, "Do I look okay?"
I say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
Yeah, her lips, her lips, I could kiss them all day if she'd let me
Her laugh her laugh, she hates, but I think it's so sexy
She's so beautiful
And I tell her every day
Oh, you know, you know, you know I'd never ask you to change
If perfect's what you're searching for, then just stay the same
So don't even bother asking if you look okay
You know I'll say
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are
The way you are
The way you are
Girl, you're amazing just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
'Cause you're amazing just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for awhile
'Cause girl, you're amazing just the way you are, yeahI spend all my money
On a big, old fancy car
For these bright-eyed honeys
Oh yeah, you know who you are
Keep me up 'til the sun is high
'Til the birds start calling my name
I'm addicted and I don't know why
Guess I've always been this way
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
I get lost under these lights
I get lost in the words I say
Start believing my own lies
Like everything will be okay
Oh I still dream of a simple life
Boy meets girl, makes her his wife
But love don't exist when you live like this
That much I know, yes I know
All these roads steer me wrong
But I still drive them all night long
All night long
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you
You, you, you, you
Yeah you you you
You you you you
All you young, wild girls
You make a mess of me
Yeah, you young, wild girls
You'll be the death of me, the death of me
All you young, wild girls
No matter what you do
Yeah, you young, wild girls
I'll always come back to you, come back to you1, 2, 3 oh
He drives a motorcycle, tattoos everywhere
He got a long wrapped sheet, that's right my baby aren’t scared
And when he talks that talk, he can back it up, ooh
And when he comes there to it, can nobody come between our love
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go
Oh no
I know loving you is so wrong
But hiding you just seems so unfair
So I'm going to take you home even though
You're my mama's worst nightmare
He drinks his Jack with no Cola, 'cause he likes to feel the burn
His middle finger to the law, no this boy will never learn
Everything wrong about him, yeah, it turns me on, oh
We live the good life, sleep all day and party all night long
I know some girls like good boys
But they just move too slow
You see, I like dangerous, it gives me such a rush
That's why I won't let you go
Say what you want, but this boy gives me everything
He'll never hurt me or put me off, anything
Mama don't you be scared, your baby girl is grown
And now I've fallen in love
You may be my mama's worst nightmare
But you're my dream come trueI know girl, when you look at me
You don't know how I feel
Cause I am usually so nonchalant
My feelings I conceal
But I want you to know
Oh, I want you to know
I must admit I have felt this way for more than quite a while
But I cannot hold it no longer when I see that pretty smile
Cannot wait no more
Oh, I can't wait no more
Oooh
Girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you
Maybe I am a fool for speaking up but I do not mind
Cause a girl like you will come around like
Once in a million times
So what do I do?
Tell me what do I do
And the look that you are giving me gives me hope to believe
So for you baby I will change my ways I will
Wear my heart on my sleeve
Got nothing to lose
I have got nothing to lose
Oh, girl, to tell you the truth
It is always been you
I am all about you
Oh, girl
No one can do me the way you do
It is always been you
I am all about you
Girl when you smile
Not a place I would rather be
Just stay for a while
Then you will see you should be right here with me
Cause I love everything you do
That is why I have to take this time baby to tell you
Oh, and now you know
And now you know
Girl, to tell you the truth

You don't need to be nervous 
Cause I, got, you, all, night

And I wanna make it right for you
Clothes are not required, for what we got planned
Ooo girl you're my desire, your wish is my demand
Treat you like a princess, oh girl you're so delicious

All you gotta do is ask me girl 
The candles are burning 
Our bodies are yearning 
I can't wait to love you
I'm so ready baby, I'm so ready babyWohooo Whoooo
How do I end up in the same old place
Faced again with the same mistakes
So stubborn thinking I know what is right
But life proves me wrong every time
Taking roads that lead me nowhere
How do I expect to get there
But when, oh when will I learn to just put you first
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
Can I move on
Oh
When I am weak it's you that makes me strong
And I know that you've been with me all along
So many times I begin to close my eyes and listen to my heart
With you life is so easy why do I make it hard
Oh taking roads that lead me nowhere how do I expect to get there when will I
Learn to just put you first
Hey!
I come to you now when I need you
But why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own
But I was wrong cause only with you can I move on
I get out of my own way, let you have your way
Cause I realize I'm no good on my own
I'm there for you, I'll serve for you
I can't live without you. No
I come to you now when I need you, why do I wait to come see you
I always try to do this on my own but I was wrong, I was wrong, I was wrong
With only you, only you, with only you

C'mon!
Verse 1 :
When I wake up next to you girl
It's like a dream and I'm stuck in two worlds
You're beautiful and you're always shining
Your happiness to me is worth more than diamonds
Many people are there, but you're worth keeping
The same letters, three words and one meaning
I love you, but we have our little arguments
That don't stop untill we forgot who started it
I blank out and the thoughts around in me
You and I, everytime you smiled at me
And I'm blessed, god's gift to me is you
Your eyes, the world I see in you
And time never goes to waste
Don't change, cuz you can never be replaced
This love, you can never rearrange
Everytime when I see your face
Refrain :
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Verse 2 :
Just the way you express with "ing" girl
You're nothing short of my everything
And every memory so sentimental
Your happiness is my essential
This a way for me to say thanks
No stress, I want you to give me strenght
When I'm hurting, you're so close to perfect
But to the world you're just one person
But to that person you mean the world is just
How we ride, me and my girl, uhh
We do this Bonnie and Clyde shit
We fall together, we coincided
The way to my heart it was hard to find it
But you found dead deep down inside of this love
You can never rearrange
Everytime when i see your face
Refrain :
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
The way you are 
Girl you're amazing, just the way you are
When I see your face
There's not a thing that I would change
Cuz you're amazing
Just the way you are
And when you smile
The whole world stops and stares for a while
Cuz girl you're amazing
Just the way you are
Yeah-ahhOh 
When I was just a little boy
Barely strong enough to stand
I could always count on him
Oh
He thought me everything I know
And 'till this day it shows
He was more than just a friend 
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't
Oh oh oh Oh
So when last rain begins to fall
And you're out there on your own
And you can't see a thing
No no no
Just find a voice that understands
For me it was my old man
Taught me to say the words I can
Oh
There were so many times I would doubt myself
But his words were always there to help
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Everything he taught me would stay with me forever
No I won't forget a thing
Oh because of dad I now know myself better
And I hope I can do for him what he did for me
How would it be?
Where I am?
If my father didn't tell me
To never say I can't
He'd carry me
And never let me fall
Oh and the only thing he asked
Right before he passed
Was to never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can't
Oh
Never say you can'tIt's your boy Bruno
I’m going to take you to the top girl, hey
Top of the world. You ready?
Come on 
I feel higher than the ceiling
Cause I'm floating on this feeling
So long my feet have been up off the floor

My Heart's for sale and girl you bought it
The moment that you walk right through the door ooh
Till the day that I stop living

I think that if you believe it then maybe we'll make it
Tonight
Oh tonight
If you believe in me like I believe in you
Tonight
Tonight
Because impossible is possible tonight
Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
Low like Kesha when she on the mic
Move on to another because she wasn't treated right
I could relate to that boy Drizzy
How did I wind up right here with you
you can achieve if you do believe
Got to chase your dreams true reality
No fantasy enjoy it while you have it
Relax and take it in
I tell as your friend your friend to the end
Some about the day
Some about the night
Feeling so right I can smell it in the air
Maybe it's the Gucci or the Louis that she wear
But I don't even care I like my chicks simple
Wit' a big dimple real down to earth
Not stuck up there for they man
Know when I need her she got a big booty like the cute girl Anita
We could get together like it's New Year’s Eve
Met a lot of girls but is you what I need
I live life fast
Trying to hang on passenger
I need a companion on this campaign
Felt so much pain when the rain goes away believe in sunny days
One life to live got to be epic or I'll be Edward you can be my BellaGot me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Got me going in circles c-circles
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
You got me up at night
Feeling like
You won't come through
Got me going in circles c-circles
My heart is dizzy from you
Round and r-r-r-round we go 
Round and r-r-r-round
I'm going in circles c-circles
Please girl!
I give you everything, but, it's not enough
You started being easy but lately you've made it rough 
You say you need me but then turn me away
Got me oh so confused, should I leave or should I stay?
 A little more time
 Baby all your love
 All the way
 Make up your mindI feel like dancing the night away
Feels like just yesterday we danced for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh
Let's let the music keep our bodies awake
Feels like I'm touching you right now for the first time
For the first time, remember our first time
Time, time, time, time, ta ta ta ta ta ta ooh
I think i might explode, this tension is so cold
And all this fighting between us is really getting old
We need a magic touch, before it all blows up
We've both had enough, we've both had enough
So let's just get away, go to that special place
Where we first met and on the floor my feet were swept away
Baby it's worth a try, I believe in you and I
Only takes just one night
Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
Before we both give in
Don't let it end
Let's fall in love again
OohWe've been hanging out all night
Everything's been so nice
Wish I didn't have to go
Feeling sexy in your bedly
Touching me so gently
But I gotta get home
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Wish I could stay all night
But I just can't tonight
Cause I gotta be up at 6
Boy you made my heart melt
When you undid my seatbelt
And told me to come give you a kiss
So many things to tell ya
So long since I held ya
Ooh boy you just don't know
Just don't know
So here's my proposition
Don't speak boy just listen
Before we go down this road
Take me the long way home
I'm not trying to leave you know
Ain't no rush so can you slow down
Take me the long way home
I know that we're pulling up
And circle around the block
So we can touch some more
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Kiss me while we're there
Touch me while we're there
Just take me the long way home
Something about you makes me wanna drive all night all night all night long

Take me the long way home

Waiting for, for this phone to ring
She'll come home someday soon

Is it strange that I talk to myself 
Is it weird when I hear someone else 
What do I do 
There's no more you 
And I tell me you'll be coming home 
Is it strange I believe them again 
Voices in my head
The voices, the voices, the voices

Then she picked it up and pop it, everybody want's it
Facial, legendary. Body is iconic
No way that you can stop it, she's way too versatile
The music makes her dance, but the money makes her smile
Oh, it's not complicated, so this won't take a while
You see, music make her dance
And money, money, money make her smile
Money, money, money make her smile

So bring them boxes in, let them know wer're some bosses
We're tossing them dollars often, no tithing, it's just the offering
She don't be hot for them, don't even want to talk to them
They pull up in the parking lot, she spots them by their moccasins
She's on the clock again, her work ethic is wild

If you ever find yourself stuck in the middle of the sea
I’ll sail the world to find you
If you ever find yourself lost in the dark and you can’t see
I’ll be the light to guide you
We find out what we’re made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I’ll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you
Like 4, 3, 2
You’ll be there
’Cause that’s what friends are supposed to do
If you’re tossin’ and you’re turnin’
And you just can’t fall asleep
I’ll sing a song bеside you
And if you ever forgеt how much you really mean to me
Every day I will remind you
We find out what we’re made of
When we are called to help our friends in need
You can count on me
Like 1, 2, 3
I’ll be there
And I know when I need it
I can count on you

My baby so beautiful id take her to the stars she’s my baby she’s my baby
Uzi:
Me and Bruno bout to go to Mars im finna take my baby Past the starsIf i told i was perfect i'd be lying
If there's something i'm not doing, girl i'm trying
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad 
If you see me at the party conversating
That doesn’t mean telephone numbers are exchanging
I know I’m no angel, but I’m not so bad
You should know, these
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby 
Nothing on you, baby
I know you feel where I'm coming from
Regardless of the things in my past that I've done
Most of it really was for the hell of the fun
On a carousel, so around I spun
With no direction, just tryna get some
Tryna chase skirts, living in the summer sun
And so I lost more than I had ever won
And honestly, I ended up with none
It's so much nonsense, it's on my conscience
I'm thinking "maybe I should get it out"
And I don't wanna sound redundant
But I was wondering, if there was something that you wanna know
But never mind that, we should let it go
Cause we don't wanna be a t.v. episode
And all the bad thoughts, just let em go, go, go
These
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby
They might say hi, and I might say hey
But you shouldn't worry, about what they say
Cause they got nothing on you, baby 
Nothing on you, baby
I've been to London, I've been to Paris
Even way out there in Tokyo
Back home down in Georgia, to New Orleans
But you always steal the show
And just like that girl, you got me froze
Like a Nintendo 64
If you never knew, well, now you know, know, know
Beautiful girls all over the world, I could be chasing
But my time would be wasted, they got nothing on you, baby
Nothing on you, baby

Sex Oooohhhhhhh
Oooooohhhhhh
I used to go out of my mind
Tryna' redefine the real meaning of love
I lost my dignity, forgot about me
I was so lost in us
I had to take hold, cause you had me
Stuck in the middle of nowhere
And my faith, it would shake
I know you're trying your best
To take me
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
You used to be
The man of my dreams
Only now it seems
You were just a nightmare
But this little light of mine
Told me "Open my eyes
There's more than darkness out there"
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
And my faith is in place
In the night, I no longer see your face
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Oooooooohhh
From ashes to ashes
And dust to us
Oooooohhhhhh
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
I'm not gon' run from ya
Imma walk from ya
I'm not afraid of ya
I've escaped from ya
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Been standing in the way
For far too long
Dream maker now
Is taking your place
I'm no longer asleep
My heart is finally awake
So goodbye, good day
Farewell, it's okay
Dream taker, won't you leave me alone?
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so long
Can't wait till you're gone
Haven't dreamt in so longToday I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone
So leave a message at the tone
'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Uh I'm gonna kick my feet up and stare at the fan
Turn the t.v. on
Throw my hand in my pants
Nobody's gon' tell me I cant, no
I'll be loungin' on the couch just chillin' in my snuggie
Flip to MTV so they can teach me how to Dougie
'Cause in my castle I'm the freakin' man
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone

'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Nothing at all
Ooh hoo ooh hoo
Hoo ooh ooh
Tomorrow I'll wake up do some p90x
Meet a really nice girl have some really nice sex
And she's gonna scream out this is great
I might mess around and get my college degree
I bet my old man will be so proud of me
But sorry pops you'll just have to wait
Oh
Yes I said it
I said it
I said it 'cause I can
Today I don't feel like doing anything
I just wanna lay in my bed
Don't feel like picking up my phone

'Cause today I swear I'm not doing anything
No I ain't gonna comb my hair
'Cause I ain't goin' anywhere
No no no no no no no no no oh

And let everything hang loose
Yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah yeah

Same bed but just
A little bit bigger now
Our song on the radio but it
Dont sound the same
When our friends talk
About you all it does is just
Make a sound
*Chorus*
My heart feels the same
When i hear your name
It all just sounds like
Ooh oh ooh oh ooooh
Mmmm too young too dumb
Too realize that you should have
Bought me flowers and held
My hand should have gave me all
Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all
I wanted to was dance now im really
Dancing but im dancing with
Another man
*Verse 2*
Your pride your ego and
Your selfish ways caused a good
Strong woman like me too walk out
Your life now you never never
Get to clean up the mess you've made
Ooh
*Chorus*
And it haunts you every time
You close your eyes it all just
Sounds likeooh oh ooh oh ooooh
Mmmm too young too dumb
Too realize that you should have
Bought me flowers and held
My hand should have gave me all
Your hours when you had the chance
Take me too every party because all
I wanted to was dance now im really
Dancing but im dancing with
Another man
*Verse 3*
Although it hurts you'll
Be the first to say that
You were wrong oh know
Your probably much too late
Too try and apologize for your
Mistakes but i just want you
Too know i hope you buy her
Flowers i hope you hold her hand
Give her all your hours when you
Have the chance take her to every
Party cause all she wants to do
Is dance do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girl
Do all the things you should
Have done when i was your girlBruno Mars
Truth of the matter is I'm complicated
You're as straight as they come
You go about your day, baby
While I hide from the sun
It's better if you don't understand
'Cause you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I will be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Cee-Lo
We would live forever
Who could ask for more?
You could die if you wanted
But baby what for?
It's better if you don't understand
And you won't know what it's like until you try
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
B.o.B
If they say life's a dream, call this insomnia
'Cause this ain't Wonderland it damn sure ain't Narnia
And once you cross the line You can't change your mind
Yeah I'm a monster but I'm no Frankenstein
And quite frankly I've been feelin' insane In between my eyes
I really can't explain what I feel inside
If you knew what I was you'd run and hide 
Many have tried to go into the night
And cross over the line and come back alive
But that's the price we payin' when we livin' on the other side
Bruno Mars
You know I
I'll be waiting on the other side
And you
All you got to do is cross the line
I could wait a whole lifetime
But you just got to decide
You know I I'll be waiting on the other, waiting on the other side
Bruno Mars & Cee-Lo Green
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understand
It's better if you don't understandAnd I don't mind when we fall out
As long as we fall back into it
I hope we never put an end to it
Even though you not that into it
Heaven, have you ever been to it?
Cause you look like you never been
You're more of a Hell's Angel
And for you, I'd rather sin
Broken heart, love you with a broken heart
For you I'd jump off Noah's arc
Love is blind and hope is dark
Why does pain feel so good?
Love is science live for you
Die for you, and I'll die smiling
Easy come, easy go, that's just how you live
Oh, take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open, why were they open?
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is
I'd catch a grenade for you, throw my hand on a blade for you
I'd jump in front of a train for you, you know I'd do anything for ya
I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you, baby, but you won't do the same
No, no, no, no
Black, black, black and blue, beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said, hey, when you get back to where you're from
Mad woman, bad woman, that's just what you are, yeah
You'll smile in my face then rip the brakes out my car
Gave you all I had and you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever asked
Cause what you don't understand is
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darling
