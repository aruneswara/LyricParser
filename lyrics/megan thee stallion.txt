Post a pic up on the 'gram, then my DMs get to boomin'
"Hey bighead" and "What you doin'?", "Can I fly you out to Europe?"
"Do your pussy taste like gum 'cause I'm really tryna chew it?”
Hit 'em back like, “Who you bank with? Do you got a lady?
And if you do, can you still deposit my money safely?”

They always hit me where it hurt, but this time, I felt that 
Why I gotta prove myself to bitches that I’m better than?

If they hate you for being you, they not secure in they identity 
Me, myself, and I, she treat me like the Holy Trinity 
Fuck a Birkin, give you a business, boss you up, now you can buy ten of these 
Shit, whatever I say

I ain’t never had a problem keeping niggas
Now I’m done teaching niggas and I’m waiting on a winner
He could be a drug dealer or a boss in the city 
Work a nigga out in the back of the coupe

He like it when I dance in my heels with the cuffs
He tell me ride slow ‘cause he tryna make love
I go, on and on and on it
Never let a broke ass nigga bone me 
Lying on your dick wit’ your whack homies
Is the same reason why you’re lonely
I keep a lil' somethin' in the love run
In case a weak motherfucker wanna act hard

Playing telephone with that "He say" and that "She say"
Why in the hell are they fucking with the Huxtables?
Niggas turn 99, now they wanna say somethin'?
Just another hero turned to a zero
That is why they need to put more women in these lead roles

A little chilly, burrr
Well, I'm here to tell you that the weather may be getting cooler
But we're just heating up
Megan Thee Stallion, J-Fal 
Drop the beat
Staring outside, all the leaves are changing
Feeling kinda cold, can't stop complaining
Days getting shorter with that setting sun
Guess Hot Girl Summer is really done
Then my phone rings and I look to see
It says "Megan Thee Stallion" on the caller ID
She says...
Jimmy, you're not making any sense at all
After Hot Girl Summer comes...
No... you're not saying...
Hot Girl Fall, bitch, yeah, it's finally here

So wait, Megan? Can I do Hot Girl Fall too?
Umm, of course, Hot Girl Fall is for everyone
If I do Hot Girl Fall, is it called Hot Guy Fall?

Okay, that's cool
Hot Girl Fall is a state of mind
It's a jack-o-lantern filled to the brim with wine
It's sending sexy pics of your turkey breasts

Put my pen to the paper then I check these niggas 
Throw the heels on and seduce that boy

Tell your bitch calm down, don’t go so hard
Spit my verse how I sip my oil

Mwah
Ayy, ayy, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, mwahWhat does it mean to be a woman of color?
She's gotta be strong, because that's just the expectation
Loving herself, but not too much
Because then, she's conceited
Being his lady in the streets, but his freak in the sheets
Inheriting her grandma's love, but always loving the wrong one
Twerking for her man, but not with her friends?
Being constantly told she's "too much," or, "not enough"
The most disrespected person is the Black Woman
Constantly having to prove she's a victim because society sides with a man
Not being able to express her traumas because she can't show no weakness
Is constantly told that she's too dark, too thin, too thick
Too much of a bitch
Being murdered, beaten, abused
Then questioned if she evoked all of it
Is left out on the street to become the flower that grows from the concrete
Who taught you to hate yourself, from the top of your head, to the soles of your feet?
She marches for everyone else
Riots for everyone else
Dies for everyone else
She loves everyone else
Lives for everyone else
But when it comes down to her, it ain't a mothafucka in sight
The system as a whole has failed her
If you've never been shot, you don't know her pain
Say her name
Eighteen women of color murderedYou can keep hating, I'm poppin' regardless
You can keep hating, I'm poppin' regardless
You can keep hating, I'm poppin' regardless

Everybody thinkin' bad bitches got it easy
Well not the young ones on the grind gettin' greazy
Last week, I had to make a hunnid dollars stretch

You was dissin', you ain't see the vision, like your eyes was Christian
Tryna curse me, I just pray to God they keep the devil off me
Stalli don't bend or fold for no ho
Don't give convo to those I don't know
Niggas try to play me close to get my info
Only time I disclose is when I disrobe
Never gave a fuck , never gave a damn 
And I'ma keep on grindin' till these hoes know who I am
And I will come and take you for a hold of my hand
And bitch, I best not catch you lookin' at my fuckin' man 
And when I'm with my crew , just be cool

Goin' out there to screwed up records and tapes 
It ain't hot if it ain't chopped 
And the shit ain't cool if the shit ain't screwed
And the shit gon' flop if it can't make the trunk pop
Or the doors knock like the cops at the trap spot

Sting you with that burner and that bitch ain't gon' make no noise 
Southside broads actin' bad on they ass

Megan Thee Stallion ft. THIMBO
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down inside of me
Quick jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be
I run down on him 'fore I have a nigga running me
Talk your shit, bite your lip
Ask for a car while you ride that dick 
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang
He already made his mind up 'fore he came
Now get your boots and your coat
For this wet ass pussy
He bought a phone just for pictures
Of this wеt ass pussy
Pay my tuition just to kiss me
On this wet ass pussy
Now make it rain if you wanna
See somе wet ass pussy
Whore in this house that's me, he wanna slide it in, to this Wet Ass Pussy

Shakin ass like imma hoe
All this stripper money all on the flo' I twerk on it, I grind on it, split on the dick and now you know
Me and Stallion awn the beat, don't fuck with Cardi she smell like feet
Like JB, I'm a beauty on this beat
Yo' nigga want me, to my pics he beat his meat
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheating
Put him on his knees, give him something to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm looking for a beating
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make you bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask, "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name
Ah
Thimbo
