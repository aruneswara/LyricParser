Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Land in Miami
The air was hot from summer rain
Sweat drippin' off me
Before I even knew her name, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah, no
Sapphire moonlight
We danced for hours in the sand
Tequila Sunrise
Her body fit right in my hands, la-la-la
It felt like ooh-la-la-la, yeah
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
Locked in the hotel
There's just some things that never change
You say we're just friends
But friends don't know the way you taste, la-la-la 
'Cause you know it's been a long time coming
Don't ya let me fall, oh
Ooh, when your lips undress me, hooked on your tongue
Ooh, love, your kiss is deadly, don't stop
I love it when you call me señorita
I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call me señorita

For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for yaI wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessing 
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessing
And maybe I should stop and start confessing, confessing, yeah
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
There's nothing holdin' me back
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
'Cause if we lost our minds and we took it way too far
I know we'd be alright, I know we would be alright
If you were by my side and we stumbled in the dark
I know we'd be alright, we would be alright
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me back 
There's nothing holdin' me back
I feel so free when you're with me, baby
Baby, there's nothing holdin' me backHelp me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood, oh
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my bloodAll it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
Oh, I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind 
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight

Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mindI won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me too
I just wanna give you the loving that you're missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
'Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he canI can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing, everything means nothing, babe
I'm trying to move on, forget you, but I hold on
Everything means nothing if I can't have you, no
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinkin' about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you? 
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?You've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging youI thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitchesHere I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Waking up to headlines, filled with devastation again
My heart is broken, but I keep going
Pain, but I won't let it turn into  hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth  away 
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth awayYou put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath 
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up 
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down 
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done 
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one 
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
What if I, what if I trip? 
What if I, what if I fall? 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know 
And what if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know

Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes

Been dreamin' that you feel it too

Dirty secrets that I keep
Does he know it's killing me?
He knows, he knows
D-d-does he know
Another's hands have touched my skin?
I won't tell him where I've been
He knows, he knows, he knows
It's tearing me apart
She's slipping away 
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?
The pictures on her phone
She's not coming home 
Coming home, coming home

Just lied to me, "There's no other"

When she looks me in the eyes
They don't seem as bright
No more, no more
I know
That she loved me at one time
Would I promise her that night
Cross my heart and hope to die
It's tearing me apart 
She's slipping away 
Am I just hanging on to all the words she used to say?

No blinds in the place where I live
Daybreak, open your eyes
'Cause this was only ever meant to be for one night
Still, we're changing our minds here
Be yours, be my dear
So close with you on my lips
Touch noses, feeling your breath
Push your heart and pull away, yeah
Be my summer in a winter day, love
I can't see one thing wrong
Between the both of us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby
You  are bringing out a different kind of me
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you
Fast forward a couple years, yeah
Grown up in the place that we live
Make love, then we fight
Laugh 'cause it was only meant to be for one night, baby
I guess we can't control
What's just not up to us
Be mine, be mine, yeah
Anytime, anytime
Ooh, you know I've been alone for quite a while, haven't I?
I thought I knew it all
Found love but I was wrong
More times than enough
But since you came along
I'm thinking, baby
You  are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in you
Every time I see you, baby, I get lost
If I'm dreaming, baby, please don't wake me up
Every night I'm with you, I fall more in love
Now I'm laying by your side
Everything feels right since you came along
I'm thinking, baby
You, yeah, are bringing out a different kind of me 
There's no safety net that's underneath
I'm free
Fallin' all in you 
Fell for men who weren't how they appear 
Trapped up on a tightrope, now we're here
We're free
Fallin' all in...You said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
You didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where  were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?I saw you on a Sunday in a café
And all you did was look my way
And my heart started to race
And my hands started to shake, yeah
I heard you asked about me through a friend
My adrenaline kicked in
'Cause I've been askin' 'bout you too
And now we're right here in this room
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Talk a little too much around you
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe
We walked in the rain a couple blocks to your apartment
You told me to come inside, caught me staring in your eyes
And I'm not usually like this
But I like what you're doing to me, ah, what you're doing to me
I get a little bit nervous around you
Get a little bit stressed out when I think about you
Get a little excited
Baby, when I think about you, yeah
Yeah, when I think about you, babe 
Talk a little too much around you
Get a little self-conscious when I think about you

You walk on by my house, I wanna call out your name
I wanna tell you how beautiful you are from where I'm standin'
You got me thinkin' what we could be 'cause
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever
In my dreams you're with me, we'll be everything I want us to be
And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time
Or is that just me and my imagination?
We walk, we laugh, we spend our time walking by the ocean side
Our hands are gently intertwined, a feeling I just can't describe
And all this time we spent alone thinkin' we cannot belong
To something so damn beautiful, so damn beautiful
I keep craving, craving, you don't know it but it's true
Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to you
This is typical of love, I can't wait anymore, won't wait
I need to tell you how I feel when I see us together forever

And from there, who knows?
Maybe this will be the night that we kiss for the first time

Can't get my mouth to say the words they wanna say to youI know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to her, and I know
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I'm afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don't know why I won't admit that you're all I want
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?

I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to you"Don't cry" - or do
Whatever makes you comfortable
I’m tired too, there's nothin' left to say
Let’s call the truce, 'cause I don't really wanna go to bed like this
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I
I don't know what it’s like to be you
I don’t know what it's like but I’m dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Can I kiss you or not? 'Cause I’m not really sure right now of what you want
Are you still mad at me?
I'm hopin' not
'Cause maybe we could go to the movies, I know that always cheers us up, hey
I'm so sorry
That we're still stuck in the middle
Yeah, I'm so sorry
'Cause in the moment I
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
Tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I get worried
I might lose you a little
Every time we
Every time we argue and get caught up in the moment
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like but I'm dying to
If I could put myself in your shoes
Then I'd know what it's like to be you
So tell me what's inside of your head
No matter what you say I won't love you less
And I'd be lying if I said that I do
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's like to be you
I don't know what it's likeI think it's time that I be honest
Should've told you not to go
Thought I knew just what I wanted
I didn't know myself at all
You're with somebody I can't be, yeah
But I can tell that you're happy
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget
But loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you
Hey, remember when I told you
That you and I, we'd go down in history together, yeah
And does your sister ask about me?
You and I, what we had, is it gone forever?
You're with somebody I can't be
But I can tell that you're happy
It's time for me to finally meet somebody new
Take her to all the places that I took us to
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I could never do
Because I had, because I had you
There's nothin', oh
There's nothin' left to lose 
Because I had you, babe
There's nothin'
Nothin' that I could do 
I wish I had you
But I think it's time I finally found somebody new
And tell myself that she's the one to get me through
And she might help me forget but loving her is something I just couldn't do
Because I had youI promise that one day I'll be around
I'll keep you safe, I'll keep you sound
Right now it's pretty crazy
And I don't know how to stop or slow it down
Hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now
Take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone
When you miss me close your eyes
I may be far, but never gone
When you fall asleep tonight, just remember that we lay under the same stars
And hey, I know there are some things we need to talk about
And I can't stay, just let me hold you for a little longer now
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
You'll never be alone, you'll never be alone
And take a piece of my heart and make it all your own
So when we are apart, you'll never be alone, you will never be aloneMaybe I had too many drinks, but that's just what I needed
I hope that you don't think that what I'm saying sounds conceited
When I look across the room and you're staring right back at me
Like somebody told a joke and we're the only ones laughin'
Don't know why I try 'cause ain't nobody like you
Familiar disappointment every single time I do
And every single night my arms are not around you
My mind's still wrapped around you

And I don't want to take that away
How many times can I see your face?
How many times will you walk away?

But I'm worried that your heart might feel the same
And I have to be honest with you baby
Tell me if I'm wrong, and this is crazy
But I got you this rose
And I need to know
Will you let it die or let it grow?
Die or let it go?
It's not that I don't care about the love you have
It's not that I don't want to see you smile

I'm wondering if anyone's there, yeah
And I really need to make a confession
I hate to say that I'm a little bit scared, yeah-eh-ehh
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People getting off and on
Prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand
I'm callin' all my friends after midnight, yeah
To remind 'em that I'll always be there for them
It gets lonely when there's no one to talk to
But it's good to know that somebody care-ares
'Cause I've been on this train too long
People gettin' off and on
I'm prayin' that I don't forget where I belon-ong
And every time I ask myself
Am I turnin' into someone else?
I'm prayin' that I don't forget just who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just wanna understand, yeah
Oh yeah-eh-ehh
'Cause we all get lost sometimes, yeah-eh I know
Yeah we all get lost sometimes
But don't leave your heart behind, no yeah-eh

Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I am
When you wake up, your whole world's flipped
It's just different, and you gotta, you know you gotta, you gotta go with it
And, that's just simply growing up
And not see it in a negative way
You have to see it as it's been given to you
I mean, as much as times can be crazy
You're gonna feel like that's where you're supposed to be
You're not going to feel out of place anymore
You're going to feel like that's where you meant to be
You don't have to pretend that it's easy all the time
You just let it go, and, and grow with it
And you can't hold on, to the old you, or the old this, or the old that
Because, you know, you change, and it's not changing in a bad way
It's just changing because that's what happens in life
You grow up, everyone moves on
You're just learning
You stay true to yourself
Changing isn't a bad thing, it never was
But at the end of the day, you know?
You're the same person
And, and where your heart is
That doesn't change
And every time I ask myself
Am I turning into someone else?
And I just pray to God that I'm still who I am-am
I really wanna understand
I just gotta understand, yeah-eh-ehhhh-ehhh-ehhhhh
Now I just need to, I need to understand
I really wanna understand, ohh, who I amRe-rewind Friday night, never forget it, how you let me go
No more lies, I'll be fine, know where I'm headed, probably shoulda known
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Fool me once, told you twice, gonna regret it, now you're all alone, yeah
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Close your eyes, you can't hide, try to forget me, but I'm everywhere
I'm the smell on your sheets you weren't ready when you left me there
And now you're gonna say, "Pretty please forgive me"
Yeah, bet it hurts it gets worse, you know nobody, said it would be fair, oh
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
And now there's something in your way
'Cause you threw it all to waste
And you wonder if you could take back what you did that day
And it hurts 'cause
Turns out that no one can replace me
I'm permanent, you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me, one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste
Truth is that no one can replace me
I'm permanent you can't erase me
I'll have you remember me one more kiss is all it takes
I'll leave you with the memory and the aftertaste and the aftertasteShe would not show that she was afraid
But being and feeling alone was too much to face
Though everyone said that she was so strong
What they didn't know is that she could barely carry on
But she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
She would always tell herself, she could do this
She would use no help it would be just fine
But when it got hard she would lose her focus
So take my hand, it will be alright
And she knew that she would be okay
So she didn't let it get in her way
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much
But you gotta realize that soon the fog will clear up
And you don't have to be afraid, because we're all the same
And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much, yeah

And we know that sometimes it all gets a little too much
Sometimes, it all gets a little too much

But you still pick up and leave the bed
You speak low so he can't hear
And it gives me hope there's something left

Two-sides of the story, it all depends
And I'll say it once and I'll say it again
It'll only end up hurting me
Years flew by, I was less than twelve
Long division, I need your help

But it feels like there was something from the moment that we touched
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
The way you’re lighting up the room caught the corner of my eye
We can both sneak out the back door, we don’t have to say goodbye
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To waste time tonight
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be cool if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Said your place is kinda close and your 'rents are out of town
Baby there’s no pressure, but if you’re down I’m down
Cause it’s alright, it’s alright
To just talk tonight
If you’re feeling kinda crazy, turn down the lights
We can take our time, do whatever you like
It’s alright, it’s alright
I wanna make you mine
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
If this is what it’s like falling in love
Then I don’t ever wanna grow up
Maybe I’m just a kid in love
Maybe I’m just a kid in love, oh baby
It’d be fine if it was the two of us
But I don’t ever wanna grow up
Cause I got it all and I got it all
But I don’t ever wanna grow up

Purple, red, and yellow, I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just shut my eyes, all I have to do
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Hello, hello, hello, walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off the petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to me, yeah
I'm no good at waiting, all the separation
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep
Oh, baby, when I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
And all I have to do
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream 
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About youOh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
And you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself
You, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone
Oh yeah And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
Everywhere that I go
I see your face and it kills me to know
That you'll never know what you did to me
And now you're gone, yeah, I can't stop thinking about you
Cause I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your name
Yeah I don't even know your name
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
I'm running, I'm searching, and I don't know where to start
I'm dying, my love, you punched a hole right through my heart
And I won't stop, stop looking until I hold you in my arms
Cause I'm running, I'm running, I'm running
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day
Cause I don't even know your nameWhen I wake up to your footsteps
As you get up out of bed
They make a song that sounds so simple
But it dances in my head
A melody so perfect
That it gets me through the day
And the thought of us forever
Is one that won't ever go away
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
So let's hold on together
To this paper and this pen
And write down every letter
To every word we've ever said
All I need to know is
Where to start
Take my hand and show me forever
So never will I ever let you go
Let's write our story
And let's sing our song
Let's hang our pictures on the wall
All these precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after all
Memories after all
Memories after all
You know
You gave me hope
But I've got to let go
I've got to let go, oh
It's taking its toll
Deep in my soul
Now I've got to let go
We wrote our story
And we sang our songs
We hung our pictures on the wall
Now those precious moments
That we carved in stone
Are only memories after allIt's a fairytale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
It's always been you, yeah
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back toYou have a million different faces
But they'll never understand
Unless you let them in
You've been a million different places
So I guess I'll have a chance to
Get lost in wonderland It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
You're my sunlight on a rainy day
Would take my heart with you if you walked away
I'm a mess right now, I'm a wreck right now
I'm waiting for the moment that you let me down
If you cut the cord, I don't know what I'd do
Don't wanna skydive without my parachute
I'm a mess right now, baby, help me out
I'm scared I'm gonna wake up and you'll let me down
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life
If there's a door to heaven, baby, you're the key
And if I had to beg, I'd be on my knees
Oh, please don't say anything has changed
You're the one I wanna wake up next to every day
This feeling doesn't fade no matter how hard that I try
I always think about it at the same time every night
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure in my life
I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life
I want to be with you
I want to fly with you
I want to be with you
It's 3:05
I'm on a rollercoaster ride
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, never been so sure
Baby, I'm terrified
You'll turn around and say goodbye
Hoping you don't change your mind
I don't wanna let go, I've never been so sure in my life 
Ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh-oohRight now, I'm alone inside the airport
And you're all at a bar in our hometown
Feels like we've been living different lives
The music's loud and everybody's dancing
How many nights I've missed, yeah, I've lost count
Haven't seen your faces in a while
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
I don't wanna miss another birthday
Feels like it's been forever since nineteen
I just wanna be right where you are
I miss how it was when we wishеd we were oldеr
Feeling so far when I wanna be closer
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friends
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
Ooh, don't wanna be alone for one more night
Ooh, I know you gotta make some sacrifices
But I should call my friends
I should call my friends
I should call my friends and go get high
I need a vacation from my mind
I wanna go, nobody knows me better than them
Wanna feel something again
I should call my friendsI watch your troubled eyes as you rest
And I fall in love with every breath
Wonder if those eyes are really shut
And 'am I the one you're dreaming of?'
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takes
You keep on telling me I'm wasting time
But to call it wasting time, oh that's a crime
And you think it's crazy what I'm tryna do
Well baby, I'm a fool for you
Cause underneath the darkness
There's a light that's trying so hard to be seen
And I know this cause I’ve noticed
A little bit shining through the seams
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls that are in our way
Cause if you don't understand yet
Then I'll never let you forget
That you don't have to do this on your own
I'll be your shoulder to lean on
I'll be your right when you feel wrong
So come on, take my hand, we're moving on
And if this is what it takes then let me be the one to bear the pain
If this is what it takes
I'll break down these walls, these walls that are in our way
If this is what it takesThink I don't need a watch to tell the time
Think I don't need the sun to help me shine
Think I don't need a girl to be alright
Guess I didn't know
Thought I didn't need shoes on my feet
Thought I didn't need a bed to fall asleep
Thought I didn't need love to be complete
Guess I didn't know
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
You're all I think about when I'm awake
Part of every night and every day
And everything's a mess when you're away
Now I know
All of this is getting really old
I'm having trouble sleeping on my own
Feeling like a house but not a home
I want you to know
That I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for me, for me
Guess I need a watch to tell the time
Guess I need the sun to help me shine
And I really need you in my life
Now I know
That you give me this crazy feeling
And you won't have to wait no more for me, for me
And I just got this crazy feeling
I've been making someone wait for meYou can’t walk the streets at night
You're way too short to get on this ride
No I'm not, no I'm not, they're tryna tell me that I
I gotta be home when the street lights glow?
You can’t watch your TV show
I will watch what I wanna watch
No, I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
Watch me swim across this lake
Fly through the sky in my Superman cape
Watch me walk across this wire
Tip toe through the coals of a blazing fire
Watch me fly this kite in the rain
I’ll jump rope with my ball and chain
Come by and knock on my house of cards
If it falls I will build it from the start
I won’t listen to you, do what I wanna do
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, listen to me yell it loud
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
I don’t know what you heard about, see that door I'll knock it down
And I will walk this road ahead
One hundred miles on my hands
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
And if you don't believe me now
I'll flip the whole world upside down
Do I need to show you?
Guess I gotta show you
Do I really gotta show you now? Really, really, gotta show you now?
Do I really gotta spell it out? I-T, I spelled it out
Do you really wanna see me now? Watch me walk across the clouds
Do I need to show you? Guess I gotta show youPlease don't tell me that he's just a friend
Don't you touch me and act all innocent
'Cause when you're sitting on my bed
And you look at me like that
It's easy to forget
Please don't lie, we got too much to lose
And pretend he means nothing to you
And you could try to make it right
But it's not so black and white
Oh, I've got nothing left
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
And does he love you like the way I did?
And was it worth it the night you spent with him?
How could you go and risk it all?
Blame it on the alcohol
Now you can save your breath
Oh, you can save your breath
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
It doesn't make it any better
When you say, "It's not my fault"
I really thought I knew you better
Guess I don't know you at all
And I've been trying my best to forgive you
But you messed it up one too many times
And when you come to me with tears in your eyes
I can't feel bad this time
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfied
I hope you're satisfiedAll it'd take is one flight
We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy
I just wanna see ya
All I gotta ask
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
Oh, oh
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
I could feel the tension
We could cut it with a knife
I know it's more than just a friendship
I can hear you think I'm right, yeah
Do I gotta convince you?
That you shouldn't fall asleep?
It'll only be a couple hours
And I'm about to leave
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind

Oh, oh
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight?
I'm a couple hundred miles from Japan, and I
I was thinking I could fly to your hotel tonight
'Cause I-I-I can't get you off my mind
I can't get you off my mind
Do you got plans tonight, baby?
I was hoping I could get lost in your paradise
The only thing I'm thinking 'bout is you and I
And I-I can't get you off my mind
Can't get you off my mind
I can't seem to get you off my mind, yeah
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mind
Let's get lost tonight
Let's get lost tonight 
Baby, you and
I can't seem to get you off my mindYeah, it makes me wanna cry
Don't know what to do
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece
I get reckless, I'm obsessive
I'm pathetic and possessive
You're so sure it makes me insecure
You're majestic, mesmerizin'
Light the room up without tryin'
Baby, I'm so into you, it hurts
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share
Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piecе
One, two, three
So do I, maybe I'm selfish
Just onе touch is so electric
Every little thing you do feels right, yeah
I'm sorry if I get protective
Need these boys to get the message
You know I'm yours, I know you're mine
Everybody wants a piece of you, yeah
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a piece
It's so hard, but it's true
It's so hard, but it's true
Everybody wants a piece
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, it just isn't fair
What you put in the air
I don't wanna share
Everybody wants a piece of you
I get jealous, but who wouldn't when you look like you do?
From the second you walked in the room, my night is ruined
Everybody wants a pieceOh
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving and might never come back
Hmm, I was dreaming of a warmer place
And if I made it, it'd be okay
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California
All those dreams that, one by one came true
Felt like nothing, cause I wasn't with you
And tell me what that means
And tell me why am I dying
Thought this was what I needed
But that was a mistake
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in California
You were crying, when I told you that
I was leaving, now I wanna come back
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
The sun is out, the sky is bright
People come and go with smiles
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California, yeah
And waves of heat from the concrete
The sand is burning on my feet
Yet, I'm still freezing cold in California
Without you I'm freezing cold in CaliforniaTaking it slow isn't easy if as far as you go
Is only half as far as you and I both know, yeah
Coming up from above, a little something
And it's only because I don't ever wanna see you in love
But I know
That you've been coming off strong lately and I can feel it that
You've been thinking that maybe, you got a
Another shot at me, thinking possibly somehow, but not now
And it's been spinning around like a hurricane
And the sound of the thunder that's beating my head to the ground
But I, I know
That I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
And I mean if you believe
That there is something still between you and me
Then baby honestly yeah, you're not the one for me
And I can't go back to this, to her
To what we used to have, it's black and burnt
My God this is so sad, it'll only make things worse
If we bring it back
If we bring it back, no
If we bring it back, oh
If we bring it back
If we bring it backI wake up a little drunk
Check my phone, I'm all alone
Ten missed calls, a couple texts
None of them are who I'm lookin' for
Who I'm lookin' for, yeah
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one
Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes, things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone, someone I adore
This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one
Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't have
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocate those feelings

I start to lose my sense of home
I should've called so many times but I
I just sat next to my phone
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Thinking back to every night
That we just laid there for a while
And when I looked into your eyes
I never thought I'd say goodbye
Just know it takes it from me
To end this darling, oh
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
Just needed time to, to find my own
But I promise someone will give you all you want
Can give you all you need
And you just gotta see
I never meant to hurt you, no
And I know you'll find someone who
Gives you the time I didn't give to you
I'm running low
I'm sorry, but I have to go
And maybe I will never feel
You gave me something so real
I'm sorry, but I have to goOh, I don't understand it when you talk like that
Swear I thought you were joking and that's why I laughed
'Cause it sounds like you wasted but it's 10 am
Maybe I'm going crazy, but I don't think I am
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
And the rest was just wobbling
Girl I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Girl I can't understand you when you act like that
Yeah your eyes are looking through me, like I'm made of glass
And my lips try to kiss you, but you don't kiss back
No, I don't understand you when you act like that
Give me just a smile
Baby stop playing with me
Am I in denial?
Maybe
But lately everything has been perfect
And your friends seem to trust me
And you told me you love me
Than the rest was just wobbling
Oh, I try and I try but still can't decipher the words that you're saying
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your language
Kinda sounds like goodbye and it's over but I guess I don't speak your languageSo you leave tomorrow, just sleep the night
I promise I will make things right
I'll make you breakfast, the way you like
Before you leave tomorrow, just let me try
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you say goodbye
Before you leave tomorrow
Before you leave
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just one more night lying in bed
Whether it's wrong or right, just gotta make sense of it
And you'll be gone in the morning and you'll be over this
Just one more night so I can forget
Stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
When you go, I can't watch you leave
Just promise me you'll sneak out when I'm asleep
And when you go, and you're miles down the road
I wake up wishing everything was just a dream
Just stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone
And I am keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on and stay here and lay here right in my arms
It's only a moment before you're gone and I, I'm keeping you warm
Just act like you love me so I can go on
And act like you love me so I can go on
Just act like you love me so I can go onLook up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
It's a Friday night
And the streetlights are all saying your name
They always say your name
Before you go home, I should let you know
I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late
But look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down
I am feeling so lucky 
The sun shining down on me 
Got these angels all around mе
I'll never be alonе
Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down
Finally we've met, now the lights are set
It's taken us 'til now
To be together in this town, yeah
A couple of years we've been making plans
Somehow you always seem to understand
So let me spend the night in wonderland with you
I am feeling so lucky 
The sun shining down on me 
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone
Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you downI've been roaming around, always looking down at all I see
Painted faces fill the places I can’t reach
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah, you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you and all you know and how you speak
Countless lovers undercover on the street
You know that I could use somebody
Yeah you know that I could use somebody
Someone like you
Someone like you
Someone like you 
Off in the night, while you live it up, I'm off to sleep, no
Waging wars to shape the poet and the beat
I hope it's gonna make you notice, yeah
I hope it’s gonna make you notice
Someone like me 
Someone like me 
Someone like me 
You know that I could use somebody
I've been roaming around, always looking down at all I seeI've lost my way
And day by day
Playing tough is hard enough
When the sun is out
Tougher in rain
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
And if I've lost my way 
Still standing straight 
I'm looking up to find I'm tough
When the sun goes down
And I feel the change
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
Yeah when I was little I was so sure of myself
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
Sure of my self 
Oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
And oh your touch
Stringing little pieces of me into us
Giving me the reason to give all my love
Making it okay to let go
When I was little I was so sure of myself 
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
'Cause when I was little I was so sure of myself
When I was little I was so sure of myself 
Yeah I knew so little but I felt with every cell
And as I grow older my fears grow old as well
When I was little I was so sure of myself I walk down the street and all I can see
Is people taking pictures of what they're 'bout to eat
Did you even notice the girl sitting across from you?
I sit in your room with nothing to do
Victim to the screen between me and you
Guess there's somebody else that you'd rather be talking to
Hold on, time out, help me
'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lost
We go out to shows, but why do we go
If we're only gonna see it through the screens on our phones?
If we're all here together, then why are we watching alone?
The world's so much bigger than posing for pictures
If all that we need's at the tip of our fingers
Then how did this happen that we all fell so out of touch?
Hold on, time out, help me
'Cause right now I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
Tell me how it feels 'cause I know the hardest part
Is when you're holding something real, you can see it in the dark
I'll tell you how it feels and here's the hardest part
If you wanna reach for something real, you gotta see it in the dark
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
And nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost in this moment, keep both my eyes open
Nothing to prove, let's keep this to ourselves
And yeah, this connection has caught my attention
I don't wanna share this with anybody else
I wanna get lost
I wanna get lost
And I wanna get lostTime warp in the middle of a daydream
Call you up ‘cause the time is wasting
Last drive, we got nowhere to go
Fear not, yeah, welcome to the jungle
Think fast, move quick, don’t stumble
We can’t do this alone
Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
We’re young livin' with no fear
Kids runnin' wild, girls cryin' drunk tears
We don’t have this time for long
Yeah, we make big plans, spending all our change
Caught up in the night, oh, we missed the last train
It’s that time, and we’re leaving, home
Where do we go? We don’t know
Follow the wind, where it blows
Let’s make mistakes and don’t look back
It’s now or never
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
Go home it’s over, but it’s not the end
Don’t wait ‘til you’re older to begin
Keep your composure and innocence
Where do we go? We don’t know
One of those nights, we’re driving around
In this boring ass town
One of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights we felt invincible
And every glass was full, one of those nights
One of those nights, dancing in the stars
Thought that the world was ours, one of those nights
I wanna hold on tight to a little of this
The kinda night you don’t wanna miss
Time of our lives, one of those nights
One of those nights, where she turns the lights down
And it’s only us now, one of those nightsWe run about a million miles an hour
And I do my best to try to do it in style
Haven't seen you in a while, girl
Our love is on trial
You run wild, you run wild
When I call you, you never wanna pick up
'Cause everything that I do is never, ever enough
You only like it when it rains
And when I'm stuck in the mud
You run wild, you run wild, yeah
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love
I'm not asking for much, I'm just tryna be fair
This road we're on is going nowhere
If we keep on running like a couple of kids
Who just get lost in the woods and now they're losing their wits
I'm overcome with it, this is ridiculous
How every time we get together, you're the one I miss?
I feel powerless and I don't want to split
You run wild, you run wild
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, yeah
Whoa-oh
That's it, it's now or never, I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
That's it, it's now or never, and I can't do this forever
'Cause all this stormy weather's got me running wild
Yeah
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
Don't want your love, want your love
But I just can't get enough
You mess me up, you lay me out on the floor
You mess me up, and still I come back for more
Don't want your loveSomething that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs, yeah
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get you out off my mind
Ohhh yeahh
I see you in the morning
Going down the street
I wanna say something
But I can't move my feet
Yeah ohhh-oh
Something that's pushing me
Just can't take you needs
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her out off my mind
She's a badass girl
Taking over the world
One step at a time
Can't get her off my mind, oh
Can't get her off my mind
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mind, yeah
Can't get her off my mindYou've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Oh, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your string
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
I'm begging you, begging you, please, baby
I'm begging you for mercy, mercy
Ooh, I'm begging you, I'm begging youGuess there's something about it
That I can't explain
We could see other people
But it's never the same
You could be in Toronto
And I could be in L.A
And we could wait too long
But it's never too late
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We tried to deny it
Ever since we were kids
Yeah, we both tried to fight it
But we never win
We tell everybody, yeah
That we were just friends
But the more that I kiss you
The less it makes sense
And if twenty years went by without you
I'd know our feelings wouldn't change
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
Oh, we got it, oh, we got it
Oh, we got that different kind of love
We've got that different kind of love
That's stronger than the both of us
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love
We've got that
We don't have to talk
To know this love will never stop
No matter what
We've got that different kind of love

Without you, all the birds would stop their songs
Without you, all things right would feel so wrong
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world would be
Without you, I'd always be alone
Without you, I don't know where to go
I can't imagine what a world would be
No, I can't imagine what a world could be
I can't imagine what a world would be
I can't imagine
I can't imagine, no
I can't imagine, no, what a world would be
Without you
I'd always be alone
I'd always be alone
Cool, that's good for nowHelp me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
O sonho que trago comigo
Se acreditar sonho contigo
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Eu vou acreditar
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could...
Help me, it's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me

And I want you to know all the things that I think about
Can I let it out?
Cause I want you to be there

And I love him so, Cameron DallasSaid, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
Said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
Look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
Where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?
How do you, how do you just walk away, yeah?
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this, baby
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
Look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you?
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
I keep wondering why
Where were you in the morning, baby?
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waiting
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
Where were, where were you, yeah?
Oh, oh-yeahDay after day
I will walk and I will play
But the day after today
I will stop and I will start
I've given you a decision to make
Things to lose, things to take
Just as she's about ready to cut it up
She says "Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!"
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!
Add it up! Add it up! Add it up!
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight
Oh ma-mama, mama mo-ma-mum
Take a look now at what your boy has done
He's walking around like he's number one
Went downtown and bought him a gun
So don't you shoot that thing at me
Don't you shoot that thing at me
You know you got my sympathy
But don't you shoot that thing at me
Day after day
I get angry and I will say
That the day is in my sight
When I'll take a bow
And say goodnight
Add it up! Add it up!
Wait a minute honey, I'm add it up!Here I am, stuck on this couch scrolling through my notes
Heart was broken, still not growing, nah
Why is it always televised? They want me desensitized
I won't do it, I won't do it, mhm
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
Never losing sight of the one I keep inside
Now, I know it, yeah, I know it
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
It's hard to sleep at night, knowing what's outside
Feeling hopeless, I need focus
You have died inside, and your soul's not worth the price
Don't you lose it for this foolishness, no
You hit me with words I never heard come out your mouth
To be honest, I don't want it, no
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
No, I won't let it change me
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
Oh, yeah
How come certain boys in blue
Can be so quick to shoot?
You gotta be the change that you want to see
Pain, but I won't let it turn into hate
You gotta be the heaven you want to see
No, I won't let it change me 
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away 
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today 
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth away
This soul of mine will never break
As long as I wake up today
You can't take my youth away
You can't take my youth awayMy head is underwater
I can't do this much longer
I lose my mind when I think that it's overI beg that you read, 'cause I don't know where to start
Though we never met, I know who you really are
Three in the morning and I should be asleep
I'm lying in bed, watching you sing to me
I love you, oh, you're so perfect
You must feel this too
I'm waiting on your intermission
You and I will be together soon
Lee Anne holds me again
Lee Anne, you’re my biggest fan
Yet I know that this needle in my heart 
I'm feeling your true love
Lee Anne
Do you even care, can you never hold back?
Now that you're famous, mister too-cool-for-that
My boyfriend got jealous that I got your name tattooed
He don't understand me the way that you do
I love you, oh, you're so perfect
You must feel this too
I'm waiting on your intermission
You and I will be together soon
Lee Anne holds me again

You got me addicted
But you still leave me in pieces, woah, yeah
Even though you're my obsession
You may never be my possession
You are the freedom in my heart
You have the freedom of my heart
You are my blood running through my cold earth
My soul weans for you because I’m addictedYou're just too good to be true

I wanna hold you so much
At long last, love has arrived
And I just thank God I'm alive
You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
Pardon the way that I stare
There's nothin' else to compare
The sight of you leaves me weak
There are no words left to speak
So if you feel how I feel

You're just too good to be true
Can't take my eyes off of you
I love you, baby
And if it's quite alright

I need you, baby
For the lonely nights
I need you baby
Just know that it's true, yeah
Oh, pretty baby
Don't hold me down, I pray
I need you baby
Now that I've found you, stay
And let me love you, baby
Let me love youChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe, mm-mm
Helps to make the seasons bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that , Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies for his sleigh
And every mother's child is gonna try
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da-da
Da-da, da-da-da-da-da
Ooh, ah-ooh
Ah
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from onе to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to youHelp me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

Afraid to be alone again, I hate this

Pressing down on you, no man ask for
Under pressure that burns a building down
Splits a family in two
Puts people on streets
Um ba ba be
Um ba ba be
De day da
Ee day da - that's okay
It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher
Pressure on people, people on streets

Chipping around, kick my brains 'round the floor
These are the days it never rains, but it pours

It's the terror of knowing what this world is about
Watching some good friends screaming, "Let me out"
Pray tomorrow gets me higher, higher, high
Turned away from it all like a blind man
Sat on a fence but it don't work
Keep coming up with love but it's so slashed and torn
Why—why—why?
Love, love, love, love, love
Insanity laughs under pressure we're breaking
Can't we give ourselves one more chance?
Why can't we give love that one more chance?
Why can't we give love, give love, give love, give love
Give love, give love, give love, give love?
Because love's such an old fashioned word
And love dares us to care for
The people on the edge of the night
And love dares you to change our way of
Caring about ourselves
This is our last dance
This is our last dance
This is ourselves under pressure
Under pressure, yeah
Under pressure, uh

Elle prend le plus long chemin pour rentrer à la maison
Et tous mes amis l'ont vu nue

Des erreurs, on en fait tous
Mais ils ne veulent pas la laisser tranquille, non
Car elle a mauvaise réputation
Mais je sais ce qu'ils ne savent pas

Say, I remember how you felt on that day
But I forget all the faces except one
And what hurts the most is that I'll never know
What we could've been
But I guess that just means it wasn't fate
 
And I was like ooh, you waited so long
Sometimes it's hard to stand out
But you don't have to do anything else
But be yourself, woah, clap those hands!
Oh, you dressed up so nice
But all I could see was your eyes
Then the crowd came and pulled you away
Then you were gone, woah, woah, yeah
And I don't even know your name
All I remember is that smile on your face
And it'll kill me every day, no, no, no
Cause I don't even know your name

A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven
I don't wanna waste the weekend
If you don't love me, pretend
A few more hours, then it's time to go
And as my train rolls down the east coast
I wonder how you keep warm
It's too late to cry, too broken to move on
Still I can't let you be
Most nights I hardly sleep
Don't take what you don't need, from me
Just a drop in the ocean
A change in the weather
I was praying that you and me might end up together
It's like wishing for rain as I stand in the desert
But I'm holding you closer than most
Cause you are my heaven
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away
Heaven doesn't seem far away anymore
Heaven doesn't seem far away

Show me an open door
You go and slam it on me
I can't take anymore
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Mm-mm-hm, mm-mm-hm, mm-mmm-hmm
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby
And heart open, testify

I'm not asking for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride, is all I got
I'm saying...
Baby, please have mercy on me
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice

It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
Laying on the bathroom floor, feeling nothing
I'm overwhelmed and insecure, give me something
I could take to ease my mind slowly
Just have a drink and you'll feel better
Just take her home and you'll feel better
Keep telling me that it gets better
Does it ever?
Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I'm looking through my phone again feeling anxious
Afraid to be alone again, I hate this
I'm trying to find a way to chill, can't breathe, oh
Is there somebody who could
Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
No medicine is strong enough
Someone help me
I'm crawling in my skin
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
I need somebody now
Someone to help me out
I need somebody now
Help me
It's like the walls are caving in
Sometimes I feel like giving up
But I just can't
It isn't in my blood

It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now
It isn't in my blood
I need somebody now

We'd be in the same time zone
Looking through your timeline
Seeing all the rainbows, I
I got an idea
And I know that it sounds crazy

Thank youI can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I'm in Toronto and I got this view
But I might as well be in a hotel room, yeah
It doesn't matter 'cause I'm so consumed
Spending all my nights reading texts from you
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
I can't write one song that's not about you
Can't drink without thinking about you
Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?
Thinking about you
Everything means nothing if I can't have you
I'm so sorry that my timing's off
But I can't move on if we're still gonna talk
Is it wrong for me to not want half?
I want all of you, all the strings attached
Oh, I'm good at keeping my distance
I know that you're the feeling I'm missing
You know that I hate to admit it
But everything means nothing if I can't have you
I can't write one song that's not about you

Is it too late to tell you that
Everything means nothing if I can't have you?She's a good girl, loves her mama
She loves Jesus and America too
She's a good girl, crazy about Elvis
She loves horses and her boyfriend too
Yeah, yeah
It's a long day living in Reseda
There's a freeway running through the yard
I'm a bad boy 'cause I don't even miss her
I'm a bad boy for breaking her heart
And I'm free
Free fallin'
And I'm free
Free fallin'
All the vampires walking through the valley
They move west down Ventura Boulevard
And all the bad boys are standing in the shadows
And the good girls are home with broken hearts
And I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Now I'm free
Free fallin', fallin'
Woah, I'm freeDid I just hear an alarm start ringing?
Did I see sirens go flying past?
Though I don't know what tomorrow's bringing
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
I'm gliding smooth as a figure skater
I'm riding hot as a rocket blast
I just expected it ten years later
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
And you say oh no
Step on the brakes
Do whatever it takes
But stop this train
Slow, slow the lights turning red
But I say no no
Whatever I do
I barrel on though
And I don't complain
No matter what I try
I'm flying full speed ahead
I'm never worried to walk the wire
I won't do anything just half assed
But with the stakes getting somewhat higher
I've got a singular impression
Things are moving too fast
I found a woman I love
And I found an agent who loves me
Things might get bumpy but some people analyze every detail
Some people stall when they can't see the trail
Some people freeze out of fear that they'll fail
But I keep rollin' on
Some people can't get success with their art
Some people never feel love in their heart
Some people can't tell the two things apart
But I keep rollin' on
And oh, maybe I can't follow through
But oh, what else am I supposed to do?
I dreamed of writing like the high and mighty
Now I'm the subject of a bidding war
I met my personal Aphrodite
I'm doing things I never dreamed of before
We start to take the next step together
Found an apartment on seventy-third
The Atlantic Monthly's printing my first chapter
Two thousand bucks without rewriting one word
I left Columbia and I don't regret it
I wrote a book and Sonny Mehta read it
My heart's been stolen
My ego's rolling
I just keep rollin' along...
And I think
Well, well, what else is in store?
Got all this and more before twenty-four
It's hard not to be sure
I'm spinning out of control
Out of control
I'm feeling panicked and rushed and hurried
I'm feeling outmaneuvered and outclassed
But I'm so happy I can't get worried
About this singular impression
I've got a singular impression things are moving too fastI thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help

I'll be needing stitches
I'll be needing stitches

        I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom, for me and you
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
I see skies of blue and clouds of white
The bright blessed day and the dark sacred night
And I just think to myself
Hmm, what a wonderful world, yeah
Where the colors of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people going by
I see friends shaking hands, saying, "How do you do?"
They're really just saying, "I love you"
I hear babies cry, I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself
What a wonderful world
Oh, I think to myself
What a wonderful world
It's still a wonderful world
All the pain that we've been through
All the fears and the hurt
I still think to myself
What a wonderful worldThis is, uh, one of those really special songs
Something, uh, a song that showed me how important lyrics are when writing music
And how important talking about something that actually happened to you
And talking about something that is true to your heart makes a great song and that's why I love this
And I hope you do too, this is called Three Empty Words
I'll pick you up at the same time
At the same place, the same old drive
We'll just talk about our day
To try to fill the awkward space tonight
We'll play the songs we used to love
While we try to fall in love again
We don't know who's wrong or right
We don't even care enough to fight
We're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No, I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We're still talking everyday
I'm running out of things to say to ya
What's really gonna break my heart
Is to have to tell your little brother
And it might be easier to stay
But it'll never be the same, no, yeah
And if something doesn't change
Then we'll keep on sinking further
Woah, we're going through the motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
No I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Those three empty words
Will only make things worse
I'm tired, I can't take this anymore
Those three empty words
Will only make things worse
We're tired, we can't take this anymore
We're going through motions
Cause we can't fix what's broken, yeah
And I know it's gonna hurt
But darling I'll go first
Cause I won't keep on saying those three empty words
We don't have to keeping on saying those three empty words
No I won't keep on saying those three empty words
Thank you so muchThis morning I was listening to your heartbeat
Singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers
Picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad
And darling, I know that it's dark, but you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm
This morning I was listening to your heartbeat
Singing songs
I see you right beside me, but you're hardly here at all
You hate me 'cause I'm pulling off the covers
Picking you up out of this bed
I promise that it's only 'cause I love you so bad
And darling, I know that it's dark, but you're safe out here in my arms
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the storm
And darling, I know that it's hard
Hold you close when it all falls apart
I'll be right by your side in the eye of the stormShawn Peter Raul Mendes  is a Canadian singer.

Artist manager Andrew Gertler discovered Mendes online in January 2014, bringing him to Island Records where he eventually signed and released his first single "Life of the Party" in June 2014. He is the youngest artist to debut in the top 25 with a debut song on the Billboard Hot 100, making to number 24 for the week ending July 12, 2014 at 15 years, 11 months and 4 days of age.

But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, I'm shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
I'm tripping over myself, I'm aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to the flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch

Thank you so muchI wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
I wonder why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong and nevеr said I was a saint
I wonder, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel likе it makes me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by youI thought that I've been hurt before
But no one's ever left me quite this sore
Your words cut deeper than a knife
Now I need someone to breathe me back to life
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Just like a moth drawn to a flame
Oh, you lured me in I couldn't sense the pain
Your bitter heart, cold to the touch
Now I'm gonna reap what I sow
I'm left seeing red on my own
Pre-Chorus]
Got a feeling that I'm going under
But I know that I'll make it out alive
If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Needle and the thread, gonna wind up dead
Needle and the thread, gotta get you out of my head
Get you out of my head
Chorus]
You watch me bleed until I can't breathe, shaking
Falling onto my knees
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Tripping over myself, aching
Begging you to come help
And now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitches
Now that I'm without your kisses
I'll be needing stitchesYou said, "I wanna get to know ya"
Why you gotta get my hopes up?
You said that you were staying over
But then I woke up to the cold air
How could you make me believe?
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin' 
Where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
And I thought you really felt this
When we were talking about breakfast
You made it seem like we connected
I guess I just didn't expect this
How could you make me believe? 
That there was something in between you and me, yeah
I look around and I don't see you
Where were you in the morning, baby? 
You didn't leave your number for me
Left me without a warning, waitin'
I said where were you in the morning, baby?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
And I hope you had a good reason
'Cause I know you had a good time
And I'm looking up at the ceiling
And I keep wondering why 
Where were you in the morning, baby?
Where were you in the morning?
You didn't leave your number for me
Didn't leave your number
Left me without a warning, waitin'
Left me without a warning
I said, where were you in the morning baby?
Where were you in the morning?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away? 
Where were, where were you?
How do you, how do you just walk away?
Where were, where were you?

If I quit calling you my lover
Move on
You watch me bleedWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cos we're just under the upperhand
And go mad for a couple of grams
But she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to flyI'm stuck inside this room, tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
Tryna play it cool while I'm looking for you
I didn't wanna go, but I had to let you know that I'm falling for you
I needa let you know that I'm falling for you
People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
I'm sober, I don't even care
I hope when I walk upstairs that I won't be let down
I just want to see you standing there
You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party
I came to this party
So, are you making moves? What you been up to?
It's killing me slowly
When all I wanna do Is get a second with you
The music's too loud, just wanna hear the sound of you singing softly
We can leave now, we got nothing to lose
People everywhere, I'm pushing through this crowd
Until we walk right out of here
You're the only reason I came to this party
So, I'm not gonna leave here with just anybody
Everybody's wasted on their phones
I wanna find a place we can be alone
'Cause you're the only reason I come to this party

Thank you so much guysWhen you try your best, but you don't succeed
When you get what you want, but not what you need
When you feel so tired, but you can't sleep
Stuck in reverse
And the tears come streaming down your face
When you lose something you can't replace
When you love someone, but it goes to waste
Could it be worse?
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
And high up above or down below
When you're too in love to let it go
But if you never try, you'll never know
Just what you're worth
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix you
Tears stream down your face
When you lose something you cannot replace
Tears stream down your face
And I
Tears stream down your face
I promise you I will learn from my mistakes
Tears stream down your face
And I
Lights will guide you home
And ignite your bones
And I will try to fix youYou've got a hold on me
Don't even know your power
I stand a hundred feet
But I fall when I'm around ya
Show me an open door
And you go and slam it on me
And I can't take any more
I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
And take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
No, you keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy, mercy on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, mercy, yeah, on my heart?
I'd drive through the night
Just to be near you, baby 
Heart open, testify
Tell me that I'm not crazy
I'm not askin' for a lot
Just that you're honest with me
And my pride is all I got
So I'm saying
Baby, please have mercy on me
And take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me
No, you keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?
And I'm a puppet on your strings
And even though you got good intentions
No, I need you to set me free
Would you please have mercy, mercy, yeah, on my heart?
Would you please have mercy, oh mercy yeah, on my heart?
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Consuming all the air inside my lungs
Ripping all the skin from off my bones
I'm prepared to sacrifice my life
I would gladly do it twice
Oh, please have mercy on me, yeah
Take it easy on my heart
Even though you don't mean to hurt me, say it!
You keep tearing me apart
Would you please have mercy on me?

I need you to set me free
I'm begging you for mercy, yeah, yeah
Would you please have mercy, yeah, mercy, ohI won't lie to you
I know he's just not right for you
And you can tell me if I'm off
But I see it on your face
When you say that he's the one that you want
And you're spending all your time
In this wrong situation
And anytime you want it to stop
I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
I'll stop time for you
The second you say you'd like me to
I just wanna give you the loving that you missing
Baby, just to wake up with you
Would be everything I need and this could be so different
Tell me what you want to do
Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time on all your wasted crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can
Better than he can
Give me a sign
Take my hand, we'll be fine
Promise, I won't let you down
Just know that you don't
Have to do this alone
Promise I'll never let you down
Cause I know I can treat you better than he can
And any girl like you deserves a gentleman
Tell me why are we wasting time
On all your wasting crying
When you should be with me instead
I know I can treat you better
Better than he can
Better than he can 
Better than he canI know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don’t mean nothing compared to her, and I know
When people ask about us, now, we just brush it off
I don't know why we act like it means nothing at all
I wish that I could tell you that you're all that I want, yeah
I pretend that
I’m not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
When I hear you sing, it gets hard to breathe
Can't help but think every song's about me
And every line, every word that I write
You are the muse in the back of my mind, oh
Don't wanna ask about it 'cause you might brush it off
I’m afraid you think that it means nothing at all
I don’t know why I won't admit that you’re all I want
I pretend that
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell?
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
I pretend that 
I'm not ready
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves? 
And you say "hi" like
You just met me
Why do we put each other through hell? 
Why can't we just get over ourselves?
I know a girl, she's like a curse
We want each other, no one will break first
So many nights, trying to find someone new
They don't mean nothing compared to youLately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Yeah, we'll be counting stars
I see this life
Like a swinging vine
Swing my heart across the line
In my face is flashing signs
Seek it out and ye shall find
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
I feel something so right
By doing the wrong thing
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayin' hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
I feel the love
And I feel it burn
Down this river every turn
Hope is our four letter word
Make that money
Watch it burn
Old, but I'm not that old
Young, but I'm not that bold
And I don't think the world is sold
I'm just doing what we're told
And I feel something so wrong
By doing the right thing
I couldn't lie, couldn't lie, couldn't lie
Everything that drowns me makes me wanna fly
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been prayig hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be, we'll be counting stars
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned
Take that money
Watch it burn
Sink in the river
The lessons I learned
Everything that kills me makes me feel alive
Lately I been, I been losing sleep
Dreaming about the things that we could be
But baby, I been, I been praying hard
Said no more counting dollars
We'll be counting stars
We'll be counting starsI'm way across the coast awake in bed
And I wonder "If I spoke
would you hear what I said?"
So I take a breath and hope you can
A feeling deep inside that no one sees
But for no one to understand but you and me tonight
Tell me that you'll take this chance
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you
Hold your heart to keep you close
Wherever you want just spin the globe
But we can have the time of our lives right here at home
Just breathe
And follow me on down this road
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for you
Promise to hold you close and be there everyday
I swear I love you more no matter what you say
And if we lost it all and there was nothing we could do
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best
Oh i'll try my best for you
Oh i'll try my best for youAnd we back
And we back
And we back
And we back
And we back
And we back
This ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll probably cry at my own service
Cause it was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
You know what I mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the words
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first
This is the third
This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got 
This is the music's all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we got
I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothing away
You gotta fight for your way
Doesn't take nothing away
Cause at the end of the day
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Music is all we got
So we might as well give it all we got
Cause this is all we gotHey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey
Because you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you
And you look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, heyI've heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this
The fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty
In the moonlight
Overthrew you
She tied you
To a kitchen chair
She broke your throne
She cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe I've been here before
I know this room, I've walked this floor
I used to live alone before I knew you
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not a victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, HallelujahWhoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
Pitter patter feet on this concrete
It's raining and the taxi cab won't wait for me
I'm a loner in my bottle and I'm lost at sea, whoa
People pushing fast, they must not see
See all the colors in world surrounding me
We are alone when we arrive and alone when we leave, oh whoa
Yeah
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
It's funny that we thought the world was flat
Little did we know that it comes right back
And you end up where you started, in the place you're at, whoa
Soon as you think you got it sorted out in your head
You gotta let it go and here your heart is dead
Because believing is not seeing, it's just feeling, yeah, whoa
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
You make me feel like loving you
You make me feel
Whoa, whoa
Whoa, whoa
You make me feel like loving you

I'll be the one if you want me to
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I am feeling so small
It was over my head
I know nothing at all
And I will stumble and fall
I'm still learning love
Just starting to crawl
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'm sorry that I couldn't get to you
Anywhere I would have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I will swallow my pride
You are the one that I want
And I'm saying goodbye
Say something, I'm giving up on you
And I'll be the one if you want me too
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
Say something, I'm giving up on you
I'll be the one if you want me too
Anywhere I could have followed you
Say something I'm giving up on youHello, hello, hello, can I hear an echo?
Purple, red, and yellow, I can't wait to get home
Head down on the pillow
Holding you is all I think about
You're asleep in London, I wish you were coming
Back home to me, darling, you're too far away
Count back from one hundred
Holding you is all I think about
Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
All I have to do
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Hello, hello, hello, walking through a meadow
Full of sunflowers, picking off thе petals
I don't wanna wake up without you laying next to mе, yeah
I'm no good at waiting, all the separating
Feeling suffocated, I just need to breathe
And I'm starting to hate it
I can't wait to fall asleep
Oh baby
When I'm apart from you
I just close my eyes
All I have to do
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
I dream about you, yeah
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About you
Dream, dream, dream, dream
About youGive me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love like never before
'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me or burn this out
We'll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, oh give me love
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my my, m-my my, give me love, lover
M-my my, m-my myIt's a fairytale I can't explain
Full of words I don't know how to say
And without a little twist of fate
I know I'd still be searching, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you
And you've seen all my darkest fears
Like you've known me for a thousand years, yeah
The boy who's really underneath
All the scars and insecurities, baby
I swear that you've been sent to save me
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to, yeah
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, it's always been you
It's always been you, yeah
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
Baby, yeah
It's always been you, yeah
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back to
It's always been you
It's always been you
It's always been you, baby
It's always been you
It's always been
It's always been you
You're the only one that my heart keeps coming back toYou have a million different faces
But they'll never understand
Unless you let them in
You've been a million different places
So give yourself a chance to
Get lost in wonderland
Woo
WoahI'm sorry if I seem uninterested
No I'm not listenin' or I'm indifferent
And truly, I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here
I just came to kick it but really
I would rather be at home all by myself not in this room
With people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask, I don't need a girlfriend
So you can go back, please enjoy your party
I'll be here, somewhere in the corner waiting for this to be over
With this girl who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta he-
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best and
Your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be
Somewhere with my people we just kick it and just listen
To some music with the message like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners, I hope you'll understand it
That I'll be here
Not there in the kitchen with this girl
Who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to this boy who's throwing up cause
He can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh God why am I here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here oh oh oh
I ask myself what am I doing here?
Oh oh oh here oh oh oh here
And I can't wait till we can break up outta here
Hours later congregating next to the refrigerator
Some girl's talking bout her haters
She ain't got none
How did it ever come to this
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm standoffish, don't want what you're offering
And I'm done talking
Awfully sad it had to be this way
So tell my people that I'm ready when their ready
And I'm standing by the TV with my beanie low
Yo I'll be over here
And I'll be over here
No I'll be over here
No I'll be over hereI'm...
Making my way down this road
Feel the chill to the road
And I can barely see the lights
Wonder if she'll be here tonight
When I see her in my dreams
There's flowers blooming these are the tree's
Been searching for so long, yeah
I think it's bout time that I found this girl
And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo
Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me gooo
Life can pass you by so quick
I didn't know it but my line is growing thick
And now I think I found the one, yeah
That I've been searching for so long
And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo
Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me gooo
Just push the roads aside
Wanted to see you smile
And now I'm feeling so strong
Done walking down this road
Got what I want
And you're coming with me
And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo
Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me go
And if you come with me
Promise you'll never bleed
I'm never gonna let you gooo
Let me take you home
I'll be the one you want
You'll never wanna see me goLook up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
It's a Friday night
And streetlights, they're all saying your name
They always say your name
Before you go home, I should let you know
I'm so glad that you came
I know that we went late, yeah
But look up at the stars
They're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down
I am feeling so lucky 
The sun shining down on me 
Got these angеls all around me
I'll never bе alone
Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
I'm not gonna let you down
Finally we've met, now the lights are set
It's taken us 'til now
To be together in this town, yeah
A couple of years we've been making plans
Somehow you always seem to understand
Let me spend the night in wonderland with you
I am feeling so lucky 
The sun shining down on me 
Got these angels all around me
I'll never be alone
Look up at the stars, they're like pieces of art
Floating above the ground
You know we could fly so far, the universe is ours
And I'm not gonna let you down
Oh yeahReally sing this one out
You hit me up, it's late at night
This is the same old story
Your friends should take your phone away
I always give in when you tell me lies to reassure me
I always make the same mistake
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're driving me--sing it out!
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you're willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please, I'm losin' my patience
You know I'm losin' my patience, yeah
I'm in your room, it's just us two
I feel you're getting closer
You rest your head upon my chest
Deep down I know that this should be the last time I come over
You always leave me such a mess
Ooh, you give me a little taste
Lure me in, then you take it from me
Oh, I hate that I love it
'Cause you're drive--scream it out!
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, yeah
And you gotta stop, if you know
So I can start, letting go
'Cause it's drivin' me crazy
Yeah, you keep drivin' me crazy
When you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing , then you say you won't
Yeah, you're driving me crazy
First you say you love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Love me, then you say you don’t
I wake up in the mornin', and I'm all alone
Tell me that you willing, then you say you won't
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losin' my patience
Yeah, yeah
Oh no no
You know I'm losin' my patience baby
Oh no no
Can you make your mind up?
Please I'm losing my patienceI wake up a little drunk
Check my phone, I'm all alone
Ten missed calls, a couple texts
None of them are who I'm lookin' for
Who I'm lookin' for
This is a song for no one
This is a song for no one
Get on a plane
Fly to the most beautiful place you've ever been
Close my eyes, things are better in my dreams
'Cause I'm with someone, someone I adore
This is a song for no one
I wrote this song for no one
Yesterday, I got pretty drunk
Said some things that I shouldn't havе
Told you that I really love you
You did not reciprocatе those feelings
But that's okay, I'll be fine anyway
Ooh, yeah, hey, yeah
I wrote this song for no one
No, I wrote this song, yeah
Woo, woo, yeah
Cuz I wrote, no I wrote this song, yeah
I wrote this song
Cuz I wrote this song, yeahSkies are crying, I am watching
Catching tear drops in my hands
Only silence as it's ending
Like we never had a chance
Do you have to make me feel like
There's nothing left of me?
You can take everything I have
You can break everything I am
Like I'm made of glass
Like I'm made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
As the smoke clears, I awaken
And untangle you from me
Would it make you feel better
To watch me while I bleed?
All my windows still are broken
But I'm standing on my feet
You can take everything i have
You can break everything i am
Like im made of glass
Like im made of paper
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper, like a skyscraper
Go, run, run, run
Im gonna stay right Here
Watch you disappear
Go, run, run, run
Yeah its a Long way down, but i am closer to the clouds up here
You can take everything i have
You can break everthing i am
Like im made of glass, like im made of paper
Oh, oh
Go on and try to tear me down
I will be rising from the ground
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraper
Like a skyscraperI wonder if I'm being real
Do I speak my truth or do I filter how I feel?
I wonder, wouldn't it be nice
To live inside a world that isn't black and white?
I wonder what it's like to be my friends
Hope that they don't think I forget about them
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
Why I'm so afraid
Of saying something wrong, I never said I was a saint
I wondеr, when I cry into my hands
I'm conditioned to feel like it makеs me less of a man
And I wonder if someday you'll be by my side
And tell me that the world will end up alright
I wonder, I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like
I wonder what it's like to be loved by
Oh yeah
I wonder what it's like to be loved by you, yeah
I wonder what it's like yeah
I wonder
Right before I close my eyes
The only thing that's on my mind
Been dreamin' that you feel it too
I wonder what it's like to be loved by youAll I am is a man
I want the world in my hands
I hate the beach
But I stand
In California with my toes in the sand
Use the sleeves of my sweater
Let's have an adventure
Head in the clouds but my gravity's centered
Touch my neck and I'll touch yours
You in those little high-waisted shorts, oh
She knows what I think about
And what I think about
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
And if I may just take your breath away
I don't mind if there's not much to say
Sometimes the silence guides our minds
So move to a place so far away
The goose bumps start to raise
The minute that my left hand meets your waist
And then I watch your face
Put my finger on your tongue
'Cause you love to taste, yeah
These hearts adore
Everyone the other beats hardest for
Inside this place is warm
Outside it starts to pour
Coming down
One love, two mouths
One love, one house
No shirt, no blouse
Just us, you find out
Nothing that I wouldn't wanna tell you about, no, no, no
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
'Cause it's too cold
For you here and now
So let me hold
Both your hands in the holes of my sweater
The holes of my sweaterOh, misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sonsAll along it was a fever
A cold sweat hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, Show me something
He said, If you dare, come a little closer
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take–it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Ooh, ooh, ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, ooh, ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, stay
I want you to stay, oh
To stay
To stay
To stay
I want you to stay...your mind start to control your hearts desire
You should stop and take it easy, easy
What do..Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
She's got her red dress on tonight
Dancin' in the dark in the pale moonlight
Done her hair, real big beauty queen style
High heels off, feelin' allive
And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
I'm feelin' electric tonight
Cruisin' down the coast, goin' about 99
Got my bad baby by my heavenly side
If I die tonight, I'll be alright
And, oh my god, I feel it in the air
Telephone wires above
Are sizzlin' like a snare
Honey I'm on fire, I feel it everywhere
Nothin' scares me anymore
Kiss me hard before you go
Summertime sadness
I just wanted you to know
That baby, you the best
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Su-su-summertime, summertime sadness
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime sadness...
I got that summertime, summertime sadness
Summertime, summertime sadness, yeah

I don't know how you do what you do
Because everything that don't make sense about me
Make sense when I'm with you
Like everything that's green, girl I need you
But it's more than one and one makes two
Put aside the math and the logic of it
You got to know you want it too
Because I want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
Anyone can tell you you're pretty
You get that all the time, I know you do
But your beauty is deeper than the make up
And I want to show you what I see tonight
When I wrap you up
When I kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
As good as you make me feel
I want to make you feel better
Better than your fairy tales
Better than your best dreams
You're all I ever wanted
All I ever wanted
And I just want to wrap you up
Want to kiss your lips I, I want to make you feel wanted
And I want to call you mine
Want to hold your hand forever
Never let you forget it
I want to make you feel wanted
I want to make you feel wantedBig wheels keep on turning
Carry me home to see my kin
Singing songs about the Southland
I miss Alabamy once again
And I think its a sin, yes
Well I heard mister Young sing about her
Well, I heard ol' Neil put her down
Well, I hope Neil Young will remember
A Southern man don't need him around, anyhow
Sweet home Alabama
Where the skies are so blue
Sweet Home Alabama
Lord, I'm coming home to you
In Birmingham they love the governor, 
Now we all did what we could do
Now Watergate does not bother me
Does your conscience bother you?
Tell the truth
Now Muscle Shoals has got the Swampers
And they've been known to pick a song or two
Lord they get me off so much
They pick me up when I'm feeling blue
Now how about you?
C'mon, Pop. Don't let it stop thereI wanna follow where she goes
I think about her and she knows it
I wanna let her take control
'Cause everytime that she gets close, yeah
She pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' 
Maybe I should stop and start confessin'
Confessin' 
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
Oh, I've been shakin'
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
She says that she's never afraid
Just picture everybody naked
She really doesn't like to wait
Not really into hesitation
Pulls me in enough to keep me guessin' 
And maybe I should stop and start confessin'
Confessin' 
Oh, I've been shaking
I love it when you go crazy
You take all my inhibitions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back
You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions
Baby, there's nothin' holding me back

You take me places that tear up my reputation
Manipulate my decisions

There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back
There's nothing holding me back

I wish I could pretend I didn't need ya
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you know I love it when you call señorita
I wish it wasn't so damn hard to leave ya 
But every touch is ooh-la-la-la
It's true, la-la-la 
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
All along, I've been coming for ya 
And I hope it meant something to you
Call my name, I'll be coming for ya
Coming for ya
For ya
For ya
For ya
Ooh, I should be runnin'
Ooh, you keep me coming for ya
