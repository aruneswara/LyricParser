Wait right here
I'll be back in the mornin'
I know that I'm not that important to you
But to me, girl, you're so much more than gorgeous 
So much more than perfect 
Right now I know that I'm not really worth it
If you give me time, I could work on it
Give me some time while I work on it
Losin' your patience, and, girl, I don't blame you
The Earth's in rotation, you're waitin' for me 
Look at my face when I fuck on your waist
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
That's why your friends always hatin' on me
Fuck 'em though, I did this all by myself
Matter fact, I ain't never asked no one for help
And that's why I don't pick up my phone when it rings
None of my exes is over Lil Peep
Nobody flexin' as much as I be
That's why she text me and tell me she love me
She know that someday I'll be over the sea
Makin' my money and smokin' my weed
I think it's funny, she open up to me, get comfortable with me
Once I got it comin', I love her, she love me
I know that I'm nothing like someone her family want me to be
If I find a way, would you walk it with me?
Look at my face while you talkin' to me
'Cause we only have one conversation a week
Can I get one conversation at least?
Shout out to everyone makin' my beats, you helpin' me preach
This music's the only thing keepin' the peace when I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reason
A reason to shine, a reason like mine and I'm fallin' to pieces
Look at the sky tonight, all of the stars have a reasonCome, let's watch the rain as it's falling down
Now let's do that song for Peep
Sunlight on your skin when I'm not around
Shit don't feel the same when you're out of town
So come, let's watch the rain as it's falling down, yeah

Bro, I got-, I feel hella shitty because it's like, yo
Like, if I would have known he was so cool
And it's like, yo, if I would have watched interviews sooner
Bro, we were so alike
It's unfortunate because it's like, yo, when people die
That's when we like 'em, you know?
'Cause your remorse kinda makes you check 'em out
Darling, your love is like walking in a bed of nails
And I just can't keep on fightin’

Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away

I just can't pick up the phone again
This time, I'll be on my own, my friend
One more time, I'm all alone again
Sex with you is like I'm dreamin', and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now you're gone, I can't believe it
Time I spent with you deceivin' me
I don't care if you believe in me
I still wonder why you're leavin' me
I don't care if you believe me
I still wonder why you tease me
And if I'm takin' this the wrong way
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinkin'
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
I hope you know I'm faded, all of this liquor I'm drinkin'
And if I'm takin' this the wrong way 
I hope you know that you can tell me whatever you're thinkin'
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
When the moon hit your skin, I could see you and him
Not you and me, but it's just you and me
When the sun shines above, you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me, but it's just you and me
Sex with you is like I'm dreamin', and
I just wanna hear you scream again
Now you're gone, I can't believe it
Time I spent with you deceivin' me

When the moon hit your skin, I could see you and him
Not you and me, yeah
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
When the sun shines above, you wake up with the one you love
Not you and me, yeah
It's when you put me in the spotlight 
It's when you put me in the spotlight I got a feelin' that I'm not gonna be here for next year
So, let's laugh a little before I'm gone
I’ve been dreamin' of this shit for a while now
Got me high now
She don't love me, but she's singin' my songs 
I don't feel much pain
Got a knife in my back, and a bullet in my brain
I’m clinically insane
Walkin' home alone, I see faces in the rain
Where did all the time go?
Spend it gettin' high while I hide from the 5-0
Where did all the lines go?
Now, I'm so high, I be fuckin' with my eyes closed
She don't fuck with me no more, I'm on her mind though
Come and fuck me in the mornin' with the blinds closed
I can show you everything I learned
While you were away from me
Runnin' away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see things
Take her away from me, but I'm not givin' up on you, no
It's just the way I be
It's just the way I see thingsSkedda!
She said I'm a crybaby, I can't be up lately
Girl, you drive me crazy, AMG Mercedes

Geekin' on a Friday, I can never sleep right
Knowin' I hurt you, I don't deserve you
I shoulda curved you, I know I'm the worst, boo
But I could be cool too, and you got them dance moves
And I got this vibe, I swear it's perfect to ride to
I wanna die too, we all wanna die too
I got this vibe, I swear she love gettin' high too

Drive our Camaros out of town
Baby, we could leave right now 
Yeah, I just wanna feel alive
Baby take your time
Smokin' on this loud 
Girl, you know you make my cold heart warm with a touch
One kiss, then we fuckin', I just can't get enough
Put it on me, that's the best part, baby, the trust
Trust me, I got nothin' for you other than love
I remember eatin' pussy on the back of the bus
I remember gettin' nookie 'til the Sun came up
All the places that you took me, no one came with us
Same hoes overlook me, now they on my, nutsI know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind
Just look at the bright side 
Just look at the club lights 
I gotta look at the bright side 
I guess she wasn't the one, right, this isn't what love's like, that's for sure
Help me find a way to pass the time 
Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die 
Help me find a way to make you mine 
Everybody tellin' me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm gettin' high again, tonight
I know that you want me, you know that I want you
The memories haunt me, I know that they haunt you too
But it's alright, you'll be fine
Baby, it's alright, you'll be fine
As long as you're mine, take a look at the time
It gets cold at night, when you're alone outside
But it's fine, I'll be fine
Pay me no mind, girl, pay me no mind
Just look at the bright side 
Just look at the club lights 
I gotta look at the bright side 
I guess she wasn't the one, right, this isn't what love's like, that's for sure

Everybody tellin' me life's short, but I wanna die 
Help me find a way to make you mine 
Everybody tellin' me not to, but I'm gonna try
Now I'm gettin' high again, tonight
Just look at the bright side 
Just look at the club lights 
Just look at the nightlife 
Watchin' the sunrise by my side
We gotta look at the bright side 
Rollin' under the club lights 
I gotta look at the bright side 
I guess she wasn't the one, right
This isn't what love's like
That's for sureI know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Working every day, now you're bleeding through your cuticles
Passing through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryin' to keep your cool at your grandfather's funeral
Finding out eventually the feeling wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothing like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they're sayin' it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fucking kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, the type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the morning, now you doing the impossible
Find out what's important, now you're feeling philosophical
When I die, I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I try suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Run away, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon
There comes a time when everybody meets the same fate
I think I'ma die alone inside my room
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautifulHuh
Whip it like a Nascar, I can see the time pass
Feel like I'm in high school, fuckin' me in gym class
Shawty, I remember that, I know you remember that
You was fuckin' with me way before I even wrote raps
Now I'm seein' cash flow, I can be an asshole, yeah, I know
But it's all good 'cause I let her spend my money, though
Playboy bunny, though, shawty look like a pornstar
I know she love me 'cause she fuck me in her sports car
I pull up on her, tell her that we finna go far
Drop top, smokin' thrax, lookin' at the stars
Gettin' high, takin' bars 'til we on Mars
I can make the ground move like I'm Avatar
Now I'm faded on my own in my bedroom
Now I'm lookin' at my phone, should I text you?
I just wanna sex you, I just wanna bless you
Baby, I'm a priest in the underworld, guess who
Lil Bo Peep with a brand new flow, too

Part 2: Sometimes Life Gets Fucked Up
Sometimes life gets fucked up 
That's why we get fucked up 
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
Sometimes life gets fucked up 
That's why we get fucked up 
I can still feel your touch
I still do those same drugs
That we used to do
I was used to you 
"What have you been through?"
She asked me
Every fuckin' kind of abuse
If you love me too
You would give me you 
Lock me in your room
Don't tell me the truth
Everything you said 
Stays inside my head 
All the shit you said
All the blood I bled
Sometimes life gets fucked up 
That's why we get fucked up

Ten racks on my lap
If I don't relapse and I stay strong
I could do anything I want to
Bump Lil Peep, when I die, I'ma haunt you
I could live forever if I want to
I could stop time, but I never wanna do that again
Nothin' worse than losin' a friend
And the feelin' you get when everybody that you love ain't around
I really gotta get away from this town
I'm just waitin' for a wave and I'll drown
Satan letting me down
I just wanna help you see, you should run away from me
Baby, I'm a drug and I don't wanna hurt you
No, I'm not gonna hurt you, girl, not at all
I ain't gonna set you free, all you gonna get from me
Little bit of love and a little virtue
If I hurt you, I'll end it allWhoa, yeah

I've been waiting up 'cause I can't get enough, oh
I feel I'm fading 
When I fall apart, your needle sews my heart, oh

Addicted to the pain that you just made me love
I'm fiendin' for your touchin' on the daily
You're the only one that I want
Break my heart but don't tell me I'm not doin' fine
'Cause I'm doin' fine

It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
I feel like I'm looking for somethin', somethin' that'll never come
Call me when you're in the city again
My head just went oblivion
It's hard to miss you when you are always on the tip of my tongue
And now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrong
When I've been waitin' 
Long for you 
I wanna drink my wine, I wanna pass that by
I wanna make her cry, she wanna make me die
Apple pie, six cigarettes
And I'll catch the vibe that we can't forget
Why you actin' vain for my love, vain for my love
When you got everything that I want?
Why you actin' vain for my blood, vain for my blood
When you got everything that I want?

They gon' miss me when I'm dead, I lay my head and rest in peace
I'm prayin' to the sky, I don't even know why, ayy
Oh, I don't think I can take this anymore
No, washin' the blood from my wrist on the floor

Oh, I don't think I can do nothin' but flow

GothBoiCliqueSpoken words were meant to last, but the picture faded fast
The words "I love you" meant so much, now not even your lips can I touch
I'll cry for another eyesore and think about our first kiss by the tree and how it meant so much to—
Nobody knows the me that you do
Gonna take some getting used to

You know, I think of you on blow
It's me, Lil Jeep, she don't keep not a memory of me
I'm a creep, I'm a freak
That's why nobody's friends with me
I used to wait in my room for a single sign from you

I thought of you and nights spent
When I'm backed against the wall
I thought of her and highly
'Cause she answered when I called
I want her to wanna hurt me

We seriously never even touched, it sucks
I'ma put your name in my skin, mix the ink in my blood
It's so fucked
So tell me what is love
If I ever had it, if I ever had it
Did I really want it?
And why can't I remember?
I cannot remember
I took the black two-seater when you pushed me away
Into the dark, I only want what's best for you, baby
I reach out to you, but slowly
If there's passion there, then show me
Fast, hard
It's a slow drug
And I swear that
But it's true love
These are true lines
Saw you in the back of the club again
And we just started textin' again
And now you sendin' pictures to my phone, like I just can't resist
I'm tryin' not to let you feel missed 
And now we're in the bar, like 6 PM
And now we took a bottle to your bed
Listenin' to Slowdive, eyes like so-so red
And I can't stop starin' at the back of your neck
And you think you can make me love again
I swear that I will never feel a thing

These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all
This is the life I made and I can't go back to fall
Back to fall, back to everyone I ever knew at all
Back to small town blues, and not a clue of what's goin' on
Back to old routines, and wedding rings and livin' at the mall, yeah
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleep
This is the song they played when I crashed into the wall
This is the girl I told that we could have it all
Baby, I'm a drug, you're addicted to my love
I thought you were the one, but you were just another one
Call me Hellboy, I got fire in my blunt
Don't call me emo, don't call me punk
I'm a vampire, bitch, I'm countin' money up
I'm with Lil Peep, yeah, we hotter than the sun
You should tell your boyfriend stop tryna be like us
Tatted up my face, baby, I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna die alone right now, but I admit I do sometimes
These drugs are callin' me, do one more line, don't fall asleepCharlie Shuffler on the beat

Life in the background, up and down the mountain
Then it's back to the flat-ground, hold me while I'm drownin'
If tonight was my last night, I would keep on countin'
'Til the reaper got ahold of me then I would take my last flight
Where ever did you go? I've been waitin' for weeks
I don't think I'm gonna make it, but don't take it from me
So it seems every time that I die, I wake up
When it's time to meet my maker, I'll be ready for him
Got your glass slippers on, lookin' like you're Cinderella
Girl, what you sippin' on? Room spinnin' like propellers
Boy, what you trippin' on? I will make these pussies jealous
Watch your girl sing along, say she want an acapella

When I call, she don't pick it up 
My head hurt from the drugs 
It's somethin' in the bud, man, I need a new plug 
I feel it in my veins
All my bitches dumb 'cause they give me all their brains

Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?
This lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go
Tell heaven "don't wait for me"
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way that she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it
You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change

I know that it hurts sometimes, but it's beautiful
Workin' every day, now you bleedin' through your cuticles
Passin' through a portal as you're sittin' in your cubicle
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Tryna keep it cool at your grandfather's funeral
Findin' out eventually the feelin' wasn't mutual
You were not invited 'cause you're nothin' like the usual
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
You wanna see your friends, but you're stuck inside a hospital
Doctor walks in and he tells you that it's terminal
Tumor in your brain and they say that it's inoperable
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
They'll kill your little brother and they'll tell you he's a criminal
They'll fuckin' kill you too, so you better not get physical
Welcome to America, that type of shit is typical
Isn't life beautiful? I think that life is beautiful
Wake up in the mornin', now you doin' the impossible
Find out what's important, now you feelin' philosophical
When I die I'll pack my bags, move somewhere more affordable
Isn't life horrible? I think that life is horrible
You think she's adorable, she thinks that you're intolerable
You think you can do it, but your chances are improbable
Once you feel unstoppable, you run into an obstacle
Isn't life comical? I think that life is comical
And if you ever need a friend then you got me
And in the end, when I die, would you watch me?
And if I tried suicide, would you stop me?
Would you help me get a grip or would you drop me?
Runaway, make friends with the moon
Why you trippin'? You'll be with your friends soon

That's gon' be there 'til it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?
When I look at you
I can see right through
And you know it's true
So you love me too
Girl, I always knew
It was me and you
And you'll know it's true
When you say "I do"
You know I'ma say "I do" 
'Cause every time I leave I be missin' you 
And I know you gon' say "I do" 
'Cause I look up in your eyes, I can tell it's true 
On a winter night
I ran away so far
I ran away with you
We slept inside my car
Run away with the one
That's gon' hold you when you're numb
Takes you home, when you're drunk
Holds your hair, when you're throwin' up
If it's you, I don't know
But at least I had some time
Just to lie here by your side
Countin' all the stars tonight
Girl, I always knew  I'd see me and you 
Leaving in a coupe  painted baby blue 
Baby, I need you , you're like a dream come true 
And yeah, I always knew  that it would be us two
Took the long way home bumpin' all our songs
Smokin' cigarettes and feelin' up her dress
I always miss you most when I'm smoking dope
They say "Love kills you slow," that's why I'm with you though
Run away with the one
That's gon' be there 'til it's done
Take the blame for the gun
That's gon' be there for your son
If it's me, I don't know
But at least I'll make her smile
Would you lie here for a while?
Would you lie here 'til I die?
When I look at you 
I can see right through 
And you know it's true 
So you love me too

Italy, Greece, the Parthenon, the Coliseum. Then I’m coming back here and I’ll go to college and see what they know and then I’m going to build things
I’m going to build air fields. I’m going to build skyscrapers a hundred stories high
I’m going to build bridges a mile long. Well, are you going to throw a rock?
Hey, that’s pretty good. What’d you wish, Mary?Hold me, I can't breathe

All this stress, look at this mess
Look at my head, I'm better off dead

Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight, I'm goin' home tonight
Leave me alone tonight, I'm good on my own tonight
I'm on the road tonight, I'm goin' home tonight
Look in the mirror, I see a demon
I'm barely breathing, my shadow is bleeding
On the highway, baby, I'm speeding
I'm leavin' the city, you should be with me
Two weeks with the same old jeans on
I know you want to die, baby, this is your theme song
Like a switchblade, baby, just hold on

Yah, all I said was yah
Now she all up on my dick when the music drop
Hit the mall, fill my pockets up and then I shop
And I need a fat stack, I can't fuck with knots
Bitches run around the lobby, sleepin' at the top
Back in the day, me and SKWAB, we would jugg and rob
Now we pull up to the mall, we look and we cop
Now they treat me like a star, I act like I'm not
Wanna give me a massage in my new garageB-B-Big Los on the track, boy
I could keep my cool under pressure 
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard 
If I didn't like you then, then I ain't gon' like you never 
I could keep my cool under pressure 
You-you could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort 
She cannot keep your cool, and you let her 
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper 
I could, I could, I could, uh, uh
I could keep my cool under pressure like a fool 
Eatin' lemon pepper with a leopard, playin' pool
Damn, my man a Cheetah, no, my man a cougar
I don't put tobacco in my motherfuckin' hookah
Just straight sativa, motherfuck a Dutch
Motherfuck a twenty gram doobie with a crutch
When it come to that stuff, I cannot get enough
So I’m strictly smokin' wax , 'cause that kush gettin' tax, damn
Catch me smokin' dabs with your dad, why you mad, bitch?
Sad boys, money gang, I need me a sad bitch
My life ain't lavish, I ain't never had shit
I'm quick to take that dollar from your wallet if you have it
I be playin' Madden, smokin' weed and rappin'
Ain't no haters 'round him, on my throne laughin'
Lil Peep spazzin', skeetin' on your mattress
Creepin' through the night time, blood on my classics

Clouds of that loud like the weather

You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort 
She can't keep your cool, and you let her 
I could keep my cool while I’m eating lemon pepper 
I could, I could, I could, I could
She said, "Why you got so many tattoos?"
So when your daddy see me out, he know I'm bad news
She said, "Why you always wear them black boots?"
'Cause the blood don't show, ho
I cannot, and I will not ever be stuck
It's just a short amount of time before your somethin' is nothin'
You've gotta do what you can do, for the public
Gon' have to end the discussion, I hear the police comin'
I could smell them from a block away, aroma like bacon
They'd be jealous of the dirty money people be makin'
So then they point their finger blamin' but the judge is mistaken
Was that money for the takin'? 'Cause I witnessed them take it
But you ain't got no damn wallet, just a pocket of dust
And the lawyer they provided you will quickly choke up
And what you gon' do then? Spend your life in the pen'?
Because the cops are corrupt, are you gon' call up your man? 
I could keep my cool under pressure 
Clouds of that loud like the weather
Show-show-showtime, bitch, Kiki Shepard 
I ain't gon' like you never, I said
I could keep my cool under pressure 
You could keep your cool, but it take you twice the effort 
She can't keep your cool, and you let her

Myself and you for real
With my gun, I'll take your life

When the time comes I will sacrifice my love in the moonlight
Whenever I cum I feel half as nice as I did when it's you, rightI'll be good, I don't care
My whole life sucks anyway
I could feel it in the air today
I'll be fine on my own
I got nowhere left to go
You got no one left to turn to now
Will you cry when you die
And there's no one by your side
And your bedroom walls are burnin' down?
Or will you take your stand tonight?
Get your ass away from that light?
One more try you'll be just fine
Do what's right, baby, drop that knife
I don't wanna watch you bleed
I don't wanna watch you leave 
I could never live my dream
I would never live my dream Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun as it rises, as it falls
Put down the gun, because I'm getting a call
What have I become? Why do I feel so small?
Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun as it rises as it falls
Put down the gun, because I'm getting a call
What have I become? Why do I feel so small?
Why do I feel so small? 
I want to end it all 
Yaya
Boy Froot
Lately, I've been feelin' like I'm somebody else
I ain't savin' bitches if I can't save myself
Gone off them Xans right now, need some help
If I O.D. then I'm goin' to Hell
I don't fear nothin' but God
But God don't exist, not at all where I'm from
I don't play nothin' but C.O.D
Not at all, I don't play
Keepin' it real, that's my job
I'm in the V.I.P., I got your girl on my blow
BOY FROOT, Lil Peep, we takin' your ho
I'm takin' it slow in my zone
Took a couple pills when I woke up, now I'm stoned
Now I'm glowed up, thinkin' 'bout some dough with my bros
If I blow up, I'ma put the shotty to my dome
Turn the song up
Today's the day that I end it all
I watch the sun, as it rises, as it falls
Put down the gun, because I'm getting a call

Now the time is right, you wanna do me so wrongDamn son, where'd you find this?
Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
With a face recognized
We can do anything
Worth remembering
One day I'll be sober too
One day I'll be over you
Screaming "Oh my my"
That head so fye
Make a grown man cry
If I take my time
And replace my crimes
While I make my rhymes
I can do anything
I can be anything
Anything I wanna be
I can never be a wannabe
Fuck the cops, man they on to me
Baby you were just a pawn to me
Fuck the cops, man they on to meSESH
I'll be right here, when you step out the car
I see you from afar, but I know who you are
I know exactly who you are, what you're lookin' for
I know exactly where it starts, and I'm not lookin' forward to the end
Because we're not gonna last
Because we took it too fast, and that's a good way to crash and burn
What I learned, I don't like takin' my turn
If she mine, she gon' be mine until we ash in an urn
Let me burn, let me swerve, let me pull up on the curb
Now I'm lookin' so absurd, but I’m all that they heard
At the party, pull-up Rari
Up in the haze on the scene
Light a hundred fuckin' dutchs and then I follow my dreams
Girl, you're fuckin' with Lil Peep, I’m the king of the teens
I just dropped a couple singles and take over the scene
Got the internet buzzin', 20 thousand a week
Now I practice gettin' pussy, I practice all that I preach
Peep
SESH
I'll be right there when you need me close
I'll always be around when you need me the most
But I know, that you've been tryna get away from me
But you just don't know what to say to me
I just gotta do what I think I'm meant to
Everything I said is true in that text I sent you
So if you ain't gon' be my boo, then just do you
I'm smokin' blunts, like they cigarettes
I still ain't shit, I ain't gotten any bigger yet
But that factor ain't somethin' that really matters to me
Ain't nothin' to think about when I'm chillin', smokin' my weed
I burn it down, and then proceed to seek out all my hopes and dreams
The future holds itself so it ain't really what it seems
If I can't get to where I want, I'll be pissed
I'll tie my neck up in a noose, kick the chair and slit my wristsLookin' for a reason to live, I can't find shit 
So, I'm squeezin' the trigger, I let my mind split
Up into bits and pieces for dinner
You eatin' brains, bitch
I know she cum when she shiver
Don't give a fuck about you
Say they hate me
I don't give a fuck about who, ayy
I pull up in a coupe
Lookin' like soup
Real hot, jaw drop like the roof
I remember livin' life like you
Smokin' on boof
Lil' broke boy with a gold tooth
I could never live my life like you
Young, brand new
Lil Peep came through with the juice
Lookin' for a reason to live, I can't find shit 
So, I'm squeezin' the trigger, I let my mind split
Up into bits and pieces for dinner
You eatin' brains, bitch
I know she cum when she shiver
Don't give a fuck about you
Say they hate me
I don't give a fuck about who, ayy
I pull up in a coupe

Young, brand new
Lil Peep came through with the juiceI've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget 'bout you
Honestly, I got regrets 'bout you 
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alright
I'm never sober now, I'm gettin' high all night
I'm 'bout to put this in my system to erase you from my mind
Yeah
I was in lust with you
Thought that I loved you, but I got the two confused
I don't wanna fall asleep with you in my head
And I know that
You regret some things you said
But honestly, I have regrets about you
I've been poppin' pills, I've been tryna forget 'bout you 
Honestly, I've got regrets 'bout you 
Baby, it's over now, you're gonna cry all night
I'm gonna smile at you when I see you and pretend that I'm alrightClub lights, we fight every night
Baby, I don't wanna do that
Your type, jeans tight, dirty Sprite
She like, "How the fuck you do that?"
I can’t be there all the time
But you know I gotta prove that
I can't leave here anytime soon 
I got somethin' to do, yeah
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I’m goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I'm goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams
I know you wanna FaceTime, baby, I have Samsung
When I met your mom, she told me I was handsome
You told me I'm sexy, do you still think that?
You told me you loved me, do you still think that?
3 AM, climbin' through your window
Ounce of the kush, blowin' smoke out your window
You're a thousand miles away, I snort a thousand lines
Step inside the club, cameras flashin’ in my eyes
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands
I just wanted to help, now I’m goin' to hell
Walk away as the door slams
Walk away as the door slams
You got blood on your poor hands

That quote was before he stopped breathin'
Now his ghost speaks to me every evenin'
I should've listened when the mirror started speakin'
Ha-ha!
Ha-ha-ha!
Oh, dear Simon...
Maybe it's time to stop doing the Simon says, Simon says that Whatever the fuck
Stop playin' follow the leader

You know I go stupid bitch
Moshpit, mud all on my kicks
All black on my GothBoiClique
All black Benz to match the fit
Skrrt  off in the whip
Skrrt  off in the whipNow that months have passed, I don't think about our past
I know it wouldn't last so I'm not mad about what we had
I know you're feelin' sad, still cryin' every night
I know seasons change and you're not feelin' right 
You held me close, I remember 
I left you cold in December 
You watched me break and don't say a thing
You can't hear a thing so I'll scream out
I'm all alone in November
She's never here when I need her
I try a lot, and I cry a lot
And I'm tryin' hard not to bleed out
You don't wanna share your love but I keep makin' moves for us
And you don't wanna gain my trust so you could get it lost in lust And I just wanna fall in love but I don't wanna fall with some
'Cause they be down in the dust and only got time for jokes, yeah
You held me close, I remember
I left you cold in December 
You watched me break and don't say a thing
You can't hear a thing so I'll scream out
I'm all alone in November 
She's never here when I need her 
I try a lot, and I cry a lot
And I'm tryin' hard not to bleed out
I'm tryin' hard not to bleed out
Never close when I need ya
When I need ya
When I need yaMany men have tried to save her but all they do is try 
Woke up on a lonely day, she can't help but wonder why 
I saw it on her face, she wanna make those fuckers cry 
She ends up in a better place and time when she get high
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind 
Stick that needle in my eye
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind 
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind 
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Pour that drip up in my Faygo
In my city I got say-so
I was just talking to Fredo
Then I woke up, he was gone
All my friends are really dead
Still hear their voices in my head
These days, it's hard to sleep alone
I beg my baby please don't go
Please don't go
I can handle my rivals, but can't fight these demons alone
Please don't go
All these fakes, all these snakes in the grass, gotta keep it cut low
Keep the circle small, stand tall through it all
Praying I don't fall, know they'd rather see me long gone
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
I'm not evil by design, but I feel dead at times
Stick that needle in my eye, just lost my peace of mind
Stick that needle in my eye

Motorola don't flip, Motorola don't chirp
Got a 'Droid in my pocket, got your bitch on my shirt
Ride when I drive, watch me swerve up a curb 
Niggas said they wanted smoke so I brought the fuckin' herb 
Bought some Olde E. for my thirst
Brought some bodies for the hearse 
He thought I was takin' shots, but that nigga took 'em first 
'Cause that nigga said he live, but he gettin' on my nerves 
I ain't have to say a word, all my niggas go berzerk 
Let him burn, let him drop, like a top let's let him drop
Like his heart, don't make it stop
Clean it up, let's get the mop
Choppin' it up with my squad in the cut
See they passin' me drinks and I'm passin' 'em blunts
And I'm sippin', they smokin', we don't give a fuck
'Cause I'm doin' my thing while we doin' it up
Drinkin' the potion, I'm blowin', you know this
Head bobbin', hypnosis, try not to lose focus
Ain't got no promotion and got no exposure
Still killin' the game and my niggas they know it
Still fuck around with your whack ass crew
Still talk about you, it ain't anything new
Still hear about your name, but I still say "who?"
Still don't give a fuck 'bout anything you do

Bought some Olde E. for my thirst
Brought some bodies for the hearse 
He thought I was takin' shots, but that nigga took 'em first
Smokin' and puttin' my lip on my bitches
They kissin' my dick while I'm typin' my digits
Arthritis inside of my digits from twistin' the piff
And yo' bitch think I'm trippin', I'm flippin' the script
And I'm flippin' prescriptions, my vision is blurry
My thoughts are perverted
I'm closing my curtains, and go in the furnace
And I bring my ruger to kill Freddie Kreuger, you loser
I'm basically what your bitch dream about
She wanna see me but she never see me out
And when she do, she gon' show me what she about
If you got something to say you can scream it out loud

I'll make it drip, where your pussy is pink
This is OmenXIII, fuckin' around with Lil Peep
Keep goin', she say she a fiend for it
Told me that you got that lean, pour it

I never come out my tree like I'm pain
Hatin' on me like the leaves when it rain
I feed off the hate, it make me feel great
I'm stayin' up late, she giving me face
Get the fuck out my way when I'm after that cake
Ride when I drive, watch me swerve up a curb

She never talk about forever with me
She never talk about the future at all 
Wanna walk around forever with me
She tryna fuck me, no relations involved 
And I ain't used to gettin’ pussy for free
I'm used to buying stupid shit at the mall 
I know, baby, I would take you to eat
Before I asked her, she was licking my *moan*

So they watched, they watched, they watched
You know I haven't been 'round people in a while
So to smile feels like I got my trainers up on the opposite feet
Treadin' on thin ice with your live
Tucked inside with my money it's not much of it
But with you I had everything
Do you still remember me?
The one who set you free? 
To put you back in chains, oh, I'm sorry
I still got blood on my jeans
If they come near you again
I'll break 'em down
Their ghosts won't forget me

Baby what it do, I'm so in love with you

"You're looking a little morose sunny, what's hitting you?"
"Just like losing my faith with humanity.."
"Can you narrow it down for me?"
"I just, wonder, if like.. two people can stay together for good?"
"You mean like couples?"
"Yaknow.. like, people in love.."
"Are you having boys trouble? 'cause I gotta be honest, I don't really much approve of you dating in your condition.. that's kinda messed up.."
"No dad, it's not"
"I mean that's pretty skanky.. isn't that what you girls call it skanky? skeevy?"
"Please stop"
"Tore up from the floor up?"
"That's just not what it's about... I just need to know that it's possible that two people can stay happy together forever"
"Well, it's not easy, that's for sure."
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around ?
We are not the same, if you couldn't tell
It's just another day in this little town, leave this little town
We could run away
Leave this little town
If you had to wait, would you stick around ?
We are not the same, if you couldn't tell
It's just another day in this little town, leave this little town
InstrumentalNo, my life ain't nothing like I thought it would be
But listen that's okay with me
I've been staying true to myself and my team
They gon' make it all the way with me
Baby, it's cold out, but I'm a man now
So I'ma just stand outside in the rain 
I got my boots on, he got his bands out
I got some coupons from the other day 
You know, I'm broke bitch
That ain't a joke, bitch
So many hopeless souls in pain 
Where do I go now, can't find a home now
Remember my home town back in the day
Aye, Peep, you know what's crazy?
There's kids out here our age, yeah, crying because their phone don't have fucking moving emojis
There's babies out there crawling on the floor no mum, no dad, no food, nothing
And these kids are complaining? 
Oh, that girl Kathleen down on 7th street, she wonders when she'll eat again 
She got love in her eyes and hell up in her mind, but soon she gonna freeze to death
She feels piercing gazes on her fragile face from strangers like you and me 
Her heart's a firework display if you feed her anything because soon she gonna die in the streets
Through a dress you can see her ribcage
She never talks to me everytime it rains 
She escapes back into the alleyways 
Because it was raining heavy the day it finally put her in this place
Oh, they kicked her out, like a goalkeeper would
Until the sky was suprised then slammed to the floor
Up and down a few more times then came to a halt
Oh, that homeless angel sliced her wings, then her throatI'ma take my last breath in this room
Pills got me up, real high, like the moon
I've been workin' hard, I'ma blow up real soon
I've been smokin' strong, while I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I always dream of you
Every time I sleep, I see right through
My intentions have shown
Girl, some day we will glow
Every little single thing you said will be known
I always can tell, when something's on your mind
We're both goin' to hell but at least we got time
Before we're deceased, draw back the curtains and blinds
I know that I'm hurtin' but, girl will you be mine?
I wanna give it all to you
I wanna give it all to you
Body on the asphalt
Be careful what you ask for
She think I'm an asshole
What if I end my life, though?
Will she like me then?
I just wanna grab my knife, oh
It's my only friend
Sacrifice my whole life tonight
I'm a lonely manYou had me hypnotized when I was your man
And then I realized, you had other plans
You had me hypnotized when I was your man
And then I realized, you had other plans
I mean that, baby, you my heroine 
Fuck me in the Benz 
Fuck me with your friends 
You could be my friend 
We could be the end to the whole fucked world 
I be looking forward, she be looking for my love 
I just sold a hook, I'll spend a check on you 
No matter what it took, I took my time to check on you 
Baby, you the truth, I can see you in the booth
Had me hypnotized when I was your man 
And then I realized 
You had other plans 
But you had me hypnotized 
When I was your man 
And then I realized 
You had other plans 
All alone here I am now, walking by myself
Singing to these birds that pass me by myself
I don't seem to even cry now, looking at the sky now
Tell me why'd you have to leave?
Could it be so bad that I really did you wrong
Now I try to explain it all in every song
Hoping that you come home and forgive me
So we could be how we used to be
Hypnotized when I was your man 
And then I realized 
You had other plans 
But you had me hypnotized 
When I was your man 
And then I realized that 
You had other plans 
Me and you, where'd we go wrong? I can't even call it
Uh, now I'm always numb
Me and you where'd we go wrong? I can't even call it
You had me hypnotized when I was your man 
And then I realized 
You had other plans 
But you had me hypnotized 
When I was your man 
And then I realized 
You had other plans 
But you had me hypnotizedIf you tell me bye bye, baby

Yeah, it say "Gucci" on my plain white tee
That's a grown man flex, stop playin' with me
Baby, I was blazin' in my plain white tee
You can steal my pictures of me and your broken dreams
I waited for your touch, you never waited for me
See me in the dark waitin' patiently for you, tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touch tonight
I'm beggin' for your touch, I'm beggin' for your touchLie me down, in this long night
Remembering my own fear of the darkness
I search around in corners without tracing back to you
'Cause you were spiked by this empty poison
How did you know? Oh 
Even I didn't know that 
Never lonely, alone, oh 
I taught my mirror how to talk back 
How did you know? Oh 
Even I didn't know that
Never lonely, alone, oh
It's all clearer when you walk back
I'm watching and stopping the ink drip fall like your tears did
A million-dollar masterpiece on a cheap canvas 
Worn underneath like a couple of old scarves in the winter 
Tear through the sheets of my skin when I'm sleeping, I'm deep in 
Laughing while I'm crying, with a vision, can't see shit 
Young angel demon, balancing nightmare dreaming
Having to right-click, zoom in
I'm healing while I'm bleeding
Tear your life to pieces, apologise, all the sins slipped in 
How did you know? Oh, oh 
Where do I go now from here? 
Follow the road, oh, oh 
You're on your own now, my dear 
When I make it to the other side of the universe where angels cry
I'ma find you there, I'ma end your life on sight
Make it right, you were my sacrifice
Lie me down, in this long night
Remembering my own fear of the darkness
I search around in corners without tracing back to you
'Cause you were spiked by this empty poison 
How did you know? Oh 
Even I didn't know that 
Never lonely, alone, oh 
I taught my mirror how to talk back 
How did you know? Oh 
Even I didn't know that
Never lonely, alone, oh
It's all clearer when you walk back
It's all clearer when you walk back 
I'm gettin' nearer to the all black 
The grim reaper said to call him Jack 
I never knew that it would be like that 
It's all clearer when you walk back 
I'm gettin' nearer to the all black 
I taught my mirror how to talk back 
I never knew that it would be like that 
The grim reaper said to call him Jack
Building and breaking
It's running so smoothly, earthquaking
I tell you I love you and hate you just to stare at your bottom lip when you're concentrating
Open my arms, receptive to the abundance of the universe
Dig my foot in the ground, spit on the earth
One person I thought I'd kill
 Don't give a fuck
Look you in your eyes and you flare your fingers
Speak in silence, reaching higher, living, dying
Enough of the meet and greet, say "Goodbye"
Give birth to an unopened coffin, then you bury it beyond the sky
You know why?There's something up on my shoulders
I'm older now, but feel hopeless
On the streets and feel like a soldier
Told ya, I don't fuck with no posers, no
See him geek like he posin', but he a bitch and he know it
He ain't bout shit but he show it
Bitch I flip the switch and I'm copin'
He fuck around with my dollars
Prolly found himself with some problems
And some trauma chasin' them commas
But I gotta eat, so I'm on it, honest
You don't know better than me
So don't tell me who to be
You don't know better than me
So don't tell me what we need
OmenXIII, black shirt, black jeans
Always rock long sleeves on my Drop Dead tees
I think I'm going crazy while I'm tryna find some peace
I'ma pick the world up, let it drop on me
I felt the pain that y'all been through
I felt the pain that y'all live through
I'm feelin' pain but I'm gettin' through
So I'll be just fine, I promise you
I don't want to talk to you
Couldn't care less how you feelin' right now
I'm a ghost I can walk through you 
All black blade with a dutch light brown
I'm a sixteen bar killer, none realer
LiL PEEP, OmenXIII, can't flow with us
Now you sellin' out shows and you fuckin' on a ho
But yo ass still know that we flow bigger
No job, no mob, no time, do it on my own time, on my own grind
Oh my, oh my, not a day go by where I don't get high
Write a hundred fuckin' rhymes
Fine, I'm better off without you on my mind
Do it like a mom only talking on my line
Then it's back to the bedroom, back to the lies
I'm bleedin' to death, but I'ma tell you that I'm fine
Bleedin' to death, but I'ma tell you that I'm fine
I'm doin' my best to keep the money on my mind

Evil killer clown, creepin' in the sewer
I be laughing while I'm killing, like I barely even knew her
I'ma cut her up in pieces, leave that bitch inside the swamp
I'm the king over it so everybody knows what's up
Welcome to the underground, other underground
Where you can't see a thing and you can't hear a sound
Lil Peep, OmenXIII we hold it down
We could take your fuckin' industry and burn it to the ground
Get the gas and light the matches, then we dance around the ashes
Get the message to the masses 'cause we sick of hearing wack shit
'Cause these niggas got no passion, fashion game played out
I just don't give a fuck how you walkin' out the house
OmenXIII, ice when I speak
Flow so cold but I'm comin' with that heat
I'm comin' out my castle, I ain't comin' off the street
Then it's back into the shadows where they cannot seem to see
I feel like I'm asleep, I'm lost in the abyss
I'm hidden in my pain, I'm hidden in the mist
Akatsuki with the shit
No I don't need no bitch
No I don't need no fame
No I don't need no clique, bitch
Welcome to the underground, other underground
Pussy never come around, he don't like the sound

Lil Peep, Boy Froot bringin' sexy back
Shawty woke up and her car was jacked
White trash gooney give a groupie bitch a heart attack
I don't love nobody but myself
Whole bunch of drugs and a shotty on my shelf
But that's just in case I wanna go to hell
Stop stressin'
When I wanna die, smoke an L, she a blessin'
Right before she go, she make me cum and get me messy
Now I'm on my own, she don't love me and she left me
Now I drop my phone every time I get a message
Bitch I'm in my zone like the day before you met me
Girl come and get me, I've been steady waiting
I ain't got no patience and that lame bitch no replacement

Glowing' in my timbs, while you cryin' in your Asics 
Kiss me on my lips, codeine taste it

I take my shawty on the road and we get it popping 
Spending all this cash, make it right back 
I'm still white trash but I like that 
Smoking on some hash got that loud pack 
Puffing goth gas wearing all black 
Emo angel in the club now I'm turning up
And if I say so then you best believe I'm burning blunts

I've been flexin' like it's my turn Sittin' on the docks, boba on the rocks
People hit my line but I don't wanna talk
I'm tryin' to be calm, I don't wanna see the clock
Don't wanna see my moms, don't wanna see my pops
Just wanna see you, but you don't wanna see me
I think I'm seeing things that the people won't believe
Just wanna see some change that I'm never gonna see
So I keep my eyes closed while I try to find my peace
Don't even wanna eat, only eat once a day
Sippin' boba on the rocks with that right strain everyday
I can't even smoke weed, for me that was just a phase
But you know I still supply, if you need to cop today
Hit my line, scoop you up, Mango juice with the stuff
Grind it up, bust some blunts, got some liquor, that's a plus
You can smoke, I'll get drunk, and we'll bob to this jawn
Better see you walking up, if you think that I'm a punk
'Cause I ain't a fuckin' fool, and I just ain't you
And I gotta stack my money to do what I gotta do
See I know it's just some paper, please tell me what else is new
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yup
Back to the head, bitch I smoke it like I had to
Cracks in my head, like a motherfuckin' statue
Back to back with the lead, spittin' out the fuckin' barrel
Young white pharaoh in the back of the Camaro 
Dopamine release, copin' with the freezer
With the coats made of geese, can you feel my energy
It's floatin' in the breeze, growin' with the trees
Wake up in the morning by the ocean on the beach, Peep
Take away my pain, feel my body up with love
See you landed in my bed, but you've fallen from above
Every time you give me head, got my body goin' numb
See you probably in your bed while I'm probably goin' dumb
On these beats, swervin' thru the streets 
Flip a couple packs and keep applying with the heat
Pressure cooker Peep, steppin' on your feet
Tell em rest in peace, cut your body to a piece, you deceased
Yellin' bitch I ain't a fool, and I just ain't you
You the type to take the red and I'm the type to take the blue
See I know it's just some paper, tryna get up out my room
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food, yuh
But you see, these stupid people take this paper for some food
Sippin' boba on the rocks got the Right strain too
In the East, in the West, what you need, we comin' through, bitchFuck that bitch, send that bitch to the hospital
Left your wife on the couch like a vegetable
Cocaine nostril, but you gotta suck the tip
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck the tip
She said, "I can't do it, impossible"
Dance to a pussy, I'm the man, you an officer
Bitch, you ain't confident but baby, I will suck your tits
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck my tip
Cocaine nostril, but you gotta suck the tip
Drugs if you wanna sip, still gotta suck the tip

Eat on that pussy, I bite it 
Snorting the coke the whole night 
Eatin' food the whole night 
Might eat the booty like rice 
Pussy leaking like a pipe 
Beat it up just like a fight 
Pussy is loose, it used to be tight I think you straighten up a little bit
I think you should, I think you know
You should, you should look at yourself in the mirror sometimes
And say: "Look, what am I doing? Why, why am I this way?"

Make a couple lines
'Cause you're making me high now
I could live life all on my own
Girl I'm only nineteen, but I'm already grown
All the shit I say to you I already told
To my last girl baby, but you're already grown
When I know that I'm not
Lookin' in the mirror, like I'm all that I got
You got me lookin' in the mirror, like you're all that I got
 Even though that ain't true
 I'ma still stay faithful
I'ma take a photograph, rip it in half if I took it with you
Now I'm looking back at the past, I was trippin' when I tripped over you
She said, "What you wanna ask me?" 
I don't listen to you
I see you looking when you past me 
I wasn't looking for you 
I got a bottle in my hand
Bad bitch-
I could live life all on my own
Girl I'm only nineteen, but I'm already grown
All the shit I say to you I already told
To my last girl baby, but you're already grownIs it them or me, tell me what's it gon' be
Is it them or me, tell me what's it gon' be
Is it them or me, is it him or her
Tell me where you gon' be

But deep inside I know that I'm wrong
I let you slip away
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you
Big-big money
All I need, all I wanted was some big money
Gave you everything you want, I'm talkin' crib money
Only buy it if it's haunted, I'm a ghost hunter
Always feel like someone watchin'
Rip-rip-rippin' up the beat
Heart cold but my mind with the heat
Knees weak every time that I speak
Lil Peep, bitch, my work never free
I don't never leave, she come to me
When the club's all been emptied
And there's no one left to talk to
You know I think about you
Pull up in a foreign when I hit these streets

I got matte black nails, I got lots of sex appeal
Pothead bitch, yeah I smoke it by the zip

Protect and serve my lover 'till the end
I won't expect anyone to comprehend 
Dreamin' of flyin' through the golden sky
You know how we smoke and get so high 
My kiss is sweeter than the cherry pie
You'll only know it when you come and say goodbye 
Got temptations wrapped up and locked and tied 
No, it won't be long now
Until we're ascending ...Bitch, you don't know me at all
I ain't pickin' up when I get your call
I just flipped a quarter bag and blew it at the mall
I ain't worried 'bout what the fuck you gotta say at all
Keep it to yourself, drugs on the shelf
If it wasn't for my plug, then I wouldn't have this belt
Yeah, I need some help, yeah, I'm goin' to hell
All my exes dead in the basement, you can smell
I just need a goth queen tonight
I just wanna fuck you in the candlelight

Put on my chain then I walk out the house
It's a beautiful day and I'm glad I made it out
I'll be okay on my own, I'll be straight 
Get out my way, get the fuck up out my way
Get out my face, out my face, out my face 
Stay in your lane, in your mothafuckin' lane 
He wanna sing, tryna be like Lil Peep 
She wanna sing, tryna suck Lil Peep
She callin' my phone, but I ain't pickin' up
'Cause I'm in my zone in the mothafuckin' club
Strappin' my chain to my wallet and my belt
I've been the same since a jit, could you tell?
Takin' your bitch with the cast of a spell
Hittin' a lick in the back by myself
Textin' these fools tryna fuck with me
Get out my face, bitch boy, would you please
Fuck up out my face, bitch
Get the fuck up out my face, bitch
Put on my chain then I walk out the house
It's a beautiful day and I'm glad I made it out
I'll be okay on my own, I'll be straight
Get out my way, get the fuck up out my way
Get out my face, out my face, out my face
Stay in your lane, in your mothafuckin' laneShe was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
VVS cuts on my wrist, I'm suicidal
Dancing all alone, I feel like Billy Idol
Looking in the mirror and I see my only rival
Only see my future at the end of this rifle
She was all I had 'til my shit went viral
Now these thoughts spinning in my head just like a vinyl
But now let's play back
Time to put my Mama in that Maybach
Almost started trapping but I had to take a safe track
Fucking with my boys we gon' have to push your faith back
Told me that you love me
Oh how sweet of you to say that
Fucked up one too many times
I'm man enough to say that
Told you that I love you
But baby I take that back
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
Ok until now before the girl with the
Broken smile, ask her if she wants
To stay around 'cause she will be loved
Poppin' pills so I can't feel it, can you feel me now?
Watching you just from a distance try and kill me now
I've been dealing with some issues tryna figure out
Is it worth it to keep going I need answers now
Ion love you too much, I love you 3 much
I'm poppin 4 pills I'm dying for real, I hope you save me
If you jump in we'll never make it to safety, I think it was
That broken smile that saved me
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that it's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrong
She was the one with the broken smile
Now that's done, she was the one
She was the one that was worth my time
Now that she gone, I know that I'm wrongLyrics From Snippets
 Steppin' on cracks

Never mind, man, come with me for a sac 
We can have sex, chill out, smoke a sack
Try to understand that yo new man wack, he a sad
Make you drip drip down from a bat 
She could take dick like she fat 
You've been riding 'round on flats 
I can tell by the way you write yo raps 
Snakes don't come around, facts 
They attract to the lies and the racks 
If you keep it real, I keep it real back 
I keep it real, so she on my lap 
Drinking that yack, smoking a sack 
I put yo town in the map, gimme some that Lyrics from Snippets

If I'm gonna do it, then I'm doin' it my way
Jay told me I'm a threat

She'll move alone, we'll move alone
So cold, you're so cold
But I know what you want
And it's not my dough
I know, you're gone
But I'm on and I'm strong
She'll move alone, we'll move alone, we'll move alone
Sometimes I get so high, I wonder if I'll fall
And if I hit the ground, would it hurt me at all?
Now you're not around, and you don't think to call
I can't fake this smile, when I'm in the mall
Take me away like you used to
Kiss me, and say that you love me
Pinch me, when you wanna hug me
Have drinks, but just don't drug me
Lay down, I can hear your heartbeat
I know who you love and it's me
Kiss me right on my red cheeks
Kiss me, bite me on my neck please
Lay down, I can hear your heartbeat
I know who you love and it's me
Kiss me right on my red cheeks
Kiss me, bite me on my neck please
Sometimes I get so high, I wonder if I'll fall
And if I hit the ground, would it hurt me at all?

Runnin' out, but I'll never escape this truth
It's you, it's you
And I can't find the time now
To think about loving you
And I don't wanna find out
You're doing things you used to do
Telling me all your lies
Knowing that I'll believe
Saying that I'm the guy
And then you went to deceive me
No, why you can't please me
Oh, oh

I'm afraid of love, 'cause it hurts so much
I'm afraid of love, watching you do these drugs
I was there, when you were
Taking drugs
Me and Makonnen out in London
Whippin' it upYo, I think I'm insane like nobody else
When I was in pain ain’t nobody helped
She left me in need, I was all by myself
She made me a promise she never would tell
I-I-I told her I needed her
I said I believe in her
Sh-Sh-She told me she never will
I hung up and I popped a pill
I ain't gon' hate you my mama will

Remember you rode me like Chevrolet
I know that my dick game is bonneville
I know that I fuck you like no one can

Just call when you're over him
You prolly gon' never call
You prolly won't hear my song
You hate me, you never wrong

Got me hatin’ myself again
So eager to help a friend
That never would help me back

But I can’t miss my flight 
Coppin' the newest shit
Blinded by all the hype
Your outfit won’t change your life 
This music might change my life

I hate when you lie to me
Still you keep me alive
I can get you high, but I can't read your mind
I hate when you lie to me, still you keep me alive
Hands run down your spine, I wish you were mine
What's the perfect lie?
Words cannot describe this
Why would you cry? I don't know
I been getting high, now I'm ready to show
I been getting high, now I'm ready to go
Yeah I'm getting too high, I'm not too numb
Now don't stop, yeah I'm going to drop
Going too crazy isn't throwing the guap
Blowin' Mercedes and going to god
Going insane because I'm rollin' the rod
Now I don't wanna be the one to say it loud
Lately I been too fucked up
Going insane in the club
I wanna be the one that you trust
I can get you high, but I can't read your mind
I hate when you lie to me, still you keep me alive
Hands run down your spine, I wish you were mine

Smoking weed in that bitch, and it reeks  
I fuck that bitch raw till she weep 
I'ma smoke a lil' weed with Lil Peep 
For anything I keep my car on the tar 
Limosa nostra, we are goin' real far 
Silverado, with a suicidal model
I'm driving, she's holding a bottle
Like she was holding a Bible, she thinks I'm a idol 
She might need a Midol, she might need someone to talk to 
I'm slowed off this shit when I walk through 
I'm hard as shit to talk to 
I don't need a Grammy, all I need is my family
That shit get me angry, when they talk 'bout my family
Don't fuck with my family, we get stupid and panic
We go stupid and vanish, we got bitches that Spanish
I got bitches from London, bitch I'm going to Paris
Bitch I'm going to Belgium, bitch I could be a felon
All my bitches is jealous, but they listen, I tell 'em
All the shit that I'm doing, but they get mad when I tell 'em
I'm just trying to be honest
They in love with my pockets
They in love with a rockstar, I'm young and I'm poppin'
Bitch I'm up in the hills, bitch I'm fucking with Hil

Let your teardrops fall on me
Speeding away, the city in the rearview
Heart racing whenever I'm near you
GothBoi jumpin' off stage
Carry me away, carry me away
Burn me down 'til there's nothing left
I would scream your name with my last breath
Take off your favorite dress
Lay your head on my chest
Diamonds, rubies, and gems
You can have all of them
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you do that
Helps me get through this without you
Bother me, tell me awful things
You know I love it when you move that on me

And I know you won't forget it, girl
Please don't panic, baby
Please don't panic, baby

But I'm only ever-present
When I almost need a medic
Now I gotta stress it, baby
Please don't panic, girl

Lil Peep, I am up in this bitch
Poppin' whatever come at me, I'm off of the crappy
Look at me, I'm slashin' my wrist
I'll put 'em back in they place
Nobody loved me, but now they relate
All of the sudden, they act like I'm great
Act like my cousin, gon' eat off my plate
What, 'cause I'm buzzin', you finna get paid or somethin'?
Nah, you buggin', I came from nothin'
Don't come around when I'm up and I'm comin'
Bitch, you wasn't there, I got hoes on my stomach
Fuck 'em, fuck 'em, no, I don't love 'em
Bitches, they love me, but no, I don't cuff 'em
I bought the rubbers for all of my brothers
All of your troubles, get double with hunnids
Tripled with time, triple six bumpin', I'm sippin' on wine

While I'm slumped is what you heard, but I just sit and slurp
And you know just-j-j-just, just watch-n-n-hing you

And right before I exit, she on her knees I let her bless it

Watch the time go by 
All I wanna do is get high
Smoke blunts in my ride
Turn the music up, I like the vibes
I'm fine, you should worry about yourself every once in awhile
Cracking a smile while I cut myself 
Sometimes it feels like nothing help
And that prescription take the pain away 
I'm taking acid if it rain today
Watch the clouds while I waste away
Dripping out the sink
No one ever knows what I'm sipping out my drink Catch a feelin' for me 
Catch a feelin' for my lifestyle 
Poppin' pills for free

I wish that I could see you right now 
Bury me with all the lights out

Rock, rock with me, baby
Rock
Come and rock with me, baby
Side by side, cruisin' up in the night with me, baby
It’s mine, the mind, you've been up inside of it lately
Slide in Mercedes
We be riding, vibin', but you be drivin’ me crazy
Rollin' downtown to this shit
Shades sit low like the whip
Windows down, but they tinted
I want you to see who it is
Speakers loud, creeping through your town, know you see me now
Leave the ground, fly off to LA with Peep, we shut it down
She throw it back just because of my name
It's crazy
Rock with me, baby
Break it down and rock with me, baby
Rock with me, rock with me, rock with me, baby
I might take you to the block with me, baby
Block, block with me, block with me
Rock with me, baby
Got you breakin' down and rock with me, baby

These hoes eyeballing me, they say I’m rare and I’m handsome
I fucked a couple bitches and a pair in my mansion
I’m goth and I’m pale as fuck, they call me Marilyn Manson
They all want me to themselves, they can’t take me for ransom
I freed a couple months and tried to scare with these anthems
I cut too many off, I got my share with these randoms
I cut my phone off quick, don’t try to blare up my Samsung
I ate those bars so quick, could never flare up no tantrum
I feel your ghost in the wall
And it was way after dark
But don’t gеt scared, cause I’m by your side
I’m thе one that put you in the ground
Cover your grave in a place, can’t be found
Gotta make sure no one makes a sound 
Have you ever seen a man this rich, this broke?
This lost in the smoke? Please pray for me
I can never hide, my ghost come everywhere I go
Tell heaven "don't wait for me"
Satan waitin' at the gate for me
I heard this bitch bump Lil Peep faithfully
That's why these pussies got hate for me
'Cause they was busy chasin' bitches, I was chasin' dreams
Throw me off the edge, I'll fall
Lookin' up at 'em like I never even knew 'em at all
I remember walkin' around in the hall
And then the bell rang and I took something then I couldn't recall
Makin' you cry the way that she did, I can't forgive myself for
And if you want me to, I'll kill myself, but I'm already in hell for it
You used to love me then, I know it's not the same
But this is not the end 'cause everything gon' change
When I get that Benz, I'ma pull up in the rain and I'm gon' say
You wouldn't wait

        Lyrics from snippet
I try to live life so painless
Sing it with me, sing it with me
Everybody sing it with me
Grab my gun and bring it with me
Just in case I wanna die
Put it on me, put it on me
Love it when you put it on me
Look at how she put it on me
That shit made me wanna cry
That shit made me wanna cry
Sing it with me, sing it with me
Everybody sing it with me
Grab my gun and bring it with me
Just in case I wanna die
Put it on me, put it on me
Love it when you put it on me
Look at how she put it on me
That shit made me wanna cry
That shit made me wanna cry16 lines-
Of blow and I'm fine
You’re wastin' your time, wastin' your time
Please don’t cry
Yeah
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don’t cry, you’re wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
I been on my own for two nights
I been in my zone, I’ve been high
Now she wonder why do I lie
I can't tell my wrongs from my rights
Is anybody out there? 
Can anybody hear me? 
I hate it when you fake care 
Girl, I know you hear me 
Is anybody out there? 
Can anybody hear me? 
I hate it when you fake care 
Girl, I know you hear me 
16 lines of blow and I'm fine
Break my bones, but act as my spine
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry?
Please don’t cry, you're wastin' your time
16 lines will make me feel fine
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
I can't stop myself from going down this road
I need a jacket, ain't know it was this cold
A musical misery
Fucking me up mentally, is that where I'm meant to be?
Cross my heart and hope to die been praying for a flatline
All these fuckin' posers, imitators on my timeline
Laying in my coffin I need overdose to fuck time
Percocet withdrawals make me realize what it feel like 
16 lines of blow and I'm fine 
Break my bones, but act as my spine 
I wonder who you'll fuck when I die
And if I tried to call, would you cry? 
Please don't cry, you're wastin' your time 
16 lines will make me feel fine 
10 years ago I went blind
I been on my own since age nine
Is anybody out there? 
Can anybody hear me? 
I hate it when you fake care 
Girl, I know you hear me
