They like me 'cause I rap and be with the athletes 
Stop askin' me , I know they mad at me 
Hop in the coupe, then I slide like it's Vaseline

In the lab with Celine like that bag that she wanted 
A lot of tings, ass bustin' out them jeans, make you want it 
Make you wanna spend a 50, hit the scene with her, don't it?

Hell nah, I don't love nun' but my money and my rifle, 
At the top like Eiffel Tower, I told her to beat it
You would have thought she was Michael! 
She don't wanna be a freak no more, 
She don't wanna take molly, get geeked no more,

She telling me she wanna tie up the knot,

Said, "What you doing out here in L.A.?"
She on vacation but stripping in Tennessee
I got her number, asked her what she doing later
She said she would hit me on my cellular, 
I knew she was digging my pimping
And new Christian Louboutin's forgot to mention. 
I brought that bitch in my facility
Told her, "My favorite room in here's the kitchen, 
After I whip all these chickens
I watch you get naked and wash all these dishes", 
She licked me, she fucked me, she sucked me
Then tried to give me a kiss, bitch you tripping 
She wanna hit my muddy trouble double
Told that bitch, "Pour your own muddy trouble"
I shouldn't have fucked her, now she's in her feelings, 
Shawty broke down and start telling her business
I said to lil' mama, "You tripping
I don't give a fuck what you did, cause business is business." 
So now we sitting in my condo, 
I don't even know what to say no more
She's telling me, telling me she don't wanna be a freak no more, but...
I know she's a freak, I know that she freakin'
I know she's a freak, super freak
So please do not try to run game on me, I'm not a Playstation
Please do not try to run game on me, I'm not a 360

Deceasing opponents so properly 
Unleashing the dark side what got to me 
We come to take this shit over 
Foot on the gas, hear the motor 
Switchin' my thoughts, I'm bipolar 
I stare in the eyes of a cobra 
Say you want smoke, come get it 
You wanna play dumb, I'm wit' it 
I'm about to take over the city 
I came with my committee, gang with it 
Came for the bag and the profit 
Lookin' for the wave when we got it 
Nigga, you ain't scare nobody

Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain
Danger, danger

Believer, believer
I can take out all the evil
Empowerment to all my people
I can prove to you I'm a leader
Run through the money, no Visa
Forgive me 'cause my life illegal
Searchin' for the bag and the prize 
On a mission lookin' for them bad guys
Can't run no play over my head, I'm real wise
Look at his eyes, wide, think he traumatized
Take me as a joke, I'ma hang 'em on the rope 
'Cause where I'm from, we don't play like that on nawf side 
Better not freeze 'cause we know you're gon' choke 
Talk behind my back but your shots backfired 
I know you tried but you never could survive
I see the fear that's in your eyes 
Run like Forrest, they tryna hide
They criticize in disguise 
They know I can only tell the truth 
They know all you do is tell lies 
I'm about to take over the city, tell me you just with it
'Cause I know my squad gon' ride 
Cold case, cold-cold case
On the dark side, if you keep cold, it's a cold case
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
In my right mind, I can ride right 'til I road rage
Cold-cold case, cold case
Skeleton on my left wrist, in that soul place
Cold-cold case, cold-cold case
On my knees, thanking God that he got me through the pain

Sip slow and live fast 
I ended up in first place but I swore a nigga started last 
I was born empty-handed but a nigga knew I had to get a bag 
I was raised by my mama, so a nigga never really had a dad 
Remember that lick we had hit? 
Broke in and we found the stash 
20K right by the stand 
Wrapped up in a brown paper bag 
That wasn't part of the plan 
Take out the tape from the cam 
No evidence on who I am

Break the bread up with the famIt's been a long time coming
From young niggas to young rich niggas

Young rich nigga riding round the city with the mac

Whipping and breaking it, making it, taking it
Nigga they mistake me, think I'm selling that midget 
What the fuck a nigga really wanna talk about? 
You a bitch, we ain't got nothing to talk about
Shaking like a stripper, put that mac chicken up in his mouth
Skippa Da Flippa, he told me weigh it up and bust it down
Migo Jerz, whipping that lambo, now watch it swerve
Tray 1 got PT's, and sold that reserved
I'm a hot boy, so you know I gotta stay low 
Quavo told me, trap on the block and bang 'em like OJ Mayo
You niggas are rookie but young Takeoff, I'm a vet 
'Set told me trapping and dabbing gon' get that pussy wet
No Crocodile Dundee, Stingray vet
Whatever I wanna do, I do it, Nike check 
I'm a young nigga with the rich nigga ambitions
At the Migo show, a nigga autographing titties
There's levels to this shit like Meek said
And you embarrassed to admit it, I don't want to kick it
After my show, the gangster-ist nigga, he looking suspicious
Walk right up on him, I'm pressing my nigga
And all he wanted was a picture
I used to smoke Swishers like a regular nigga
Now I'm a Backwoods type of nigga
A nigga, he ran up, tried to rob, I shot him
White people, they still treat me like I'm a victim
Now people they screaming out "Free Actavis"
They talking bout that Actavis be discontinued
Check my cup of muddy trouble, got packs in the attic
Catch me riding with packs in my rental

I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country
When you in the streets, you know you gotta make a name
I stole a Mustang, drop top, no brain
Police had a nigga, cause they know I'm in a gang
Taking pictures of a nigga like a groupie, like a fan
On my first lick, only got a little bit of change
Thinking like Obama, something gotta change
Did a lot of dirt, I had to sit up in the chains
When I got outta jail, did the same thing
I spent that money, money, coming back like boomerang
Cocaine in her nose like a septum ring
My niggas be trapping the gas, propane
Hit the nigga with a chopper, nigga bang bang
I was getting money, way before the rap game
As a young nigga, used to wear the fake chain
They say that I'm ignorant, $50,000 on a chain
You know it ain't come from Johnny Dang
Fake watch busta can't bust me, no lie
Won't catch me with the fake jewelry, I got too much pride
They killed my nigga Pistol P for a three-five
I pay the ticket, when are you gon' die
When I'm in the kitchen, I be cooking crack pies
I got chickens in the trunk, you think I work at Popeyes
The streets is the jungle, my nigga, you better survive
Getting married to the money nigga, that my bride
My diamonds gon' shine, might poke you in the eye
You selling by the ounce, my nigga, you just getting by
Put the birds in my hands, knows when's it gon' fly
Glah! Glah! Glah! In the bushes like a spy
Nigga talking stupid, we don't let that shit fly
Talking crazy to the Migos, boy you know we keep the fire
Got that chopper, flip a nigga like a domino
Young rich nigga, never made the honor roll
Hit his ass with the .44, make him fold
Chattahoochee River where that nigga body float
On the nation, my nigga we throwing up the forks
She on a mission, trying to fuck me, better get your ho
Big bank take little bank
Yellow diamonds on my rella like a moon cake
Two Glocks on my hip like Tomb Raider
Arnold Schwarzenegger turn into the Terminator

You may never been there, catch me cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
Coca leaves and palm trees, we cross the country
Cross the country, cross the country
She don't understand English but she want me
Cross the country, cross the country
I had to get a Visa cause I'm in and out the country
Cross the country, my plug he in Wyoming
And the only time I pull up on you, if a nigga owe me
And the whole word know that a young nigga rap
But a pussy nigga better not provoke me
Came in the game with the formula, sold it
Now I gotta switch it up on you phonies
Pocket full of macaroni, Mac-11, run up on you
All you can eat in my trap like it's Shoney's
Rich Nigga Timeline: that's my motherfucking testimony

Get juuged,  get capped, that's a part of the game, squad shit
Oh no, I done rolled around the block and I don't see him
I paid a J $200 just to hit me when he see him
If I was you right now, I wouldn't wanna be him
Caught him two weeks later in the club, with his mamacita
He had some jewelry on him, worth $100 so I took it from him
Took the first PJ across the country, got too hot for a moment
They say he got work, now I own it
Now my squad, they going up, no Makonnen
In the players pad at the Caesar's Palace
Out in Las Vegas, like I'm Roman
All types of Euros and Yen
I got money in Berlin
I told the Lord forgive me for my sins
Cause I don't wanna do it again
Cross the country, cross the country

Them boys talkin' 'bout the boards on the windows 
When you trappin', keep a shooter at the front door
Fuck, twelve! Runnin' out the back do'

Skippa Da Flippa done flipped a nigga, never fold 
Pipin' up in front of your bitch, you'll get elbowed 
Ping pong, hit a nigga with the ring on 
Yung Rich Nation jeans on, it's yo' theme song 
So many pints in my crib, it's a lean home

Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for 
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow 
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors

Take off on the plug, I hit him with the finger roll
If you can buy the car then why the fuck you rent it for 
All of my niggas they ready to get you and hit you and flip you
And never leave no witnesses to see you

Fucked ‘em up with the dab, so we goin’ up on the feature
All of my bitches they piped up and conceited
Offset!
Semi-automatic out the window of the Caddy 
I know this shit is tragic, toss your bitch up like a salad 
Walk up in the mansion, I just made a money pallet 
Trappin’ out the bando, selling crack up in the alley 
I send my young niggas, act a fool with the tool 
Contemplating, should I drop a four or drop a deuce?
Heard you a real slick looking for a good lick 
But my niggas ain’t going for the bullshit 
I got the stick, nigga don’t trip 
Nigga run up in your house and tying up your bitch 
Boot up that bitch in the morning on grits 
J’s at the bando in the morning, got to fix 
I’m sitting on the pedestal, my diamonds look impeccable 
Your bitch sucking my dick just like an edible 
Make her take a physical like medical 
Fucking bitches overseas like it’s America 
You niggas don’t even know I got some pain in me 
Missing my grandma, wish she could sing to me 
A lot of dirt I did, I got some shame in me 
When I’m pulling up I drop the brain on it 
Came in the game with the fashion statement 
We dropped Versace, the fame it came quick 
Got to stay focused, consistent, don’t quit 
Brick on my wrist and it make me a lick 
All my niggas turn to Rambo or commando 
We the first ones that came up with the bando 
Talking ‘bout you got the Act but what they goin’ for 
I’m bout to start extorting niggas for that Migo flow 
We the ones that really came in with the kicking doors 
Same niggas brought Versace to the centerfold

Wanna come to the bando, knock two times then twist the handle
Got everything in stock, whatever you need, just ask me

I'm a Wizard, Antwan Jamison
My plug ain't Kangaroo Jack, but he Australian
And he got crack sacks in the knapsack
Critics say I'm a product of my environment
Selling that dope to economists, menace to society
On the top of the mountain, you under me

Sipping lean, yeah I'm good on tequila
My neck is so sick, got the measles
This for my my niggas that trap in the Regal
Ounces, ounces, ounces, molly Santana's tall as a mountain
Put the molly on top of her tongue
She sucking and fucking, she ain’t got no manners
Back to the basics, I’m counting these faces
My pockets inflating off trapping the babies
You niggas fugazi, my niggas, they strapped like the Navy
I’m the mayor, matter fact, I’m the president
Sipping on Actavis, like it's my medicine
Throwing the bird with accuracy, all of you niggas is amateur
Pull up in Phantoms, but trap out of Challengers

Plug in China I have to meet this man 
Choppers imported from Kazakhstan

]
Slide in the pussy like a surfboard
Killing these niggas get a hearse for 'em
Fuck you niggas even sellin work for
You next to tell put your chirp on
Be the main reason pussy niggas gettin' murked for
Little nigga, who you work for?
Cause I came for the bosses I ain't for no losses
You playin', it's dirt for 'em
And I came from the first floor
Gangbanging hoes like a turf war
Then hit the road for my first tour
My level went up to the third floor
And I swerved on these hating niggas
MIA with some Haitian niggas
Bad bitches keep takin' pictures
I pulled up in that Wraith nigga like whoa!
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions 
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison 
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
All of my life, I only wanted nothing but Franklin
Touchdown on a fuck nigga
Make him tuck in his shell like he Franklin
You and my niggas are not the same
I jumped out the Lamb' like Bruce Wayne
The ten-piece of chicken is on the way
I told 'em Carlito to andale
You see them new niggas in the back of the club
Just look at them plottin' in conversations
I know they don't know!
I sent the Migos to come back to the bando for translation
Camera rollin', Quavo Spike Lee
Heroin black, look like Willie B
If you do the coke, you gon' buy some skis
If you in our trap, you gon' buy some ki's
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions 
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison 
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater, you don't know how I'm feeling right now
Young Takeoff, I am a professional
Vegetarian, only eat vegetables
I got some kush you can roll up
And I got some kush you can eat that is edible
Stretching the work like I'm Mr. Incredible
You ain't never seen no work as flexible
And I turn on the stove, and I'm whipping the brick
For that pay my, nigga turn to Predator
I bet you didn't know I was twenty-two
Win the judge ten times, what a miracle
Me and my son identical, seventeen years old
I had him I didn't know what to do
I had to put food on the plate!
Asking the Lord, "give a nigga some faith"
Now when I wake up I look at my lake
My foot on the pedal not touching the brake
No chess but, nigga, I got me a check!
I bet you didn't know that my niggas make millions 
It's sad to say some of my niggas convicted to prison 
When you at the top you don't want to look down, you don't want to look down
In a submarine underwater , you don't know how I'm feeling right nowWoah, woah

Pipe up this bitch 
If she is basic I pipe up your bitch 
Think it's dark in this bitch 
Don’t worry cause I got some light on my wrist 
Want to talk about dab
The difference between us and them, we created that shit 
Stackin’ money ever since
If it ain’t about money it don’t make sense 
Dope in the coupe and it’s two percent tint 
Dope in her coochie, I'm pimping this bitch 
Keep it a hundred, I’m sick of this bitch 
Never ate breakfast but eat up the grits 
Hold everything but she can’t get the stick 
Taking a charge, I’ma give her the dick 
Chew it up, eat it up like it’s a Twix 
Most of these niggas nowadays counterfeit 
Go see your jeweler my nigga, you tripping
Your diamonds so little that they got me squinting
I forgot to mention you tryna get a verse from me
Then I’ma have to charge you at ten 
Then I go 24 karat my kitchen
Fell asleep on drank at the house party with Diddy 
Who the fuck said we ain’t plugged in the city
Never mind, niggas done turned into crickets

I’m not your average rapper 
Come to my trap, I’ll tax ya 
My diamonds came from Africa , like Michael Blackson 
I spent 10k in Magic , two bitches fucked my fashion 
They think because I’m rapping , Houdini won’t do magic 
Working the water in Atlantic 
Money stretched out to Kansas 
Big body panoramic 
I told your bitch to get to dancing 
Shoot a nigga, hit the canvas 
Get off my grass like I’m Stanley

Look at my diamonds, they wink and say peek-a-boo 
I shock the block like I’m Pikachu 
I shot the Glock, tried to kill a few 
I put that dope in her dookie chute 
We fuck these bitches, we switch-a-roo 
I had to beat it like Michael do 
I get the Sprite and I spike a deuce 
I create flames when I’m in the booth 
Wide , body , I’m bout to buy me an island 
Dab , stylish , these not on the shelf, you can’t find ‘em 
Ice , blind ‘em , if I’m eyeing it told you I’m buying it 
We together, we never divided 
Like a feather I’m flier than pilots 
Chew my dab up just like it is Trident 
Kept it real with you niggas, we tried it 
Got to hit hard and move silent 
If it’s bout the money then I’m riding 
If you broke, need a job, I can hire you 
Offset, your dab is expiring 
Your pockets ain’t straight, need alignment 
The bando is my type environment It's a brand new day, got brand new bitches
Wrapping up chickens, I'm leaning, I feel like I'm fallin'
But really I'm trippin'
Only wear Bally's when I rock the Bentley
Gas so loud, y'all niggas can't hear me
Pull out that KLAW, know they gone feel me
Whippin' that Brittney, that Whitney, that Lindsay
Like I'm a chemist, treat em like dentist
You showing your benjis on Instagram flexing
Maybe tonight, but ain't got a session
I hate to be you cause I know its depressing
Must think its a salad the way that I'm dressing
I walk up in Neiman, I see it I cop it
I pull out my pocket, you pull out your wallet
Who you impressing, you know you ain't got it
Diggin' through pockets, changing the topic
Nigga just stop it, it hurt me to see you ain't got it
Make me wanna come out my pocket
I'ma get it back cause a nigga got a sack, so my lil' double cup got filled full of the Act
Young nigga got bricksquad, we crack
If a nigga talkin' back, I'm aimin' the strap
It's a brand new day, in a brand new whip, and a brand new 45 sittin' in my lap
It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin' 
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurting
Aye hold up Takeoff, you see that nigga
It's a brand new nigga on the block, hit his ass with a brand new Glock
Knock em off the block like he playing hopscotch
My niggas is crazy, we keep the new babies
We ride in Mercedes keep crack like the 80s
They cook it, they whippin', they slavin'
I ride 'round the city screaming "Mama we made it!"
I'm busting them bricks out the wrapper
Too hot for a trapper, so now I'mma rapper
My pot too big, got too much water, so I skrt-skrt with a boat paddle
I see you running with the sack
Quavo the linebacker so I had to make the tackle
Got Migos in Mexico right now, putting 50 bricks on a horse saddle
I'm servin' them patients, my money is ancient
My diamonds are lookin' like I bought a ice glacier
Addicted to paper, I movin' to Cali
I roll me a blunt and I go watch the Lakers
So much gas you'll need a ventilator
My house so big got marijuana acres
Pots and the pans, Quavo the baker, molly in the jar, look like a saltshaker
It's a brand new day and the birds they chirpin'
It's a brand new day plus my Nextel chirpin'
Ya'll niggas got work but you ain't never ever working
Throwin' money in the club when you know your pockets hurtingPlease help me
Top down on da NAWF, I'm home
I can never get lost, no no
I play the field and the coach 
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho
For some reason I can't cry, cry
For some reason, I am not tired
For the gang, I gotta bring it home
For my grandma watchin' in the sky 
You probably can't tell me nothin'
You probably gonna see me stuntin'
You probably wanna see me run
You probably wanna see me run on 'em
But I got my top down of on da NAWF 
Believe in what I did and what I saw 
Stand on my word by law
Mama prayin' on the devil, shake 'em off 
Boulders on my shoulder, weights on me
I will never fold up when it's on me
Stash a whole mil' in the backseat
Just to move them thangs down the backstreet
Top down on da NAWF , I'm home
I can never get lost , no, no
I play the field and the coach
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho
I done survived the gun smoke 
Some of my niggas ain't survive, God bless your soul 
The codeine eased in my mind 'cause my eyes on the road 
The Patek is rose, we hide in the flats and bandos
I'ma pull up on that nigga with the five then
If I could go back, I would whip up a pie again
I got the hood all on my back and they ready to die for him
Dope, trappin' up out of the gym, 2Pac is above the rim 
Watchin' me like I am a film, they want the chips, the drip
The sauce, my hoe, I look at the niggas like shrimp
Fuck these niggas, these niggas ain't come from the NAWF 
85 nawf the route  and I'm not leavin' 'em out 
Yeah, shippin' 'em out , don't let the money run out 
Top down on da NAWF, I'm home
I can never get lost , no, no
I play the field and the coach 
And they know, that's why I'm Huncho
No question we come from the NAWF, they know we the boss 
Only site, no map involved, I cannot get lost 
And we know you flaw, everything you say is false 
I'ma scrape his jaw, pay the ticket, you get off
No navigation needed or GPS at all 
My neck and wrist conceited, full of Fiji and it costs 
Mirror, mirror, who the richest niggas of 'em all? 
The mirror spoke to me and said, "No cap, I think it's y'all"
Takeoff
In the night time, we can ride then
I'ma slide on that bitch outside then 
I'ma make sure my wrist all iced in 
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then 
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then 
I'ma make sure my wrist on fire then 
I'ma make sure my wrist outside 
I'ma make sure my wrist outside then 
Have you ever swam with sharks in the deep blue, huh?
Ever been in the dark when there is no sun, huh?
Ever been on the NAWF with hundred round drum?
With a hundred round drum 
Drum  drum
Pull up on me, show me outside then 
Pull up on me, show me let it fly then
Yeah, yeah, yeah

That's the same way the gladiators did 
I'm the gunman but I love the kids 
Quavo Superman, Quavo John Wick

Hail Mary

Birds in the trap singin' Mary Mary 
Bullets tickle yo stomach like Pillsbury 
Look for him every day till you find him 
Cut off his wife's finger to remind him 
Do a drive-by when I say, Simon 
Send him to kill ya, that’s a assignment 
Set this shit on fire, change the climate 
Throw the body in the river up in Winder 
I get you knocked off even if it's minor 
Cookin' up the dope, sneezin', fuck wit' my sinus 
I'm with the shit, fuck nigga, I'm John Wick 
Hit his ass with the gauge and it hurt my wrist

White girl, she geeked off of angel dust
Boy you sugar and spice, like a Powerpuff
Shoot a nigga like a catapult
You tell me you broke; I don’t give a fuck
I fuck her one time and I’m sick of her
Perform at the Fox, no Vivica
Get that pack out the box on the Reebok
When you get the dope and it’s recooked
You talking about something that he took
The first time you shot, it was off a little bit
Then you came back and got rebooked
Twenty-four karat, all gold on my neck, you think I got it from Egypt
If dabbing go for a contagious disease, you think that shit was the measles
Everything foreign, everything foreign, came a long way from that regal
I got the birds, like an eagle
Traded away, that’s a Michael Vick eagle
You just worry about yours
I’ma just worry about mine
Shout out to my nigga, Jerz
We used to trap nicks and dimes
I don’t drink, but I still buy pints
Hundred thousand cash make your hoe faint
Drugs and money is something we talk about all the time, but you can relate
Don’t imitate, the dab I create
I’m in YRN clothing or in Bathing Ape
Niggas be saving up for a lifetime just to
Get a new rollie and go out and skate
Billionaire looking my way I’m on pace
Feeling like Donald Trump back in the day
Don’t beef with no rapper it’s a money race
It won’t be an issue if you come in first place
Give it to him in the worst way
Finesse the plug with a fade away
I bought my diamonds from a Blu-Ray
I bought Versace shades from Ray 
Put a ‘tato on the K
It gon’ be loud anyway
The Migos life, you think, a maze
But really, my nigga, we straight
Takeoff!
Nigga we straight, no one down to debate
At the round table steak and a stack on my plate
I stack and pray and I stay out the way
It’s a good day today, I’ma pour me an eight
Grab the act out the refrigerate
Call up the plug, see what we gonna do today
Hundred-round on me, don’t speak or say “Hey”
Nigga look in my way, you get shot in the face
Dab when I jump out the Wraith
When you talk on the telephone, watch what you say
They gave them one hundred and they closed the case
Got off the road, I threw half a mill in my safe
Transactions on trap phone, so it ain’t no trace
Don’t come out the house, you can’t make it back safe
Walk in with a knot; you know I’m cashing out
Used to tell them folks “Put your shit on layaway,”
When it’s the summer, the spring, or the fall, or the winter, my niggas they having pistols
You pushing that rental, my niggas pull up on you with them
Don’t say nothing, Domingo gone get ‘em
After you get ‘em, Domingo gon’ split ‘em
Can’t let these niggas fuck up my momentum
These bitches is snake, trying to feed me that venom
I trap out the bando; the boards come on the windows
I remember, I can’t afford a fender bender
Now I’m fucking bitches and I’m Malcolm in the Middle
I see you toting that pistol, but you ain’t gonna shoot it with ‘em
What the fuck is you doing, nigga, you might as well kill him
Niggas rapping and stealing the flow, but nigga I invented it
You bitch want some boot, and I ain’t talking about Timberland
These bitches gold diggers, ain’t gon’ give ‘em non’
Gold on my pinky, so you know she digging that
Plug in Arkansas; I call him a Razorback
Fuck what you talking about, I ain’t hearing none of that
All them niggas stick ‘em up for a 60-pack
Chopper on ‘em make a nigga do jumping jacks
I’m slanging tree, like I’m the lumberjack
Front me a brick, I’m running, I’m not coming back
My gas is the greatest, Muhammad Ali
Roll the backwood, it hit like a punching bag
Got the beam on the chopper, play laser tag
Cooking up M&M, wait for the aftermath
My car is robotic, my wrist is robotic
Hit the Glock and I cock it, you take a nap
I’m a Nawfside lil’ nigga, don’t fuck with no nigga
On your cheese, they put you in a mousetrap
I can’t remember the last time we had a drought
Plug up in New York, them birds flying south
We fuck these bitches and then swap ‘em out
Chopper break all your bones diagnose you with gout
Julio Jones, we running paper routes
John Wick in the cut deuce deuce in his crotch
Don’t be a fool, you get wet like a pool
Got a hot ass Uzi, cooling, keep that shit cool
In the court room represented by Jews
Hundred thousand, two hundred, working moves
When you got a pistol you go to advantage ‘em
Ready for war, ‘case a nigga get manage
Niggas see Offset; they start to go panic
They know I’m no bullshit; I’m ready to damage
I’m screaming out, “Fuck it,” my cup is still muddy
Don’t kick it with niggas; don’t play “buddy buddy”
Pussy ass nigga, you soft, Teletubby
Pulling up on you lil’ babies, like Huggies
Spanish bitch in the kitchen, mamacita
No panties on, she just got on a wife-beater
They say that the Migos better than the Beatles
We leaders, we pour an eight up in a liter
I came from the dirt; they call me the Grim Reaper
It’s cheaper to leave her; I leave her to beaver
Dabbing on them Louboutins, like a zebra
Want to know anything about the bando, I’ll teach you Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh
 When a nigga hit the plug

Hit the pot just for the extras, abracadabra it’s missing
Hit the pot, hit it, hit it, hit it, make 'em take that like Diddy
Fuck fuck nigga talking, pull up on the block with extensions

Had enough to pay my dividends, Migos I’m a citizen
It was evident we had to stay passionate
Pissing diamonds accident, my money is immaculate
Hit 'em with the tackle
Pull out the chopper, not fronting I’ll rush 'em
Sipping on Actavis in my blood vessel
I am not a mason but I’m rocking Margiella’s
Higher than a motherfucker, just like a propeller
I’m riding in the Mulsanne, Bentley got umbrellas
My plug’s too far so I tell a nigga mail 'em
Your bitch look like she want to fuck some
That’s what I did when I came in the room and I hit her with the uh

She tried to put my dogs in her dog house
When they smell fear you know they poppin' off
I'ma go and fuck your daughter study law
I'ma stand for what I believe 'til I fall
If I never said it, I'm sayin' it right now
Say what you want I'ma shed my pride now
Everybody say fuck the feds and five-o
Gave everybody theirs it's mine now
I'ma make a public announcement, call now
Turn to a blood, them A's went down now
Kinda good lookin', them bitches fine now
I'ma drip some red on the sauna
I'ma cop the bread when it's all gone
I get a machete on for you
Sleepin' on that bitch like I'm comfortable
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, two-thousand on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like a cocoon
Designer gifts red bottoms baboon
We the wave, we the wave, typhoon
Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room
I put the fours on 'em
Came from juggin' with bowl homie
Now look all this rose gold, gold yellow gold, gold, gold on me
Yeah mob ties frog eyes
What a time to be alive
No neighbors
House on the hill with the acres
Don't date her
Running through the squad slave her
I'm the mayor
President Huncho a player
Twin chopper, Sonic and Tails
Twin chopper, Sonic and Tails
Niggas love when the birds sing
White cocaine Pinky and the Brain
Love when the box hit the mail
I love when the player wanna bail
I hate when a nigga want problems
But I love to give a nigga shells
God protect me from the evil
Take the squad out the cheetahs
Streets crawling like beetles
But the Stanley Steamer keep me cleaner
You got it out the mud I got it out the oil
You heard the cash prince niggas on Forbes
I'm the plug, extension cord
Got your favorite model on drugs If you ain't know it
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, two-thousand on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon

Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room
Ayy, I ain't tryna save 'em
Momma said don't let 'em know where you lay at
Old bitches back in the day use to play bad
I'm a pull up flexing in the Maybach
Northside nigga but we bought the A back
I'm a beat the motherfucker make his face flat
Hit it from the back, back, baby throw it back
Have a heart attack, can you handle that?
Maison Margiela dabbin' on everybody
I'm on the codeine moving like a dead body
Bad bitch went to college but she real thotty
That's the reason I can't even trust nobody
Celine and Supreme I'm the dab daddy
She coming home with me when she mad at ya
Sucking on me buckling my knees throw a bag at ya
Molly feel like Hercules when a nigga jab at ya
Hold on wait, Hopping in the Wraith
Stars in the ceiling like I'm living out of space
Manoeuvre like a boss we don't ever leave a trace
Dirty Diana the chopper keep a nigga safe
Fucking a model bitches big booty little waist
I'm putting the money over these bitches any day
This one for the people that taking drugs everyday
Fuck what they say let the pain go away
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, two-thousand on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two
By myself at the top like cocoon

Take her out of the hills to fuck with some goons
Now she breaking pounds in my room
Pinky codeine and mushrooms
Sweep a nigga like I was a broom

Chop a nigga with the bamboo in Cancun
Twenty bitches runnin' 'round nude
I fuck her bottom we fuckin' them by the two
I got water drippin' out my jewels
If it ain't Actavis nigga it ain't approved
Migo the gang we will never lose
So many bitches might catch me on Shade room
Got a Pit bull thinking 'bout copping a Baboon
Free all my niggas like a movie they coming soon
When I'm in the coupe I feel like I'm in a cacoon
Ten bitches ready up at the Boom Boom Room
Actin' a John but I ain't Tune
Takeoff!
When I take drugs I go to the moon
Lil' spoiled bitch, two-thousand on shoes
Walk in the club with one bitch, leave with two

Let me turn these lights off

You know how we get it
Can’t find my lighter though
Migos
Young rich niggas
Young niggas been doing real boss shit
They know where they got this shit from
Came in the game kicking doors, fucking hoes, and rocking gold 
Now our pockets swoled 
Been having hoes 
Been having niggas on go 
For real 
Ask about it
I’ma put on for my city 
You gon’ put on for these bitches
Young nigga I came from nothing
And now I’m at parties with Diddy
See at first they didn’t believe me
Now this shit coming way too easy
I’m with a paid assassin
Run to the money, we dashing 
We the ones came up with dabbing
We put ‘em on trap fashion
I made a play out in Athens
I’m whipping up Kylie Kardashian
Same niggas see me having
Used to be the same niggas laughing
Now my palm itching
Now my palms itching
Came from bomb pitching
My mama be the witness
Free my convicts
That took a long sentence
All my niggas came from the north, they born menace
Ay, ay, no Kanye
I walk in the trap, play with yay
Bao, bao, bao, ra-ra-rao watch what you mu’fuckers say 
Call up the lean, pour an eight
Then pop an eight, tray tray
Then I fill a Backwood, the cookies it came from the Bay
Bitch, I came from the trap
Take her phone, she wanna snap
I don’t get no sleep, I just take naps
I look out the peep, 12 at the trap
I look out my peep, 12 at the trap
Ay, my nigga gon’ run with that sack
Ay, my nigga gon’ flush that lil pack
I jump out the window then forty yard dash
That’s the shit I used to do in the past
Now we through playing, we playing with cash
Droppin my top just to dump out the ash
Wrestle with work like my name Kevin Nash
Let me take it back just for two minutes
Fourteens and the nines, had tools in it
And you notice that it didn’t have windows
That the first fucking million dollar bando
Some niggas came in the game dancing but Migos you know we came in with the fashion
Ain’t talking ‘bout Donatella but we the most underrated rappers reppin’ and havin’
My niggas have a 30 plus a 30 in the vicinity literally 
I would give you names of these Migos clones but it’s every rapper in the industry 
And they wanna know why we pressing these niggas, they don’t let us in they facility
Cause if you ask me I feel like I should get a percentage the way they be stealing me
Elmo, these niggas they tickle me
Drink codeine and trap out the embassy
Mama said niggas’ll envy me
Behind the lot shootin’ at my enemies
Quavo got Kylie, well I got that Kimberly
Drinking codeine, moving slow like a centipede
We brought that flow back when niggas didn’t know
People compare Migos to Bone Thugs-n-Harmony
I put my blood sweat and tears in the game
And I still got more years so I bet they’ll remember me
All of these niggas they trying to rap nowadays
When I start spitting I ball cause it’s inner me
Remember taking trips in the Infinity
Looking for gold, electronics, or Benjamin’s
, the block is sizzling
Gotta stay low key cause witnesses snitching
Who the fuck told ‘em north side wasn’t the trenches?
These niggas bitches, they want some attention
Niggas get put in detention
It ain’t my fault, nigga, it’s your decision
No presents up under your christmas tree
Cause I am the Grinch, stole christmas
Wonder why your children not watching Disney
Cause Migos we making a history
I bought twenty pints of Activis
You think I’m sellin’ em, but that’s just for me to sip it
If you don’t believe me you can ask Quavo, matter fact Offset was right there with me
Offset!!
History repeat itself, I got locked up again
I came home to the Benjamin’s
As a young nigga they always envied me
You copy my dab, you lil niggas are mini-me’s
My necklace it cost me a brick a piece
Fuck the bitch so good I make the bitch’ knees weak
Dropped the top off the Bentley, it’s up to me
I sat on a milly while I was in custody
Picked up my stick, hundred rounds in my clip
Double cup of Actavis, I pour a couple zips
I’m that same nigga that jumped in the VIP
Lot of niggas pussy ‘cause they know that I’m a killer
Made a couple million, but the bricks up in the rental
We was in the bando, trapping, capping, I remember
I really beat the nigga, caught a pussy nigga stealing
Get hit with that stick and I bet you gon’ feel it
Pull up in Maseratis, where my ceiling
I see a nigga plotting, where my semi
I can whip me up a brick in a minute
Throw on Margiela one day, then Givenchy
Got the game in submission, your bitch in my kitchen
Don’t care ‘bout no ho cause that money my mission
Chill Will want a body, his finger been itching
And my Ferrari got bricks by the engine
Don’t fuck with no rappers, these fuck niggas bitches
I’m not being friendly, I don’t want to kick it
Didn’t write no letter, you niggas ain’t visit
I took a plea, I said fuck it, I did it
YRN 2, nigga listen up, hear it
We back on our shit, you can’t fuck with us period
I see a million when I’m in the mirror
Get hit with the Glock and I scrape off the serial
Hop in the Lamb, hit the gas, hit the gear
I got a shooter with me, he right here
I got your bitch suck my dick, on my Lear
Police be watching me like a premiere
Put that lil bitch on some molly
She ride on my dick like a trolley
All of my cars are exotic
Knock a nigga off, don’t get indictedMigos!
Talk to em Takeoff
Takeoff, Takeoff!
You niggas be bitin' my style and I like it
But you niggas know you weren't rapping like this
Trend setter, I'm a trend setter 
Knockin' them out like I'm Mayweather 
Bando look like it's a homeless shelter 
She poppin' that molly like  Alka-Seltzer )
Whippin' that dope with the terminator
Wrist is spillin' dope all on my Breitling bezel 
My mansion got 80 acres
Trap underground, they calling me Undertaker 
They wonder why I got the Bentley, the Fisker
I put in work and dedication 
50 pairs, Giuseppe steppers
Maison Margielas, they think I'm on Rocafella
The kids, they call me Slick Rick 
I make up a script, they call me the storyteller 
I got the Britney, the Whitney, the Iggy
We murdered Versace like Biggie 
Hannah Montana, fuck nigga we been in that Coogi
It's time to kill em' with Givenchy
Red bottoms, scenes are forensic
Designer frames, limited edition
Pushin' one button, my roof and then its missing 
Dope on my Louboutins just left the kitchen 
You turn on the radio you gon' hear every rapper tryna rap like the Migos 
Fuck nigga wanna clone?
Been rappin' like this since No Label 
Fuck the fame rather be rich
Been gettin' money, since No Label 
You waiting for it, then here it go, the intro to No Label 2
QC, It's funny my nigga right
Cause everybody wanna sound like us
But they don't wanna give us the respect, right?
You fuck niggas gon' learn we started this shit
We the first niggas to come out the A, on that real street shit
That real Northside shit, holdin' their muthafuckin' county down
Not city nigga, county nigga
Tell another nigga to do it like us, nigga
QC the label, money on the table
Migo Gang, No Label!
Way back in the day nigga made No Label in a basement 
Young nigga got all that talent 
On the radio didn't have a placement 
Linked up with the hood 
OG Head Huncho, Migos 
Then we took over the north 
20 dollars to get your song played at Flamingos 
Remember the days of hitting licks? 
Every Christmas, had to be St. Nick (Christmas
Payin' bills, tryna meet the rent 
My mama she say that she sick of it 
I had to go get to the Benjamin 
Sorry Your Honor, I'm innocent 
Money moves the commitment 
No label, my life you witnessed it 
From kickin' doors 
Taking gold 
What did I cash out on? I don't know 
I will not tell on my soul 
Cause Ion' know if the case closed 
I know that you hate that Versace went gold 
Now I'm walking round with a blue bankroll 
Independent, never ever won't fold 
Gon!
See, I learnt the term from my nigga Biggie, right?
We went from ashy to classy
We went from having shit to fucking your bitch, my nigga
No Label, DJ Ray G
These my muthafucking brothers right here, Migo Gang
What niggas you know made a million in one summer without flipping bricks?
Ask your favorite rapper
I bet he say us, nigga
QC, the label
Hah! No Label!
Locked up on every mixtape 
Quavo told me nigga wait 
This is the only way we can escape 
I realized it when I sat down for an 8 
Grandma' told me and Quavo to be patient 
Grandma' was a cancer patient 
Before she died, she sat us down 
Said stay together and we're gonna make it 
For you niggas don't know 
Never really sold dope 
But I kicked door 
Free my nigga Willy Mae gave him 3 to the dome 
He didn't tell a soul 
You making me sick to my stomach
I might go and vomit 
You niggas is cloning 
We not together cause you my opponent 
Taking our style nigga we never loaned it 
Labels wanna sign, that ain't on my mind
Critics and blogs, you know they ain't lying 
Thirty thousand just to look at the time 
Twenty five hundred for my Louboutin 
Mansion Elan was our stomping ground
Our money big, your money minimized 
Taking shots cause your buzz died
Cutting the top off the Lamb' make it circumcised 
The world is fucked up but the strong survive
Haha, name your favourite club in Atlanta, my nigga

And that taught me a lesson, lil' mama got to be special
She just want to kick it with me, we can travel wherever
She know I got a busy schedule, sometimes she be acting selfish
When I hit her she be quitting cause she say it's too much pleasure
She telling me her favorite song is Handsome and Wealthy
She love it when I'm kissing on her body, start to melt her

We sticking together just like we salt and pepper

No, no, no, no
The way that I whip it, no Chef Boyardee, they wanna know the recipe
I pop a pint, and I pop me a eight, now I'm movin' slower than a centipede
Twenty bitches runnin' round the lobby, suckin', fuckin' just to say they did it
I done fucked so many bitches, saw many ass and titties, it's ridiculous
Get on my knees and I pray at night, forgive me for my sins know I do the wrong and rights
Situation feel right when I'm wrong, but a nigga feel wrong when I'm right
Gianni Versace cover my eyesight
Kid Cudi nigga trappin' day and night
I be in the water with the sharks and they bite
These real diamonds nigga, Rihanna, cut off the lights
All my niggas from the slums, only girl I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers
I'm the one they talkin' bout with the spot with the pots in there 
Walkin' round the city with a nine in my pants and a knot in ‘em 
Yo bitch she suckin' on me and she tryna get all of my 
Switcharoo your bitch, we flippin' that ho like a spatula
For real my nigga don't run up on me cause you niggas don't know me
Niggas that know me don't show me cause they know I got it on me
Feel like The Rock I'm giving out people elbows to all you Jabronis
You talkin' hundreds, we say chonies
Your niggas loaners my owners
Macaroni cottage cheese, 20 bandz in my Balmain jeans
No limit Master P, bout it bout it on the scene
When I take a piss, I see codeine
Hotboxin' backwoods in the lambo, can't breathe
If I smoke then it's expensive weed, I give you the sack if you find the seed
All my niggas from the slums, only girl that I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
We ain't gon' never have trap problems
If we ever have a problem, my niggas pull up with choppers
Came up from the bottom, now a nigga having power
Used to trap and slang powder, new Rolly ice on my hours
I got the bird like a owl, I'm in New York smokin' on sour
Look at you niggas is cowards, the bricks is surrounded like flower
I got her sangin' just like Mya, suckin' and fuckin' until she get tired
Feeling like Donald Trump, bitch you is fired
All my niggas blowing up like a fuckin' tire
Late nights in the bando feel like The Wire
My niggas heard that you snitchin, where is your wire?
And it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer
Said it's 50 thousand dollars just to put me on the flyer!
All my niggas from the slums, only girl that I love is my momma
All my niggas from the bottom, we gon' never have trap problems

Pussy nigga, we made it

The Audi, Bugatti, Ferrari, the Masi
The Bentley, the Fisker, the Jag, the Rover
With a bad bitch like Hova
My wrist it be spinning and spinning like it got a motor
Fifty bricks in the Toyota, trapping off the motorola!
Through this same time, it was last year
Migo gang still with the top,  Migo gang
Niggas wasn't fucking with me
Now they wanna fuck with me
Cause they see on tv in that Versace
I know that they hate it, I know that they hate it
I know that they praying we won't make it
Momma told me, "Son, you gon be the greatest
And you know that you gon always have haters."
16 stuffing zips in my windbreaker
Hanging with the OGs and the killers
Then that windbreaker turned to a chinchilla
No limit money nigga like I signed with Percy Miller
Whipping it, whipping that Hitler then hop in that Fisker
It was all a dream like Biggy
Grind hard, committed, Migo gang lieutenant
Lost a lot, now we winning
From the Hondas to Bentleys
First of all I wanna say ... fuck the feds
Wanna see a nigga locked up or dead
Straight up out the county, straight to the fortune
Remember back in the day broke on the porches
Smokin gas, sipping mud, driving in them Porsches
Now we traveling the world like a fucking orbit
Thousand dollars pair Giuseppes, no more rocking Jordans
Fully loaded Rolex for my son, Jordan
Now he looking up to daddy like my daddy important
Rolls Royce or the Maybach, that’s boss choices
Kick this shit like I'm Chuck "Offset" Norris
Rasputia my pockets they fat, don't mistake me for Norbit
WHOA!
Ever since day 1, had to juug some
Momma told me, 'better not run into these houses son"
What you mean ma? We gotta keep the lights on
She said, "Quavo you might run into the wrong one"
It was 2 years ago, it feel like it was yesterday
Task force around my house looking for a case
Turning on the channel news then I see my face
Turn myself in cause I know my lawyer beat the case
Then we dropped Bando, hoes go loco
How dare a nigga ever disrespect the Migos
Could see that hater look in the eyes, the way we hit em by surprise
Cause we blowing up like inner tube tires
Now look at my life rocking the ice, rocking the mic
Now my hoes a different color, looking like Mike & Ikes
 Damn right I changed my life
I hope I motivated young niggas to get their money right
Now this is for the people let em know that we some young rich niggas
Now this is for the people let em know that we got way more than one hit single
GONE!
Young Rich Niggas 2 ...
It's a blessing ...
From us to you ...Aye Offset , aye Takeoff, what's up, unk?
You remember that shit we did way way way back in the day?
 Motherfuckers said it wasn't gonna work
We was some crazy young niggas huh?
I'd like to welcome you to Yung Rich Nation
I know you been patiently waiting
Yung Rich Nation that's the album
Tryna turn the mansion to a castle
Diamond shine came from Africa, shine, shine 
 Ooh, damn, bachelor
Turn the club to a massacre 
 Sad to say
First check bought a Audi Coupe
It was black and grey like the Raiders
First check bought a Challenger
It was 10 bands so I paid it
Remember the time, Offset he got me high
That was right by the neighbors house?
Remember the time we broke in the neighbors house
That was our first paper route
Remember the time they shot up my mama house
12 tried to make it my fault
Remember the time you niggas laughed at me
Said that I wouldn't bond out
You say that you trappin', take you to the bando
Hand you a fork, see what you bout
Before we made the song Hit Em' wit it
We was knockin' niggas out
Before we made the song 'Birds', pelicans fly to the south
Niggas talkin' stupid up in crowd
Jumped in the crowd and punched em' in the mouth
First time we in Miami, we had a gangsta shootout
Dope in my sock, and we beat the trap out
Don't come in my trap if you unannounced 
Diamond shine came from Africa 
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors 
Turn the club to a massacre 
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya 
Remember the time, I did my first break and enter?
Me, myself & I ain't had nobody wit me
Cause I ain't want my uncles know I did it
Remember the time I got kicked out for havin' gas stashed in my locker?
In the gym choppin' it up wit my partners
Next thing you know got walked out by the coppers
First juug I hit at school, Lord please forgive me
I know you remember that
6 period plotted on my teacher had to hit for that fundraiser fanny pack
Got home and counted the check
I'm thinkin' to myself Takeoff what you gon' do wit that
Call the plug up ask him where he at
I'm celebratin' smokin' back to back
Remember that time Quavo came home with a full grown marijuana plant
Stinkin' up the crib tryin' dry it off in the oven it was still wet
Mama came in smelt the odor said "Damn boy I can catch contact"
I got that dope talkin' anthrax, hit a fat one when we hit for fifty racks
Diamond shine came from Africa 
Young Rich Niggas we some bachelors 
Turn the club to a massacre 
If you a broke nigga I'm sad at ch'ya Yeah, woo, yeah, skrrt

Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty 
Brand new Chanels

Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well 
If Nicki should show me her titty

Remember the day, my mama started crying
'Cause I pulled up in that NASCAR
My nephew 'gon whip, they callin' him  cause he dope and he passed the test
Poppin percs and I dashed off
These rappers be acting like Hasselhoff
Passed you a rock and you scared to ball
I got yo lil' bitch on a date at the mall
He know that you gone, she scared to call
When you get home, she dead my dog
We came from the bottom ain't scared to fall 
Been runnin' from 12, my legs exhausted 
12 racks in the wall, can't plug in the sockets 
I fit a hunnid ten racks in some pockets
Free all my niggas they eatin' on pockets
Gimme the beat and I beat the bass
Gimme yo bitch and I beat her face
Gimme the pot and I beat the cake
Gimme the AK, I seize the place
Just gimme, mansion with acres 
Gimme, just gimme

Walking out the bando with a .45
Shake a 7/11 in the dog pound
It's just another day on the Nawfside
I'm for real, nigga, you can ask about us, nigga
We earn stripes on the Nawfside
Just another day, just another day
Just another day on the North
Real talk, nigga
I know niggas took a loss, nigga
On the Nawfside, it's just another day on the Nawfside
On the North, it's just another day on the Nawfside
It's just another day, what is a day on the north?
Wake up in the morning, they kick in the door
We looking for money, we looking for gold
My niggas 100, my niggas on go
My niggas is trapping, dapping, what is you having?
Run with the sack and I go hit the hole
They calling me Quavo McFadden, no John Madden
I run the game
Look at my house, take a look at my ring
Walk in the North and I know I got rank
Pull up in the North and remember the day
I play the game like a game of spades
And I took me a flight to the Everglades
I told 'em that day that it was my way and never get paid of 50k
Nigga, they bucking, they rubbing, they sacking
Taking the pounds and breaking them down
What a beautiful day, my AK came equipped with 100 rounds
Niggas talking like they got the crown
Find their body in the lost and found
Chopper louder than surround sound
It's an undercover in the underground
Just another day on the Nawfside rollin' 
Riding around trying to get it in, 2Pac all eyez on me 
My young nigga hit a 100 band jugg in the club it was stolen
Young nigga still strapped by the North side
Gwinnett County patrolling
Trapping on Club Drive, Migos the Army got Mob ties
We hit the ground, we had to do time
Kick in the door a million times
My nigga Westside he had to do five
The hood were crying when Pistol Pete died
You gotta survive ,the streets will eat you alive
They say we wear make up, but that was a lie
Broke in them houses, no burglar bars
You said that you hard, you niggas are frauds
I went to the pen and them times were hard
I got a bulldog and it's gonna bark
You niggas is bitches, you wear leotards
Bitches they mad cause I broke their heart

You don’t be talking like a lame bitch
You follow the rules but keep it cool
Cause they don’t
They don’t even know that I know you’re feeling me and you walk around like you don’t know
They don’t even know that you been down since a nigga trappin' in the bandos
They don’t even know that we made it
She helped me run up the big cases
I get on my knees and I’m prayin, ask God for this lady
They don’t know nothing about me, know nothing about you
Keep it that way, cool, they don’t know
If I go way back we’ve been fuckin with each other since high school
They don’t even know that she keep a 44
In the Birkin bag might go boom
Just telling you something about her
Cause you may know nothing about her
They don’t know Offset
They don’t even have a clue
They don’t know
When a nigga was stuck fucked up
In the county couldn't move
Every move
Every bitch left me but you
She was there
Young Offset is feelin’ you
Your head game is critical
I’m touching your body, I’m giving a physical
These bitches they hatin’, they envy you
If a nigga get pulled over she gon hold the work
It should be a crime how she hold a nigga down
Cut the other hoes off cause she said her feelings hurt
Up and down’s in relationship but we gon make it work
If I ain’t tell her you ain’t tell her, who they talkin bout then? 
I swear they don’t know how much time we’ve spent 
We started off talkin in French 
Blowin OG in the wind
The first one to show her a chicken
So much loyalty, so much loyalty
They don't know I bought the Benz
Chanel bag, put red on the bottom your shoes
They don’t know
And you say you want a hair salon
So I paid for her tuition, I had her schooled
They don’t, they don’t know
They don’t, they don’t know
Cause they don’t knowZaytoven
Aye, Migos

Quavo
Case closed, we can stop the duckin'
Went and did the show out there in Georgia Southern
Had a couple grams on us, large amounts of cash
Couple straps, they wasn't even dirty
We was super late, but they said be early
The other van had Rich and Murk in
Got to the show, 12 deeper than 30
That's when I knew that somebody was workin'
We the only niggas in the back
I had to hand big 12 my fuckin' strap
What I'ma do with my pack?
Damn, I put that shit right in my bag
12 lookin' at us, mad
Cause we thuggin' and our pants sag
While we're pipin' the stage up, doin' the dab dance
12 searchin' the van, damn
They locked up my driver, damn
Soon as we thanked our fans
We walked off the staged
Then walked through the locker room, they was cuffin' our hands
Hold up, ain't no talkin', no discussion
They threw us in the paddy van 
Shit, we all said, "Fuck it"
Whatever happen's God's plans
I bet you thought you would never see 
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be 
And she told you you can't have no company

Offset!
I had to sit down once again in the pen
Denyin' my bond once again and again
We kept it solid, don't fold and don't bend
Had to beat a nigga tryna steal up out my Benz
My diamonds be kickin' like Ryu and Ken
If I had the chance I would jump the fence
Sat on my box, read a book while I vent
Didn't do a show, but I still got my percent 
Felt like I lost it, but I got it back
She archin' her back in the back of my hatch
I swear to the Lord that I'm not goin' back
Back on the road, 80 thou', we need that
Takeoff gave a hunnit, told me to relax
Sleepin' one eye open, Silver without a patch 
They set us up knowin' we stay with them straps
You not a boss cause it's somethin' you lack
Minor setback for a major comeback
Smokin' on gas, breathin' like Toni Brax
Back to the bando and back to the trap
Face in my Backwood, I'm not tryna match
Got on my knees and asked God to help me
Actin' like I don't know you like I got amnesia
Portraits in my mansion of Mona Lisa
My partners beggin' me just like they Felicia
I bet you thought you would never see 
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be 
And she told you you can't have no company

Muddy trouble on the way to Georgia Southern
Poured me a four and went out of it
Tried to hit a nigga in the head with so many charges
Should've caught a concussion
When I got to the show I woke up, didn't know nothin'
All I seen was police, sheriff, and drug enforcers
Took that, zipped up my hoodie then I got the TEC
And I asked for the Ozium cause it was musty 
But it's too late for all that cause they lookin'
Now it's 'bout time to walk into the buildin'
My gat's in my britches, I keep smellin' cookies
No this ain't a wrap, but I smell what they cookin'
When I was on stage, I didn't have a feelin'
That they was behind me plottin', tryna get me
If I knew then what a nigga had seen
Promise we would not be in this predicament
Had a zip in my net when I got jammed
Went to the toilet, threw and flushed it down
Lookin' cause it wasn't no cameras around
Autistic when they come to question on sound
Not talkin' so whatever you know, you found
But you ain't find shit, nigga, I'm not a clown
Searchin' so hard, left some drank in the ground
Fuck all that shit, my nigga's out the slam
Nah forreal, Takeoff!
I bet you thought you would never see 
Migo gang back again, it's the three
You better go hide where your momma be 
And she told you you can't have no company

Broke niggas still saying "turn it up!"
All my young rich niggas screaming out "pipe it up!"

He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it
I'm goin' through it, man this shit so crazy
'07, lost my brother, 15 years in them cages
Now my grandma rest in peace, that was my first lady
Thousand dollar specs on my face to block the haters
Goin' through it right now but still chasin' the paper
My bitch fucked the whole team, I never should have saved her
And now I'm goin' crazy, cause I'm just goin' through it
I still walk around with Rugers cause I like to shoot 'em
I thought I loved that bitch to the mothafuckin' core
I bought her Jimmy Choos, I bought her Juicy Couture
I treated her like a queen, but she was the neighborhood whore
And now she tryna ride with me cause now I'm on tour
Money, money, money, money got me in a Porsche
Money, money, money, money got my fingers sore
I'm rollin' up a 3-5 blunt look like a core
Feds watchin' me, still servin' J's, I'm paranoid
I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it
I'm goin' through it, my niggas in the slammer
I had to go to Wal-Mart and collect some Arm & Hammer
And go hard in the kitchen, finessin' nothing but tickets
Do numbers water whippin', Young Quavo, yeah I did it
My bitch, she smashed the whole team, damn that ho too friendly
So you know when I sign that deal, got to know I ain't buyin' that ho no Bentley
Ain't seen him in two years, now he wanna come around, gotta know somethin' fishy
And I told my momma if somethin' happen to me, she can have my riches
Young Quavo, ain't leavin' my wealth to none of these bitches
Cause once you dead and gone, she'll have another nigga in your kitchen
Water whippin', show her how you did it
If I get her the Bentley, she'll have another nigga in that Bentley
I'm goin' through it, my nigga ain't even loyal
He snitchin' on the kid, I heard it from my lawyer
I'm goin' through it, my bitch ain't even my bitch
She let the whole team hit, this bitch ain't worth shit
I'm goin' through it, my brother in the cage
My grandma in the grave, the Lord told me be patient
I'm goin' through it, I gotta get this money
I'ma always ride in foreign, the codeine what I'm pourin'
I'm goin' through it
I've been goin' through it, shit been crazy
2000, lost my cousin, cried like a baby
My ancestors been goin' through it, back then in slavery
Now the time faster, I am the master
Could've been me back then, nigga woulda been like "Fuck your master"
My name Takeoff, I am NASA
Every move I make, is spectacular
Northside is my nation, and I'm an ambassador
I pray to the man above, palm to palm
Remember back in '07, almost lost my mom
That woulda hurt my heart, prolly wouldn't have no heart
Prolly would've been stopped right then, prolly wouldn't been no start
Back to kickin' them doors, back to juugin' them cars
But I pray to God, cause he healed my mom
If you talkin' 'bout that bread, then I want every crumb
Runnin' to the money like I'm in a marathon
Foreign bitch, pop a zan like she pop a gun
Smokin' on that kush, it smell just like an underarm
And the check say it wanna get married to my thumb
Goin' through it like a nigga locked up with no bond
I'm goin' through it
2000, lost my cousin RiRi, rest in peace
'07 lost my big bruh to the feds
Free Player Made
Just lost my grandmomma
Rest in peace Sally Smith, I love you
Done took so many losses, it's only right that we winIt ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Now shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
Shake that ass for me
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
It ain't nun for her to bust it wide open
Wet just like an ocean, she gon' let me slide on it
Forgiato tires, I'mma let you ride on it
Tambourine with that ass, she gon' shake that ass on me
Feel like Juvenile, baby, back that ass on me
Pocket full of cheese, yeah, sloppy macaroni
I fucked her on a Tuesday, shout out Makonnen
Performin' on stage, no safety on the pistol
Lil' mama whispering niggas plottin' in the V.I.P
Pulled out, I gave her a hunnid just to tip her
Gotta know she real bad, I leave the club, I miss her
Bounce that ass ho, boing boing, pogo
Throw the profit on lil mama, cuz she make me more
She a trap girl she like blue strip hundos
She no fuckin' with if you broke oh no, no, no, no
Bounce that ass like a trampoline
Throw the money in the air like it got wings
Work, twerk, go berzerk in your vert
Skurt, skurt, pop it nasty in that mini skirt
Mr. Perfect, she perfect, I call her Mrs. Perfect
My neck lookin' like Mr. T, my hands is lookin' like James Worthy
Pop it, pop it, I gon' throw out the guala
Don't make it rain I make it thunder
I'm slappin' ass like E. Honda
My diamonds look like Willy Wonka
She got that body from her momma
She strippin and fuckin' the owner
She poppin', I'm throwin' some commas
She droppin' it just like it's hydraulicsReal street nigga

This right here for the real street niggas Lyrics from Snippet
They don't want the time 
Put my main thang on Birkin snakes with komodo 
Shopping spree in Spain, know my name, walk through coco 
Range Rover 4 door 
The chain VV rose gold 
A lotta things you don't know 
Reminiscing when I bought that Patek with the snow cone
She blow me kisses through the phone 
Right before I go home 
We run to the checks
You preform through your sex
For the charm on your chest 
From the harm I protect 
I know all these thotties tryna plot, me tryna catch 
My doors suicide and we hop out it any day
I gave you respect but know it come with the success
Baby if we fall apart don't settle for less Migo Gang
All my niggas got choppers, man we some killas
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman bitch all my niggas is some shooters  
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
All my bitches got that brain like a calc computer 
Call of Duty, Migo Gang, you know we some shooters 
Call the plug for that gas, tell him he need to refuel us 
And I'm callin up my jeweler, put more ice up in my Muller 
Loud come from Amsterdam, and that white come from Cuba 
Don't want to be him, so conceited, you can ask your bitch who's cuter 
I stay draped up in them True Religions like I am a Buddha 
I got illegal immigrants, won't hesitate to shoot ya 
On the block early, real loud, like I was a rooster 
34’s on my chevy, man I think I need a booster 
I'll finesse you out your pack, I'll Reggie Bush you, I will juke you 
Bando trapper got bazooka, M-16, laser beam
Hollow steam, Listerene, Kush make me look Chinese
Free my nigga Westside, shout out to my nigga Offset 
 What's up to my nigga Quavo?   What's up to my nigga Willie Mac? 
Shouts out to JJ  Whats up? Y'all stupid
Red blood diamonds in my neck, look like cupid 
Foreign car, foreign broad, designer gear
Foreign kush rolled in my cigar I'm a boss bitch
I do just what the fuck I want  Nigga what you want 
I got kush pack under arm  in my convertible foreign 
Make it rain, thunderstorm  Yellow diamonds in my arms 
Sip that dirty sprite all night and I won't wake up till the morning 
Ain't no one hitman bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman bitch all my niggas is some shooters  
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters 
Ain't no one hitman, bitch all my niggas is some shooters My bitch got mad cause my fucking phone kept ringing
That bitch didn't say nothin' when them mockingbirds was singing
Bitch I'm gettin' money

So bitch stop asking

Quavo, when you gon come talk to me
I'm cooking and rapping and chickin it crazy

Goddamn, boutta make young nigga go ham
Pull up pass 100 to the fam
No Shaq but a nigga got slammed
She calling my momma, she tell her I'm selling
I think that she pregnant, I hope that she ain't
I'm smokin' all day, this bitch in my face
When a nigga go to sleep I don't even feel safe
Man I swear this bitch so cray
She cray, she talkin' bout having my babies

Cookin' and flippin' and whippin'
She callin' my phone the moment you trippin'
I'm in the middle of the kitchen ______________________ I drop in the trenches
She naggin' she flipping she's tellin' my momma
Tellin' me __________________ 
But them chicken they bought you, them Jimmy Choos now you all around taking Instagram pictures
I know that the Feds they watchin, like Nikki Buns up in Harlem
Meet the plug with the bat, ________  the money I pull out the carbon
Give it up, fuck nigga, it's a robbery
Got some niggas in the hood that are robbin' for me
Migos we the new Outkast and Bone Thugs-n-HarmonyHuh? He saying what? He said that for real? Ha Ha. Oh yeah, he said that too? Damn
These niggas talk more than bitches 
These niggas talk more than bitches
They tryna clock a nigga dollars
They tryna see if you a baller
Check the tag on your collar
Instead of hating on the next man
You need to try to be the best man
I think you got it from your girlfriend
Talking about bitches contagious man
You talking about Keisha
Really you acting like Keisha
You don't run it up you a runner
You grown but you live with your momma
All of y'all niggas be talking
And can't even pull out a hundred
All of y'all niggas jabroni
They phony they can't even keep it a hundred
My niggas came from nothing
They go to the bando and get them a bundle
Talking ass nigga you pussy
When I was 16 I trap out a onion
We put our stripes in the hood
Migos on the north, you know that we run it
These niggas talk more than Oprah
They telling the feds who done it
These niggas talk more than bitches
Go pissy fits niggas be bitching
You singing to 12, you be snitching
Dope on your nose niggas calling you Whitney 
Quit the watching nigga pockets
Watching to see what he pull out his wallet
Look like you plotting my nigga
That's how you get hit with that pocket rocket
My niggas Aretha we got respect
Your niggas talk sweet on the internet
I know that you really getting finger fucked
But my nigga we not 'gone speak on that
Your CEO gay, need to see 'bout that
My neck got more gold than a treasure chest
You know that I'm having this manifest
I'm my brother's keeper no Malcolm X
These niggas talk more than these bitches
Wear panties and leggings
I'm laughing and giggling
These niggas they shopping at Tiffany's
In the city they Victoria's Secreting
Your money short like a Pilgrim
Niggas talk like Wendy Williams
Rest in peace to the late Robin Williams

Now these bitches go crazy over me they want a picture
I'm tired of these goofy ass nigga not taking no selfie nigga
Where the fuck did you go when the young nigga needed some help my nigga
Kicking doors was the only way to go
You got a devil inside you
Get the gold that's the goal
They treated me like I was hoe
ATF in my dope
Is Mr. Offset at home?
Momma told the nigga no
We really live by the code
Heavy choppers on the road
After the show I'm grippin' my 40
We made it Grandma told me
I really know that I was chosen
My life was a roller-coaster
Look at my wrist and it's frozen
Look at my neck and it's golden

Had to draw down on a fuck nigga the other day cause he thought I was easy
50 gold bottles of the ace of spades looking like they bringing me a deck of cards
God gave me a second chance so young nigga gotta go super hard
Beat the pot like Zab Judah
Mansion party kick it in Bermuda

Pull up and
They call a young nigga mardy
I like to welcome you all, welcome you all to the migo party

The gangster being in me so I keep a semi

You know what I'm saying living luxury nigga
I bought a Bentley Mulsanne
And I sat it on forgis
Woke up in the morning
Look to my left damn dat bitch gorgeous
Back then when I couldn't wear them Louboutins
I used to wear Jordans
The M-15 I'm grippin', my mansion, Mona Lisa portrait
If you drank too much phizzurp, won't wake up till the morning
Old bricks they rep them blocks I'm talkin' Alonzo Mourning
I might touchdown on a pussy nigga when I'm perfomin'
A show in Paris, Amsterdam, and Belgium they think we was tourin'
Don't need no pistol or no gat when I'm in the booth recordin'
I'm Slick Rick in my streets, I'm tellin' the children them stories
Used to ride Honda Accord now 911 my Porsche
QC the label we the new Death Row my niggas come join
Before that rollie was that Jacobs
Cause I couldn't afford it

Niggas lie in their stories
Kim Kardashian bitches beautiful
Diamonds is african
Shippin' and dabbin'
Look like a mannequin
Bitches panicking

Club packed to capacity
I'm the  your majesty
I'm sippin' lean like a daiquiri
Got the 40 I'm packing it
Your bitch is an animal
Eat the dick like a carnivore
And I pull up Aventador

You got money gotta feed the poor
They watching the Migos it's season four
I cannot believe that got me a Jeep and a Porsche
Your bitch in the kitchen she sucking my dick and she tellin' me her knees are sore
I was 15 I jumped out the Porsche
23 got a mansion golf course
Bugatti's, Ferrari smoking exotic while I'm ridin'
I'm molly exotic
My young niggas catchin' bodies
 society when you live in poverty
I didn't had no priority
Now I got me a property
I'm just making it obvious
You hated me previous
You lovin' the millions
My bitch ain't a citizen Brazilian an immigrant
I love both of my children cause I know god sent them
Kill a nigga planting...Cut the top of the Lamborghini, coolin'
Got to juug overseas I'm bout to pursue it
Got your bitch and her friend makin' movies

Black belts wrapped around my money like I know karate
Look-looking at money everyday like I can't see nobody
And I'm cuttin' that dip with white like my name was Rowdy
You can come and get the chickens if you want to
Cause you know we got them birds flyin' on the roof

 Lyrics from Snippet
...
Strike up the choppa, we best friends
We got the name from the Mexicans
Strike on the dice and then bet again 
I give her pipe cause' she wet again 
Ain't no one on one, we jumping in
If I'm with the tommy gun, I'm setting a trend 
All of my niggas get checks in 
None of my niggas is yes men 
Go to Miami for jet-skiing
Traffic on traffic, keep pulling in 
She cut the purp with her best friend
Send a location, she drop a pin 
Twenty-five K for a pocket book 
She like to suck on it, Dracula 
Slap on that ass, smack-able 
Pull out the trap and I'm tactical 
With the spatula 
We get dogs imported from Africa 
Oh, you short on that, Dawg? Then we whacking em' 
Vacuum seal when we wrapping it, package it 
When it's smoke, it get dirty, kidnapping em' 
I can turn a hundred to a 'mill in a week 
Shooter got a kill on a  week 
White stone sit on her thumb like it's bleach 
I put on chrome and they bon appétit 
Take her back home, she done sucked me to sleep 
Cuddle with her, go and kiss on the cheek 
Kick up my feet, don't ever bring your  to the 
...Water, Water, Water
And i can't keep my head out of the stick
I think i'm addicted 
'Till the water splash 
Water
Connect it like WIFI nigga place your order 
Karate choppin at birthday get a slaughter
My plug is Diego he came on a boat 
Choppin and capping i just made my clothes
I got the rappin and trappin yo
Water be splashingYeah
Oh shit man, who that is?
Shout out Migos, shout out Zaytoven one time
That Migos, Drake on Versace?
Versace, Versace, Medusa head on me like I'm 'Luminati
This is a gated community, please get the fuck off the property
Rap must be changing ‘cause I'm at the top and ain't no one on top of me
Niggas be wanting a verse for a verse, but man that's not a swap to me
Drowning in compliments, pool in the backyard that look like Metropolis
I think I'm selling a million first week, man I guess I'm a optimist
Born in Toronto but sometimes I feel like Atlanta adopted us
What the fuck is you talking 'bout? Saw this shit coming like I had binoculars
Boy, Versace, Versace, we stay at the mansion when we in Miami
The pillows' Versace, the sheets are Versace, I just won a Grammy
I've been so quiet, I got the world like, "What the fuck is he plannin'?"
Just make sure that you got a backup plan ‘cause that shit might come in handy
Started a label, the album is coming, September, just wait on it
This year I'm eating your food and my table got so many plates on it
Hundred inch TV at my house, I sit back like, "Damn, I look great on it"
I do not fuck with your new shit, my nigga, don't ask for my take on it
Speaking in lingo, man this for my nigga that trap out the bando
This for my niggas that call up Fernando to move a piano
Fuck all your feelings ‘cause business is business, it's strictly financial
I'm always the first one to get it, man that's how you lead by example
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Word to New York, ‘cause the Dyckman and Heights girls are calling me "Papi"
I'm all on the low, take a famous girl out where there's no paparazzi
I'm tryna give Halle Berry a baby and no one can stop me
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace Versace, Versace Versace
Versace, Versace, I brought that shit back, all these niggas they copy
Medusa head on me, I'm at the hotel, Versace Palazzo
I rented the yacht for a week, but I bought the convertible Lambo
Six mill for the mansion, I see haters coming, I need some more ammo
These niggas gay, that's Elmo, so much green I turned camo
Some Hoover niggas on flannels, light, light you up, no candle
Grip on that handle, Yosemite Sam ya, that bitch bang like a banjo
Told my arms dealer no need for a box, I don't read the instructions, I throw out the manual 
Versace, Versace, my brother King Trell, he in a Ferrari
I don't look the same, my camera the same, I made too much money 
Paul Pierce is my neighbor, I told him he shoulda went to the Clippers
I got some crazy ideas for Versace, get them and tell 'em my number
Versace, auggh Picasso, Basquiat, I'm cocky
23, fifteen mill, I'm just getting started
Pop water my water, I walk around on my wallet
I don't fuck with Saddam but, that's gold all in my toilet
Statues of Horus, Anubis is polished
I don't gotta rap about, coke for you to enjoy it
I'm 'bout to join the money team, just holla to Floyd about it
Versace, Versace, I'm taking my money to the Cayman Islands  Versace
Versace, Versace, it's killers, real niggas that's all in my posse 
I'm getting so rich that they making up rumors that I'm 'Luminati 
Just me and my niggas, we killing these bitches, go body for body 
These suckers be hating, they praying to God I don't cop a Bugatti
Hold up, drop the top on the 'Rari
Pull in the club and I'm stopping the party
Hold up, got bitches on bitches, they popping on Mollys
I'm probably at Follies with PeeWee and Tip, questing with Lou
I did everything that I said I would do
I really won't tell you I'm better than you
But we are not on the same level as you
‘Cause the G55 got a hell of a view
Regular niggas make regular moves
With ya regular bitch and ya regular crew
And you nigga still smoking on regular too, like "Word!?"
What a shame, my nigga
Louboutin blood like Game, my nigga
Get left tryna aim, my nigga
Like Saddam Hussein, my nigga
I'm whipping this brand new machine, hundred bands in my jeans
Call yo bitch Barry Sanders, she done ran through the team
I got hoes out the D, they playing on the team
Do anything for me, I mix that Xan' with the lean
Hold up, let me get it back
Versace, Versace, I'm getting this money, I'm stacking my broccoli 
I'm running my city, you might gotta pay me you land on my property 
I bought the boardwalk and I parked on the ave, shit my life like Monopoly
You caught a new case and you got outta jail but you look like a cop to me
Get out of jail free card?Spin off in the coupe typhoon 
I got ass, baboon
Wrappin that dope cacoon

You don't sip that lean by the pint
You a peon, you don't got rank

Quavo Stuntin, name hold weight
In the kitchen and I make a earthquake
When you walk around, pocket full of cake
Gotta keep your grass low, full of snakes
Chevrolet SS on skates

She love to pop them 
Got a rocket on my hip, Yao Ming

You playin', ain't 'bout no bottle
Sip codeine out the baby bottle
Grape Maserati look like a

You can still rock an Artful Dodger
Real G, blowin' up, Pearl Harbor
Cut the work like a nigga was a barber
In the kitchen with them toddlers
In the hood with them robbers
In the bando with them choppers
I'ma G like the Green Bay Packers
Young Takeoff, call me NASA
Fuck with my money
That chopper gon' stretch you out like cardiovascular
You can't even flip no brick
You can't even flip no nick
You never had purple codeine
Your Sprite always look clean
Sip lean, double cupped with the ice
Drop 85 hundred for the ice
When a nigga talk crazy, hang his ass

Wish a nigga would try to steal my ice
88 birds in the trunk, Jerry Rice
You can't do that real nigga shit

She say I'm in South Africa I make a movie 
White McLaren let the wings up and show the Uzi...I see about time I need to cut my grass real real real low

Hit em' up nigga, that boy need some milk 
Cutting the corners, the Lambo on tip

My bitch, she bad and stiff 
Keep counting, can't clock out the shift 
The money too real 
Young nigga toe tapping that field

Don't lose your life for my chain, nigga 
Fuck it, gon' line that shit up 
Go buy the wide body Bentley, no range 
Go get a thot and don't fuck, give me brain 
Go get a shotty, go shoot out his brain 
She eat the molly to fuck on the gang 
Kidnap the pilot then fuck on the plane 
We gon' buy the shit, we never lease it 
Fuck on your hoe and she keep it a secret 
Hit her one time, broke your heart all to pieces 
Lamb truck, sound like it's wheezing 
Water my neck, go to the beaches 
Father, bless me and watch out for demons 
Pull up, matte black Lamborghini 
Pity you fools like I'm Mr. T
He said that he rich, that's a mystery
Bought her a Birkin,  history 
Fuck her, she suck, she won't kiss the G 
This a new frog and it's leaping, hey 
Sit on my log and she leaking, ye
She mine, she not your bitch today 
Get in the bando and whip the ye
New deals come with new mills, come with new bills unless you gon' cash it out 
Smash or not,  I crash or not
Fuck around and see the car dash, I'm out
I keep a mag cause' I shoot on a spy 
Try and do me bad, we ain't gon' let that shit fly
...
 stripper bowl, we up on the porch
Switch on a bitch, aiming down on a 
Red diamonds shit,  double jointed 
I'm thanking God for knowing 
Heard he working this morning 
These niggas sleep on the gang, nigga
We bout to wake em' back up
Don't lose your life for my chain, nigga 
Fuck it, gon' line that shit up 
Go buy the wide body Bentley, no range 
Go get a thot and don't fuck, give me brain 
Go get a shotty, go shoot out his brain 
She eat the molly to fuck on the gang 
Kidnap the pilot then fuck on the plane 
We gon' buy the shit, we never lease it 
Fuck on your hoe and she keep it a secret 
Hit her one time, broke your heart all to pieces 
Lamb truck, sound like it's wheezing 
Water my neck, go to the beaches 
...
Richard Mille, two hundred fifty thousand 
 bags, two thousand

Ain't no pretenders, we rip to the block 
Come to the Nawf and get popped

Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Everything cool when they money going in
And everything bad when they money going out
Don’t want the people running in yo house
So the best thing you do is close your mouth
Never never snitch thats what daddy told me
And I never serve a nigga that sleep off in the streets
He told me If I try em then I’m gonna need heat
So I keep a Mac-11 tucked under my seat
I’m a goon gorilla so I call up Willy B
2 cup sippin on something light pink
Diamonds clear like water you can dive off in the sea
Designer I paid for it sauces all on me
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money going in and out like intercourse
Gave my mamma 8 bands just to go to the store

Front my migo the work cause he said he wanna serve
Lil cuz said he wanna be a trapper one day
I said not to do that cause its not the right way
He said big cuz how am I gonna get the cake
I gave him 10 bands told him gone put that shit away
It put a smile on my face, every time i see my cuz he got a smile on his face
Try to take my money know i be strapped up with the wooly
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going in like a plug in the wall
Fuckin with the BMG leave ya hostage like saw
Whatcha need I got the soft and the stupid ass raw
Hit the stupid ass raw end up with the lock jaw
The pack hit ya hard make ya have flashbacks
What you got petroleum you know thats the gas
Hit ya bitch once then I threw her off the glass
You know I had to pass but don’t call me Steve Nash
Lost about a pound to the motherfuckin’ feds
Money coming in we got the long bread
Money coming in cause the money get finessed
Money Going In, Money Going Out
Money Going In, Money Going Out

Money Going In, Money Going OutI'm from Queens, brodie!

Got a big house
Dick lookin' like a mouse
At Americana, buying a Louis V blouse
Shopping at Gucci
At Toku, eating sushi
No one wants your ugly girls' coochie
Up in Queens
We don't fuck with those Manhasset feens
I asked your mom, you all got got tiny peens
Ghosting on Halloween
Don't know what that means
And what the fuck is frosh
I'm so fucking lost
New car, how much that shit cost
By the end of the song, you'll be fucking sauced
Fuck, shit, bitch
Yeah I'm from Manhasset and my daddy's really rich
When I'm around, you be hiding your bitch
Can't tell you shit, 'cause you a snitch
Lacrosse, that shit's gay

We get it, you guys have monay
Call me Big Chungus
The way I eat that foot fungus
Your houses are all fucking humongous
You all have fucking air pods
Your girls, they have dad bods
You think you're all fucking gods

No home button, you don't speak broke
Lacrosse, that shit's a fucking joke
Shots fired!Quavo:
Feelin like John ghotti , bricks in da rari
All my niggas killas, bringing pistols in da party
I'm kickin it with the vato ,  trapping and wrapping the kilo
Kickin it with the migo, countin up the pesos
Sippin on lean I'm losing my mind , The Lord is giving me plenty of signs
Since a young nigga I'm watching my brother
I'm walkin around and now I got the nine
I don't love the pussy , you niggas is rookie , I'm smokin on cookie my pockets on snookie
Pull up in jags and rovers its over I'm ballin like Lamar odom
Takeoff:
Real trap niggas get money ,pick up the phone whenever it's money
Sellin dem bricks they dummy
Wrapping that work like a mummy
The birds, you know that they humming , them hollow tips bust and u runnin
Sellin that coco nocolo , the plug it b costa Nostra
2'Brown:
We the ones dodgin the FBI , we the ones drop in the 4
Mix it with water then heat it up , whip it around with the fork
Mix it around wit the coke , meet me up rite at the store
Top of the line , creme of the crop, hit it and murda she wrote
Got that pistol tucked in my Gucci belt , work with the water like micheal phelps
Give me the doe need nothing else , fuck signin deals ill sign myself

I got my migos comin cross the border, grocery bag full of arm and hammer baking soda
Me n my migos get that work in , have your whole block sowed for you count to 10
Wats up quavo. Wats up takeoff. Wats up offset . Man dis for the projects
Dis for the gangsta s, dis for the hustlas , the costa Nostra dawg they can't touch us
They can't see me , they can't b me , the Feds watch me dawg like ima tv
Cd stay on repeat, creep through with that street sweep , stay round where da gs be

Come fuck on the gang for change, if it ain't no pressure 
Uh, bang bang, I let the stick talk, give a lecture
It was all a vibe 'til niggas start dying, look through the scope, spy 'em 
Your bitch ain't even worth one diamond, with a stick out the top of the cayenne 
Your partner gon' kill you, I buy em 
Kidnapped em', re-tie em'

Snap my finger then crash it

They need my drip, potassium 
Must be on fire, no grabbin' 
Release the clip, don't at me
She can't breathe, she tryna attack me
Fire Hydrant, can't put the fire out 
I got two bad bitches in the bed, I'ma swap the hoes out 
Sip a lil' lean, I pop a lil' bean, but I will not snout

Crack popped the seal so you know it, know it's real 
Mama shed a tear 'cause I profess all my skills 
Big bills at the casa, solid tears 
Shoot you all in your shit, we know how to drill 
The gang we slide, we pull up and peel, peel, peel 
He believe he can fly, fuck it, I send  lear 
Damn, he thought it was hot,  ain't in the coupe in the

Yo, yeah, Dat Way

Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Pick up the phone and call Kanye 
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
Told him put The Huncho on the runway
Uh, yeah, Dat Way
The plug pull up on me anyday
He told me pull up to his mansion alone
And don't come in with all that gun play

Double park, double park, parallel park
Then I pick up that Backwood and spark
So many artist can't even say where
But they picked up the flow, I don't know where to start
Shopping cart when I go pick up my Narcs
So many animals like Noah's Arc
Hop on the chart' and I pop me a Percocet, pour me a fo' befo' it can depart
I land in Cali, my plug pull up on me with pints of the Act
I don't want no Wockhardt
Make your hoe ride along with me
Got unfinished business, got me feeling like Kevin Hart
Back up, that camera pop out when I park
I got that Draco, come out after dark
Niggas gon' act like they 'bout that life, 'til you pull up on them, see that it's not in their heart
The nigga you think be the coolest a groupie, he put on a act like he shooting a movie
Kicked them with fashion, I'm talking my dab and they thought it was Newton, then you must be stupid
Trick that bitch make her trap for me like Lucy
We got the keys to the street, I gotta use it
Pull up in my mansion, the crib is extended
The bitches, my nigga, I'm feeling like Pookie
Dat Way, dab at the runway
Got me running to the M&M's, I'm thinking it's a rat race
Ya main bitch on backpage
I pull up with a 'Yonce Lemonade
Migos performing up at the Barclays
J's test the dope, said it was Parkay

My bitch is bad and boujee
Calabasas, I was trapping in Coogi
Blue cheese drop a 50 in Gucci
Wipe my red bottoms down like I'm Boosie
Dat Way
We could make a movie like a matinee
In the kitchen with the white like mayonnaise
Pull up on the plug like Dat Way
This for the culture, stay with the bird like a vulture
Play with my niggas, put you on a poster

{Quavo outro}
ugh..datway..ugh..datway....hey hey hey yeah...My weed from Jamaica, my money older than Sega
Bust it open, then wait up, tell m, work out, then re-up
My diamonds sparkling, I be like the sargent
Pull up in the Astin Martin, leave in a Burperry carpet
Migo the label, but no no playing with paper
My shirt tiger striped, my shoes aligater
With the plug, never see it
Wip them chickens and pidgens, cokina and midgets, touch it, I flip it
I remembered in school, teacher talkin bout history
I was tryna make history, up in that house in Beverly
I just called my jeweller, tell him bring me my rolly
In that muscle car, 12 pull me over for flexin
I got sweet and sour chicken, lemon, go get me some beef
I got soldiers in the streets, I'm commander and chief
When the Js hit the dope, I bet those nose bleed
I got a plug from Mixico, and one plug that’s chinese
Bad bitch on my team, do whatever I please
Thick thais, brown eyes, she finesse you with eze
Think the jeweller got me sick, a chew, I sneez
Someone get me a key, I'll just rest in peace
Last nigga try to jump, left him deceased
Then we dumped him in the river, body still won't be seen
I’m a cool individual, selling dope, that's my principle
Young like the siminals, baking soda a chemical
I done made it out vakent, had to lie on David
Keep the pistol like Peet, and keep the knife like I'm Jason
I ain't Gigga for nothing, tell m fishing for money
Gotta bumblebee building, me and my crew, that's some hundreds
Took the truck to Bahamas, pick the plug up from London
I be sellin so many fishes, call me Offset Benny Hanna
And the 9 is my ratchet, trappin and stampin on matress
Singing Tony Braxtin, and they all wet like napkins
Biggest bitches, I'm cravin, got that dope, so come taste it
No, my swag is not basic, pull up with a strap, no lacesMillion dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move
When the plug make the call, know that I got the ball
Nigga, can you flip it all, can you make Fendy ball
In the streets, I'm a wizard, call me Quavo John Wall
Sellin rolls, no cornrolls, nigga, I set it off
Gotta have a gass mask cookin in the kitchen, cause I cough
Send that work out to Memfis, so shout out to Dolph
You niggas is fiction, I know you is false
Rick Ross, and the only nigga in the world boss
4 Gs on the Cheavy, ridin old school T talk
When a nigga run up on me, freez him like a free froth
Feelin like a DJ, hit m with the Re Rock
Feelin like a lost nigga, Re Rock on the D Block
Fuckin with the Chi town niggas, out on the old block
Finger fuck the pot, I can make it snow on yo block
Nigga jumbo cookin, that's the reason why the stove hot
See money in my dreams, I had a bankroll not
Million dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move
Offset!
I'm a criminal, I gotta move my operation
You don't got the money on time, nigga, what's your ocupation
Put a muzzle on m, we came up with the location
We say we would never complecate it, never fuckin with the envestagation
Lake m, cause them niggas got condinsation
Livin like Big Meech, got a hundred million in my vaces
I got GD in my vessle, hot like a keddle
I could make a hundred thousand dollars with no efert
Wet niggas with me, wipe m up like Bounty
Imma put the tass on the gas, move it out the county
Active got me drowzey, sippin on this Ak to calm me
I got bricks up in the uhall, and got bricks up in the mountains
I'm askin you to count it, nigga, I don't need to count it
You count it, run off with the pack, like animals
Bricks up in the forin, they callin me a siminal
I know how to move m, Michael Jackson, I'm a smooth criminal
Million dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move
Drinkin on Activis, a hundred K in the pack in the addic
I got the bricks in the cabanit
Work is emaculit, I be trappin and dabbin
On the island, I'm coolin, had to Christian my Louboutins
If there's an intruder in my window, I'm shooting him
Prata, Bermuta, pullin up with them choppers, with the cooling system
Trappin, got half a bag, but don't know what to do with it
Make a milly, make a bitch get loose with it
Sellin out arenas, fuckin up every city, we used to it
Never seen a hundred thousand, cause you niggas new to it
See, that's that life that got us famous, trappin and smokin with them good jamaicans
Black and white Bentley, but I'm not racest
Travlin around the world, to get Benjaman faces
If you ain't talkin about money, then I get agrovated
Get the fuck out my face, if you ant talkin bout Benjaman Franklins
Takeoff takin trips around the nation
Million dollar make a nigga move
200 dollars buy a bad bitch, gotta know she goin move
Pull out the chopper, everybody goin move
Get back, treat you like a cow, nigga, you better move
You better move, you better move???Lyrics from Snippet
...Mad at my ways and I'm back with the K
Put on my  in case it's a K 
Back in your face, get the fuck out the way 
Peek in the scope and I'm sniping your bae 
Dealing, concealing, the block got the play
No thriller, I put the .45 in your face 
I'm tired of niggas, quit playing with me 
You wanna die, then you know before three
Cop a new Rari, ain't copping no plea 
25k on a new choppa, go E 
Perky 230, I'm sweating, I'm geeked 
Double cup lean, got codeine dreams
Walk in this bitch with the bank on me 
I hit a lick and I got it with ease...Ayy, yo, DJ Genius
Ayy, yo, DJ Knight
Let me talk to 'em for a second, let me talk my shit, my nigga
Ayy, yo, Migos, what up, though?
Quavo Stuntin, Offset, Takeoff, man
That's how the fuck we do this shit
We call this shit right here No Label 'cause niggas getting money out here in the streets, they don't need no motherfucking label
So when you ask those questions, "Who they signed to?"
It doesn't fucking matter who they signed to, they getting to the money
You ask us, "Who they run with?"
It doesn't fucking matter who they run with, they getting to the money
Young Migos
This shit time to shine, my nigga
This shit time to go, my nigga
DJ Ray G, you know I got you, my nigga

Hey, hear that roar 
Ever since I got money bitches kumbaya
Hey, kumbaya, kumbaya
Ever since I got money bitches kumbaya
Ayy, got these Louis frames over my cornea 
I go to my old hood in the newest car 
All my old girls screamin' you a star 
Doing digits on the dash, you gon' hear that roar 
You gon' hear that roar , she scream she want more
I fucked her on the floor, that's what we call a score
Ooh, look at my dab , you don't even know the half 
All of my bitches got- , All of my bitches got ass 
This is how I'm feeling, came from water whipping to the top of the building 
This is how I'm feeling, fuck a nigga feelings, fuck a nigga feelings 
All of my engines got roar , Mmy bitches came 'cross the water 
All of my plugs cross the water , and I never, never short her 
She wanna fuck with a rider , I put the dope right inside her 
And she done sold four out of five of 'em 
Hop in the coupe and we ride on 'em, that's for sure though
I don't like taking no photo , I poured her a drink, she say, "No mo"
And I don't like coppers, no Robo , I step out and dab on them, dabo

I go to my old hood in the newest car 
All my old girls screamin' you a star 
Doing digits on the dash, you gon' hear that roar 
Do the digits in the Aston, digits in the Lambo', you can hear the engine roar 
The way I do fashion, think I'm an assassin, they know I'm a star, my dab is up to par 
Scoot up my double cup, sipping on bar
No matter the place they gon' know who we are, pull up in the Aston, the doors are ajar
Smoking cookies, not a rookie, we smoke it out cookie jar 
These niggas a bank card, my nigga, your niggas fraud, didn't tell me that when you niggas sent me large Marge
Remember I was dreaming 'bout kicking it with the stars, now I'm overseas in Bahamas getting a massage
Look out for the snakes, so I dressed up in camouflage  All these foreign cars cannot fit in my garage 
I came a long way from patience and waiting around with a .30, not swiping a card
Treat this shit like basketball but no charge, you wanna go home? then you better go hard
I cannot see myself going broke 'cause I cannot leave my family out here to starve
I get the money, more green than the forest , when I sweat kush, the lean come out my pores
No maid, I got ten bitches gon' do the charge
Tell Benjamin, mi casa, su casa, my house is yours

Alerg ca la Exatlon 🏃
Dupa bani sunt un alt om 💸
Clasa 1 in avion ✈️
Tu esti off si eu sunt on 🔛
Asculta, si taci din gura
Taci din gura, stau in natura
Sunt prea verde, ma ia in gura
Ma ia in gura, zici ca-s pilula
Cand stau in brigada
Ma suna minim o coarda
Nu vorbesti despre bani
Reaseaza-te la coada
Coarda ta nu te mai vede
Am lasat-o acuma oarba
Doar ****  si banii vrea acum ca sa le vada
Poarta-te frumos sa nu pici acum pe jos
Ce scarbos! Te rog, hai! Nu fii prost!
Nu imi esti tovaras doar ca sunt eu prietenos
De la banii astia stiu ca ai prins si tu miros
Exatlon..
Maraton..
Nu alerg is mototol..
Am un garaj..
Cu 3 masini..
6 stau afara c***e ca n-am unde sa le tin
Exo vara nu-i ca iarna
Stau pe plaja in Havana
Un sezlong rulez tigara
Tarfa asta suge pu-pu-
In portofel am 4-5 prieteni morti
Nu conteaza ca-s dubluri
P-aia micii nu-i socoti
Am stil! Nu-s designer!
Prind un drop de la Supreme
Seara de seara ma delectez cu ceva fin..
Intorc camera pe dos ca un Tsunami
Sunt pe treaba..
Frate stii c-o dau pe fata!
La gat imi port numa' gheata
Bani gheata, facem filme
Sunt actor american
Dau o fuga a milli run
Fac multi bani, o grija n-am!
 Fara febra bag sirop!
 Cum fac banii nu ma joc!
Tot ce facem iese brio!
Tu salam de Campofrio!
Fac milioanele sa sara
Bani din conturi sa dispara
Cu White Migos mare trio
Sosu nostru este bio
Flex, flex, flex, limbile de la Rolex
Niciodata nu ratez, nu incetez sa ma flexezVersace

What's in the racks, don't bleach it 
I bought the sunroof in the Bentley 
She wanna fuck on my, she  and extended it
Boy, what you doing, the racks is too skinny
I ain't been sipping on drank in a minute
I still  purses to get to the ceiling
Bought a new  to feel the experience
Hugging the curb, it's deadly and serious
Way that we slide, go fast and the furious 
We gotta press to move with the mask, feds wanna get curious 
Thinking 'bout struggling, ain't going near it
You go play choppas, ain't hearing it 
I can see my mama tearin' up
That's my motivation, I'm switching and gearing it 
I'm a veteran with experience
No I can't fuck with you niggas, it's weird 
Yeah, yeah, I'm going , put the riches in the  
I'm in the streets, going on the tune 
 it, young nigga, he going to the moon
She wanna fuck, but she cap back and rude 
She like run and get the  that's a 
Dropping my top and I flex out the coupe 
I like to go spend a bag with your boo
Run a 'lil package, we going cocoon
Flock got the drop, we going 
No chopping, go , yessir, we tattoo 'em
Give 'em two of my beaters, we eat at 
This a 2 seater, two  what we doing
Trapping and rapping, the shit I influenced
Get your 'lil hustle up, nigga, endurance 
Play with that Gina, I'm not Martin Lawrence 
Packs on the plaque, 33, Patrick Ewing 
Zaza the pack, get the brick and we growing
Go coast to coast on the boat, through the  
Hit the brick and kilo once a  
See the opp and I'm plotting, I'm scoring 
Purple potion, slow motion,  
Whipping convertible, kick down the door, I was robbing the burglar
30 round clip on the hip of a murderer 
Wear my vest on my chest so I'm curving her 
Put a hole in your head, call the coroner 
I wear karats on top of a  
I can't fuck the thot, flew in the formal 
When we go gang, it's too late to come join us 
Make a M in a  up  
Bought a , she charging 
500k on a yacht, bought a plain Patek, it came with the dots 
I had to pull out the K on the spot 
I seen it all on his face, tryna plot
Ain't run from no nigga, I run from the cops 
I had to pull out the Draco and mop 
Pistol got killed, pop a pill for my heart
Kill or be killed in the field, play it smart Young niggas on the block they ain't give a shit

You say young niggas ain't got no money you think that's harming us?
Make you believe in Santa Claus, Santa's sack is on us
I know that they hate that I came off a bag
I don't have to boast or brag just look at the cash
Nigga don't make me mad
That's why I had to put extensions in all of my mags
All of my life young nigga would get into something
Young nigga came up off of nothing
Now I got to learn the different lingo taking private jets across the country
You niggas still waiting on your momma
Somebody shine the lights upon them
You know that you need it, you want it

Really, I think that we earned it
And the picture we burnt it
All of my life I wanted this shit, put my name on the jersey
Young niggas on the block they ain't give a shit

Young nigga trapping bags
On the block with Cam running from the fucking tag
Robbing the goon old man
Hop in the jag, young nigga hit the dash
One thing about the migo line nigga know we living fast
Whole lot of cash, OG cash bag in the Jag ain't gotta dash
Walk in the mall, nigga don't check the price tag just throw it in the bag
Ain't tryna  the ticket don't come at all if you ain't got the cash
Make a play get the cash right back so fast like flash
Fuck it up and take it rodeo yo' ass

Money bags whole slab!

And I usually don't leave until that thing end
But in the meantime and inbetween times
She workin' that other one and I'ma work mine
Party don't start until we walk up in the building 
All my old hoes starin' at me, caught in they feelings
Pullin' up the McLaren, they start to pull up they cameras
I beat it up in my condo, I'm spankin' her like a parent
Niggas hatin' the club 'cause I'm in the 'Rarri smashin'
Hit the  by the dub, rich nigga with a milli'
I'm all the above, I got love for my fans so I give 'em a hug
Doin' shows in Thailand so I'm thankin' the Lord
Time changed, lookin' at the Rollie, no Michael Kors
We not rewindin', we keep it movin', gotta go forward 
The party not startin' 'til the Migos walk in 
I seek God for forgiveness 'cause
The party don't start 'til we walk in 
An' I usually don't leave until that thing end 
But in the meantime and inbetween times
She workin' that other one and I'ma work mine 
Said the party don't start 'til we walk in, 'til we walk in 
If you feelin' like money , if you lookin' like money
Throw your motherfuckin' hands in the-
Said the party don't start, not 'til we walk in
And I usually don't leave until that thing end
But in the meantime and inbetween times
She workin' that other one and I'ma work mine

Money above the rim, Burberry Timbs
Bands jumpin' out the gym, no Shawn Kemp
Back then, she ain't want me, now I got her salty
Cause she seen Young Quavo flexed up in a Aston Martin
Hurricane wrist, watch Young Quavo break the pot
In the VIP shootin' nothin' but money jump shots
Can't nobody touch me 'cause my goons like secret service
Pull up, pop the trunk, it's a flock of birdies
Smokin' on purp, James Worthy
Sippin' on pink like Kirby
I already know she thirsty
So I put her in the kitchen dancing dirty
I already know he a coward, I already know he sour
He a snake in the grass, so I had to cut him off
I call that Georgia Power
We don't even kick it like that, dawg
Quick to spray a nigga like Lysol
Don't get mad at me 'cause I smashed your bitch
Then I passed her like Chris Paul
Hell nah, I don't need no label

Face card so good in the hood
I could go kick shit with Blocc Gang in Decatur

Black and grey monster truck, David Robinson

And I keep that 9 on me, Tony Parker
And my nigga gon' shoot, James Harden

Our chappal game is A1, our bars do not lack
The necessities and all the extra cheese that make us squeal
I just played with Iboh we played some Hot Wheels
This popsicle is tanda I just got some chills
We’re back and we’re chillin while watching Little Bill
Magnetic Motoos yeah we are up next
I’m mixing up the beat like my first name is Chex
They see poti all around me
In my pants, I just peepee’d
I feel like I’m an admi
You bachaz bears just like gummi
This beat is too fast, it can’t handle me
All the time I slurp on smoothies
I cry all the time like babies
My bars made the vision go dark, you  can’t see me
Last second and I can’t find my naikers
Roti so fresh just got it from the baker
We don’t smoke on broccoli, we slurp on nihari
It’s time to eat, but we ain’t eating biryani
I’m not Lil Pump but I dab like ooouuu
My aboo so fresh his name is like Jimmy Choo’s
Yeah I’m fasting and I’m hungry
But it’s not for khana it is not for money
It is for the gummi stacks of lotas ober dere
I wish for my popo to be clean, not to be ammer
I also hope for some pani
But I already have it, have you seen my tummy?
Saadistan Cycle in full: come on just wait
I still need more, I feel empty in my peht
I need to ask my bachas in Pakistan to unlock the gate
So I can go up and rule my country, Saadi the Great
I’m just a desi boi living in Saadistan
Which the greatest country eber, ask your khandaan

...Lyrics from Snippet
Feed the block and I walk with the carbon 
This a Glock with a switch, make 'em  
Shoot my shot, I'ma hit my target 
In a space coupe, Marvin the Martian 
Came from the bottom, we got out the mud 
F&N, the green tip hold a dub 
Learned how to shoot before I got a buzz 
Facing life when I'm shooting, the judge 
Pay the price, hit his head and it's blood 
Drop on a opp, put a thot on the opp
We 'gon catch 'em, he walk out the club 
Smoke the , professional stepper
Don't do the drive-by, we walk ...Lyrics from Snippet
...back to the trap on the wireless 
Slatt
Locking the  on me
Never water the baking soda, then I wait 'till it's harder
I popped out the crib with your 'lil bitty daughter
...Jp is so fucking fat oh my god 
That nigga fr need to go on a diet 
Why this nigga weigh like 500 pounds 
Jesus fucking christ why is this nigga so fat Lyrics from Snippet
I'ma dress it up, clean it, put some shoes on it 
I'ma tote that tool and she my opponent 
In the trap, don't you touch it, it got coke on it 
And that Richard Mille water, you can float on it 
And that money,  I don't run from it 
And if you do not  it, we put drums on it 
And if a nigga  it, he owe something 
I'm gon' take them keys and then I stomp on it 
I'ma get ...It's who birthday? Yours 
Feels like you're driving Rolls Royce 
Can we keep peace indoors? 
'Cause I bought the most expensive piece up out the store
It's the birthday bae, it's the birthday 
We gon' pop this party off and you gon' have to ball 
And we gon' chase the stars
It's who birthday? Yours 
Feels like you're driving Rolls Royce 
And you gon have to ball
Hashtag mood with the flames in the comments
Tonight's a vibe and we livin' rare moments
Do that Bobby Brown 
Watch how we get down 
Icin' on my watches 
Livin' life on Yachties 
Shirt made Versace 
She got nice bodies 
Had to take her shopping 
'Cause I got nice wallets 
Life of the party , price of the party 
Take 'em to the future , make 'em feel like Marty 
Poppin' champagne bottles , we just got it started 
Treat you like a trophy , that's a Vince Lombardi 
It's who birthday? Yours 
Feels like you're driving Rolls Royce 
Can we keep peace indoors? 
'Cause I bought the most expensive piece up out the store
It's the birthday bae, it's the birthday 
We gon' pop this party off and you gon' have to ball 
And we gon' chase the stars
It's who birthday? Yours
It's who birthday? Yours
Feels like you're driving Rolls Royce
Can we keep peace indoors?
'Cause I bought the most expensive piece up out the store
It's the birthday, bae, it's the birthday
We gon' pop this party off and you gon' have to ball
And we gon chase the stars
It's who birthday? Yours
It's who birthday? Yours
Feels like you're driving Rolls Royce
Can we keep peace indoors?
'Cause I bought the most expensive piece up out the store
It's the birthday, bae, it's the birthday

Pop two cups of purple just to warm up 
I heard your bitch, she got that water

Iced out watch , ridin' round, ten o'clock 
Ridin' round, geeked up, damn, think it's three o'clock 
Four o'clock , five o'clock, six o'clock 
I'm gon' pop, if I don't, I'm back to the pot 
I got rocks , big bales, big arms
Tommy gun , come out and play, let's have fun 
Big scales , fish scale, big weight 
Iceberg , ice tray, ice tray 
Plug called , tried to front, I don't need it

Get freezy , young nigga pay your debt-is 
Grandma , auntie Ab and auntie Neesa 
Uncle Bo , auntie Greta serve ya Perkys

In Italy, bought her a fur, look like the wildebeast 
Just chill with me 
It is no worry, it is a bill to me 
I pull up Diablo, I pull up with models
I gave her her first Philippe 
We goin' full throttle, she swallowed the bottle
I'm all in her ovaries 
I gave her some dollars
I Gucci'd her collar, now she can't get over me 
She want a dose of me 
Just hop in the Ghost with me 
Perky and molly, don't vote for nobody
These bitch ass niggas ain't solid 
Run in your house and with pumps and the shotties
Your mama might be up inside it 
Cars robotic, bad bitch with a body
But really don't care nothing about it 
Cappin' and poppin', I seen that lil' Masi
I coulda pulled up and just shot ya 
It's a jungle, I let 'em survive

        What the fuck did you say? 
What the fuck did you say? 
What the fuck did you say? 
What the fuck did you say? 
What the fuck did you say? 
Tell me what these bitches want from a nigga
Give what I want when I wantGot so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
I just want to see lil' mama
Bounce that ass like a drummer
Because I got an anaconda
She do what ever I wanna
I wanna go and tell my mama
Her hair so long like Rapunzel
She told me don't eat your lasagna
So I gotta listen to my mama
Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all about the money, I ain't mad at you
Long as I throw it up, you look back at it
Got me coming back like a crack addict
I take a night off and I'm back at it
Got so high to call mama
So high to call mama
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Make a way, let me bust a dance move
Pull up on a boulevard
Straight to the point, I don't talk
I got a coupe, I can't park
All my dogs go hard
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
I threw the money, told her "look back at it"
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She make that booty bounce like a jack rabbit
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
She all about the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at you
If you all 'bout the money, I ain't mad at youYea
Rain drops
Drop top
Pull up in the game and no I don't stop
Killin every rapper when I play no co-op
Never lookin for a helping hand cuz they all flop
No
They know the flow
Stackin up bread it's like never before
Thinkin bout when I just used to be broke
Payin for girls I don't talk to no more
Wish I could go and get that money back now but it's all good
They been watchin what I'm doing now and they all shook
When somebody go and let you down make em all look
Back at what they coulda been now but they lost it
No
Leave me alone
On do not disturb I don't pick up the phone
I'll find me another its plenty of clones
These women the same they all bad to the bone
Yea they lookin so bad and boujee
Come thru and we'll make movie
Don't matter if your all your friends knew me
I'm tellin you this is the new me
Aye Come find out what u been missin
Accept it like terms and conditions
No iMessage got me suspicious
No phones in the room it's all business*Transcribing*
