(Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If  you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
If  you tell, you a fuck nigga
(How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What’s  up with you? I grew up with you
Used  to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you)
(Fuck  niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
Fuck nigga
Nah, Lil Tjay , yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with
SB strapped up in the field with it
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
I used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you
My mama know about the pain, thought I'd never change
But looking back, for the fame, I felt the same
I was stuck up in the streets, but I had a brain
I ain't have no money, we was looking for a nigga chain
And shit, all I ever wanted was to have a name
Had a lot of shit to lose, not enough to gain
And that fuck nigga changed, went against the grain
Found out my homie went fed, almost went insane
Strictly business, you ain't with it, you get parked, nigga
I don't know you, you wasn't with me from the start, nigga
I remember catching stains in the park, nigga
Me and Bubba tryna catch an opp after dark, nigga
My mama told me, "Wisen up, be a smart nigga"
So all my niggas on go like a kart, nigga
Smelly drive mean a bullet to your heart, nigga
I don't really wanna speak facts, see the chart, nigga
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust
Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga

Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga
What's up with you? I grew up with you
Used to fuck with you, now I'm wishing that a bus hit you

Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga
How you tell on the gang? If you mention my name
Boy, I promise I'ma kill you, better duck, nigga

Bitches see me and scream Lil Tjay
Had to fuck up the spot for my B-day
Hit the 'telly and catch me a BJ
Fuck this love, I don't want me a skeezay
Give her dick, now she feel like she need me
I'm too high, always smoking on GG
Bankroll, had to stack my chips
SB, I'ma jack my shit
I know these niggas gon' hate me
I've been working hard, driving me crazy
Big bag don't mean everything wavy
I got 99 problems like JAY-Z
Caught a felony, judge tried to slave me
Lost my grandmother, R.I.P. Mavy
I got money and niggas moved shady
With my brother, I put that on baby
My first car, I might cop a Mercedes

Niggas waiting, the tape 'bout to drop
Told my mother that I'm destined to pop
Y'all ain't think I would get what I got
But I stayed true to myself
No losing myself
Improving myself
I'm on the road to the riches
I'm asking the Lord for forgiveness
I got two or three opps on the hit list
Y'all be talking but ain't never did shit
You'd be better off minding your business
Hard-headed, I just don't like to listen
Mezclando, I stay in the kitchen
Money coming in, my palms is itching
Y'all niggas ain't no competition
Big bag don't mean everything wavy

Lil Tjay
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin' 
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong 
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Everything is going Gucci, see me Lou V
I can't let a nigga shoot me, I'm in a two seat
And before I speak about it, rather grab a loose leaf
Thirty clip of the dip, and I'm in a hoopty
And we spin the opp block with a mini Uzi
Had to send a couple shots, I been acting bougie
All the sudden all these thots let me in they coochie
They gon' make they pussy pop tryna get my blue cheese
Low-key I be in the streets tryna OD
Low-key 'cause the industry, I'm not the old me
Low-key started peeping niggas not my homies
Phony nigga ate that shit like macaroni
And I remember last year niggas went to Coney
Never thought that this year I'd have a deal with Sony
Lil TJay SB, I'm the one and only
And I just came home and everybody know me
If you want another G.O.A.T., guess you gotta clone me
Quit talkin' 'bout some loyalty you never showed me
Nigga, I don't owe you like you never owed me
Once I got a little clout, everybody know me
And we never had to prove this, we really do this
You was never in the field, you was on your school shit
Now my energy is boosted, my mind exuded
They gon' make a nigga lose it, they acting stupid
I got up out my Birkin, it's workin'
She said she a virgin, it's hurtin'
But she ain't never show me love when my pockets hurtin'
Now she see a nigga on, she fucking and slurping
And they see me puttin' on and it got them nervous
We don't never need to ball, I did it on purpose
And I used to play the block with the fiends, got some knots in my jeans
If a nigga talk hot, we gon' pop for his bean 
I'm coming strong and they knew that
You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that 
You had your chance, but you blew that 
Everybody asking who that? 
The fuck going on?
Someone in my circle started leaking all my songs
I'ma stay ten toes, I'ma still go strong
I don't get these snake niggas, we just can't get along
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine
Gangbang, growing up I was Stain Gang
Stain Gang, promise I was only tryna maintain
Lil TJay SB, that's the gang gang
Ask about me, bet they tell you how my name ring
And I know they gon' hate 'cause I'm up now
I'm at the point where I don't really give a fuck now
Free the guys, I'ma say it 'til they touch down
One day everybody have a bustdown
So I'm skrrting off the scene in a foreign, see me goin'
Me and YG up in Cali smoking GT out the bong
Shawty pulled up in a thong, I don't know what she on
If she ask to spend the night then I might give her what she want
Fuck her one time, maybe two times if she too fine
Make your boo mine, I'm in the stu', this my new grind
I'm cooking up, I'm cooking up, ain't tryna lose time
I shoot it up, don't give a fuck, ain't tryna lose mine Lil TJay
Uh

Smellin' like Dolce Gabbana
Rollin' up marijuana
Ya bitch had me "Como te llamas?"
Ya bitch, she ain't really a fronter 
Know I could fuck if I wanna
I might just tell her I love her
I might just fuck her and dub her
Last bitch I hit with a rubber 
I couldn't bust on her covers
Had too much respect for her mother
Ain't wanna lay hands on her brother
Flexin', she all on my huevos 
I just be chasin' these pesos
Told her I ain't tryna fuck now
She said, "I'll still give you head though"
So we went to go get a bottle 
She said Ceretto Moscato
Chillin', I'm all at her mouth wit' it
I bust a nut and she swallowed

She asked me when, I said, "Yo no se"
This money be comin' in every way
I stay on my grind every-everyday
That pussy be wetter than seven lakes
I beat it, she love how I treat it 
I know I'm the shit, I'm conceited 
I got her addicted, she need it 
If I was a book she would it read it
Said if I was a book she would read it

Ain't got no time for no damn ho
I kill it and leave it like Rambo

She said, "I'm different," I'm like, "What you mean?"
Shorty keep callin', I'm lettin' it ring
All she gon' say is, "I'm doin' my thing"
Gotta start somewhere, I'm chasin' my dream
Started off hungry like Jack and the Bean
Hurt me to say that I'm drug to the fiends
I'ma get money, that's by any means
Not worried 'bout niggas that's worried 'bout me
Yeah, I'm from Ryer and 183
Used to be deep now it's nobody free
Do it for Smelly, I do it for E
Bitches on me and I don't give a fuck
Sometimes I feel like it's all about us

Yo' bitch finessin' my dick like a dutch

Lil Tjay
Yeah, yeah, yeahI feel like the greatest
Only been at this for two years, thank God this shit happened so quick
Fashion me the latest, money comin' in but so do hatred
Shit ain't how I pictured, but I faced it
Emotions, I erased it, fuck havin' feelings, I replaced it
Should've peeped that fu' shit from the basis
This when the mistakes hit, tired of gettin' caught up in this fake shit
I just can't sit comfy with no snake shit
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie
So if you ain't ready to die, then don't try
I gotta make it home so my mama don't cry
I'd rather do the sentence, least time'll go by
Feel the pain, so numb, I don't feel nothin'
Shooters still runnin' 'round with no chill button
Still be totin' in the town, finna drill somethin'
Let a nigga run up on me thinkin' I won't kill somethin'
And I keep the gang with me, try it, bet we air shit
Everybody get it, if it's static, we don't spare shit
Really on my bully, 2020, we ain't playin'
Now it's lit for everything, don't care 'bout what you sayin'
Mama, she was prayin', I was on that block late
Really put in twenty years of work, but then I got weight
Sunday I ain't never go to church because that block pay
Big .40 cal' in my shirt, no karate
Fuck what the opps say, fuck what the cops say
Big Smelly drive, E for E, that's the block way
If you feel a way, grrt-baow what the Glock say
All my niggas tryna get the bag, fuck the pop way
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, "Tjay, bro, you made it," I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, "Fuck it, I don't care," 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest
Words that they did not say, dick suckin' crazy
Everybody tryna beach for clout like it's wavy
Guess I'm just too real, I stood solid, how they made me
I can never be a goofy nigga if they paid me
Songs too heat now, everything is wavy
Lot of niggas think it's competition, they amaze me
I was goin' downhill, jail kinda saved me
Gotta keep the hard work, ain't no gettin' lazy
Smokin' opposition kinda sorta got me dazy
Think you'd last a day up in my shoes, then nigga, trade me
Bitch, I need a billion in blues like I'm JAY-Z
Huh, R.I.P. to Mavy
Bitch, I'm cookin' now, got the sauce like it's gravy
If you want a feature, get your money right and pay me
Still, when the time come, it might be a maybe
It depend on the type of record that you gon' play me
I can't do a wack verse, industry would trade me
Every time you hear my name, you know I'm goin' crazy
Really, I'm a trench kid, SB really made me
Really had the same goal and dream since a baby, ooh-ooh-ooh
I just want my name to be around when I ain't here
Livin' in the moment, but I want this shit for years
They like, "Tjay, bro, you made it," I still feel like I ain't there
A lot of niggas hated, I said, "Fuck it, I don't care," 'cause I'm takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, takin' off
I'ma soon be the greatest, huh
I'ma soon be the greatest
I been holdin' demons inside, I can't lie

Hopped in the booth 'til we scream that we made it
Other day I was recording in the basement
Now I pull up to a show in a spaceship
How you screamin', "Day one," doin' fake shit?
Nowadays bad bitches wanna taste it
Pull up on the S, show love, that be gang shit
And if they let me in the game, I'ma change it
Ain't a lot of niggas say ever basic
Pop out, I'ma stain, Balmains and some Bape shit
Niggas see me, they ain't never gon' say shit
Bustdown, ain't never gon' take this
Money I got, lil' nigga, can't make this
Countin' blue strips, broke niggas gon' hate this
Mama so proud, I'ma take her on vacation
I be goin' hard, remember used to starve
Remember selling nicks right on the boulevard
Going downtown, tryna steal a nigga car
And if I call Tut he'll pull a nigga card
I don't play the field no more without a hammer
Brodie on the news, whole face on the camera
Free all my day one niggas out the slammer
Opp nigga told, black and white, he a panda
Got me finna run up in his crib like I'm Santa
All of this designer got me broads in Atlanta
Honestly, I ain't playin' games no more
And they been on my dick 'til my thing feel sore
Bitch said I'm trash, shorty, change your drawers

Flex up, I'ma jump out the gym
New water, watch that young boy swim
I got it the harder way like I'm Tim
In that Maybach, you can't see through the tint
I ride foreign but bro in a stolie
Had to make me some plays on my dolie
Think I made it, these bitches all on me
No, this is not a chain, this a trophy 
Boss up, he a baby like Jody
Used to go hit a stain for the OZ's
When I put on the ice, it be odee
I'm talking money, put that cash on a threeway
Doin' the dash on a freeway

Baby, I make it look easy
Your bitch keep callin' and sayin' she need me
I know she see me with Tjay
I'm sippin' fours of that drank, movin' slow-mo

Other hoes play a part but they ain't my bitch
They just wanna see us ruin our relationship
Swear they wanna see us ruin our relationship
But I love them good vibes, that's what I deserve
Even though sometimes you irk me and you get on my nerves
I could always make it better when I lift up ya skirt

Teamwork make the dream work, now I need a clean shirt
Pussy tasted like a Tropicana out the freezer and
When I see you, I know these bitches wanna be you
And they don't even know about that Hurricane Katrina
How I knock it out like we up in the arena

Yeah that's mine and I love her like my Nina
I keep her looking fly, she might just pass it if you see her
Man slow down, speed it up, slow it down, speed it up
Matter fact, lay down, lemme eat it up

The way you kiss me when I'm strokin' deep inside of it
I swear you ride it so good 
That pussy blow me away
And I been thinkin' 'bout your smile
All mornin' for a while
'Bout the way you twist your face while I'm strokin' in and out
And now, girl you shocked me, I'm so wowed
Got me slippin', I'm like how?
First I met you on the 'Gram, I picked you up and took you out
Let me show you what I'm 'bout
Let them haters run they mouth
You should know you somethin' different 'cause I brought you to my house
Serve you breakfast on my couch
Anything you ever need you know I'll be there with no doubt
I need you by my side, I hope you're here to ride
I hate to see you hurtin', my lil' baby, wipe your eyes
Baby let me pull your dress down 
Kiss you from your neck down 
Have you screaming "Oh"
Baby just let me pull your dress down
Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming "Oh," them sex sounds
Baby I need you in my life, it's like there's no one there
Nobody, can I turn to you next time there's no one there?
I need that girl to match my loyalty when times get rough
I turn to you 'cause I know damn well you don't give a fuck
About them, let them niggas hate
Either way, regardless what they saying, we'll be great
Let's go explore the whole world, fuck the skippin' states
You got me feelin' different, I might let it go today
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go
Mm-mm-mm, might let it go
Oh, oh, oh, might let it go

Kiss you from your neck down
Have you screaming "Oh," them sex sounds
Oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh-oh
Dress down, dress down
Oh"I fucking love this nigga, I'm 'bout to fucking cry. Oh my God!"
Five dollars, used to stretch it for days
Robbin' niggas tryna cop me some J's
Momma said, "Ain't nothing good in these streets"
Book smart, I was always unique
Then I wind up getting caught in some beef
Thirteen when I got off the leash
First gun, kept it under my seats
First pack, kept it under my beef
They ain't think that I would better my life
They ain't think that I would get this shit right
Done trapping, I ain't into the jug
Chose rapping, I ain't sippin' no mud
If it's static, come and show me what's up
Last nigga tried, caught 'em a slug
Summer nights, I was done off the drug
Free Xanny he had caught him a hit
Opp snitched that little nigga a bitch
Fuck the judge he can suck on a dick
I told Monkey I'ma bail him no trip
I told Smelly I'ma work on my gift
I told Eazy that his name's still alive
I don't wanna see no more of us die
I don't wanna have a reason to cry
Funny movement then I'm toting a .9
Hunger, you can see the pain in my eyes
Fifteen, cracker give me some time
Lost my brother I was losing my mind
Fake love left them niggas behind
Buying nicks used to sell them as dimes
Summer's mine, I ain't waiting in line
Labels beasting tryna get me to sign
Independent I'ma do it for now
Need a feature then I'm taking your clout
I got niggas bumping me in the south
Told my mother I'ma get her a house
Fuck the haters they be running they mouth
I have shooters go and see what you 'bout
I ain't trippin' I'm just getting these bands
Shawty sippin' she go dumb off the xans
Niggas talking, they don't know who I am
Could've took a nigga life but it jammed
You ain't never lose your bro in your hands
My story niggas don't understand
My glory I'ma live out the plan
Fuck opinions I'ma be who I am
Never let a nigga tell me I can't
Young nigga with a mind of a man
My story niggas don't understand
We've been through pain together
Can't switch, be the same forever

I'm steady workin', no stop 
Really got faith for my pop
They want my music to flop 
Fuck it I'm sippin'
Niggas ain't getting no chicken

Grippin' with it and the windows is tinted
Skrrt skrrt, I be switchin' through lanes

Don't get left where they gotta come visit you
Gang, gang, call 'em out to extort you 
Little more than one eighty, the Porsche do

And fuckin' they thots, yes, I'm still puttin' on for the block
Still on my way to the top
And I'm still here to prove, 'cause my hunger ain't never gon' stop
Trauma that's fucked with my mind
Ain't wastin' no time, I'm focused on betterin' mine
Bullets gon' wet up your spine
Throwin' shots from behind, Lil Tjay you one of a kind
It's the reason I gotta go off
Take your moms out the hood, it don't matter the cost
Seventeen, life is short, but I'm rich and a boss

Hop in the foreign, switch lanes

Bitches see me and they know who I am
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm a fan
Lil Tjay, oh my God, I'm the man
I remember I was whippin' the pan
Wasn't right, but I did what I can
Fuck it, though, 'cause I'm just livin' my life
Remember times when the day wasn't bright
Half a pint up in a two-liter Sprite
I'ma make sure all my niggas aight
Commissary and I'm shippin' out kites
Takin' off, 'bout to book me a flight
Diamonds dancin' in the middle of night
Fire bitches started bein' polite
I remember when I wasn't they type
Now they figure I can better they life
I ain't listenin' to niggas' advice
Unless I feel what you tellin' me right
Fuck tomorrow, I'ma ball for tonight
I got potential to ball like I'm Mike
VVS diamonds, no regular ice
Heard a mistake when they see me on sight
Bitch, all that talkin' endanger your life
I keep a strap, Lil Tjay a dyke
Bread on my head, I could double the price, nigga
Runnin' your mouth
I'll have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out
Bitch, you could mob, and no toungin' me down
Make fun of me now, they see me like, "Wow"
Niggas that hate they gon' wanna be down, runnin' your mouth
I'll have my young niggas run in your house
You could be dead 'fore the sun even out, ayy
Designer belt holdin' my pants up

And bitches be blingin' my hotline
Drop top at the stop sign
You say that you flexin', boy, stop lyin'
And your bitch an eater, she not mine
And I'm goin' straight to the top, watch how I open up shop
Fuck out my way, I don't need you, I be great
Gettin' to it out of state
I need a bag, that's the reason why I spaz
Every time I'm on the track
Foot on the gas, leave them niggas in the past
I remember I was trash
Down to my last, I ain't never even ask
Now I look at y'all and laugh
Niggas be mad, why don't you look at my dab?
It's crazy this happened so fast
I'm on the road and I'm bringin' my bros
I'ma do it for all of the guys on the ave
Pop me a flag, pop me a tag
Sippin' dirty, I don't know how to act
They said I'm the new A Boogie, relax
I ain't never try to copy his swag
I'm just tryna put my hood on the map
Ellie use to live right next to the trap
Love or hate me, I'ma get to the racks
Skippin' niggas and they pull ya back
I was sleepy, I was takin' a nap
Ah, nah, nah
Runnin' your mouth
I'll have my young niggas run in your house

Niggas can say what they want, say what they want, they must not want me to win
This shit not cap or pretend, I lost a friend, I see an opp, I go in
Got me some shit that extend, you just all talk, how you ain't  never come spin?
I told my mama to grin, we at the top, I ain't been broke in a min'
Father, my bad for the sin, since I begin, I just got lost in the wind
I had to save up for bro, he need a lawyer, he gotta come home again
I need like fifty a show, that's how it go, I pick up half at the end
Young nigga settin' a trend, copped me a Bimmer, truly, I wanted a Benz
Everybody grind, everybody eat
I been on my grind on my two feet
Butterfly doors, it's a two-seat
They teeth, finna punch, call it Bruce Lee
We'll spin a nigga block only two deep
Nigga ran out his socks like a new feet
Remy Mack got knocked, but he loopy
Wanna see my whole block livin' Gucci
And the good die young, said Poochie
Walk around with two chops, Lil Ducie
Outta town, finna cop Lil Uzi
Know a lot of pussy niggas wanna shoot me
Wear my hat to the back, I ain't woopty
Had your main bitch eat, she a groupie
I remember block days, it was 2P
In the cell writin' bars under two sheets
I remember when the crib had no heat
I remember when the opps wanted no beef
I remember spinnin' blocks in a stoley
Seen a nigga get burned with a bogey
I done seen a good kid startin' OD
I done seen bro die front of police
So I try not to cry every day now
Swear I still feel the pain when I lay down
If you hit, pussy nigga, better stay down
You ain't never moved guns through the Greyhound
You ain't never gon' spin when it came down
And I really wanna hear what you say now
Keep a pole every day, we don't play 'round
Backpack got a stash, it's a spray ground
I remember tryna jugg out the playground
In the stu' goin' hard every day now, no, no
Niggas can say what they want, say what they want, they must not want me to win
This shit not cap or pretend, I lost a friend, I see an opp, I go in

I hope my mother forgive, shit that I did, she ain't expect from a kid
It's just the way that it is, stick to your biz 'fore you start runnin' your jibs
I know some killers and goons, I send 'em lurkin', they finna get you by noon
You could get swept like a broom, heaven got room, you finna go up there soon
What you assume?
Had to eat, I ain't start with no spoon
Feel like brother just got me in tune
Now I'm finna shoot off to the moon
Numbers goin' like Sonic, they zoom
Bitches fiendin' to give up they coo'
Made a milli', so long from a goon
I'ma have me a billion soon, nah, nah
I'ma reach for the stars
Ice gon' cop me a new Audemar
Had to let go like five at the bar
Told the dealership upgrade my car
I be the man, two milli' plus on the 'Gram, learn what you don't understand
You just a fan, soon as you saw me, you ran, bro caught a hit off the Xan'
Boy, I'ma blam, that's what you don't understand, no, we ain't finna throw hands, no, no
Nigga tryna steal my shine
I'ma clap 'fore you try to take mine 
Lately I been on my grind, for a fact, we gon' all be fine 
Haters tryna waste my time, for a fact, I don't pay 'em no mind
Niggas can say what they want, say what they want, they must not want me to win
This shit not cap or pretend, I lost a friend, I see an opp, I go in
Got me some shit that extend, you just all talk, how you ain't never come spin?
I told my mama to grin, we at the top, I ain't been broke in a min'
Father, my bad for the sin, since I begin, I just got lost in the wind
I had to save up for bro, he need a lawyer, he gotta come home again
I need like fifty a show, that's how it go, I pick up half at the end
Young nigga settin' a trend, copped me a Bimmer, truly, I wanted a BenzCashMoneyAP
Lil Tjay
Niggas gon' hate, I don't care about 'em
Niggas gon' hate, I don't care about 'em
Not at all
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
Bro said be humble, I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for my bros, I'ma make it
They want me gone, I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught, and he ate it
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
Hop in the foreign, I'm driftin' off stupid
Niggas be broke like the fuck is you doing?
Started off strong but there's room for improvement
I ain't for nothing, Milwaukee, I'm booming
Love ain't for me, now it's static with Cupid
Bitches in love with the way that I sing
They ain't want Tjay before this whole movement
Now they dick ride 'cause I'm doin' my thing
Still posted up on the block with the gang
Spin through your hood, I ain't tuckin' my chain
Bro got a chop with a whole lot of range
Said be consistent, ain't nothin' gon' change
Now that I'm speaking out honestly
I be flexing, but I'm still in poverty
Move my mom out the hood, do it properly
Give a fuck if you look at me awkwardly
No Monopoly, I'm about property
I don't owe niggas shit but respect
Yeah, one day I was going through stress
Matter fact, I'm just wasting my breath
And now I'ma just talk about all of these bands
How I'm so grateful I'm not in the can
How I'm so grateful for all of my fans
How I'm so grateful I am who I am, huh
Balmain the sweater, huh
Truey the pants, he did it again
Looking forward to a show in Japan
I think Dexter better lay off the Xans
Throwin' water on my chain 'cause I can
Applyin' pressure, now they shakin' my hands
Niggas ain't gettin' no paper
I know that's the reason they hate, that's my gun on my waist
Test Gwuapo, get shot in your face
And there ain't no room for debate
I know these niggas gon' hate
But my life is still goin' great
Pop out, Givenchy and Bape
We from the trenches
It's easy to hop over fences
The D's tryna build up a case
Stay with a weapon
It's either a Glock or a Wesson
That bitch shoot you right in your face
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
Bro said be humble, I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for my bros, I'ma make it
They want me gone, I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught, and he ate it
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
Feel like the greatest, I think I'm the G.O.A.T
Please don't get naked, I just want the throat
Out of my Birkin, I feel like it's workin'
Yeah, bitches be burgers, ain't even a joke
Feel like a star when I hop in the Wraith
It don't matter the place, I ain't tuckin' my chain
Only my brothers, ain't fuckin' with lames
I don't care what you tell me, ain't nothin' gon change
Ran up some bands, now I'm up like a plane
I was just hungry, ain't nothin' was funny
Y'all do what y'all do, I'ma stay in my lane
Hop in the booth and I'm spittin' that pain
I was a youngin that couldn't be tamed
Thinkin' shit funny like Tjay a stain
And I'ma get money regardless
Kill a nigga be easy, I'm heartless
I'm so young with a whole lot of charges
In the booth I be workin' my hardest
Boy tried to diss me, I swear that shit garbage
It won't be long 'til I walk down the carpet
Cop me a ladder, I took off the market
Red and green beam, I ain't missing my target
Run if you stupid, run if you stupid
Word to Smelly I won't hesi' to shoot shit
Told my niggas we gon' ball like I'm hoopin'
In the streets, I'm a fighter, Hadoken
Started winnin', I got tired of losin'
Know about it, don't why know they accusin'
Three lines got me deady, I'm snoozin'
Back up 'cause I'm seein' illusions
Bro told me grind, bro told me grind
All this fake love, I don't pay it no mind
Got a story and it's one of a kind
Independent, but I could've got signed
Cooking fire, baking soda combined
Do the math, I turned 8 in '09
17 and your boy in his prime
Free bro, he got off with a dime
Free verse? Is you out of your mind?
Only gang, do whatever for mine
Running, running, tryna get me a bag
Running, running, tryna get to it fast
Niggas talkin' like they bitches, they chat
Spin the block and we spinning it back
I was in the field cookin' the crack
One in the head, I ain't cocking it back
G side stackin' static, they smacked
SB, put my hood on the map, gang gang
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
Bro said be humble, I patiently waited
All of this love and I ain't even made it
I got a plan for them niggas that hated
Run up some bands for my bros, I'ma make it
They want me gone, I can't walk around naked
Even my brother got caught, and he ate it
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
No one can stop me I feel like the greatest
Got to be humble, I patiently waited
No one can stop me, I feel like the greatest
YeahEight
'Bout the wait
Bein' in the hood with no escape
Learned from my mistakes
Sentence on cases
Back when I was five years old, I knew that I was gon' be great
I found my gift for music back around the age of eight
I knew I'd be successful, it was more about the wait
So unacceptable as being in the hood with no escape
My mama taught me right but I just learned from my mistakes
Started washing up the day I caught a sentence on the case
Hunger pains shaped me to the way I am today
I gotta live with it, feelings that won't ever go away
Not every day I pray, but that ain't nothing cute to say
The money good, but how I know my buzz is finna stay?
Put my all into this music, I ain't make it here to play
Came a long way from booking niggas, me and Trigga Trey
Okay, I'm just tryna shed a little bit of light
And motivate them kids who haven't found they way in life
Remember I ain't have nowhere to lay my head at night
Trappin' on the block, I was sellin' weed and dirty Sprite
Don't wait until you hurtin' 'fore you choose to pray to Christ
Shooter on my package, you ever see me on them bikes
Still be in my hood, I'm comin' up, I'm playin' dice
I earned my stripes so I walk around my city like shit nice
On God, I wish I could make sure everybody eat
Red bottoms drippin' off of everybody feet
Hard feelings, I be thinking everybody keep
And I'm workin' hard, I be up while everybody sleep
Asthma acting up, fuck it, I don't really care
Still spittin' bars while I'm wheezing for some air
Pocket hold a deuce, and yeah, it's small, I'm well aware
When it flare, hit your melon, bet your salsa hit the air
VVS's diamonds on me, reason why they stare
Youngest out the city, reason I don't really care
Hatin' on my body, best believe I'm well aware
Caught a milli' on the 'Gram, lil' boy, you're nowhere near
Flexed up, just was next up, now I'm up now
Down to Earth, true to all my fans, I could touch ground
Run up on me thinkin' I don't got it, you get pumped down
Bustdown, glizzy in my pocket, stupid nigga
No security, 18, I don't think they hearing me
Apparently niggas ain't real, shit be scaring me
I'm glizzied up, got that glizzy tucked, why they fearing me?
Rap nigga try to throw shade, why he daring me?
18, got a clean record thanks to YO
Your bitch, she swallow
You feel a way, then catch a hollow
And hits really nothin', we don't really care for five-o
I been doin' this shit, as a kid I was nine-o
But they don't really know that, somethin' like a throwback
Tryna clean the image up so I don't wanna show that
Headed to the top, I ain't never tryna go back
Signs you see me throwin' up, they nothin' like a zodiac
Fuck the other side, see my nuts, they can hold that
Showin' off them pistols, I ain't never seen you blow that
Smelly hella proud and the opps already know that
If y'all want me gone, why don't you come and pull up where a show at?
No cap
No cap 
Man, she know I was gon' make it
You know I was gon' make it, yeah
I can talk my, my stuff now
'Cause we out here
No, yeah, you act tough inside the school
And out here, look at you today, yeah, quiet
Remember sellin' white up on the block
Tryna make some knots
D's try to run up in the spot
Me and Smelly sittin' in the trap
Smokin' on the pack
Wrong crib, all you smell is crack
And I done put my trenches onto rap
I wish I could go back
To August 14th to be exact
That's when my nigga Smelly would be here
Trauma so severe
I had to watch him crying out for air
Bet he's in the air, make me cough
Spinnin' through the fourth
Catch an opp, I'm finna take him off
And I call the shots, I'm a boss
Skinny version Ross
Dummy in the air, take a loss
Y'all niggas gon' get me caught up, man
Got me talkin' hot and shit, man
Niggas know my body though
SB the fuck up, gangLil Tjay  
Yeah, uh, uh 
Oh-oh, oh, yeah , yeah , oh
Back when I met you I thought you were special
Something 'bout you, just couldn't forget you
Swear to God, I regret how you played me
Can't believe I was me and I let you
Bet you gon' miss all them nights when I sexed you
Bet you gon' miss when I'm hard to get next to
Bet you gon' miss all them roses and petals
Where you gon' look when you ready to settle?
Nevеr my way, lil' shorty, I'm gone
This ain't gon' work, we ain't gettin' along
I can't sit right with you doing mе wrong
I know it's gon' hurt when you hear this song
'Cause you've been playing games
And I been feeling strange
Girl, I don't want you to think I wanna change
I will move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on, oh 
Move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on
Oh, I gotta go, 2020 now, you should see I'm changin' shit 
Growin' up and I'm the man, yeah
To these bands, ain't got time to change a bitch 
I think I want me a Bentley, foreign car just to change the whip 
They like, "Tjay, you different," I tell 'em, I know 
I'm focused on changin' shit
Focused, ain't playin no games with this
Car cruise, I got lane assist
Hop in the stu' , and start flamin' shit
Got out them trenches, they dangerous, they dangerous, no
I was gon' ride for you, and it would be too much just to lie to you
So, I'ma just keep it a buck, you're out of luck if you think me sayin' I'm goin' is a bluff 
I'ma leave, sit down, sit and breathe
I need your bad energy apart from me
I know Smelly up guarding me
Somethin' told me you ain't smart for me, no
Back when I met you I thought you were special
Something 'bout you, just couldn't forget you
Swear to God, I regret how you played me
Can't believe I was me and I let you
Bet you gon' miss all them nights when I sexed you
Bet you gon' miss when I'm hard to get next to
Bet you gon' miss all those roses and petals
Where you gon' look when you ready to settle?
Never my way, little shorty I'm gone
This ain't gon' work, we ain't gettin' along
I can't sit right with you doing me wrong
I know it's gon' hurt when you hear this song
'Cause you've been playing games
And I been feeling strange
Girl, I don't want you to think I wanna change
I will move on, move on, move on 
Don't make me move on, move on, move on, oh 
Move on, move on, move on
Don't make me move on, move on, move on, oh 
Move on, move on, on
Move on, move on, on
Move on, move on, move on, move on, move on, move on
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Uh, uh, oh-woah-oh
Oh, woah, oh-woah-woah, ohPipe that shit up, TNT
No, no 
Lil Tjay, yeah, yeah, yeah
He might treat you better, however, this what you fail to remember
You know I'm stacking my cheddar, you know I be there whenever
I'm in L.A., what's the vibe? This dope got me in the skies 
So when you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
When you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
If you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline 
I don't be pressing decline
Just so much be on my mind
Keep it low so they won't know, let's go somewhere they won't go
Fuck all that taking it slow, right now, I'm letting you know
Run up, I'm letting it blow, they tryna cash in my life
So if you really by my side, I hope you're ready to ride
Been through this many times
You my brother, you stick by me every time
Always there, nigga acting funny, he gon' let it fly
But I'm just tryna teach you little bits of me, yeah
I'm right here, right now, but this ain't where I plan to be
Should be somewhere overseas, touring and getting cheese
But I'm right here in the town, always moving around
I was down, down, down, down, down, down
Mama proud, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud
Look at me now, I'm grippied up, don't try to book me now
I'm the youngest nigga making noise out the Boogie Down
I was down, down, down, down, down, down
Mama proud, proud, proud, proud, proud, proud
Smoking GT out the pound, laughing 'cause he a clown
Woulda had a cap and gown if Smelly was still around
But it's pain in me, thinking about it make me get so angry
Hang with me, riding 'round town with the gang
Girl, I fuck with you, you should know exactly where you stand
I'm only saying the truth, so serious, I ain't playin'
And I'm speeding like the fast and furious, music playin'
In the telly, I'ma play with your clitoris while you layin'
Don't you understand what I'm sayin'?
If I fall off and lose my bands, baby, is you stayin'?
Or maybe I don't understand half the shit I'm facin'
No time to be patient, I see my mama, I'm 'bout to cry on stage
He might treat you better, however, this what you fail to remember
You know I'm stacking my cheddar, you know I be there whenever
I'm in L.A., what's the vibe? This dope got me in the skies 
So when you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
When you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
If you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline 
I don't be pressing decline
Just so much be on my mind 
Only time I press decline if I know you ain't on shit
And I always try to catch a vibe, but you ain't ever on shit
In Miami we went slip and slide, went deeper than the ocean
I'm the type of guy that's always fly and gon' keep me some motion
I can't fuck around with the other side 'cause they be on some ho shit
I'm wearing Cartier to cover my eyes, I'm staying focused
Money coming in, I get high, tryna stay low-key
The lawyers say, "We going to trial, we don't take no pleas"
Back then, we steal cars, we ain't had no keys
Modern days, we drive foreign, they come with no keys
Watch came with VV's, see me on TV
Back stage with RiRi, my life on repeat
I be grinding so hard I be forgetting to eat
Pull up everyday around the world, I don't get no sleep
Turned into a monster like I damn near don't know me
I don't care for listening, you gon' have to show me
He might treat you better, however, this what you fail to remember
You know I'm stacking my cheddar, you know I be there whenever
I'm in L.A., what's the vibe? This dope got me in the skies 
So when you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
When you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline
If you call me, don't assume that I'll be pressing decline 
I don't be pressing decline
Just so much be on my mindOh
Oh, no
No
Don't give a fuck what nan' nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only ten-year friends in the Wraith
You ain't got no friends in this race
Bro, you gotta understand niggas fake
Knock him off if he stand in the way
Shorties hopping out vans with the K
I done seen my own mans turn to snake
Done seen my own mans tell the jakes
I know God got plans for me now
Just because he put bands on the plate
Want static, put bands on his face
Bet he gon' understand we don't play
First nigga try to reach, say it now
He gon' die where he stand, yeah, today
I was passing out dog food in the dope line
Streets vouchin' for me, fuck a cosign
Where we gangbang and we tote iron
And you earn respect with a four-five
I'ma let it spark when it's showtime
2014 when my bro died
Seen a lot of niggas really won't ride
Wanna see you smile one more time
Got a damaged heart, I done had enough
I don't wanna hear no more lies
And a lot of niggas lost they head in this shit
I'll be damned if I let 'em smoke mine
Promised Maxine I was gon' shine
Got my bands up, copped the X7
On the highway and that ho flyin'
Money, power, fame make a ho blind
And the vibes be so fake, so showing love feel weird
Fuck the opps and the jakes, I wish my thug was still here
We got no remorse, we send 'em slugs for them tears
I got my back against the wall, I think my trust disappeared
Don't give a fuck what nan' nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only ten-year friends in the Wraith
You ain't got no friends in this race
Bro, you gotta understand niggas fake
Knock him off if he stand in the way
Shorties hopping out vans with the K
I done seen my own mans turn to snake
Done seen my own mans tell the jakes
I know God got plans for me now
Just because he put bands on the plate
Want static, put bands on his face
Bet he gon' understand we don't play
First nigga try to reach, say it now
He gon' die where he stand, yeah, today
I done been through it, I seen a lot
Made it out, now I feel like I want it all
Money been coming in, gotta stack it tall
If you build this shit right, it won't ever fall
I don't know about y'all, but I gotta ball
When I get in my bag, I just hit the mall
Way before you gon' walk, niggas gotta crawl
Nigga saying he gang, well, I don't recall
Tryna make sure my team right
Each, every nigga on go if I give him that green light
He fronted the scene pipes
Shooters right here, little boy, what you mean, fight?
Savagery, I might seem nice
I know niggas checkin' my glizzy, the beam tight
No longer the scheme type
Blue cheese up in 'em, Amiri, my jeans tight
And I gotta eat now
I know mama happy her son on his feet now
I'm bringing the heat now
For 20-two-oh, we shutting the streets down
Lil Tjay a beast now
I got in my Birkin, watch everyone feast now
I mean this from deep down
Don't try to come rob me, you see me don't speak down 
Don't give a fuck what nan' nigga say
Couldn't let that chance get away
Need ten hundred bands in the safe
Only ten-year friends in the Wraith
You ain't got no friends in this race

Knock him off if he stand in the way
Shorties hopping out vans with the K

Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-oh-oh-ohAlmighty Nate
I said mm-mm, mm-mm, mm
Mm-mm, mm-mm, mm, yeah
Said it's on me, yeah
I gave my dawg a couple hundred, told him hold his head
He locked up, so I pray for him before I go to bed
My back was turned when y'all was talkin', but I heard what y'all said
Got all these tears I done formed, but they ain't never shed
They said they went through hell and back when we was livin' there
Tryna last a day inside my shoes when I got different pairs
I can't believe this little bitch thought she was slick
I got the spits and then I dipped, I had to show her that I didn't care
I pay attention all the time, you got no choice but to respect it
I can't let them take my life, that's why we walk around with weapons
I can't get you off my mind, it's to the point where I be stressin'
I got played so many times, it was all I expected, nah, nah
Niggas televised my pain when I needed help
I always thought I needed you, but bitch, I need myself
Who am I to believe a bitch when I don't believe myself?
And I refuse to please a bitch when I can please myself
I had my back against the ropes, I had to protect myself
The hopes I had were way too high, I used to upset myself
I gave you way too many chances, I had to check myself
How do you expect me to respect you and you don't respect yourself?
You had no reason to do what you did, but you still did it, nigga
They ain't think I'd make it out the hood until I did it, nigga
This for all them days when I woke up and wished I didn't, nigga
And where I'm from, we put in pain before we feel it, nigga
I gave my dawg a couple hundred, told him hold his head
He locked up, so I pray for him before I go to bed
My back was turned when y'all was talkin', but I heard what y'all said
I feel no type of way, just take these bullets to the head
I had what you need, I had what you want
You was in these street doing niggas wrong
Now you on my meat, singing all my songs
Now you wanna speak, blowing up my phone
I had what you need, I had what you want
You was in these streets doing niggas wrong
When you be with your friends, you be singing all my songs
Now you wanna speak, you be blowing up my phone
I gave my dawg a couple hundred, told him hold his head
He locked up, so I pray for him before I go to bed
My back was turned when y'all was talkin', but I heard what y'all said 
I feel no type of way, just take these bullets to the head 
Couple soldiers locked down, I scream "Free the guys" 
Petty shit we overlooked done got us penalized 
I still talk to Mini everyday, he got like three to five 
All this shit been puncturing my heart, but I won't ever cry 
Brand new money coming in, I just put that shit aside 
Y'all might think this shit I did was easy but it took it's time 
Now I'm on my grind, overwhelmin', I've been contemplating time 
Fuck a line, I been skipping shit, this talent is hard to find
Tell on mine? Swear to God that I won't never tell on mine 
I was there? Nigga, who? What? Fuck it, guess I'm blind 
How you real, how you scary? Plus you guilty of that crime 
I guess that I'm in a different mind, shit be hard to find 
'Cause I'm different, ain't too many like me 
All the sudden bitches tryna write me 
Now these bitches come around tryna sight-see 
I just want the Masi, she hit me up like, "I see" 
And I know that she don't like me, she just want to brag 
I caught the kitten, after that, I left that bitch on read 
Shorty got potential, but she skeet off like a slag 
She said I'm her teddy bear, I treat her like I'm Ted 
Raf fake, Gucci cake, stripping, might get played 
Outfit go retarted, I get checks like special ed 
Youngins in my city going dumb, they so mislead 
I'm just tryna show 'em it's a better way instead 
I gave my dawg a couple hundred, told him hold his head
He locked up, so I pray for him before I go to bed 
My back was turned when y'all was talkin', but I heard what y'all said
I feel no type of way, just take these bullets to the head 
Take 'em to the head, uhh
You don't make it 'til you're dead, no
Take 'em to the head, take 'em to the head, mm, ohYeah
Lil Tjay 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Know you want me for my bread, you ain't fucking wit' my head
Try to push me to the edge, I reverse that shit instead
You want me 'cause I'm on, you want me 'cause I'm on
You want me 'cause the drip I got, the sauce that I got on
I pop out with some Gucci, Cartiers and Saint Laurent
Got all these mixed emotions, had to put 'em in a song
You want me 'cause I'm on, you want me 'cause I'm on
You gold digging thinking I don't know what's going on
I love my niggas but y'all ain't treating me the same
I never thought that y'all would switch up on me for the fame
Chatting on my name
So call my phone, I'm a let it ring
Call my phone, I'm a let it ring now
Tell me what you would do
If your day one nigga started changing on you
We done been through a lot, ya act like y'all forgot
And I know a lot of niggas didn't want me to pop
Got no love for a thot, I'm just chasing the guap
Hollow shells for a nigga 'cause we play with them Glocks
So I stay with a chop, I ain't saying a lot
'Til Sandy come home, he gon' stay in the box
They ain't feeling my pain, they must think it's a game
I can't wait to take a picture next to Nicki and Wayne
Two SB on the chain and I know I'ma stain
If you run up on me I'm a have some shells for your brain
Henny, Patron got me feeling good
The gang with me, wish a nigga would
Strapped, waitin' for a opp when I'm in the hood
I'm a keep making noise 'til it's understood
Know you want me for my bread, you ain't fucking wit' my head
Try to push me to the edge, I reverse that shit instead
You want me 'cause I'm on, you want me 'cause I'm on
You want me 'cause the drip I got, the sauce that I got on
I pop out with some Gucci, Cartiers and Saint Laurent
Got all these mixed emotions, got to put 'em in a song
You want me 'cause I'm on, you want me 'cause I'm on
You gold digging thinking I don't know what's going on
And I could spit some shit that y'all just wouldn't comprehend
It's really Smelly drive and I'm riding to the end
My new grip the clip extend, it's full for all your friends
They prayin' I'ma fail when my career, it just began
Told the guys it's our year, right now it's our time
I'ma always do my best to make sure everyone shine
Long, long time, we all gon' be fine
I ain't never said contradicted none of my lines
But I'm going through stuff, I think that I'm stressed
Everyday I'm in the studio, ain't getting no rest
That's the reason why the haters won't acknowledge that I'm next
They hate because I'm coming strong, stepping on they neck
Why you hating on me? I ain't hating on you
And niggas clout chasing like it's something to do
I still don't understand, I swear everything new
And I'm hearing a lot of rumors, I don't know if they true
I know you niggas too fake, they two-faced
Always throwing shade, swear that shit amuse me

You ain't no competition, boy, don't think you wanna do that 
You had your chance, but you blew that 
Everybody asking who that?

Nagra 
Know how we do, bro
You know what these bitches always say
Everybody  can suck my dick 
Fuck  it, I know I'm still young, I know I'm still dumb, but I'm tryna change shit
My youngins, they be on that gang shit
I  send 'em, they pull up and bang shit
I tried to chill out and focus on music, but niggas forgot that we dangerous
When it come to that iron, we slang shit
I'ma stay on this road 'til my lane switch
On  the road getting chicken, but we call it flicken, these niggas ain't speaking my language
Pussy boy, I don't fuck with that lame shit
It be hard to stay low 'cause this fame shit
Had this thot give me mop in the back of my Bimmer
It's crazy, you call her your main bitch
Every link-up, it's always the same shit
Now you knocking, I know that the pain hit
Said you wouldn't be an opp
Had your bitch give me top
Told the guys, I'm like, "Bro, this is gang shit"
White gold, I ain't rocking no stainless
Fill your head with three hollows, you brainless
Put them goons on your ass, they looking for cash
You fuck around, boy, and be chainless
My city, I'm tryna rename this
Run up on me, head tap, now you famous
And I heard niggas looking for me
And I heard niggas looking for bro
Pop out, I be icy and clean
New drip from my head to my toe
Catch an opp back to back in a row
Bullets burning, we get him, skip states and get low
Ordered my food then I took it to go
I was 13 tryna flip me an O
When I ain't know nothing, I knew I would blow
I knew that one day I'd sell out a show
I know these fuck niggas want me to lose
Thanks for the haters for helping me grow
I got some feelings I never let show
Do it for Smelly, forever my bro
Ride through my city, I'm droppin' the fours
You see me, I'm flexing with butterfly doors
Fuck it, I know I'm still young, I know I'm still dumb, but I'm tryna change shit
My youngins, they be on that gang shit
I send 'em, they pull up and bang shit
I tried to chill out and focus on music, but niggas forgot that we dangerous

Now you knocking, I know that the pain hit
My niggas with me, to the top
Lil TjayWoah, woah
Oh-oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh
They tried to tell me I wouldn't be shit
Family doubted, I couldn't believe
I had to focus and better myself
Fightin' anxiety, smokin' these trees
I got caught up tryna run up a juug
Locked me up, felt like I'm never gon' leave
Life is so rough, you ain't show me no love
Time to be selfish and focus on me
Niggas tried tell me I wasn't gon' win
They tried to knock me up off of my grind
Ain't motivated, then get out my face
Negative energy, left it behind
I made a promise, my niggas gon' ball
Judges can't hold me to finish this time
Gotta stay toe, we ain't never gon' fold
Smelly ain't here, but for him we gon' shine
Still play the block, it ain't changed
I'm just tryna help the guys and maintain
How the fuck you tryna prove somethin' to me?
You ain't even at the top of your game
How you got them niggas rockin' your chain?
22, the sound pop in your brain
Last nigga tried to snake me dead
On God, I ain't finna play with no lame
Hop in the foreign, switch lanes
AP, no Jane, bro made a hundred off 'caine
VVS diamonds, my chains
Everything changed, lifestyle just won't be the same
Mama know this year my time
Low on my mind, I can't let up off the grind
I won't leave no one behind
We finna shine, listen, just give me some time
Somethin' different 'bout the life I live
And the games we play
All the pain we done been through
Will I change? No way
Somethin' different 'bout the life I live
And the games we play 
All the pain we done been through
Will I change? No way
Mama know that I'm a bright kid, only eighteen
Always knew that I would get here, had a bright dream
Now I'm headed to the top now, me and my team
We're no longer on the block now movin' ice cream
Feedin' into the bullshit, I gotta stop that
And I can't fuck a bitch if her shit is not fat
And I'm cruisin' through my city, finna push the top back
And AMIRI on my waist, so I keep the strap back
You don't really want smoke
Still play the block, it ain't changed
I'm just tryna help the guys and maintain
How the fuck you tryna prove somethin' to me?
You ain't even at the top of your game 
How you got them niggas rockin' your chain?
22, the sound pop in your brain 
Last nigga tried to snake me dead
On God, I ain't finna play with no lame
Somethin' different 'bout the life I live
And the games we play
All the pain we done been through
Will I change? No way
Somethin' different 'bout the life I live
And the games we play 
All the pain we done been through
Will I change? No way 
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-no
No, no, no-noYoung Seven make it splash
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep , so I just pray and blow the pain away
I'm a young nigga straight from the bottom
Won't be long 'til I get to the top
Feel like half of my bros on the rock
This for Smelly and E, I ain't never gonna stop
I was juugin' and grindin' to get what I got
At this point in my life I done seen me a lot
If you slackin', I'm workin', I'm takin' your spot
All these VVS diamonds, I'm takin' your watch
I done been through so much, I ain't never tell cops
I'ma just work 'til I get me to drop
Step out of line, we gon' wait for a time
Bet you think you're so low, 'til you finna get popped
Talkin' on Smelly, you finna get dropped
All my lil' shooters keep Glizzy, they flock
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block 
I send the green, and they spinnin' your block

Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
Yeah, I miss the way that this shit used to be
Fucking famous hoes in California, this shit new to me 
They say that I changed since I got money
Well that's news to me
'Cause through all the bullshit that they threw
I still stayed true to me and that's truthfully
Through all the lies and the scrutiny
Through all the times that they used to be
Talkin' down on my name, now they wanna come around
But they ain't new to me
I used to think you was everything
Now you not even cool to me
I used to think you was everything
Yeah, that's how I used to be
And you can not say that I didn't try to make time but I guess time away
Got you in your brain, thinking about my mistakes
I don't got the time to waste 
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day 
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me 
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away
I'm smokin' dope, it's to the face, I'm finna fade away
Remember juugin' on that block, that shit was day to day 
Though we won't never leave them trenches, don't you play with me
Feelings running deep, so I just pray and blow the pain away

And I work so hard 'cause I need me a plaque 
Told my brother, "What you need? You can ask"
'Bout to feed you the facts, what I need is the racks
Swear I could've really got what I need in the trap
Once I figured I could rap, mind started goin' everywhere
They wanna put me in the ground and I'm well aware
Nina right hip on my side, we ain't never cared
Hit a nigga, now he dead
Throw his body in the bag, take a road trip to Delaware
Damn, damn, I'm the man
I'm not like them niggas that just do it for the 'Gram
I do it for my fans so I'm always goin' H.A.M.
Niggas judgin' me, but they don't even really understand
How it feel when you go through hard times 
Workin' every day, I don't do a part time 
I knew there was a light after every dark time 
Sittin' at the top, ask me, it's our time

Niggas, they be snitchin', they be talkin' to the feds
My mama told me, "Get it, boy, you better get this bread"
I'm tryna change, tryna chill, but I'm at the edge
I swear, I had a dream that a nigga can't forget
A lot of niggas funny, they be trendin' for the check
Y'all niggas know my bodies, better show me some respect
I walk around, move around, gotta keep a TEC
'Cause a couple niggas stressed and they wanna see me wet, no

All of this water so crazy as mine
You see they know  that, I'm gribbin' a nine
If you look for me I ain't hard to find
I'm in the field with it all of the time
I offer my help but you actually look out for yourself
Hope you know I don't want no one else
Hope you know I don't love no one else
Hope you know I don't trust no one else

You want a nigga to ride to the end
Shakin' that face, so you know when we're done

Tighten the cover and roll the blunt
My niggas so high, we gon' go on a hunt
Everythin' so I just know I'm up front
Baby don't know what to do for you
I understand that this lifestyle new to you
But it's new to me, so it's new to we
Never thought I'd see my face on TV
But baby you 'posed to decide
I ain't never goin' tell you no lies
All this shit I've been feeling inside
Way too deep, you can look in my eyes
I'ma still give all of me
Lifestyle now, like a nigga thought it would be
Every show we goin' pull up,see me slaughter it
Same energy until a nigga slaughter me
One time for the niggas that died on me
I know my big bro proud of me
The way I feel about you, that's wild of me
Fuck boy, I don't know how to be
Lil' momma she bad to the bone
I support what she do for her own
She ain't tryna hear nothin' she grown
Hit her once she won't leave me alone
Lil' momma she bad to the bone
I support what she do for her own
She ain't tryna hear nothin' she grown
Gotta focus I stayin' in my zoneEvery night, there's a murder in my city
Every time I think about it, that shit hit me
Streets no games, so I choose to keep it with me
Streets no games, guess I gotta keep it with me
Every night it's a murder in my city
Every time, think about it, that shit hit me
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzy
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzy
Nineteen, I seen some crazy shit, sanity, I'm chasing it
Going through so much that every blunt I see, I'm facing it
I was really patient with success, I had to wait for it
Now everybody's startin' to feel entitled, swear I hate this shit
To the top, I'm taking it, remember taking station flicks
Oh, hell no, I can't go back to that jail, but still, I hate to slip
All this just the basic shit, don't know who might relate to this
I don't open up, but I pour out while I'm makin' shit
Nigga think he takin' shit, he must just want his face to lift
If it weren't for rapping, I'd be fuckin' with that nasal sniff
Rap money good, know they'll kill me for a taste of it
I ain't stressin', Cookies out the pound, rollin' eighths of it
Every night, there's a murder in my city
Every time I think about it, that shit hit me
Streets no games, so I choose to keep it with me
Streets no games, guess I gotta keep it with me
Every night it's a murder in my city
Every time, think about it, that shit hit me
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzy
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzy
We done lost a couple niggas from that sandbox
I gotta watch the way I move 'cause that sand hot
I used to look up to them niggas in the streets
'Til them same niggas got down on both knees and took a plea
I'm gon' probably fuck around and make this song cry
I refuse to let these bitches see my soft side
Before you suck me off, you gotta let my balls dry
This casket big enough, so fuck it, y'all can all die
I know they hate me, it's crazy, I ain't do shit to niggas
Every day I walk around your hood ready to spit on niggas
I can't let these niggas take me out my element
We ain't go to school 'cause in the streets, we gain intelligence
You know I ain't scared to step to these niggas
I just hate it when you treat me like the rest of these niggas
As for the rest of these niggas, go get a vest for these niggas
We servin' head cracks, you don't want no bets with me, nigga
Every night, there's a murder in my city
Every time I think about it, that shit hit me
Streets no games, so I choose to keep it with me
Streets no games, guess I gotta keep it with me
Every night it's a murder in my city
Every time, think about it, that shit hit me
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzy
That be why a nigga gotta keep a glizzyThis world is so ice, this world is so cold 
This world is ice cold , this world is ice cold 
This world is so ice , world so cold 
World is ice cold , this world is ice cold 
I swear I got plenty niggas snagged, never comin' home
Demons in my head, I got too many niggas gone
Kids out here dyin', mama hurt, cryin'
I ain't even think I'd see eighteen and I ain't lyin'
Jails multiplyin', change shit, I'm tryin'
Murder rate just keep on goin' up, it's horrifyin'
Cops pointin' fingers, they be misidentifyin'
How could it change? Honestly don't think it's ever gon' change
Lookin' from my new perspective, I done realized some things
Them streets bad, streets wicked, streets bad, streets wicked
If the right shot hit you, that's a one-way ticket
Somethin' don't work a couple times, better fix it
I been to myself, I been just stackin' up my digits
All I could do is preach and I hope you niggas listen
So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn, no givin' up
Hopefully one day your life see a turn
I been to Hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain, tired of this pain
Tryna balance imperfections in my life and do some good one
Never knew my father, mama told me I'm a hood son
I done been through lot of rough times, it was hard
That's just one of the reasons I'ma take it so far
So much shit that I hold back, memories, cold facts
They just took my nigga, he got caught up with no strap
It's just been so whack, I just want bro back
I swear to God, we livin' in a cold, cold world
Boogie to the face to calm my feelings, I'm a stoner
Can't go to them trenches, it be hot like Arizona
JT my aroma, city got Corona
Sad to say I know like just two niggas with diplomas
First time gettin' sentenced, I was thirteen
First time ever gettin' knocked, I was twelve
When I came home, young nigga, I was fourteen
Went back two more years, oh well 
'Member when they kicked me out of school, got expelled
They said that I wouldn't be shit, I knew only time would tell
Now a nigga goin' up, up, up
I know them higher powers lookin' over, that's for sure
So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn, no givin' up
Hopefully one day your life see a turn
I been to Hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain, tired of this pain
So I like to spread the love
I feel your pain, you just wait your turn, no givin' up
Hopefully one day your life see a turn
I been to Hell and back a few times
Know what it is, get back, I don't mind
Tired of this pain, tired of this painI know

Swear I remember those times, block selling dimes, promise we all gon’ be fine
I got too much on my mind, bullets start flyin’, sharpen and somebody dyin’
I know, there’s a lot to be grateful for
Can’t list all the things that I’m thankful for
Could be somewhere in a cell, somewhere in the ground, but life's goin’ good and I’m takin' off
On the road, doing shows, finna take a tour
Niggas mad, in they bag ‘cause i’m making more
Flexed up, can’t fuck with no basic hoe
Huh, lil bitch give me face and jaw
You stupid niggas is mad at me
Yeah I slipped, but nobody had accuracy
Vice versa woulda been a catastrophe
Vice versa woulda been a catastrophe

Bodies droppin’ all the time where the opps go
I know, I know i’m finna’ be the man
Big S on my chest, call me Superman
Niggas like “damn,” holdin’ out they hand
I was in the can whole time thinking of a band
Gotta stay 10 toes on my pivot
Never gon’ preach, nigga, something I ain’t livin'
Rats are forbidden, they could never be forgiven
Sent my hitters on a mission, to assure that you ain’t livin' now
Give me that chain
Take the profit and stuff it inside of my mains
Who’d of ever think that everything changed?
And I really wish that nigga treat me the same

I sent my prayers up to father God
Trying to make up for them nights we use to jug and rob
I was broke on the block i ain't have a job
Ain't no way to get no money so i had to rob
I just pray my nigga Smelly sitting up with god
We ain't mean to do the shit, we did, but life is hard
Wish i couldve killed that nigga first and took the charge
And it hurt knowing my big brother in the stars
He supposed to be with me inside this double R
Sometimes feel like all the struggle made us who we are
Gotta bust , durkio , just tell me take it far
You can find me in them trenches and exotic cars
Denny in my system got me touching mars
I be smoking on a pack but i dont fuck with bar
Free Mini, bro was always down to take a charge
Fucking bitches on the daily we was living large
I need 10 for a feature i ain't finna barge
If i want a nigga chain we gon’ make it ours
I dun really put in pain and i got the scars
Smelly block eazy gang , not to say the part
A lot of niggas finna hate cuz of who we are
While it’s loaded, I’m stain so I’m moving smart
Better stay up in your lane you dont play a part
This year we ain't playing see me on the chart
Sippin moving fast looking at the past
Who the ever thought i get my music off the grass
Who the ever thought i make it here from skippin class
Back end got me feeling good tell them give me pack
Niggas playing games like its tic and tac
I tell my hitters put in pain while i go relax
Smelly died thats the gang put it on the map
Told my brother he need anything know i got his back
Know the streets cold so i got a strap
A nigga moving too bold then i gotta clap
Hurd you got a 22 well i got a mack
I ain't really ready for the fame but I must adapt
Niggas chattin on my name let me know the facts
No cap , we ain’t playing , this shit more than rap
Put the moves on your ass, than we grip a tac
Word , only takes a couple bands , just to get you wack
I ain’t want a label
I ain’t want a label
They give me a felon
I ain’t want a labelIceberg want a bag, bitch
I got some real goons doing time
I know a real nigga finna' sign
I know some big boss, gettin' big bag
'cause a real source don't decline

You know the jewels dance when it shine
They hate to see a young nigga flex
I had to move right when the time
I know some real goons doing time
I know some real niggas 'bout to sign
I know some big boss, getting big check
'cause a real source don't decline
I got a big piece on my neck
You know the jewels dance when it shine
They hate to see a young nigga flex
I had to move right when the time
I had to boss up and get in my mansion
Too old to be taking them chances
Wasn't settling being a broke boy
All this drip in my body, expenses
Swear I really came up from the trenches
I remember us hopping them fences
I remember the day I got sentenced
I remember some shit I can't mention
Always knew I won when I was destined
Popped out new designer I'm dressed in
TYB on yo' shorty she sextin'
Throw a hundred inside, I'm investing
Getting money in something Im best in
Don't compare to other contestants
Commissary Im sending through West Ends
SB niggas know what I'm repping
No.. no
Smelly Drive on chain
These streets no games
Fuck all this fame
I got trauma inside of my brain
Getting this money I gotta maintain
Don't you run up on me I got aim
R.I.P right in front your main
We ain't really with playing them games
I've been waiting a long, long time
That's the reason I'm on my grind
Couple niggas tried to block my shine
Work hard, then I got what's mine
I've been waiting for a long, long time
Now stars tryna call my line
Flexed up with the fixed up and the fake love we gon' all be fine
I got some real goons doing time
I know a real nigga finna' sign
I know some big boss, gettin' big bag

Had a 100k right in my hands
17 bitch I know I'm the man
I'm chasing this money, you don't understand
I was down on my ass, had to bust a lick
Someone go tell the haters to suck a dick
Bitches all on my body, I'm loving it
If I fuck her one time then I'm dubbing it
Heard niggas really coming for my neck
I heard they second guessing who the best
Heard niggas really out tryna flex
I heard what you got and I wasn't impress
I'm just a hungry nigga from the X
You just a dummy nigga, making less
Niggas gon' hate to see a nigga winning
They watching my body, I keep me a tech
Bitch in the kitchen whipping like a chef
I done got tunnel vision, it's the best
Ima' just keep on working and progress
Ima' just keep on jugging and finesse
I don't know why these niggas just hate on me
You don't think it's my time just wait on it

Finna hop in the booth and go stupid
I'm just smokin', ain't sippin' no drank
If you run up, I'm empty the full clip
Headshot, I don't care what you think
I don't play no games when it comes to this
17 years old and I'm running shit
Outside with a chopper, I was on my drummin' shit
Spinnin' through the opps, they was always on the running shit, no
And it's back to the bag
In the stu', cooking up like a lab
And this Gucci the buckle, I'm sag
See me spinnin' around to the cash
I done threw 100K in the stash
Boys pull me over, I'm doing the dash

Everyday I walk with it, that's why I can't leave the crib without it
The day I ever get caught slippin', boy, I doubt it
But, damn you never know, you never know, nigga 
You never know when it's your time to go, nigga
I know I ain't satisfied with this, I'm tryna go bigger
I ain't lettin' nothin' in my way, I've been a go-getter
I can't even get this through my mind, how you go, nigga? 
I always told you I just wanna see you glow, nigga
Rest my nigga Pop Smoke, know I'm lettin' shots go
At any nigga, fuck it, I inherited the opps though
Know I'm finna make it to the tippy-tippy top, bro, for you
I know that's all you wanna see me do
Can't believe this shit, can't believe this shit is true
Took you out your glory, who would've wanted to see you lose?
Woke up in the mornin', seen my nigga on the news
And I'm still like "Damn," tryna put together screws
Takin' deep breaths, recordin' this, I'm bustin' out in deep sweats
Mind froze, like I don't even got a reflex
Said a lot, but still it feel like I ain't even speak yet
Tryna hit a pocket that I still ain't even reach yet
But I still can't comprehend this shit, it hit me in the heart
Hungry young niggas, man, I seen it from the start
Put a .35 on my wood to try to shift my mind apart
It's different now, I know I always gotta move smart
Can't change nothin', we gon' let your name ring
A lot of niggas they won't feel us, they don't gangbang
I know how it feel to leave them trenches, did the same thing
Just tryna provide for mama, love her, help her maintain
Can't change nothin', we gon' let your name ring
A lot of niggas they won't feel this, they don't gangbang
I know how it feel to leave them trenches, did the same thing
Just tryna provide for mama, love her, help her maintain
Maintain, tryna help her maintain
I'ma say, give like a message to my young niggas, you feel me
Like niggas like us, coming where we come from
We can't afford to fuck up
We can't afford to slip up, make no mistakes, you heard?
'Cause, they watchin', and they, they want us to
You know what I'm sayin'?
We got all odds against us Baby need shoes, mama need a house, goin' through racks again
Baby mama bitchin' 'bout another bitch and I got 'em racks again
Caught me down when I was slippin', but I promise I'll never lack again
My shooter trigger finger itchy, nigga, might just hit you on accident
Reload the strap again, we comin' back again
You double-crossed on a nigga, we hit him and it ain't by accident
Throwin' new racks again, blowin' through stacks again
Hella new plaques again, spittin' these facts again
Sippin' the dirtiest, baby
The shipment come, we get the earliest, baby
I'ma spend it, I'm courteous, baby
The first to the fuckin' thirtieth, baby
It ain't a place a nigga can't go
One Umbrella, that's the fuckin' gang though
Had to imprint it on a chain though
Switchin' different whips like I'm lil' Django
I done came up from the sidewalk
Now I rap, nigga used to slang dope
From the fistfights to the shootouts
In the parking lot and now it's bankroll
Was a broke nigga, now I came up
I don't do this shit to entertain ya
Can't believe I even got this famous
Yesterday, I was grippin' on a stainless
I was sellin' dope from out the Popeyes
I was whippin' corner counter-clockwise
Tryna get the Porsche with the frog eyes
Sellin' dope, a nigga should be top five
Got extended clip inside a Glock 9
It was never times I forgot mine
If a nigga trippin', turn to Columbine
Shootin' anybody that his shots find
Niggas say that they deserve my position
But them pussy niggas, they did not grind
If we talkin' 'bout shit that separates me and you, nigga, it's a long line
I done came through, Bentayga Bentley
Never thought that I'd be seein' this when I was young and I was playin' Sega Genesis
Pancake seats made at Denny's, that's real nigga shit
We don't pay a bitch nigga debt
Bet your life on the line 'cause we don't make lil' nigga bets, nah
Look at all this dope, it ain't by accident
Bitch nigga, I'm froze, it ain't on accident
She gon' give me that throat, it ain't on accident
Fuck nigga, just know

Backin' that back again , done fucked up my stacks again 
Nigga get clapped again, it ain't on accident
Shitted on 'em, so I know they mad
Copped my freezer from AZ in Rollie bag
Grippied up, we don't care where the police at
And we scorin', fuckboy, where your homies at?
Niggas know us, we 'bout it, we love to drill
Some my youngins be on that, they love the field
We pull up, we blastin' this shit for real
Mama said, "It's for nothin', you need to chill"
I'm goin' off, still on that gang shit
But I told you ain't lane switch
I catch a lick, it ain't really 'bout shit
We gon' spin off the strip and just change whips
Ain't no security with me, we totin' like fifty, that's life if the gang slip
But fuck it, we live how we live and I know what I did, plus it's too late to change shit
Ain't no fightin', that Glock rearrange shit
If you tryna meet death, I'll arrange it
In a foreign, I pick up your main bitch
She was suckin' my dick and I came quick
I ain't even gon' talk on the opp side
Y'all could say what y'all want, but do not slide
Caught him slippin', he ran into Popeyes
Everybody all tough 'til them shots fly, gang
Look at all this dope, it ain't by accident
Bitch nigga, I'm froze, it ain't on accident
She gon' give me that throat, it ain't on accident
Fuck nigga, just know

Backin' that back again, done fucked up my stacks again
Nigga get clapped again, it ain't on accidentCashMoneyAP

I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be
And I know, I know, I know
I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be
And I know, I know, I know
You told me you was gon' hold it down
All this time you hoed around
Ain't no point explaining, I ain't capping, girl, it's over now
This is from my heart, my soul
I just had to let you know
You fucked up something good, you couldn't be with me on the road
When I told you I'm gon' ride for you
I ain't even lie to you
So I'ma do what I'ma do
And you move on if possible
Figure that ain't optional, chasing after dreams now
It ain't nothing stopping you, go ahead and leave now
I can't slack, I'm back on my grind
But last week I was losing my mind
Never intended on doing you sly
And it's gon' hurt when I leave you behind
I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be
And I know, I know, I know
I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be
And I know, I know, I know
You said that I fucked around
I feel like you let me down
You don't even know who got me tripping with that run around
This is from my heart, my soul
Yeah I'm done with all that love shit
I've seen the red flags, I no longer ignore it
Telling more lies again, talking 'bout you sorry and
You gon' have me scuffling, silly-ass bitches be troubling
You fool me once, I get you twice back, look who's laughing
You gon' be mad when I get tight and get to clapping
I know you busy and back on your grind
But, see, it's slow for you wasting my time
I keep it pushing and going, get mine
Just in, believe that I'm gonna be fine
I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be
And I know, I know, I know
I still can't even go to sleep, you still can't get over me
I thought you was real, how you fuck someone so close to me
Messed me up emotionally, this ain't how it's 'posed to be

It be niggas like me who kept the rest mad
Gotta big bag, keep a big strap
That .357 gotta kick back
And I know these niggas wanna take my life
Codeine got it all in my Sprite
I ain’t never been afraid of the light
Too many bands, I done lost too many friends, right when I got me a chance
Too many fans, I done got too many fans, in less in a year with a plan
It’s the beginnin', far from the end, hollow inside the whole grip with extend
I was in poverty, now I could land
When I got sneakers for all of my mans
We been through way more than y'all understand
Spin through the opps, every chip niggas ran
Now they lurking, always watching my 'gram
Dippy bop 'em like you know how to dance
Ball fire and my flow is advance
Repetition, niggas know who I am
Can’t believe I’m really labeled “the goat“
Can’t believe I seen 100 G's the age of 17
I feel like renting a boat
Backwards always paid bein' told
Two grams on the block when I smoke
I was fighting for my life on the O
We been through pain together
Can’t switch been the same forever
We been through pain together
Can’t switch been the same forever
Too many bands, I done lost too many friends, right when I got me a chance

And I know these niggas wanna take my life
Codeine got it all in my Sprite
I ain’t never been afraid of the light
I was trappin' from the day to the night
I remember I was going to war
.50 camping in the front of your door
Gotta keep it just to walk to the store
Money coming, I don’t struggle no more
Busy calling about my buckles and draws
Remember nights when I was praying to score
We never gave a fuck about the law
We never gave a fuck about the law
Trendsetter, come and hop on the wave
Niggas wanna see the kid in the grave
Fuck it I might have to foreign a state
Fuck it I might have to fool for the day
I ain’t settling for minimum wage
How he did it, they be looking amazed
Y'all would never know the problems I faced
13, I was fighting a case
Tay-K did the race on the boys
Clout chasers got me feeling annoyed
Fire bitches started feelin' your boy
Bad vibes I'ma weave 'em like Floyd
Bad vibes be hard to avoid
Bad vibes be hard to avoid
Too many bands, I done lost too many friends, right when I got me a chance

Real nigga, I could show you how I live
And you can't tell me nothin', I'm a billion dollar kid
And I ain't like them niggas that be runnin' out the jeans
He was talking so we slid and karma is just a bitch
Last nigga told how he got hit now

These niggas hatin' 'cause I went and got a legal bag
Still frontin' what the fuck I would have gave you that
You said I asked you to make a flip so you can pay me back
Chump change whole lot you can pay me back
Fake love finna turn me to a maniac
You see what they do, I ain't bout that, have a rain attack
Thinkin' 'bout a wap, imagine all the shit that I forgot
And this for every nigga that ain't think that I will pop
I told my nigga Smelly that I'll make it to the top

It’s rules to these streets niggas must respect
Niggas talkin', they be lyin' to you, flexin’, I'm fuckin' vexed
I touched down in a new jet
I got some diamonds on my body, reason why these niggas upset
I got some money I ain't touch yet
I got some bitches with a nice lil body I ain't fucked yet
I got some bitches in my crib
And that's my bad, I was slackin', they should find out where I live
'Cause I’m somebody, nigga’s nobody
These niggas, they be talkin' ’bout me, they don't know 'bout me
I keep the pole on me, I can't slip, run up on him, he gon’ dip
I got the four fifth, we gon' spin right up in that whip
We go spinnin' through the third, we gon' spin up on your side
Everybody, Smelly drive, call my brothers, they gon' ride

Ain't nobody gon' survive when I pull up with the nine
I ain't playin' games, bullets comin' right for your spine
Bullets right for your eye, I'm just hopin' that you die
I just want to see you dead, we don't need the opps to lie
See his momma cry, homicide, bottom line, spittin' off the top
Used to serve up on the block, I'm servin' knocks
I remember in the kitchen, we was tryin' to whip the pan
Niggas talkin' 'bout me, they don't even know 'bout who I am
Now niggas upset, I gotta went and get this bag, I ain't up yet
I was early mornin' on my grind tryin' to get these dollars
These niggas talkin', I ain't never been a fuckin' scholar
And I been in school, go to math, go to class, gotta get these bags
Niggas they be talkin', you was broke, then we gon' cut your ass
Cuttin' class, I was in the hallways and the staircase
These niggas, they be talkin', I'ma show you I ain't fairway
I'ma shoot you in your face, shit I'm gon' shoot you in your eye
I'ma shoot you in your tooth, I'ma shoot in your neck
Niggas talkin', I might have to go and shoot you in your vest
If you run up on me now then I'ma shoot you up in Flex
I ain't playin' games, I ain't sayin' names, I ain't tuckin' chains
 totin' big things
I ain't playin' games, when we ride niggas gon' hide
I said niggas gon' hide, hot nine
And now spittin' right off the top
Remember when I was spittin' right up on the block
I said I had to light some candle for my nigga Smelly
You run up on me, got some shots right for your belly(Fuck niggas, I don't trust niggas
If you bust triggers and you tell, you a fuck nigga)
If you tell, you a fuck nigga

Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much
Why the fuck these niggas looking at my chain so much?
They just mad 'cause I departed from the game so much
One false move and the gang gon' bust
Cartier glasses, 20/20, got a clear view
You a man, I don't fear you
Act up, we gon' mask up, boy, I dare you
Brody catch a body, I'ma leave you in the rearview
Could have did it to me, lil' nigga, you were scared to
You a bluff and you not who you appear to
You'd be starstruck if you see a nigga near you
And your bitch wanna fuck, I don't care to
Careful, if I say links, plan's canceled
I can have your shorty in my bed doing dance moves
Fuck that, let's get right back to the real shit
In the field shit, niggas really used to drill shit
Mama stressed out, whole lot she gotta deal with
Swear every real nigga gon' feel this
Smokin' on drugs 'cause there's too much to deal with

Young and I'm rich, all they see is this drip 
They don't know about them stabbings 
And I've made mum cry, I can see it in her eyes
Still remember all them courts that you sat in 
And she told me that the road's not nice 
Snitched on his friend and they both got life 
You ain't ever had to bang up 'til morning 
Yawning, exercise yard in your Jordans
Now they're saying that I changed but it ain't me 
Is it 'cause I put thousands on the AP? 
VV's and my t-shirt's brazy
And I got peng tings tryna have my baby
Save me, DigDat, can't let her claim me 
Jump out Lambo, that ain't no Mercedes 
If I ever broke her heart, bet she hate me 
Grrr, pow, I'ma skip town, see my wrist drown
Everybody wanna fuck with me for benefits now
Man, I wish my nigga Smelly could've seen me lit now
Sit down, maybe roll up, blow a spliff down
Time go by, niggas change so much

Woah-h-h
My mama told me don't you let up on your gift
Watch the people close and never really know who finna switch
Want the whole world, I just can't be satisfied with this
It's a cold world, they just out here waiting for me to slip
My mind focused, I just tryna get the bag
Ain't tryna be like other niggas, missing what they had
They addicted to the studio and I'm writing songs in class
With the hunger in my body, got me drippin' like a bag
These niggas hatin', I just look at them and laugh
I was fucked up, they were broke and on my ass
Only 15, mama seein' the shootin' on the grass
Only 16, rock down, juvin' I was trash
Got the big dreams, we been came a long way from the ave
I remember havin' nothing, so i'm careful when I brag
I'm stuck up in my moment, now there ain't no going back
So you know I'm going fast, like 200 on the dash, na
My mama told me don't you let up on your gift
Watch the people close and never really know who finna switch
Want the whole world, I just can't be satisfied with this
It's a cold world, they just out waiting for me to slip
My mama told me don't you let up on your gift
Watch the people close and never really know who finna switch
Want the whole world, I just can't be satisfied with this
It's a cold world, they just out here waiting for me to slip
Ye, the streets got me traumatized, I cannot be satisfied
My homie got smokers but the killers weren't identified
Locked down up in prison, I was sentenced, it got minimized
I bet he got set but he did as a juvenile
Big dreams, always seekin' gettin' my mama out the side block
Struggled paying rent, 6 kids, hard to provide for
Daddy was in jail, nobody cared 'bout my grandma
My mama told me don't you let up on your gift
Watch the people close and never really know who finna switch
Want the whole world, I just can't be satisfied with this
It's a cold world, they just out waiting for me to slipFor me
Baby, you ain’t got no good for me
Yeah, yeah, yeah
That boy Cash
Slow down
Try to get to know me, maybe put your phone down
Once we build a bond, I could give you four rounds
Like slow down 
Baby, slow down 
Like slow down 
Yeah, you pulled up on me like you know me, I was by my dolie
Asked me for a picture, checked my Rollie and said "Okey dokey"
That fan love, I decide to give my fan hug
She said she gon' post it when I really get my bands up
Name Miranda, with the body of a dancer
She was smoking hot, but not the type to give you cancer
Besides that, her shit fat with a six pack
Yeah, she threw it at me ‘fore we even got to chit chat
Like ooh, girl, you might as well forget that
Said she got a man, I’m thinking he could have his bitch back
Future looking bright, and I ain’t even bout to risk that
Shorty, you a dime, so fine, learn to take your time
Throwing it so fast, this potential going in the trash
I ain’t even act, that shit make me wanna do the dash
I need a bitch to hold the grip when shit get lit
The type that I ain’t got to worry when she kiss me on my lips
Slow down
Try to get to know me, maybe put your phone down
Once we build a bond, I could give you four rounds
Like slow down 
Baby, slow down 
Like slow down 
Yeah, I mean its crazy ‘cause I never tried to play you
You ain’t never fall through, I was only tryna save you
And this 1942 got me stuck up in my ways
Had dreams and nightmares like we back up in the days
Figured you would hold it down, I was bound to beat the case
Bitch, you tryna sneak diss, I should punch you in your face
Made me call another bitch and tell her put you in your place
‘Member everything was fine, ‘member everything was great
And I peeped it in your eyes, you resembling a snake
How you yanked another nigga ‘cause he said he got a eighth
You ain’t wanna keep it real, you ain’t figure it was safe
I just rap about my pain ‘cause I know others could relate

Baby, tell me how you’d feel if they took me away
Would you be here by my side if I was fighting a case?
Whole gang locked down doing time in the state
Gave my father 85 years in front of my face
And the real shit is hard to deal with
I lost my nigga Smelly, now I’m finna drill shit
And I can’t even talk about that in the field shit
Just some young, wild niggas, and we really kill shit
Couldn’t wait ‘til I got signed, move my mom outta the hill
Judges gave me all that time, swear I’m never gon’ squeal
If you run up on my squad, swear this shit it get real
Head tap, bullets flying, someone bound to get killed
And the real shit is hard to deal with
I lost my nigga Smelly, now I’m finna drill shit
And I can’t even talk about that in the field shit
Just some young, wild niggas, and we really kill shit
Yeah, parking lot, pick a spot, I don’t gotta talk a lot
We bendin’ blocks, sendin’ shots, happy when we see an opp
Kinda hot so I be spittin’ facts, but then, I’m kinda not
You flexin’ like you up, but in reality, you kinda ppop
I got the drop, some fucking thot had toe over you, open shot
I whip the water send your order, Kema let that glizzy pop
Them bodies drop, I showed my condolences ‘cause I’m scared of cops
They saying names, breakin’ code
Swear this shit will never change
Headshot, call it accidental, I say perfect aim
Niggas I grew up with hate to see me doing better things
Y’all was trappin’, I was rappin’, fuck it, we took separate lanes
Arguments, but when I say I love you, I still feel the same
Baby, tell me how you’d feel if they took me away
Would you be here by my side if I was fighting a case?

Thirty clips and this bitch gon' spray
Me and my niggas ain't play, no, no, no, no
Thomas  got to his 
Better go take a vaycay
Buggati, uh, Lamb' truck
On the freeway, I switch lanes
Rock this Gucci, oh my God
Overseas, I'm out in Spain
Came from Drivin' down in Paris
Now I'm ridin' in the railway
I came a long way
I was playin' with them kind of friends
In and out of stores, hit the ivy
He like "What is that?"
I ain't had nowhere to go
I applied, no sustains and shit
All of my niggas on go
Get Milwaukee, drive us through your shred
Ridin' 'round 'round the city, in this brand new whip
Rollin' through my city and that Wraith, I see the stars
I got way too much money, don't know what to spend it on
If we ain't gettin' no money, nigga, we can't get along
Smoke dope, now my mind too gone
I got way too much money that niggas try to run up on me, I'ma make one call

Run up on me nigga, that's a body
Headshot, ain't no shame at all
Murder, we ain't playin' at all
I lost so much, I ain't given up
First move and game can't to be stopLil Tjay
Oh, oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Can't change, I remember what I've been through
So when I spit, no need for pencils
Traumatized, shit be fuckin' with my mental
Done seen some shit I can't get into
I'm just tryna be somebody influential
A lot of souls I could vent to
My success is not something coincidental
And if you feel like I'm shittin', it's accidental
I was locked down, locked down, almost lost it
Brodie locked down, told him, "Fight, don't you forfeit"
Sometimes we just do some stupid shit when we be off it
I done see too many niggas die, so I'm precautious
Thinkin' 'bout them flashbacks really get me nauseous
That's just what this comes with, playin' with them bosses
Could've caught a hammer charge the other day, I tossed it
Worry 'bout my freedom every day, got me exhausted
I gave niggas trust, real love, and they crossed it
Tried to keep you around, I brushed it off, it's like I forced it
Mad that you can't be me, I be drippin' different sauces
Glad I started winning, tired of takin' all these losses, losses
Losses, losses
All these goddamn losses
Tired of takin' all these goddamn losses
Can't change, I remember what I've been through
So when I spit, no need for pencils
Traumatized, shit be fuckin' with my mental
Done seen some shit I can't get into
I'm just tryna be somebody influential
A lot of souls I could vent to
My success is not something coincidental
And if you feel like I'm shittin', it's accidental
Big glow, lookin' back, I came a long way
I still be reminiscing moments from my dog days
That's why I stay away from niggas and they slug ways
I can't handle bad vibes, they exhaust me
Lotta niggas in they Birkin, they be salty
Niggas heavy on my body, get 'em off me
New ice, see it's shinin', it's flossy
'Bout to cop a new whip, mine and it's costly
Had a dream to make it out, it wasn't simple 
Niggas don't know what I went through 
Self-taught, had to learn the fundamentals 
I ain't tryna be resentful 
I was layin' lowkey, but I meant to
'Cause everybody so judgmental
If you want it, run and get it, fuck a gentle 
Let the hunger deep inside represent you
Can't change, I remember what I've been through 
So when I spit, no need for pencils
Traumatized, shit be fuckin' with my mental 
Done seen some shit I can't get into
I'm just tryna be somebody influential
A lot of souls I could vent to
My success is not something coincidental
And if you feel like I'm shittin', it's accidental
I was locked down, locked down, almost lost it
Brodie locked down, told him, "Fight, don't you forfeit"

That's just what this comes with, playin' with them bosses
Could've caught a hammer charge the other day, I tossed it
Worry 'bout my freedom every day, got me exhausted
Losses
Tired of takin' all these goddamn lossesPipe that shit up TNT
D. Major, baby
Told 'em I'm the greatest, won't be long until its proven
Life been rough from the start, tired of losin'
They slept on me, but they ain't peep how I was movin'
Now I'm headed to the top, steady groovin'
All this fake love, so confusing
Still on gang, bitch, no conclusion
My heart been hurt, now how my gang cut away
True to my brothers, rep that gang everyday
I was stressin' in that cell, I remember when they locked me up
Gripped up no pocket bluff, just tryna get my pockets up
Tryna flip my new pack, on the block they nice, they coppin' up
Careful in that field, ain't no tellin' when they poppin' up
Glock told me whole lots of stuff
Know my chain, know my watch is tucked
My Glock is tucked, move like you a threat bet broski popped you up
I know he would, everybody ridin', so, I know we good
Trencherous, we stay to ourselves, we a lonely hood
Deady off the Zaza, O' full of GG
I be smokin' new gas, careful, that's a PD
Everything for easy, all the money speedy
Bags comin' in, I send 'em out, 'cause I ain't greedy
If we ain't talkin' money, then I'm blinder than Stevie
The checks comin' in, I'm settled for good
Mind fucked, really trencherous and misunderstood
Shit ain't been goin' too different then I pictured it would
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I say "Speak it to the youth" 'cause I grew up just like them
Hope these lyrics could be the helping hand I extend
That's why I don't really flex a lot, or talk 'bout what I spend
Humble nigga, I'm a trench kid, never gon' pretend
From the bottom, so we kept a pole, rose it to defend
I was stuck, really locked up, I'll do that again
For the guys, hurt my soul that day I see my mama cry
I was locked up in that prison, D.A. tryna give me five
Know them feelings when your eyes hurt, you don't wanna cry
Stressin 'cause my brother dead and I ain't tell him bye
Ma' said "Tjay, you a superstar", still hard to accept
Still in tune with them trenches, that shit'll have a nigga stressed
Steady chasin' them checks, I just earn and invest
'Stead of watchin' another man wait your turn and progress
I don't know, I'm just different, but you ain't gotta listen
I'm on the road to riches and I don't see competition it's understood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstood
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so, I'm so misunderstoodYeah, yeah, yeah

My new year's resolution: I'm finna change some things
I'm gon' continue going hard until I change the game
Look in my eyes and see the hunger, nigga, I ain't playin'
So much inside, can't hide my pride, my nigga, I'm just sayin'
I don't feel safe because too many know where I be layin'
I'm 'bout to stack up all my bread and just start hibernatin'
I keep the strap, almost got clacked at least like five occasions
Know for a fact if I get whacked my momma gon' cry her face in
I can't let them do this shit, can't put momma through this shit
Bodies drop, I'm used to it, bodies drop, I'm used to this
I'ma go get my momma a house, after that I'ma get a new car
Can't believe that I'm makin' it out, momma mentioned I'm gonna go too far
And I still be the man on TV
Younger kids lookin' up, tryna be me
Lil TJay, that's me, I'm the man, why they hatin'? I don't understand
Had to hop my bag
In the stu everyday 'cause I want this shit bad
Need a feature, double digits of tax
Talkin' lower than you smokin' on crack
I can just show you the facts
Bro in the trap, he done made so many racks
Fuck it, I'm pourin' the Act, tourin' the map, swear there ain't no goin' back
Bro told me this is my time, blowin' my mind, promise we all gon' be fine
No I can't slack on my grind
Remember them times when I was out flippin' a dime?
And I still be the man on TV
Younger kids lookin' up, tryna be me
Lil TJay, that's me, I'm the man, why they hatin'? I don't understand
Had to hop my bag
In the stu everyday 'cause I want this shit bad
Need a feature, double digits of tax

Accuracy, I Be Shootin' Like I'm JordanOnly nineteen, I'm experiencin' life
Momma said she proud 'cause my future lookin' bright
And I done took my chances, I ain't talkin' 'bout no dice
I know I'm on probation but I'm still gon' keep this pipe
Niggas watchin' ice
Every nigga you see with me down to take a life
I earned my stripes, so wear respect that I got sentenced twice
I'm on my way to the top now
Fuck the other side, we don't care 'bout opps now
I done made it here, I be dumb if I stop now
Haters on my body, fuck it, look at how I pop now
'Bout to cop a new whip just so I can flex
Hunnids on me plus I got some diamonds on my neck
AP on my wrist, but I stil get a new patek
Life's goin' good, homie, look at how I'm dressed

I ain't gon' lie, it took some time to get my bands up
It was me and bro, came a long way from the sandbox
Always taught to talk, competition helped us man up
We was down below, now we walkin' with our heads up
And I know for sure, bro will always have my back
And for any situation, bro will always be down to clap
Take the pain from off my mental and lay it down on the track
We done came a long way, and there ain't no goin' back
Don't try to front I'm with the gang
You run up on me, choppa bang
I shared some times, and washed his name
And he won’t ever be the same
Every time you see me, I got change
Plus my shooter he got aim
Loaded pistols they got range
I been official, and I ain’t change
Still the same, still the same, still the same
Do after clues, no, I won't switch up on my gang
I forever ride the silent, with my brothers from the grain
I swear I get on my own, but they blur right in my veins
I know, I know, I know, the streets no good
I know, these niggas hatin’ but I'm still in my hood
I know, I know, I know, the streets no good
Pistol with me, try to get me boy, I wish a nigga would

Yo' bitch, she wanna suck the cock

I was posted on the block, every other fuckin’ day
And if a nigga run up on me, then he gettin' slayed
Got the choppa with the .223, up ina hit yo' face
I begun no aim, when the shit they ricochet
I be makin' money, now these niggas throwin' shade
I been catchin' stains, and I did it for the gang
Sippin' hard Wok, 'cause I been through lotta pain
Might be goin' insane, catch you loafin' take you chain
Catch a nigga let it bang, I got trauma in my brain
Ion think you understand me, on the inside we ain't the same
Catch a nigga, then we got him, we gon' do our thing
Chain up on my body, now I feel like a nemon
And I been in the field, yeah, you know my heart freezin'
Jade I was cryin',  he was bleedin'
They don't understand, yeah, I'm out here with the demons
Catch a nigga loafin', then we gotta pop him
Know I'm with the goblins and we ain't have a dollar
We catch 'em, we gon' rob 'em
No it ain't no problem, with 357 gotta toat that same revolver
I'm finally up
Now I came up off the block

Don't you fuck around cause my nina stay horny
Glizzy by my side, gotta keep that thing me
Nina down to ride, they gon never change on me
Brodie in the foreign see him switchin' lanes on me
Don't you fuck around cause my nina stay horny
Parking lot, pick a spot, I don’t gotta talk a lot
We bendin’ blocks, sendin’ shots, happy when we see an opp
It's kinda hot so I be spittin’ facts, but then, I’m kinda not
You flexin’ like you up, but in reality, I kinda pop
I got the drop, some fucking thot had told me when you opеnshop
I whip the water, send your ordеr, Kema let that glizzy pop
Them bodies drop, I showed my condolences ‘cause I’m scared of cops
They saying names, ringing calls, swear this shit won't ever change
I'm 17, putting in that pain I'm finna change the game
They know my name, Lil Tjay quick to let that glizzy bang
Call the gang, any situation we gon' do our thing
He took my chain, now they sayin' RIP before his name
Headshot, call it accidental I say perfect aim
Niggas I grew up with hate to see me doing better things
Y'all was trappin', I was rappin'
Fuck it, we took separate lanes
Arguments but when I say I love you I still feel the same
Niggas they be goofy when they hear this, they don't feel the pain
Niggas talk on Smelly when I see that is all a stain
Glizzy by my side, gotta keep that thing me
Nina down to ride, they gon never change on me
Brodie in the foreign see him switchin' lanes on me
Don't you fuck around cause my nina stay horny
Glizzy by my side, gotta keep that thing me
Nina down to ride, they gon never change on me
Brodie in the foreign see him switchin' lanes on me
Don't you fuck around cause my nina stay horny

Love in the air, let it blow in the wind 
Lil' nigga, you a joke, I be whippin' a foreign 
Why you so mad? My bad 
Ooh, didn't mean to make you sad 
I wish I could take you back 
Don't you switch for a few racks
Gave you shit you never had
Now you angry, all the hatin' do not faze me
All the money on the daily
Pull up on you in a new Jag', and it's too fast
And I know I got your boo mad, he'll do bad
I be counting' all this new cash, but you knew that
I could put you in a new bag and the shoes match 
It's so sad, oops, my bad
Started gettin' money and these niggas so mad
It's so sad, oops, my bad 
Started gettin' money and these niggas so mad

And I was puttin' in the work like I was on the clock, let 'em watch
'Cause I ain't even 'boutta talk a lot

Ayo, bros, it's time
It's time, bros 
Straight out the hot dungeons of rap
The joystick drops deep as does my rat
I never chat, 'cause to chat is the accountant of cat
Beyond the walls of chaps, life is defined
I think of rappers when I'm in a dick state of mind
Hope the bat got some caveat
My cat don't like no dirty at
Run up to the hat and get the mat
In a dick state of mind
What more could you ask for? The quiet joystick?
You complain about the heat
I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the sic
I'm rappin' to the banana
And I'm gonna move your santa
Bright, crazy, smooth, like a handbag
Boy, I tеll you, I thought you were a rag
I can't take thе the heat, can't take the snail
I woulda tried to skip I guess I got no entail
I'm rappin' to the santa
And I'm gonna move your banana
Yea, yaz, in a dick state of mind
When I was young my accountant had a trick
I waz kicked out without no sic
I never thought I'd see that kick
Ain't a soul alive that could take my accountant's tick
A cool head is quite the shed
Thinking of rappers. Yaz, thinking of rappers Ooh, yeah
Whole lotta gang shit man
It's our year
Niggas be hating I already know
They tryna take a nigga out his go
I'm getting paper I got it off the road
I just got five bands for a show
I just be smoking doly at the O
I ain't from nothing had to let 'em know
Shawty be smutting had to let her go 
If she ain't sucking she can see the door
Too many bands, I done lost too many friends
So right when I got me a chance
Too many fans, I done got too many fans
In less than a year with a plan
This shit began, far from the end
Hollow West Side the whole grip and extend
I was in poverty and I had to land
When they asked niggas for all of my mans
We been through it more than ya understand
Spin through the opps every trip niggas ran
Daddy lurking always watch my gram
Diddy bopping like he know how to dance
Bars fly and my flow is advanced
Reputation, niggas know who I am
Can't believe I'm really labelled a G.O.A.T
Can't believe I seen a hundred gs at age of 17 I feel like renting a boat
Backwoods, always paper and tokes
Two grams and I blow when I smoke
I was fighting for my life in the O
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
And we went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
I remember us going to war
Gripping, camping in the front of your door
Gotta keep it just to walk to the store
Money coming I won't struggle no more
Glizzy cooling on my buckle and draws
Remember nights when I was praying to score
We ain't ever gave a fuck 'bout the law
We ain't ever gave a fuck 'bout the law
Trendsetter come and hop on the wave
Niggas wanna see the kid in a grave
Fuck it I might act a fool on the stage
Fuck it I might act a fool for the day
I ain't settling for minimum wage
"How you did it?", they be looking amazed
Ya'll would never know the problems I faced
13 I was fighting a case
Tay-K did a race with the boys
Clout chasers got me feeling annoyed
Fire bitches started feeling your boy
Fire bitches started feeling your boy
Yeah, it feel like I'm tripping, in water, I promise I go in for slaughtering
And bro said I'm taking it harder you won't imagine the start of me
None of this rapping shit hard for me
Bro niggas stay tryna border me
VVS diamonds, they hard to see
God, he sitting in the stars with me
Smelly looking over guarding me
Free a nigga he a harder me
Nah, nah, nah, yeah
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
And we went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same forever
We went through pain together, can't switch, be the same foreverA man once said always keeping it one hunnit
But u know wats funny
Slutty whore bitches who wanna take all ur money
Make you call them honey
Drink their honey
But I don’t really mind cuz I get to fuck that honey
Make her pussy all runny
I can’t count how many times we done it
How many times she asked me to rub it
But u realised after all that rubbing, fucking,sex to one hunnitt
Ur a thief, a bitch you were born in a ditch
Thats why u wanted to control someone rich
Bitch all u are is a posuare
Straight through that facade
Is u
Pulling the gold digger card
Why don’t u just tell me u wanna be in my car bitch
Thats why u gotta keep it one hunnit
