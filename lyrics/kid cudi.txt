I'm just what you made God — not many I trust
I'ma go my own way God, take my fate to wherever you want
I'm out here, on my son, won't stop 'til I get me some
Club-hoppin', tryna get me some, bad bitches wanna get me sprung
Early in the morning, I'm wakin', bakin', drinkin', contemplatin'
Ain't no such thing as Satan, evil is what you make it
Thank the Lord for that burning bush
That big body Benz I was born to push
On my way I'm burning kush, nigga don't be worried 'bout us
Neighbors knockin' on the door, asking can we turn it down
I say, "Ain't no music on", she said, "No, that weed is loud"
Nigga, we ballin', straight swaggin', lost Hawk, but I'm maintainin'
I've been told that I'm amazing, make sure keep that fire blazin', we livin'
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God 
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
 I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God
Let me tell you ‘bout my month y'all, in the shop and I had a ball
I had to ball for therapy, my shrink don’t think that helps at all
Whatever, that man ain’t wearing these leather pants
I diagnose my damn self, these damn pills ain’t working fam
I- In my spare time, punching walls, fucking up my hand
I know that shit sound super cray but if you had my life you’d understand
But, I can’t fold, some poor soul got it way worse
We’re all troubled, in a world in trouble
It’s scary to have a kid walk this Earth
I’m what you made God, fuck yes I’m so odd
Thinking 'bout all my old friends who weren’t my friends all along
Hm, when it rains it pours, whiskey bottles on the sinks and floors
Everyday to find sane’s a chore, amidst a dream with no exit doors
I need smoke
I need to smoke
Who gon' hold me down now?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I wanna get high y'all
I wanna get high y'all
Need it need it to get by y'all
Can you get me high y'all?
I'm just what you made God, just what you made God 
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made
 I'm just what you made God
I'm just what you made God, I'm just what you made God
Need it to get by, ya
WillyMmmm, ay-oh
Hey...
Ratatat, yeah!
Na-na-na-nah
Na-na-na-nah
Crush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night
I don't care, hand on the wheel
Driving drunk, I'm doing my thing
Rolling the Midwest side and out
Living my life, getting out dreams
People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'ma do just what I want, looking ahead, no turning back
If I fall, if I die, know I lived it to the fullest
If I fall, if I die, know I lived and missed some bullets
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Tell me what you know about dreamin', dreamin'?
You don't really know about nothin', nothin'
Tell me what you know about the night terrors every night
5 AM, cold sweats, waking up to the sky?
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?
Tell me what you know about night terrors? Nothing
You don't really care about the trials of tomorrow
Rather lay awake in the bed full of sorrow
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness
I know everything that shine ain't always gold
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness, and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold, hey
I'll be fine once I get it
I'll be good
Pursuit of happiness, yeah
I gon' get it, I'll be good
Oh...
Oh man, oh, ugh...
Room's spinning, room's spinning...
Pat, Zuli...
Oh fuck
Oh my God, why'd I drink so much and smoke so much? Oh
Oh, fuckUh, uh, uh, uh
Uh, uh
Day and night
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Dolo
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
'Cause day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Slow mo'
When the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive though he is feelin' blue
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of, to free his mind in search of
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, at, at, at night
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night
At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, night
Na-na-na-na-na-na, Kid Cudi
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all night
Cleveland status, grind all day
Cleveland status, grind all nightI got 99 problems and they all bitches
Wish I was Jigga man, carefree livin'
But I'm not Shawn, or Martin Louis
I'm that Cleveland nigga rollin' with them Brooklyn boys
You knowin' how it be when you start living large
I control my own life, Charles was never in charge
No sitcom could teach Scott about the dram
Or even explain the troubles that haunted my mom
On Christmas time, my mom Christmas grind
Got me most of what I wanted, how'd you do it mom, huh?
She copped the toys I would play with in my room by myself
"Why he by himself?"
He got two older brothers, one hood, one good
An independent older sister kept me fly when she could
But they all didn't see
The little bit of sadness in me
Scotty
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm super paranoid, like a sixth sense
Since my father died, I ain't been right since
And I tried to piece the puzzle of the universe
Split an eighth of shrooms just so I could see the universe
I try and think about myself as a sacrifice
Just to show the kids they ain't the only ones who up at night
The moon will illuminate my room
And soon I'm consumed by my doom
Once upon a time nobody gave a fuck
It's all said and done and my cock's been sucked
So now I'm in the cut, alcohol in the wound
My heart's an open sore that I hope heals soon
I live in a cocoon opposite of Cancún
Where it is never sunny, the dark side of the moon
So it's more than right, I try and shed some light on a man
Not many people of this planet understand, fam
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
I'm this close to go and trying some coke
And a happy ending would be slittin' my throat
Ignorance to cope man, ignorance is bliss
Ignorance is love and I need that shit
If I never did shows then I'd prolly be a myth
If I cared about the blogs then I'd prolly be a jackass
Don't give a shit what people talkin' 'bout, fam
Haters shake my hand but I keep the sanitizer on deck
Hope I really get to see 30
Wanna settle down, stop being so flirty
Most of the clean faces be the most dirty
I just need a thoroughbred, cook when I'm hungry
Ass all chunky, brain is insanity
Only things that calm me down; pussy and some Cali tree
And I get both, never truly satisfied
I am happy, that's just the saddest lie
I've got some issues that nobody can see
And all of these emotions are pouring out of me
I bring them to the light for you, it's only right
This is the soundtrack to my life, the soundtrack to my life
To my life, to my life, to my life...
Uh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah, uh-huh
Yeah
Yeah
YeahYep 
Yep 
Uh-huh
Yeah, nigga
Yeah, it's been a minute, but I'm back in it 
Y'all ain't dealing with the same boy 
Got a little trippy, then I transitioned 
New attitude mixed with that pure raw 
The night game, your girl called
She like, "Do me, baby, down to get busy, busy?" 
No dice, chill, whoadie 
In life, feeling dizzy
Oh, having visions of the city and I go to war
See me in the day through the late night 
Tell 'em it's the charm, I'm in freeze mode
To the gods, can't stop a hero when he in flight 
I'm swimming in the light right
Go and get you some, go and show 'em something, this a new thang
Yeah, I let my nuts hang 
Knock your top off with LeBron or Dwyane Wade 
Aww, lift off
Can't stunt a nigga growth, better get gone, move along 
You don't wanna trip, wanna get it on 
You don't wanna act, don't get me wrong 
They don't listen to the words in the song 
We ain't gotta tell 'em, we just getting ready 
See 'em fronting, we ain't kidding
If you want it, you can get it
Members of the rage, come and get you some
Next step's out the jet from the lean back
Running 'round the world and we ain't packed
Hit 'em, vroom, vroom, leave 'em stuck, oh, you seen that?
I'm chillin' where the team at
See a black Benz pull up with some jawns, yeah, I need that
So crazy, can't believe it
No cams, damn, no filming at all, real nigga facts 
Years ago, rehab
All good, helped me figure out another plan
It got bad, so bad
Nah, I ain't fucking love that, man
Then I hopped out in a new zone with my Louis bag
True story, take you through the dark and the light 
Godson, got through new
Back up in the world, it's the day in the life 
Hit the blunt and get it 
Raised bars , same song, we did it 
Hot sauce, pour it on all jams, explicit
Carry on, smoke strong, got your mama down with it 
And the game fuckin' needed something dirty raw
Tell them this the law and we weeded 
So if it's God you believe in 
Bob your head and just nod in agreement 
They say time's undefeated
I'ma be the first one who can beat it 
I had hoop dreams, now I shoot threes 
Got a lil' green , but I don't do weed 
Purp nor lean , that's Tunechi 
That's New Orleans , fuck Drew Brees 
Snoop D-O-double , that's two G's 
I probably spent on paper, ooh-wee
Since Tuesday, probably killed a few trees 
But the only ones I smoke are the loose leaf
Not high, but I'm your highness 
And secretly, you're on my dick 
But you haters are butthurt , bunch of sore hind-ends 
I was just a poor white kid 
Now if rap was B-ball, I'd be Jordan-like, bitch 
You wish you could score like this , yeah
Not even at half court, I'd miss 
I'm mouthwash, 'cause if I was on the floor, I'd swish 
But I cannot lie 
I got you in my top five
Worst rappers of all time 
I lost my spot, y'all got Alzheim' 
King of rap? Nah, their words, not mine 
King of swear words and not lying 
You should never compare yours 
A toll-free number , only way you'll ever have a hot line
Fuck's going on, man? 
Bunch of half-wits up in office 
Half of us walking around like a zombie apocalypse
Other half are just pissed off and 
Don't wanna wear a mask and they're just scoffing
And that's how you end up catching the shit off 'em
I just used the same basket as you shopping
Now I'm in a fuckin' casket from you coughin' 
Always stay ahead of haters, let 'em hate
But never let a traitor penetrate your circle
Separate yourself from those who try to pull you down
The real ones never stray, it's sort of like Medusa 
That's how you stay ahead of snakes 
Emcees pull out gats, I don't give a fuck how strapped
You're gonna out-rap me? I doubt that
Please, bitch, I'm a house rat
These raps are 'bout that cheese like mousetraps
Earthlings, I adapt to 'em
Certain things, I don't want to do, but have to in
Order to just act human
Like using a bathroom and vacuuming 
Rapping in the booth in a triple fat goose hazmat suit
Bubble wrap and a mask too and
I don't think that's what they meant by trap music 
Running through ink like I'm tattooing 
This is music to be murdered by, you love
Turn the volume up, I am fired up like a blunt
Bread is long like an Italian sub, I am drugs
That is probably why your opinion of me's high as fuck
And it's nonstop fury 
'Cause I ain't holding 'em up like an armed robbery 
And God's my jury, so when I die, I'm not worried 
Prayers to George Floyd and Ahmaud Arbery 
How the fuck is it that so many cops are dirty? 
Stop, man, please, officer, I'm sorry
But I can't breathe when I got you on top of me
Your goddamn knee's on my carotid artery 
The adventures of Moon Man & Slim 
Yes, who want it with them?
The trilogy continues
Serving niggas, yes, see what's on the menu 
Watch 'em panic, hot damnit 
Hope you fuckers understand it
The realer for you niggas
Come and get these scriptures 
Rap God 
RagerStuttering
Giving 'em rest and making love again
In my best, I be the run again
And I have the man dem stuttering, -ing
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!
Yeah, ayo, ayo
Barbeque and blow in the back of the crib
Sitting and counting, smoking a spliff, this shit's a gift
All my niggas' watches is rough
Grabbin' our crotches, yellin', "What up?" The jeans cost 500? Fuck
Stop it, keep baking, see the smell, it's a statement
One freeze of this shit, you won't feel your legs kid
I'm a gangsta corporate hustla, my voice is illustrious
Hounded by vicious dons, nigga we armed, trust me bruh
They yellin', "Chef, kill the plate with the cooks"
I say yay with two chains on, we common, let's push
Burn another bush then burn another, we brothers
Love us or not, the Mark Zuckerbergs of the block
Hug a knot, staying rich, we was built for the guap
Park the green six deuce on the deuce just props
Rock a kilt, mean Glock, I'm all machinery, ock
Cling to me, now see how the scenery rock, yo?
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!
I was born by a lake, chicken shack and a church
That mean the flow got wings and it come from the dirt
Godly, I know she wanna test the 'Rari
Eye on a dollar like Illuminati
Life is foggy, tryna see through the mist of it
Could have been living it, you was Mrs. Mischievous
This is just a letter to better your development 
Situation delicate
Some claim God body, blame Illuminati
All 'cause his pockets now knotty as his hair, yeah
All Sonny, no Cher, only solitaires
You clusterfucks could cluster up
On tippy-toe and still not muster up
So it's 
In God we trust, the game is all us
'Til the sky calls or it's flames on us
Push
I'm getting this nigga in the morning
He gon' think he been chiefing, just too long when
He see me in the evening, wanna catch all these feelings
Well, let me be the first to get mine, ohh!
2 Chainz!
I'm chilling in my camo, flipping through the channel
On my G.O.O.D. Music shit, my logo's a Lambo
Four doors of ammo, ammunition I'm pitching
To make your body switch another position
I hope the people is listening
I could never sell my soul, I gave it back to God at my christening
It's tickling when I hear what haters be whispering
What makes you think an Illuminati would ever let some niggas in?
Huh, fake friends and siblings
Like to wish you well but ain't never flip the nickel in
Haters wanna pull they pistol when they see me in this race car
But you can't spell war without an A-R
15, I was pushing carts at K-Mart
By 21, they said I'd be inside a graveyard
Can't wait to get that black American Express
So I can show them white folks how to really pull the race card
 Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga? 
 Yeah, you feeling on top now
 Getting that money nigga? 
 Yeah, you feeling on top now
Getting that money nigga?
 Naw man, mad people was fronting
 Aw man, made something from nothing
I treat the label like money from my shows
G.O.O.D. woulda been G.O.D. except I added more O's
If I knew she was cheating and still bought her more clothes
It's cause I was too busy with my Baltimore, you know
Some people call that the art of war, you know
I guess it depends what you falling for, the clothes?
Cars, money, girls and the clothes
Aww money, you sold your soul
Nah man, mad people was fronting
Goddamn, we made something from nothingPlain Pat, what up?
My heart thump
Not from being nervous
Sometimes I'm thinking God
Made me special here on purpose
So all the while, 'til I'm gone
Make my words important
So if I slip away, if I die today
The last thing you remember won't be
About some apple bottom jeans
With the boots with the fur
Maybe how I dream of being free since my birth
Cursed, but the demons I confronted would disperse
Have you ever heard of some shit so real
Beyond, from the heart, from the soul, you can feel
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
My mind runs
I could never catch it
Even if I got a head start
God please help me
I am feeling so alone, wait
I don't need to worry
'Cause I know the world'll feel this, nigga
Blessing in disguise, but
I am not hiding who I am, open your eyes, bruh
If I ever met you, I appreciate the love, yo
Girls that I dated, it's okay, I am not mad, yo
Unless you stabbed me in the heart, no love ho
The shit is so ill
Play it back from the top if you recognize real
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
But please don't cry
Just know that I have made these songs for you
And if I die before I wake
I pray the Lord, my soul, to take
'Cause I'm ready for the funeral
I'm ready for that
I'm ready for the funeral, hey-hey
I'm ready for the funeral, hey
I'm ready for the funeral
Hey, I'm ready for it
I'm ready for it
I'm ready for the funeralShe said I don't spend time like I really should
She said she don't know me anymore
I think she hates me deep down, I know she does
She wants to erase me, hmm
A couple days, no talking, I see my baby
And this what she tells me
She said I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you 
It's like I'm her new nightmare, she ain't escaping
It makes me feel a bit complete 
Knowing someone you love don't feel the same way about ya
Memories they soon delete 
A couple weeks, no talking, I see my baby
I missed you so damn much
Hey, I wish we could start over, I told my baby
This what this bitch tells me
She said I keep on running, keep on running, and nothing works
I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing you
Yeah, cause I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you are, you might hear me
I'm in the magazines, on the TV
No matter where you go, you might see me
I'm Yeezy, she say "Hi, I'm Aria"
No, you a angel, you wave "Hi" to Aaliyah
I got a show in Korea, they built a new arena
Why don't you come and watch a nigga tear the whole scene up
I know I seen you before, but don't know where I seen ya
Oh I remember now, it's something that I dreamed of
Don C says she cool, but don't let her fuck your cream up
Monica Lewinsky on the dress, she'll take you to the cleaners
Sure enough, a week later, I'm in extra love
And everybody know she's mine so she extra plugged
Every bouncer, every club show her extra love
We just praying the new fame don't get the best of us
But all good things gotta come to a en-a
She let it go to her head, "No, not my Aria"
The height of her shopping was writer's blocking me
I couldn't get my shit out anyway, I hope you die, Aria
I keep on running, keep on running
And nothing works, I can't get away from you, no
I keep on ducking, keep on ducking you, nothing helps
I can't stop missing youInhale and I want you to exhale
And I want you to follow your breath
10... 9... 8... 7... 6... 5... 4... 3... 2... 1...
I'm off on a adventure 
I'm on my way to heaven 
Birds sing, flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them 
You want to be one of them 
You might hear the birds singing, flying around
You never see them too long on the ground
You want to be one of them 
You want to be one of them

3... 2... 1...
Scott. Scott. Scott. Scott!
That's good. You alright?Alright, run it
I never gave a fuck
I never gave a fuck about what niggas thought about me
I mean, I did, but like, fuck it, you know what I'm saying?
You gon' love me, man
You gon' love me, man
They can't comprehend
Or even come close to understanding him
I guess if I was boring they would love me more
Guess if I was simple in the mind, everything would be fine
Maybe if I was a jerk to girls
Instead of being nice and speaking kind words
Then maybe it would be okay to say then
I wasn't a good guy to begin with
But my mind is all crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like an airplane in the sky
But then they say I'm crazy, crazy, crazy, crazy
They got me thinking I ain't human
Like I came in from above, above, above, above
Feeling like a bird sitting high, high
I be that man on the moon, I'm that man on the moon
And I'mma do what I do, so do you, hey-hey
I be posted with my blunt and a brew, my dude
I'm that man on the moon, I'm up-up on the moon
It's like, I'mma play all my stuff for everybody
And you know, and all my people they give me feedback
You know, and they'll be like "Yo, yo, why your shit sound so different?"
You know what I'm saying?
"Why your shit, like on another level--Why's, why's it sound so different?"
Like that's a bad thing
And I be like
"Why not? Nigga"
Close my eyes, high in the dark
It's a curtain call; come one, come all
All I do is try to make it simple
The ones that make it complicated
Never get congratulated
I'm something different, all aspects
Don't want a woman just to love her assets
I'll still wife her up, even with her flat chest
The type to get hurt, but that's the past tense
My mind is all hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
'Cause they used to call me lame, lame, lame, lame
My swag was a little different
But then my mind is hazy, hazy, hazy, hazy
I be thinkin' that I'm wrong
But they the ones who lame, lame, lame, lame
I got the last laugh, nigga

You love that, little bit of new, now throwback
Cleveland City snakeskin snapback
Niggas know the uniform, keep the brim low
You doubt him, don't know a damn thing 'bout him
What is hip-hop without him, y'all niggas just really don't know
Go, all day every day, hold on with all might
I gave the world my heart, and they gave the kids insight
Yup, now fuck you I ain't left
I'm outta my mind like all the time
And a nigga ain't missed one step, yet, yup

My head hurt, gotta give me something that'll make me feel good
I remember, couldn't tell a nigga nothing, man I wish you would
Niggas ain't working, like me I had to put my bid in
All this rose gold I'm dipped in
Juste un clou, while I coast through clouds
That's my life babe, crystal clear, no cascade
I'm going, going, I'm on a crusade
To save the kids from the weak shit
It's finally gonna be my world
Here all the girls can be my girls
Just sit back count stacks, girl
Hold a nigga down all the time, girl
Whaddup?

Alright IanOoh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Born from dusk to dawn, I am truly alive
The satellite that sits in frame to illuminate this shaded place
He's a rose that don't belong, the music, the magic, take the lead
Come on with it, mmm, come on
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in

In the choices you made, it's all by design
Go with it, mmmm
Come on, don't fuck up the feng shui
Feng shui, feng shui, feng shui, feng shui
I see everything with new beams, I do dream
My eyes are glowing mood rings, you're boring
Stop dueling with the true thing, I do think
When you think too much you're removing what's moving
Stuck inside a statue, look at you
Go ahead and pogo, something gon' catch you
A petty logo, shed all my tattoos
I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
The universe never steered me wrong
The universe never lied
Take me bound to the come me down
The fantasy in this remedy
Free from where you don't belong in the concept of time
New levels, mmm, come on
Moments don't pass me up, no, no
'Cause I seize them in stride
Tell them winnin' never gave me in
When I eternally have faith

I read all the bad news that says I'm too careful
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Ooh-oh, tap in to the frequency, light
Feel I'm being tested every minute
Feel like yesterday I was blind, I've been lost
Seems like I've stumbled on a path, no coincidence
Truly in my essence, I've arrived
Who am I? Who am I? Don't remind me
Too alive, too alive, new arriving
You were right, I was left in it before
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
Parallel to paradise
I reach out for my lifeline
The angels laugh in paradise
They say I am my own lifeline, look in you
To the night, to the night I'm abandoned
To deny, to deny, what a sandpit
Couldn't I, couldn't I have an angel?
To the light, to the light, I am Carol Anne
So twisted in emotional notions, oh yeah
I savor your love, don't fuck up the feng shui
I see every thing with new beams, I do dream

Uh-uh, uh-uh
Bitches in my ear, they sayin' they love me
Uh, you don't love Scott, you love the Kid Cudi
I ain't no fuckin' slouch, show you what I'm 'bout
My energy is a bit too precious, too drenched in them blessings
Transitionin' to my inner, I'm hearin' their voice
Tellin' me stay in focus, keep focusin', boy
Feelin' like a trilli billi
The man everywhere I go, in any city
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls galore
I mean, damn the girls, girls, girls adore
Mixin' fluorescent to the core of the accoutrement
Off the tippy titty, settin' off my groupie radar
Sippin' Hen', dappin' hands off the roof of my Porsche
A fresh nigga at large, a fresh nigga go hard
All my youngins say, "Keep it goin'"
All my youngins, they dumb and reppin', they always knowin'
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute
Sexy mama, send her way, you doin' it, honey
Them hatin' fucks sideline and question what you do
Not this, my nigga, you be here 
Not this, my nigga, you ain't here 
Big boss, I made your heart heavy 
Can't stop me, can't carry me, baby

High-igh-igher, high-igh, high-igh-igher 
Nightmares kept a nigga from closin' his lids 
Since a kid, I've been haunted by visions of death
Such a trip, now it's normal, I customed the grip
Think they gone, nah, they just dormant, the hauntings ain't left
Now tell me what's a young nigga to do
When the zombies are comin' for you?
Load up them Daryl Dixons
Survived the rage, turn the page, relaxin', I'm whippin'
Last week, I almost weaved right off of Mulholland
Chiefin' good like I should, alone in my thoughts
All the awesome places I've gone to and witnessed
Is it worth the paranoia, betrayal, or loss?
Nah, nah, heroes can't simply have it all
Sacrifice, but see heroes don't sleep, we hear the call
My nieces know Uncle Scottie's so rock and roll
My princess Vada know rock and roll, Daddy got the glow
Got some pride in your town, I'm spottin' 'em lately
Three-piece suit and I'm lookin' so cute

I tried to tell all my friends when I was a kid that I had powers
And nobody wanted to believe me
All right
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Spent the last month feeling bad 'bout myself
I couldn't speak anything of real hope
And the day came when it hit me like lightning through my veins
A sudden change in my groove, in my walk
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
It's like the city is mine and the dark is my cape
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said, "Tonight I feel immortal," ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, whoh
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Bet you want to see me weak, not sort of my thing you see
I'm too damn cool, my mojo too dope
It's the same old thing getting lost day and night, young and lost in the pain
So many times I've broke this vicious cycle
Hmmm, I got my lion heart and electric flowing through my brain
Shocking waves make me feel I can float
Surely I'ma do what I want, ain't got no one to blame
I can't explain this sudden peace, am I woke? I sure hope
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
Hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm, hm-hmmm
I'm living my life as if I got powers
And tonight I feel immortal
I said tonight I feel immortal, ohh
Tonight I feel immortal, yeah-ah
Ohh, I, ohh
Don't Fuck with me. Fuck with me. Don't, don't fuck with me. Fuck with meGod, I thought I loved you so
God, I thought I loved you so
They done let in the skinny jean-wearing
Fro-for-days in a old AA
Balling so low, most fools couldn't price me
Silently stunt with a blunt full of P.E.
And I guess you know me
Been in NY so long, got Tri-State family
Especially Brooklyn—shout-out to the Madis
My bloodline runs deep
Nights, I don’t sleep
Figure it’s my pops keeping me awake
Help me keep my mind out the clouds for reality
These motherfuckers can’t fathom the wizardry
Slow-mo-brain, ass-backwards cowards
Take a shower, your attitude stinks
Want to know what I think
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga, hey
I live through words, not metaphors
So I passed to be the rest of the freshmen
Playful tough talk, often the fave
'Til I came like 'Pac art and said true things
A whole new legion of some niggas
Aiming high, past the idea of slanging
Praise Allah for keeping me away, man
A lot of my niggas fell victim to the dope game
Somethings will never be the same
Wish that I could tell my brother
Something for some motivation to get him out that gutter
He’s leaving behind a family and a mother
Damn, you must understand
What I speak about in song, this how I really am
Yeah, this is how I really think
You can see what I see, yes, I really blink
Yes, I really drink, I really do rage
My demons out the cage 'bout most of the day
Before I became the age to even rage
I was drowning my sorrows with some O.E., nigga
Hey, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Hey, my mojo so dope, bitch
My mojo so dope
Yep, we live it, live it
Yeah, we on it, on it
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about a motherfucking lifestyle, 'cause, nigga
We, we live this shit
Oh, oh-oh, oh
Give a fuck about your lifestyle

Oh, oh 
Give a fuck about your lifestyle
Give a fuck about your lifestyle, 'cause nigga
We live this shit, hey
Oh, oh-oh, oh

Yeah, here we go
On, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
And we dream
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and
On, and on, and on, and on, and...Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yo
I don't love who I am so I'm workin' on a fix
I don't need a bitch tryna tear my mind on my grip
If I had one wish, it'd be to have more wishes, duh
Fuck tryna make it rhyme
Throw them stones, with your bitch ass
Cutting me deep and even though I bleed
I stand alone, alone I'll be
Heart of a lion still shinin' in this sucka ass
Workin', workin', workin', for inner peace
Fightin' for the freedom of my soul, I can hear the speech
Yeah I mumble while I'm trippin on so many pills
Hah, they figured that they know a nigga
Yeah, I see you hatin' over there
See you jockin' over there, see you lookin' at my girl over here
Why you worried 'bout the girl over here?
Keep your eyes over there, it is creepy when you stare
Come on, hey, I see you hatin' over there
I see you jockin' over there, think about your own life
Why you talkin' 'bout the young hippy?
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know

I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, get it right
And they think they know
And they think they know the deal, for real
I'm just doin' my thang, if you know what I mean, yoYeah, woah-woah, oh
Yeah, woah-woah, haha
Yeah
My name is Scott Mescudi, yeah
Yeah
Gotta get it through my thick head
I was so close to being dead, yeah
Life, live it, with nobody's help tips
Man, I'm just walking without being led
See the world is so crazy and filled with such risk and man
I just know I gotta dodge them, yeah
The beginning is always followed by an end
In the in-between time I'm not runnin' or hidin'
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things trouble me
The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah, haha, yay
Yeah, whoa, whoa-whoa, yoo
Tried to fight it, but soon that gave in
Went down a road with no lights on
Can't describe it, and you don't move like them
You become their worst nightmare
You remember the things that your parents had said and well
Rather find out the hard way
You should tell a friend to tell a friend to tell a friend
I keep with my stroll, I'm not runnin' or hidin'
See things do come around
And make sense eventually
Things do come around
But some things still trouble me
The people I've met and the places I've been
Are all what make me the man I so proudly am
But I wanna know one thing
When did I become a ghost?
I'm most confused about the world I live in
You think that I'm lonely, well I probably am
One thing that still gets me
When did I become a ghost?
Yeah
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na-na, woah-woah
Yeah, woah-woah
Oh-oh-oh
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
I really understand that they...
I really think I, umm...
I hope they understand that I really understand that
They don't understand
Whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whow
Listen to me
Whow-whow-whowTwo, three, four
Ohhh-oh-ohh
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"
Future in my hands, God, she had a plan
Stronger than I know, soon I'd understand
The power I possess, the story of the Chosen
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum

Looking where we're at
How did we make it through this level all in one piece?
Hmm, oh, oh
Oh, where them friends now? I don't see 'em
And if I do, I don't sense the truth in 'em
Distancing myself while I'm focusing, fo-focusing
Don't pretend to worry bout shit
Go through one ear and out the other
Better off saying nothing, nigga
As I shine on and dream on, our vibes are on
Had one trip of a dream back in 2003
Who am I? And who will I be? Will I be free?
I need a sign, oh I need a sign
Oh, since I was young, been grooving to my own drum
Ain't that many teachers show me my potential
Felt like a failure, Mama said, "You know better"

Look at who you are, how could it be?
All I ever wanted was to find some inner peace
Mmm, oh, oh, oh
Where them haters now? I don't hear 'em
 to think they fucking with me, though
I put that on my soul, can't love, they jealous, so jealous, and some
Learning day to day, humans
Spread love to all my sisters and brothers, let's do better
Stop judging a nigga because they're different
We're supposed to groove to our own tune
So woke from that one tripped out dream back in 2003
And who do I see, baby?
The stars will align, the stars will align
Oh, since I was young, been groovin' to my own drum

'Cause I know I could not be in a place that's filled with lies
Can't stand no quiet nights, while I fill up my glass with pride
Hopeful is all I know, how to keep me from silent cries
Nothing I can say, facing all this pain in my way
I fight it every day
Why am I this way?
A nigga tryna maintain
I sit and tell myself, "Okay"
We gotta find another way
You gotta find another way
You gotta find another way

That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in '92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas gon' eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right

Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they never change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin' got them sucka niggas hatin'
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' 'bout crack or we talkin' about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin' the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin', they fittin' to run up
Then they gettin' the come up, yup, bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's 'posed to be

Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right, ohh
Hey yo, all right
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If it's a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas

Through the day, ayy
I mean, you staring like a creeper 'cause you gotta peep her
I mean, you prolly might be saying you ain't jockin' either
But, man, ol' girl got a fat ol' ass
Yeah, the type to make you tell a bitch, "Just dance"
And fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for her bitches 
Fuck them other niggas 'cause she down for the sticking 
And fuck them other niggas, hope she down for some licking 
And fuck them other bitches 'cause she down for the tricking, ugh
I'm hopin' she a rider

 Yeah
She said she want whatever she like
She said she gon' bring her friend
And we gon' have a hell of a night
Through the day
I made her say—Hold up,  born in '88? 
How old is that?  Old enough
I got seniority with the sororities
So, that explain why I love college
Getting brain in the library 'cause I love knowledge
When you use your medulla oblongata
And give me scoliosis until I'm comatos-es
And do while I'm sleep, yeah a little osmosis
And that's my commandment you ain't gotta ask Moses
More champagne, more toasts-es
More damn planes, more coasts-es
And fuck a bus, the Benz is parked like Rosa, -oza
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh 
AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
She said she want whatever she like
But you gotta bring your friend
And we can have one hell of a night
Through the day
She blamed it on the ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-alcohol 
She had her hair did; it was bound to fall 
Down, down for a—damn, Cudi already said it
Her poker Facebook, I already reddit
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body, known to blow fuses
A stripper from the South, looking for a payday
Said, "Bitch, you should do it for the love like Ray J"
But they say, you be on that conscious tip
Get your head right, and get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the godly to the party
It's the way I was raised on the Southside safari, so
Oh, oh-oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
When I...
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
I make her say
Oh, oh-oh-oh, AH-AH-AH-OH-OH
When I
Pa-pa-pa-poke her face, pa-pa-poke her face
Can't read my, can't read my
No, he can't read my poker face
She's got me like nobody
Can't read my, can't read my 
No, he can't read my poker face 
She's got me like nobodySoarin', is this allowed?
I sure bet my daddy proud
A little nigga with a Shaker smile
On top of the dreams is where I'm found
Some figured I was Satan bound
Until I came back with a style I found
Then all of a sudden they fixed their faces
'Cause of who I know and the trail of places
That I've stepped
How many niggas wanna hate 'cause I left?
How could you blame me and my plan of attack?
'Cause I'm risking my soul intact, now I'm heard all over the map
Only rule of thumb
It don't really matter just where you from
All that really matter is where you gon' go
Maybe upstate for some
But you can’t rule out these cats for gone
Second chances given out for some
All you gotta do is take advantage
Then maybe you can get yourself a horse and carriage
Done pimpin', you can think about marriage, until then, get it
Then find yourself and let's begin
I'ma tell you how in a minute
I'ma show you how I be livin'
From a long time ago, a young nigga, he was timid
Now I'm zoned, see things so vivid
Hide my soul? Nah, homie, not even
I'ma zone out 'til I lose feeling, remember
I'ma be gone way past November
Even, stay up there, up there
Floatin', floatin', hopin'
I can find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all
Ballin', is this allowed?
Without feelin' like Shallow Hal
Diamonds on the Jesus piece for style
Back in Cleveland City we ride around
Greetin' my niggas with dap and pound
So if I fall, I won't hit the ground
These are the things that'll make me smile
Knowin' this blunt might burn a while
I keep myself so lifted
I am accustomed to new heights
I feel perfect though they think it's worthless
See without my flight, man
Everybody wanna be a critic
I have my life and I will live it
Shut your mouth before I fuck it
Ha, my jokes, they will love it
If I'm seen on the scene with my slim cut jeans
More than likely I am faded, man
You are not the shit if everywhere you go
Niggas ain't sitting, standing 'round hating, so
My vice is when the lights start flashin'
I'll be zonin', all alone then
And the place where my mind is goin'
Filled with songs that no one's knowin'
And the Devil in a hot pink dress
Tryna ask me for one dance
He think he slick
But my guardians protect me from his wrath
So, in my place no hate shall enter
Livin' high up there, up there
Copin', copin', floatin'
I will find peace somewhere
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it all
In my mind
It sounds like oooooooh
When I'm gone
It feels like oooooooh
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I'm feeling alright
When I'm zoned, I'm feeling alright
I'm feeling alright, I forget about it allI don't need, I don't need nobody
Please shut the front door and walk right in
In the land of the man who rock it hard for them
Super Solo Dolo attack, run and tell that
If you'd like to know, yes, I am on acid
Who could it be? K-I-D
Searching all day in the streets for DMT
Don't sip it, though - it couldn't answer
Drip, trip all day - bumpin' MGMT, homie
Watch on who you hate on, fam', without the facts
Sad niggas back in the hood bumpin' Ratatat
To me it was a dream, a fiend to understand that
You never seen a nigga like me?
I just tell 'em I'm an oxymoron when I open my mouth
Cause people talk shit before knowing what I'm about
But for sure these Cleveland boys is ill
But pretty soon your gutter bitches wildin' for real, it's such a trip
Hoes around the globe, I'm known to have a fet'
I don't do a thing and these bitches lickin' they lips
Me and Chip reflect on all the hate and jibber jabber
Mmm, you almost got me, but sucker I'm not a sucker
Better get on back
You pussy motherfuckers get the Will Smith smack
And I am not a fronter, better look up the facts
The world know what it be: Mr. Rager, Solo Dolo, C.U.D., repeat it
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?
I really want it - need it
Break bread - or break fast
Before I blast and break legs, ride past
And they scream out "little Johnny is dead!" 
You wish me well, I wish you Hell
Eternity, no such thing as time will tell
Infirmary, burn like magnetic combustion
Bad credit with me, and paramedics are hustlin'
What's the definition of water?
Sherm sticks, sipped a gallon of it when you caught us
Turn quick, I don't wanna play this for my daughter
If my son heard it, probably look at you as his father
I'm proud of myself in a bad way
Halfway house, tell it to meet me halfway
I'm passin' out, ass whoopin'
Your ass lookin' for Michelle Obama 'til I bang on you
They couldn't
Come, come now, last call, who want some?
It's just me, two bitches and dirty drums
Two lips to kiss, 22 mother nuns
God blessed my tongue, I need it for life
Awkward like Cartwright, twiddling my thumbs
Pondering my next accomplishments
It's condescending to say I won
Two lips, you kiss my ass tonight, huh?I'm single in the streets 'bout to get it in
Talking bout some drinking and some mingling 
Can't believe what I'm seeing, man, all these girls, look , look 
Hmm, they got me caught y'all, I just wanna make her feel hot
Let me smell your sin girl damn you look  so 
No groupies, see a blonde girl with a brunette

A nigga turnt up
All the windows closed for the roast up
Club club letting out finna post up
All I need is somebody to fly with and smoke this tree
Down for doing acid
Slim up on that waist, but that ass fit 
Let me feel your skin on mine unwind speak whats on your mind
And tell me somethin that moves me
Seen all types, different continents
Nothing more intriguing than an accent
That's a one, two, double up, get it up

Don’t be prejudiced, cause she’s mixed
I'd still fuck the blackest bitch
That's how it is if you in my world
Light skin, white momma you a white girl
And I got that fever
And a big thick you know what I wanna feed her
Met a girl named Maria, its your turn, I love them señoritas

OG Too Short don't stop

Yahm
Bitch!Listen good, I don't have nobody
But what I might feel are the sounds of sanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself continuously
Then I won't be afraid, no, no
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
Look at me, you tell me just what you see
Am I someone whom you may love, or enemy?
Am I speaking for you and yours, or someone else?
I need some answers, yeah, yeah
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm, Mr. Solo Dolo
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh
My world turns, flippin' the bird
To the ones who figure
Me outcast, no, not the duo
Back in Shaker Heights where they knew who
Do's little brother was a strange one, boo-hoo
Cry me a river, hater, look who
Traveled out an igloo
Cold-cold world wasn't fit for me at all
Look at where I stand at, tall
Clutchin' my Kid Cudi bizzalls
Mute motherfuckers back home, quick pause
Gargle on my mayo
Look at me, I bet I'm the one you think to fail
Floating in my mind, no sail
Ahoy, ahoy
Listen good, I don't need nobody
This is what you feel, are the sounds of insanity
Hoping what I hear loops itself to finish me
No, I won't be afraid, hey, hey
Oh, whoa, whoa
Why must it feel so wrong
When I try and do right? Do right
Oh, whoa, whoa
Soaring through paradise
When I'm closing my eyes
I'm Mr. Solo Dolo
Why must it feel so right
When I know that it's wrong? It's wrong
When will I ever learn
From the words in my songs?

Stoned on the run-run, no fun if not
It's Scotty from the email read
Man, I swear to keep it one hundred
And if I ain't have it, then I'll be dead
My soul's been fed tonight
Everything that I choose, still can't forget Grey Goose
Converse covered with mixer juice
And all my niggas rolling up in the booth

And they also knowing they ain’t right
When I walk in the room they can’t look in my eyes

Rejuvenated, recreated, rebooted, in a new program
Prada calf’s, black skinnies, T and hoody
Y’all niggas know the brand, GQ mustachin’ I’m in LA
Soaking up the sun and I’m laughing, what can I say?
I love the way the fans say they love me
I know it’s all because my God above me
But damn I’m feeling like Sam
Except my daddy ain’t stuck up no video game
Things changed, for the good
He watched my back until the world started knowin’ my name
This should be in the Bible
Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated
I got my own empire, I’m the baby
I ain’t taking care of nobody but my daughter and my mom
Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting
While I’m winnin’ livin’ life, skippin’ grinnin’ on em
All hail King Wizard in the fuckin’ house

Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide
Truth comes to the light all the time
You can’t hide from fate, you can’t hide

Thought you were my sister, I thought you were
Thought you were my homie, I thought you were
So absurd
I am a person with powers, I possess the power
You can’t hide, see me shineNow when the sun come up
I'll be there to say "What up" in the morning
Brush my teeth
Find that clip I been looking for since last night
I feel so caught up in the bud
I float somehow in my bedroom
Turn around
See myself in the mirror, I guess I'm cool
And those happy thoughts in my head
I'm feeling like I'm Peter Pan
Minus the tights and the fairies
Happy to see how far I've come
To the same place it began
My dreams and imagination
Perfectly at peace
So I move along a bit higher
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever
Uh, higher learnin'
I see the dreams I made
So I'm cooler now
I can take care of my mom and my little niece Zuri
So sing along, lil mama
You ain't gotta worry 'bout no drama, no
I provide for friends and fam and fans
And Cleveland City grinding, man
Stay afloat, the key is hope
I'll never let a motherfucker break me, dawg
Who gives a fuck? If a nigga don't like your steeze
Tell 'em to buzz off your N-U-T's
We don't care what people say
Dudes who critique your clothes are most gay
I ain't gotta wait for no one
If I wanna fly, I can fly for freedom, hey
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause they gon' judge me anyway, so, whatever
I'll be up-up and away, up-up and away
'Cause in the end, they'll judge me anyway, so, whatever

The end is never the end
A new challenge awaits
A test no man could be prepared for
A new hell he must conquer and destroy
A new level of growth he must confront himself
The machine and the ghost within

Da-le-lay, de-le-lay
Da-le-lay, de-le-layYou could fly
Nobody can touch you ... nobody
You could fly
Nobody can touch you
Ain't no question, ain't no conspiracy, yeah
Keep on searching for love, who else is incomplete?
There's so many good vibes just floatin' around in the world
And when the ground and sky combine, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than fine
I'm so Rock and Rollie
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
One day I knew no one could help me in Hell
Not many people are true, fake as the lies they tell, no no no
The world is filled with good vibes, and that is what I seek
And now I'm feeling more than cool, oh yeah
I'm feeling more than cool, yeah
Them Jokers can't hold me
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it? Feel it? Feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittable
Don't you feel it?
Don't you know that I'm unfuckwittablePlease save a kid that needs some help
And I can't begin to think of anything that could help
But the weed is guaranteed, indeed, just what I need
How I feel, upon a time, so recent in time, made me sad
When I recollect how it used to be
Like David and Goliath, kinda like me
And the Devil tryna rip out my soul
Tryna catch a nigga on sleep, no-no
You can try again and I'll be ready
Won't let you kill me in my dream like Freddy Krueger
No, I'm not no loser, I'll see you in Hell
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
Please save a kid that needs some help
And I can't see ahead of me so I move in stealth
Hide and seek within a dream I seem to glide above my horror
Though I feel I'll never be complete inside the dark I borrow
To proceed and remain intact my mental is so unstable
And they talk and judge a man
They have no clue of what I'm capable
'Til I show a side of me no one had thought could be within
I told you, no I'm not a loser, I'll see you in Hell
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion, the heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
The heart of a lion, the heart of a lion
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah 
I'm just a kid who needs no help
I've achieved a bigger thing
No cash or check, could be more blessed
And if you had ever seen the things I've seen up in my slumber
You'd be shook, stay awake
No need to run, your fate would follow
You should know, not for the faint at heart
This world understands no coward
It's a goal, a simple code, I stay on the grind to the 25th hour
And I know the fight in me is somewhere hiding deep within
I told you, no, I'll never let you drag me down to Hell
At the end of the day, day
My mama told me don't let no one break me, let no one break me
At the end of the day, day
Nobody, nobody ever could stop me, ever could stop me
At the end of the day, day
You can't regret it if you were trying, if you were trying
At the end of the day, day
I'm walking with a heart of a lion, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah 
No, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah, no, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, yeah...In my head your smile appears clear
Wish it wasn't my imagination running away with a dream
Your eyes they tell it all called it
Hope you have a good heart and you're smart
You've got a good head on your shoulders
That's what turns a nigga on, strong feelings that I have
You'll probably never, find out ever
I'll admire from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
How'd you get so fuckin cool?
Fools probably try to spit at you daily
The price you pay cause you're hot
Has anyone told you that you're fresh as hell
And I dig the way you wear your hair too
It makes you look more mature
See I just wanna be a man and I think you can be the one to guide me
But who the fuck am I kidding
Man you know they say I'm wild
But real people rarely come around if ever
You got it going on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
You turn a nigga on, these feelings I have
You'll find out never, unless you're clever
I'll admire you from afar, star
Keep doing all the great things you're doing
You got it going on, young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!
You got it goin on young lady
Jesus Christ, girl!

When the days change
So does my attitude
I'm messy at home
I eat a lot of junk food
When the nights change
So do my nightmares too
I dream reality
Is my dream
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own
Yeah
When the weeks change
The rumors change too
I'm addicted to highs
Would you like to know why?
When the months change
So do my love point of views
I don't want what I need
What I need hates me
What I need hates me
I know all along
All along
I know I'm meant to be alone
It's crazy
But all along
All along
I knew I was meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeah
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to win
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
Suppose somehow the lionhearted
Failed to smile
Who will be the villain?
All the strangers voted for him
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
All along
All along
I guess I'm meant to be alone
Out there on my own, yeahHey!
Love, hate, play this game of give and take
Go, stay, we all make mistakes
I'll say, what a wonderful escape
I embrace
Hey, hey, hey
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
Things get crazy and I feel I'm losing my mind
I don't know what to do
I'm going insane and I really don't know why
There's only one thing to do
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
I can't understand, I don't understand it
The visions in my head
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
I just can't make sense of it
Cause I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
There's no use for it baby
I can never run
I can never run, I can never run
I’m so used to you baby
I can never run, I can never run
There’s no use for it baby
I can never run

I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eye
I'm floating through the night on a red eye, red eyeYou see I'm trapped in my mind, oh I'm, goin trippy
Oh I don't think I'll ever go
You see the walls are so high that I, couldn't climb them
So I don't know which way to roll
I feel I'm stuck in rewind, though I'm, lookin forward
Damn, I wish I knew what went wrong
Am I sick, am I ill? Man, my mental got me
Oh Lord, please help me pull through
Oh baby
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
You see the sun seems to shine, when I, am not looking
Oh, it seems to trick every time
Things do get out of hand once awhile, inside my mental
Hey, I took one hell of a ride
When I see what is so, I know, I am not lucky
Yeah I like to pat my own back
It's a gift and a curse, since my birth I'm in a prison
Though I'm happy right where I'm at
You see I'm trapped in my mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
I'm trapped in mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
Oh baby
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
Oh why, oh why, ooh
Oh why, oh
You see I'm trapped in my mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy
Hey I'm not that bad at all
I'm trapped in mind, and I, know it's crazy
Hey it's not that bad at all
When you think of the world, I know it's crazy

Oh baby
Hey I'm trapped in my mind baby
I don't think I'll ever get out
Ohh I'm trapped in my mind baby
I don't think I'll ever get out, yeah
Oh, I'm trapped in my mind, baby
I don't think I'll ever get out
I don't think I'll ever get outI guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I'm just a star of my movie
They say I'm the chosen, and so it goes
I'm supposed to live and grow old and die alone
Talking to myself in the mirror
Take one to know one
Can we talk, just loony to loony?
How strange the notion
You don't really know no one
And what if I told you
You no longer know me
You better keep going and keep it rolling now
Ain't no thing, you don't really need me
The pressure is growing
Hard times they mold you
Into someone way colder
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
And people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
And people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
Oh, and people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
M.A.D. S.O.L.A.R
I guess I'm loony, I guess I'm on one
Guess I got to finish my movie
See my heart has been swollen, it's healing slow
Hope I don't live to grow old, no one at home
Staring at myself in the mirror, take one to know one
Want to find out 'bout the real me?
Certain moments reveal you
Especially friends who were never good friends
But want to act like they know me
You better keep going and keep on strolling
It's so crazy how you think you can play me
Show them pussies you're growing
Hard times, they mold you
To the haters, I told you
Let the world see how you win
No matter how you seem to them
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
Fuck 'em
And people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar
All the things that bother me
Ain't no other way I can be
And people think I'm mad 
Then won't you tell them I'm mad, solar

Got to keep up the pace
And them girls gon' twerk
Because the vibe is poppin'
As well as the bottles
Keep it rockin', don't stop 'em
At the Motel-8
We can park out front

Niggas aim for death
They tryin' to fuck with the blessed
Ain't no fuckin' with amateurs
Run passed the novice
Sip hella lean
To see who talks the slowest
Ain't no stoppin' me at all
You'd need a sawed-off, or maybe a chainsaw

I am the maniac, I am the ghoul 
I'm in the shadows in the corner of my room 
This my new hideaway, this is my tomb 
This is my coffin, this is my place for unruliness, no worries
I love the darkness, yeah, I'd like to marry it
It is my cloak, it is my shield, it is my cape 
I love the dark, maybe we can make it darker 
Give me a marker
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am the maniac, I am the fool
I found the monster in me when I lost my cool 
It lives inside of me, eating what's in its way
I put black spray paint on my windows during the day
I want to spend time with it, I think I'm losing it
Or I found it and I'm using it
I wear my shades at night so I can look in the abyss
I see something in nothingness if you can picture this
Put black holes in my jar lid, I climb the wall
I'm too high now, I'll die from the fall
Before the water's to our knees, we can't climb when the trees
Wash away, you and I are the disease
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniac
I am a maniacHmm, you wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But it seems they all on the same mission
You wanna find somebody you trust and lay low
But can't stand the heat of my love, then stay out the kitchen

Punch-Drunk Love annoyedI might go losing it and drive off of a cliff
Fall in the void
And if I blow my brains out all over the scene
That's madness curing sadness
These walls ain't talking back, might as well finally paint them black
I'm out of ideas
The ceiling is all I have, downward from here
I'm ripping apart
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?
Confused, truth is what I choose
Heal I never do
Asking, "Who are you?"
I don't have one clue
Seems I hate him, too
Seems my color's blue
Who?
I always end up back in a cycle of shame
Looking in the mirror is hard
Some days, I hurt myself to distract me from distraction
That's madness fixing sadness
Go on adventures to find that the answers aren't plain
But there's comfort in tears
Decoding my sacred heart, flying from here
No more falling apart, ah
Who am I? Who are we?
Who am I? Who are we?
All I want is to feel complete
Who am I? Who are we?
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
Confused, truth is what I choose 
Heal I never do 
Asking, "Who are you?" 
I don't have one clue 
Seems I hate him, too 
Seems my color's blue, ooh
Who?
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sun
I hate the drugs, but I love the numb
I hate the gun, but I want the sunHey, let's have some fun this time
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right
Please, please don't play this song
Yeah, haha
Pain, hurt, sadness and loneliness
Balled all that shit right up
Tossed it away to the bottomless pit
The part of my mind that slips
And the part of my mind so sick
I don't even like to take the trip unless I'm sloppy drunk
I pray for my mom, how to teach a son
That never gave a fuck about a scantron?
All I wanted was to be a human being
And show all the world some new colors and scenes
Imagine all types of beautiful scenery
I remember when I first had trees
Smoked out a Black and Mild, so dumb of me
Now, I'm grape Cigarillo man
Any young black kid, guaranteed fan
Hold it down, humble pie on the humble
And I treat normal girls like models
Reckless and young and my, my mom's calling
Think I should hit decline
I'm numb faced while I'm thinking 'bout suicide
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song 
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right 
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right
R-r-right, r-right, right, right 
Please, please don't play this song 
Black Robin Hood, riding high just like we should
You know the saying, ain't no delaying
Gotta gets the getting while the getting's good
Yeah, demented, my brain was forced to transform
Wise up, I'm checking the gate
On humble tales and minimum wage
The blogs tell it; "Cudi's lame
Wearing a kilt? He must be gay."
Let's keep it trill, fuck being discreet
Bet some girls tweet how they miss my meat
Yeah, Cudders, HBO, that Vitamin Water
That's money to blow 'cause it's money for blow
Don't take no shit, you can blame my ma
I'm in the maze, I'm in a daze, I'm losing it
I'm locking in my rocketship
I'll be a blip on your radar, bitch
Feels like things can be covered
Until the day I'm above myself, hovered
Wanna know what it sound like when I'm not on drugs?
Please, please don't play this song
R-r-r-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right 
Trying to get my mind, my mind, my mind, right, right
People think they really being helpful
By telling me please be careful, yeah right 
R-r-right, r-right, r-right, right, right

Yo, check it
Ayo
Who could take a single buck, an empty cup, a stroke of luck
Fuck around and reconstruct it up to a million bucks?
In God we trust, every part of us is marvelous
You Krusty Krab squad, y'all will rust, y'all ain't hard enough
Demolition expert, I exert through your network
While the Tec squirt, jerk, there's holes inside your sweatshirt
Through your apparel, through your blood, through your bone marrow
Precise with this mic device, slice your pie like Sbarros
You falling nigga, and you can't get up
You been stalling motherfucker now your ass is stuck
Brooklyn, Brownsville, baby, stay with the Killer Hill crazy
Ankle strapped above the boot, it conceals my three eighty
Are you running for this money money? Hunting eggs like Easter Bunny
Geeks trying to beast upon me, freak, I will eat a zombie
Calm and double while you jumping through these hurdles
Silly rabbit, the race is always won by the turtle
Mental machinery, purple herbal mixed with that greenery
I don’t write songs, grasshopper, I write sceneries
Everything ain’t what it seems to be
What it means to you, it don’t mean to me
Bzzz, a sting from the killer bees

In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks

In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
Stings bitch, bzzzz...
BzzzzZZZzzz
I pass any test of litmus, I workout at 24 Fitness
On the weekends I sip Belvedere with that citrus
My dogs is vicious, exotic nympho whore for the mistress
Life is good, I live every day like it's Christmas
Happy New Year, I does what the fuck I wanna do here
I splash that Gucci shit from the shirt to the shoewear
Trust the rings out, wife beater tee with the wings out
Long dick stamina, I fuck a bird 'til she sings out
La la la la, Bobby could convert Lady Gaga
Back to heterosexual, I'm classy like Impala
Plus I'm federal, when it comes to making dollas
Like Jigga nigga man, if you hear me then holla
Gold rings like the Green Lantern you see me in the mean phantom
Pushing over there in Ohio, outside of Canton
Or maybe in the grotty, rugged projects of Staten
Tall redbone in my shower, she looking like Paula Patton

In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks

In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks
In God I trust, now I don't give no fucks

I know it's easy to imagine
But it's easier to just do
See, if you can't do what you imagine
Then what is imagination to you?
Just a waste of space in your brain
To take the place of hate or things all the same
Tell me your secrets, the things that make you tick
I like when you talk, because your voice is angelesque
Ay, I want to kiss you on your space below your navel at
The place that you keep neat, so moist, like a towelette
This will mark the day our minds and souls will connect
Let's not forget the sex, my heart you can collect, now, now

Soon after falling into a deeper psychedelic state
To escape the prison of our reality
Our hero becomes trapped in his own peaceful place
Which immediately becomes his sanctuary
A place filled with his wildest dreams
This is his new home"This is the Rocket Powered Space Capsule. All systems are go."
And the story goes, a young man will come
And save the universe from the forces of evil
Take a second to adjust to the ride
They say if this was a crime, it'd be federal
Lately I've been feelin' invincible
As I'm tryna find my way, can't nothing hold me though
I say, get a clue, the vibes all around you
Try but you can't deny when it's in your soul
Let's take it where there aren't any roads
Where these sucka hatin' niggas can't follow, baby
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride
No worries, no worries, no worries, no worries
Come on don't be shy, let your guard down and work it
Do just what you want, anything you choose
I tell ya, there's no way we could lose
Have you ever seen the Earth from this view? I bet not
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride, take a ride, take a ride
And now, the vibes
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
Heavy little thoughts get jumbled in a bundle
And they're tucked deep down in the back of my brain
All is life and all is pain
Down the hallway of my endless fate
Take it to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Come get in my space whip to the satellite, tonight
Take flight to the moon
Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Take it to the satellite, tonight

Take a ride, take a ride
Come on, yea
Come on, dream on
Come on, come on
Dream on, no worries
WickedI got my head on a swivel
Think it's time I open my mind where I left these niggas incompletely
Make sure that they can't delete me
I'm bout to rewire your whole fucking mainframe, sick of the same
Lame old same thing
I got some bubonic you might wanna mix with some whisk
I got a vendetta with showing niggas that I'm way better
Feeling way worthless, the lost black sheep of G.O.O.D. Music
Only good for a hook, huh? Let me show you flows
Intuitive when it comes to the many things I know
Cold, most winters I would dream of being a winner
Feeling like less than shit to the doubters
Pain I promise to all who oppose my knowledge
My reign, the fucking essence of pain, fuck rain
Standing in a monsoon of cool, time will tell
This is what it is when you're walking to hell
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
Owie
I love how I can make so many people feel uneasy
Walk right past, I know you hoes see me
Can't deny the shine of a Jedi
World-class almighty super Cudder the Godly
Burbon, divas just smoking 'tiva, those my hobbies
I love shittin' on these niggas, that is my fave
Can't fuck with an unstoppable force
That lives with no regrets and of course no remorse
One two, one two, assholes now please listen close
I live for the day to watch all you pussies roast
Whoosah whoosah, so I don't slit nobody throat
Aw, it ain't my fault, homie thought he had the juice
Bash a nigga face and watch the blood leak
Put my ear where his jaw was, tell a nigga to speak
Standing in a monsoon of cool, karma is my armor
Was only scared of my father, beyond that I'm
Cold
Bitch you know I'm cold, yeah
I'm one cold blooded nigga
Oh, so cold
Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga

Niggas know I'm cold, yeah
One cold blooded nigga
OwieYeah, the crazy, the wizard
So much whiskey all in my liver
I really like the punch it delivers
Makes me warm while I high-five sinners
All alone, trying to hide from the shadows
Ain't no use, it seems everywhere, they follow
They know where I be at
Infect my mind, tryna get me
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
Life is like that
Beat me up, and I'll fight right back
Poof, poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, stuck in my hell
Lied to my mom, and I ain't doing so well
Lord, let me in
I feel like He's my only friend
Yeah, the rager, the menace
Hate me now, then hate me when I'm winning
Work so hard to not go insane
It's a full-time job to not lose my faith
Okay, I've been here before
Alone for the umpteenth time or more
I'm tired of motherfuckers saying that they worried 'bout me
When, in fact, they probably never gave a fuck about me
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
Yeah, life is like that
Beat me up, and I'm fighting right back
Poof-poof, be gone
I see the devil linger on
Yeah, I wanna win
As long as I can do the work within
Lord, let me in
I feel like You're my only friend
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more
These worries are heavy, they rest on my shoulders
My pride, it won't let me fall victim no more

Every time, the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time, the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
I'm feeling strange in the night
I'm not myself, I feel I'm thrown into a fight
Ah, nowhere to run, nowhere to hide, nothing's right
My skin is burning and my heart begins to speed
There's something going wrong with me
I am changing rapidly, ay
I'm feeling stronger, more alert, I'm on the move, mm
I smell her scent, and I know I will find her soon, soon, soon
The one to come and free me from this fate
I'll find her, it's not too late, hey, hey
Every time, the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
And every time, the moon shines
I become alive, yeah
I'm a beast in the night
I'm on the prowl while I'm hoping to find some light
You call it Heaven, I do too, we feel the same
Ain't nothing wrong, I'll be feasting on something brave, ay
A sexy lady who's pure, she has the cure, ah
I hope she can find the man within the beast, and
I hope she saves me from the curse I have to beat, hey
I hope she figures out a way to save my soul
Yeah, to save my heart, hey

I watch the sun collapse and took up in the clizzoud
I am the lone wolf, go where I wanna
Let the moon shine, be the guide to the lizzight
Even when I stray away, the light never left me
Uh, I learn to follow my instinct
Blinded by the light, rather that than the evil
Feelin' out of place in a room full of people
Try and be the same, but you know you're not a sequel
Your fate will be
Whatever it shall be, be, be, be, be
Won't fight no more
I let these things just be, be, be, be

Blinding, your glory is blinding
Your glory is blinding You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Damage control
The same old tricks won't work no more
Smarter, stronger, hmmm
A nigga gon' make it through
What is to do, I've been low enough
Who knew I'd make it out?
Been trapped for too long, I'm out of the web
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah
Calls from the dark
I got hope in my eyes
No help in sight
I'ma swim in the light
She's tryna pull me in
But the same old tricks can't work no more
I'm out on the way
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
You could try and numb the pain, but it'll never go away
Ey, yeah
When you're in love
Swim in the light
Swim in your love
Wish me well
YeahI’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again , do it again 
I’d never do it again 
Cuz this is the end
My brother told me a long time ago
Don't focus where you been, G, focus where you tryna go
I swear the game make you cold like abominable
Snowman, old man, when you trying to shine like gold
When it's my time to blow partner I'mma know
In the midst of getting dough I was hit with highs and lows
My Melo tried to play me like my fucking eyes was closed
Now I'm sittin here wishing that my guys didn’t know
They love a G, so they despise a soul
What they gon’ do to him, beyond my control
When the reaper calls, it's your time to go
Never play a nigga when you see that he is trying to grow
I'm Benny Blanco when he knocked out Carlito
And Pachanga so I'm watching every angle
Under the moonlight with the devil I've tangoed
Church on the move like Jesus in the manger
Better control the money, it's better to control the anger
So now I watch a friend the way that I watch a stranger
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end , I’d never do it again
Chillin', rolling up something to change my feelin'
Thinkin' about how I came up from nothing while I’m splittin'
This cigarillo, phone rings I get a call
One of my dogs tripping hard talkin about really killin them all
I say slow down, slow down, what the fuck you mean nigga
Just ran in your crib and popped your daughter in the spleen
I’ll be there in 20 minutes, but it only took fifteen
We wasn’t that tight, but cool enough for me to hit the scene
Not knowing this was all a set up, secretly they want me wet up
Jealous of my future cheddar, however
They fastest move was too slow for me
I pulled up, wasn’t no ambulance, there wasn’t no police
Something fishy going on, naive, kept pressing on
Nine gripped, thinking the killer could still be on the lawn
Opened the front door, they shot, I shot, someone dropped shit
The nigga with something to lose just almost lost it
Won't trust him again
Do it again, I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end
I’d never do it again, do it again
I’d never do it again
Cuz this is the end, this is the end
This is the end, I’d never do it again
Cheese came through at 3
Salute, at ease, C had supplied the weed
Cause IBN had OD'd
It's me with a black rockstar steeze
Real rock tees, 300 a pop for these
Please, bummy? You don’t know me money
Day & Nite got flipped and I got blow for a grip
Sipping on a Heine with my Jamie-boo beside me
That's my fucking best friend
When I'm tweaking she be calming a brother
Like the touch from a mother
I am so damn comfortable I never want to leave it
The feeling is something like a spiritual healer
That could end me, I think that’s the part I find intriguing
A little bit off, I am, I am, I am
I see that I'm caught, I am, I am, I am
It’s something like a spiritual healer that could end me
I think that's the part I find intriguing, I'm fiending
I’ll never do it again, do it againOh
Oh, oh
What a world that I'm living in
Will the rainstorms ever end?
 Path narrow, I run again
Seem happiness is gone again
 Grey clouds up above mayne
Metaphoric to my life mayne
 Heart stronger than it's ever been
Strong will 'til my journey ends
 More than I ever rolled
Not pills, but the Mary though
 Eyes heavy when the day goes
Nothing helping when my head doze
 Awake in another state
Living in a new space
 Mind running at a steady pace
God help me so I'll win the race
 The sky might fall
 The sky might fall
 But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
 The sky might fall
 The sky might fall
 But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Grey clouds stuck together fam
Lightning piercing through another land
Over the desert where the lost play
Soul searching each and every way
 Awesome sound, so profound
When it– it'll grip you
 If you hear it you can feel it too
Something special I am running to
 Away, very far away
To another universe where all the people say
It's the new-new place for the special to embrace
Like a Martian who seemingly wandered out of place
Take what you need from the valley of the hope, where
Even if you drown you'll be floating higher up, and
You can say bye, bye, bye
Sky might be falling but remember you can fly high
 The sky might fall
 The sky might fall
 But I'm not worried at all, c'mon, c'mon
 The sky might fall
 The sky might fall
 But I'm not worried at all
Hey, hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
Hey, I let 'em know somethin'
I let 'em know somethin', I let 'em know somethin'
You can listen up, a-listen up
A-listen up, a-listen up
I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up
And I keep running, yeah
I gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
Gotta keep up, I gotta keep up, yeah
'Cause I'm gone
Yeah, na-na na-na, na-na na-na
I'm up, and away
Na-na, na-na
Know what I'm talkin' 'bout?
Hey, heyEasy, ahh
This is Easy Sunday Morning
And we're right here on a beautiful morning
In Cleveland, Ohio, and it's chilly today
The kids are going to school, the grass is frosty
 Let's take it on, on the ride-ide out
 In the morning
 Hello Cleveland
 Yeah
A nigga like me be so gone
Eyes so low that a nigga gotta throw his locs on
"Wonder what them folks on?" That's what they be askin'
Dumb kush we smokes on, smell it when a nigga passin'
We gettin' to the cash and, you can see a nigga shinin'
Just a little gold, a couple hoes, couple, two, three diamonds
Up in the hood where you find him
'Less he out on the road 
Every show got a bag full of blow and Patron
All my niggas getting throwed like they 'posed to
Cause life is short and filled with lots of grief and doubt
So I just, pull that bag of colorful frosty leaves on out
And free my scalp, I need to free my mind a puff at a time
I'm up all the time, I'm up on the grind
So a Red Bull and a blunt would be fine
Just wanna feel fine, just wanna kill time
Just wanna relax and think of a rhyme
Don't really like sippin' cause I get to trippin'
My nigga, just roll up a heap of that pine
And only bring a little bit for the trip
Just in case we get blurped by 5-0
"Sir, you look high", I know, but I prefer my eyes low
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so high
Yeah, they say, "Easy friend"
There he go talkin' 'bout weed again
Probably cause of all that weed in him, yes and no
Cause and effect is what most don't know
Doing bad or like Mike said could be doing wrong
Forget about the obvious context of song
Put your brain where it belong
Can't we just all get a bong and tag along?
And we float, we kids with hope
Better to cope when you smoke
Dawg, please don't miss
What a nigga tryna get you thinking 'bout
We outside because my mama in the house
Puff-puff-pass with your bitch-ass
Back in high school, smoked weed when I cut class
And now I'm an addict, tragic, stay rolling up while reclining
I be looking down, see my Jesus piece shining
Good look, Yeezy, now I stay blinded by that light
Somebody pass me that shell to the right
Yes, I'm going, I'll be outtie, and you can find me
I'll be chilling back, I'll be chilling, Jack
Let's go
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
And we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, and higher
And higher, and higher
You know we get higher, so higher
Oh-oh-oh, oh yeah, we get so highLord of the Sad and Lonely
Yeah
Won't you tell me who is; the supreme leader
Still underused, like I'm not a human heater
Move and groove, make a bitch linger
Want more than the dick, gold on the ring finger
Not the one to play dumb, see I'm from Cleveland bitch
Up in the hills, still keep it way triller than most
Wanna relax, someone tell me how that feels
I say that now until I go and pop this pill
I say out loud "You wanna let me cop a feel?"
Now I don't pray out loud but I know that my God heals
Bounce with me, if you don't give a fuck simply
Fed up, won't let up, on the overtime
The more I work, the more they wanna sweat mine
I can feel those lames, they love to speak my name
Sometimes dream of breakin' niggas whole faces
In front of the precinct, ain't scared of catchin' cases
Sky might fall, but I ain't worried at all
Got me some Xannies and a couple Adderall
Plus these racks I go distribute at the mall
In the spirit of God, with some Gandalf balls, yahm
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones that feel like shit on the daily
Don't let these phony niggas and hoes
Be the ones that bring you low
Let it be from the fatigue from making the pussy bleed
All of the things I've seen and survived
Make a nigga feel way more than just alive
You know my name, you know my face
All hail King WZRD in your motherfucking space
You love it
Everyday, ev-ev-everyday
Yep, yep, yep, yep, yep, yep-yah
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yep-yep, yep-yep-yep-yep, yep, yep
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
Yep-yep-yep-yep, yep, yep, yep-yah
Lord of the Sad and Lonely
And the ones who feel like shit on the daily
I got you
Now I can show you how to make it, no Domingo Dean
In a way in which the universe has never seen
I feel attention when I'm struttin' in my Prada boots
Checkin' my fresh, if you want, I can style you
So unearthly, my profession is to wow you
Nigga how you not better than me? Listen, I swear to Je'
I feel like Baby back in '99
In the SLS stuntin' and it's all mine
Shittin' on these niggas, sippin' on some Swiss Kriss
I got some jewelry on it, sittin' on my slit wrists
My label fucking up my flow, see I'm getting pissed
Work too damn hard fam, for the shenanigans
Don't hang around bums, and that's how I win, fe fi fo fum
Haters, how do my cum taste? No more fun, no jokes, no smiles
Just a grin that suggest I'm the best
Living like I got a motherfucking pump on my left at all times
So many kids live their life through my rhymes
See, I'm in love with you all 'til the end
When shit was dark for me you were my only friends on the realer
So smoke some tree for your nigga
Ain't nobody got my bounce, know my juicy ounce
Walk in rooms and fuckboys close their mouth
The Cud life, you know what we about
Lord of the Sad and LonelyHello, yeah
Uh, little homie, in the room
In-in the room, boy on the moon
 No one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my little homies
One year younger, they ain't get where I was going
Took a turn to the worse when my father left me lonely 
Lonely in my room
I-I mean me, up on the moon
Entertained myself, laughed at myself
As I grew to be a teen, I disguised myself
Had the lowest self-esteem, especially with the girls
Tried every sport just to impress all the girls
Instead of all the ladies, 'cause they talked down
I was too artsy, known to be a clown 
 And now my Facebook poppin'
'Cause I told the same girls I would be the hot shit
One day
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
Yeah, yeah, uh, big homie, made the move
Made-made the move, flew off the moon
Still  no one to hang out with
Talk that shit to just my Brooklyn niggas
All I would wonder is when will my time come
Had mad jobs and I lost damn near all of them
Thinkin' 'bout my bosses, yep I hated all of them
Studio at night had me hustlin' to most of them
Nigga, I was late damn near every day
But I'ma be on time when my stars align
When my soul was happy on my Ramen diet
Followed by a loosey, was the meal of grinders
If you knowin' the truth, all you think about is that thing
Always be a hater tryna shoot down any dream
Until you meet a kid like K-I
Niggas thought I was crazy, my mama know I stay high
We getting money, mom
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all had a clue about me
And none of y'all really knew about me
I was heavy-heavy-heavy on my grizzle
And none of y'all really cared about me
And none of y'all really cared about me
Now, guess what? I'm all you see, I'm all you see
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
I told you so
This will be my world
Yeah-ay-ohh-ohh
Yeah-ay-ohh-ohhWhat up, how is everyone doing?
You are now in a world I am ruling
Take a minute to adjust for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of fun and enchantment
I promise you some "generation next" shit
Speak for the silent who are left with
Parallel levels in a dark, dark place
Tricked all you niggas to a dark, dark fate
And guided you all with a smile upon my face
As the sun kisses us on our foreheads gently
Gentle with the drugs, heavy with the love
And my speeches on stage rock mountains from a club
Money doesn't move me except on the literal
G4 flights, now we're off to Australia
I wanna see more of the world
These are more than just words, these are facts from a winner
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side
What up, how is everyone feeling?
I hope you understand what you're hearing
Take a minute to roll up for the wondrous
Clusterfuck of darkness and evil
I will paint the Yin and the Yang for you
And my jeans are Dior for the love of skinnies
Upgraded, faded aided to the T
Work hard, making sure I don't become a memory
Hard to press on when the memories remember me
And they always find the perfect moment
High speed, my momentum won't slow up none
Lost in the wind, I've lost all my friends
Maybe they were never meant to be acquainted
Money seems to make everything tainted
Everybody mad 'cause they stuck where I knew 'em last
Took what I wanted and I did it all blunted, oh oh
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other side
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
We can meet on the other side
On the other side, ayy
This is a journey into the horizon
You can see past, if it's real to you
Then we can meet on the other side
On the other sideUhh, yeah, uhh

'Cause every day, every day, every day is sunny
Here in my dreams now
Welcome, yeah
Welcome
You're in my dreams
This is a dream come true
Finding the perfect words to sing to you
Here in my dreams
Everything plays out
Exactly how I want them to
Everything turns out dope
Right here in my dreams
Welcome, yeah
Welcome
You're in my dreams now
Long before we know ourselves, our paths are already set in stone
Some may never figure out their purpose in life and some will
There are a lot of us who are caught up in this hell we all live in
Content with being blinded by rules and judgment
We live in a world where it's more okay to follow than to lead
In this world being a leader is trouble for the system we are all accustomed to
Being a leader in this day and age is being a threat
Not many people stood up against the system we all call life
But toward the end of our first ten years into the millennium we heard a voice
A voice who was speaking to us from the underground for some time
A voice who spoke of vulnerabilities and other human emotions and issues never before heard so vividly and honest
This is the story of a young man who not only believed in himself but his dreams too
This is the story of the Man on the MoonA-B-C, A-B-C, A-B-C, A-B-C
1-2-3, A-B-C, A-B-C, 1-2-3, A-B-C, A-B-C
1-2-3, A-B-C 
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Simple as that for your simple ass
Ask about that, pretty simple man
I'm dreaming on good for a sicker plan
Sicker than any other nigga could be thinking, and
I can't be a loser, could've figured that
I can't be a lame, I'm cooler than that
I feel I love the fame, then I hate it back, hmm
Thinking now what I should be twitterin' 
Why'd big bro take all the hot bitches?
Dear God, me too, I like the hot bitches
I'll be the underdog, all along, 'til I'm gone
I will live through a song, I'll be strong through the haters
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that 
As simple as that for your simple ass 
As simple as that, as simple as that 
As simple as that for your simple ass 
As simple as that 
As simple as 
Uh, simple as that for your simple ass
Simple way I wish you would've called it how it should've been
They try to tell me they don't get it, they don't underdig
Now I'll be damned I came this far to let a fool live
I gotta terminate the hate, spread the positive
Without it being wack and cheesy to the little kids
So I curse like a sailor and I smoke weed
I am exactly who an older rapper's kids be
And who they love, hands to the universe
Probably think they drug addicts if they spit a Cudi verse
Mad lil' mama switch to Converse without a purse
Long as the booty lookin' juicy and he stylin' on 'em
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that  
As simple as that for your simple ass
As simple as that, as simple as that
As simple as that for your simple ass  
As simple as that 
As simple as 
As our hero seems to be dreaming in peace
A dark chapter unfolds
Throwing Scott into the most eerie
And unstable part of his imagination
So intense he cannot tell his dreams from reality
This is the Rise of the Night TerrorsYeah, wassup?
Mmmhm nigga, yeah it's me 
Yeah, I’m back baby
Cudi, hey
Ottoman couch, how handsome your furniture
Lovelier now, but dressed for funeral
Begging you to sit for a portrait on the wall
To hang in the dark of some parliamentary hall
Huh, stay home a lot, no TV 
Just thoughts, and a heap of good weed 
Same jeans, same old Converse
Bape tees and the Walees, so works
I'm cool, some niggas mad at it
Lookin' in from the outside, fantastic
Can't keep the negative alive
They be on my dick, if Kid Cudi die
Don't cry hater, I forgive 
Now go and get my album and get off my dick 
I smile and I’m pleasant, the weed is the essence
But if I’m in the club, we gon’ tear this shit up
I’m talkin' 'bout shots, ridiculous amounts 
Cause if you’re gonna rage, should be all about 
Take, take another shot or you’re soft
Dream On campaign I’m the mother lovin' boss 
Haters suck my balls, two time 
I never say goodbye 'cause I’m on mine
All my life, wanna do some' major
Now every little thing I do might make it in the paper 
Cudi found y’all nigga, po-po 
Mad drunk in the street, no photo 
Hatin' motherfuckas, don't know yo
I guess this was the life I chose
Wanna get up in my mind
Wanna know about me and Amanda Bynes 
Wanna know really, really, really who I’m datin'
Is she civilian or super duper famous? 
Is she African American, Caucasian, or Asian? 
Or maybe Spanish 
It don’t matter my nigga, I love them all
As long as she don’t need stupid amounts of makeup
To makeup the self esteem 
Selfish dreams can reflect the blessing
I am tap dancing on a cloud 
Successful raps, I might scream out loud 
Puttin' it down, for all I met 
Talking fans, I won't quit 
I’m puttin' it down, for all I met 
Talking fans, I won't quit 
Hey hey hey, whoa whoa whoooa 
Hey, whoa whoa whoooa 
Stoned, go smoke some more weed
Hey, whoa whoa whoooa
La la la la la la
Goodbye"Now certainly, we all recognize the extremely, extremely low probability of life existing on the moon."
Hmm, hmm, alright
Hmm, hmm, hmm
Drinking again, drinking again
Bottles up, I'm in it to win
With none of my friends, just me and this bottle
People say that I'm off, say that I'm off
I wouldn't doubt it if you were me
Free as a bird, flying over mountains
And I don't know where I'm going
But I'm going
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening
Hate what I see, hate what I see
I'm over it, I need me some change
Something to feel good, get me on a level
No, no, no need to cry, no need to cry
You straighten up, you're such an adult
You pay all your bills, yet you are a zombie
And you don't know where you're going
But you're going
It's all happening
I'm going
It's all happening
We're going
It's all happeningHit 'em
Plain Pat, what up
I ain't playing no more
Hey
This is my story, this is my song
If you feel it, motherfucker, you can't go wrong
To the screw-face niggas, what you on?
Get off that, get a goal and focus dog
See, I'm what you need, you fiending now
Ask around and I bet you'll figure out
How to zone and control your future, wow
Yeah, I think I'm in the future too
I'm unlike fools who proceed to choose
To be like them, I be like who
I be like me, Mister K-I-D
S-O-L-O, D-O-L-O
See, the Lord adore me
He met me half way
"No guts, no glory"
I always say
So until I reach what I came here to find
Along with inner peace, life will always be a grind
One day I'll be what the world want me to be
I was born to be super-duper Scott
The one bad bitches called super-duper lame
Now super-duper fame gets me super-duper brains
86 the cape, but I'm super-duper high
Soaring past the moon, a super-duper lonely guy
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in, hey
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
For even in Hell I still have faith
To one day be free with my Father at the Gates
But make no mistakes, I'll show you what time takes
To be a success on Earth, mixed with all the hate
I stand on my pivot, my life, you could not live it
For the things that I've seen have been too damn explicit
But soon you will get it on a CD with some credits
I provide my grind, mixed with no edits
They say they don't want me when I'm fucked up and forgotten
Until I rise up amongst the evils trying to stop 'em
Slow down, bitch, my money is what I'm clocking
I'm tick-tocking, once I start, I ain't stopping
Such bullshit that my soul deal with
When my room's dim lit, I pray to God to help with, uh
My endeavors, in any kind of weather
Hoes be pleather-fake, so I erase 'em out my sim
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind
Now do you want to be him? Think twice
You'd commit suicide trying to read my mind
Down and out
Hey, down and out
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Hey, down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Hey, down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then
Looking for a substance to drown in
Down and out, so I'm out and down then

OK, OK this how we gonna do it
Plain Plat presents: 'A Kid Named Cudi'
Hello
All the time, nigga
All the grind, niggaMm , mm, mm
Mm 
Easy does it 
Easy does it 
Mm, mm 
Hello friends, Cudder again
Gotta smack 'em with some shit before the world ends
Same old denims, wore 'em for days
I'm at home makin' jams in many wonderful ways
I see in many wondrous shades
Peekin' out the shadows at a new landscape
I've been trapped in my mind, I've been tryna escape
Fame and loneliness, the recipe for disaster
I can't handle this shit, I'ma get plastered
I just wanna go fast, I'm a bastard
I won't stop 'til I'm where I wanna be in line
And there's so many things to do in the in-between time
That's to say I don't get lost and lose my fuckin' mind
Thinkin' 'bout the days I was broke fuck me up sometimes
How did I do it, why the kids love me so?
'Cause they connect with Cudder, real simple
Now let me set the groove with some cello
From the outside lookin' in, shit is mellow
But sometimes I wanted to shoot my fuckin' face off
I'm talkin' game over, defeated the boss
Hope with age, I can cope with my rage
I'm so damn passionate, there's no safe plane
To chill or dwell in, I'm always in the zone
Why did God let Hell in? To test a nigga?
Man, listen, I'm tryna find a way to tuck this nina in my skinnies
It's kinda tough, I don't see how they did it in the '80s
My angels ride for me at all cost
My dad is tellin' me, "Don't stress, go and floss"
"Live a little," I got you, pop
Love, Kiddo, my negro
Somebody better save them, God
'Cause young Scott Mescudi stayed on his job
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents 
Put the flow in the bag, kept it sealed on 'em
What I'm drivin'? Well it depends, so many things to ponder
Broke up with this girl, she was trippin'
Couldn't understand my life in the world, I can't be stressin' 'bout it
My SLS is pearl, bitch, please don't call it white
Been that nigga even back when I was trippin' off that white
A jealous motherfucker, that's the shit that I don't like
You got a girl? Better love her, man, you gotta cuff her tight
Because so many people love the nerd
You ask about Cudder and I bet you fuckin' heard
They call me legend and I'm feelin' twenty-six
You mad, you mad, you mad Cudder in this bitch
I'm an unstoppable fucker, from the land where my niggas be
Bumpin' "1st of tha Month" with my fam, jokin', rollin' tree
You see this walk, you know my face
All hail King Wizard in your motherfuckin' space, you love it
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquents
The leader of the delinquents, delinquentsYeah
Element of the surprise
Such a spectacular thing I cannot, lie
So many things people wanna limit you to be
I show you a glimmer inside the spectrum of the wizard
Well known as a getter and a nigga with a plan
The negative that come out they mouth, so sad
When I smash, wipe the smirk off they face, my bad
Who bad? I am, my dad raised one hell of a man
At eleven I had to throw on the pants
Still don't feel appreciated and not by my own fam
All good, I'll be tucked away in them shadows
Workin' in sweats, solve the riddle and soon I'm ready for battle
Move my fans with my love and they move me with theirs
We unified by the dark and middle fingers in air
Come on, who gon' go half on a zone?
Oh, thought I would be done off that coke, no
Let me tell you some' ho
Ben said "Everything that shine ain't gold"
Been skeetin' on pretty faces then my heart switched cold
Been the nigga sittin' in hell in fresh ass clothes
I know what it feels like to have a broken nose
And ain't nobody hit you in it
It's really 'cause that shit that you snorted and put all in it
That time you thought I was finished, no I just experimented
And it helped me adjust and be ok, with being demented
By the way nigga, these cars ain't rented, I give a fuck who sees
So I don't bother rollin' tinted, look who the fuck it be
That skinny Cleveland niggie, I stay reppin' my city bitch
Been smokin', no jokin', Cudder's had that itch, so I scratch
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back
So please no more speculation 'bout that
Burn baby, burn, truthfully and noted, I'm back
Niggas think I'm livin' life paranoid
Mothafuck that, man

Askin' God to help 'em, are you hearin' me?
Girl is tellin' me she don't know what she want
Lotta demons creepin' up, they're livin' underneath
Gotta take a minute, y'all, traveled far
Feelin' somethin', no, I can't ignore my instincts
Back just where I started, it's the same old damaged song
It's the shit I need
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at

 Something 'bout the night that keep me safe and warm
Just me, the universe, and everything I think
Lotta shit is weighin' on me, it's a storm
Never thought I would be back here bleeding

You can see my life, how I grew, I want serenity
Tryna find it on the right track
Oh, wanna be just where the free at
Talk to Him, He don't speak back
Hm, can't lose, I'm in the third act

I won't stop 'til I crash and burn
Tell my mom I'm sorry
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
Hm, hear me now, hey
This time I'm ready for it
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in me
I been here before, hey, hey
I been here before, hm
Can't stop this war in me
Can't stop this war in me, in me, in me
And the story goes, hey, hey
As the story goes, hm
This fight, this war in me
This fight, this war in me, in me, in meAin't the type to let you tell her what she needs
Ain't gon' sit or stand around
A lethal love, I leave 'em sick, mamacita on me
No, one touch is never allowed
She said, "What do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want, what do you want?
What do you want, what do you...?"
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? 
Where you going? 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I need a winnin' woman, a Wonder Woman
A Gal Gadot, sophisticated and hot 
She knowing what she doing, like the music here
When she step on the scene she could light up the block 
Sittin' all, took her, make her awesome
Civil hearts hid them whole love back in a custom
Ain't too many women, I know
Who could look at your soul, just from lookin' at you
I heard she got these niggas fallin' at her feet
She kneels to no one with her golden crown
You'd be the one to b-bow
You'd be the one to b-bow
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark 
Have mercy on me, put some magic on me
Be my guide in the dark, guide in the dark
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? Yeah
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
So when did we become so sophisticated and smart
And tryin' so hard that we forgot that we were animals?
But never her, I never heard a creature make such sounds
It never would occur to people her up-downs
Convertible, would murder evil, pup-pup hounds, just been doggin' her
Courtesy and real love found, just been dodgin' her
Mr. Man, misogyny hands been massagin' her
If she ran and blew up her town, shit, I would pardon her
Put a part in her scalp, scratch her dandruff
Put her heart in your hand, she throw a tantrum
Better let her get that shit off, bug repellent
Hell, they've been telling her "Nah" since forever
Harold Melvin and some Blue Notes all she know
Murder, murder, murder, m-murder all she wrote
Perverted, she prefer to be hurted, claw her throat
All the dirty verdicts she learned watchin' soaps, yeah
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? 
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Semi-automatic with the passion when we makin' love
Never made it to the bed, sexin' on the living room floor
Now she on the warpath, homie probably best that you don't piss her off
Got this woman on the prowl, on the hunt, she gon' eat 'em all
And she know what she lookin' for, know what she lookin' for
She said she got herself some Louboutins, got herself some Louboutins
Not indecisive, indecisive at all
She know what she lookin' for, got her some Louboutins
Ooh, ooh
Where you going?
Where you going? 
Where you going?
Ooh, ooh, ooh, oohOhhhh, ahhhh
Ohhhh, ohhhh
Ummmm, ohhhh
Hold on, let me explain
Sometimes I just don't know what to believe in
And I hate things that I said, I didn't mean them 
So difficult tryna piece my thoughts
Don't wanna be no burden, I always piss you off
How could a man not wanna disappear? 
I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in, I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
Why all the fussin', I can explain
I know your heart is all in no one takes your place
I hate the man that I was, so unbecoming 
We're learning together anyhow
We're learning together right now
Facing the man that I was, tired of running
I'm exposed and I am pure
No one makes me feel secure
Except you and now we're all in
All in , I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
We're all in, all in
I am all in
Whatever happens, happens
Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All in, all in, all in
Happens, happens, happens, happens, happens
All, all in, all in, all in, all in, all in
Whatever happens, happensHeadbanger

These people love me man

These people love me
McFly-High
I come from Cleveland
Y'all can really hear it now
Hit 'em like comic books
Kaboom! Pow-Pow
Into a girl's mind
Spit fine; no wine, dine
I keep two phones, sidekick for bad dimes
And a topical question is why I'm so chill
Girls don't understand, "He ain't even made a mill"
They say I'm complex just like the magazine
I wear my closet complex like the magazine
I get in their head
They don't even see my bread
Oh so, oh so fly
Cool as I wanna be, one hell of a guy
I keep 'em short and sweet, thick and petite
Ridin' alongside in my Cutlass Supreme
I'm from a place where old-schools are common 
Gotta explain every time I'm rhymin',  I be
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippin' cup out on the low
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes
And I say
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is my, my city 
Yup-yuppers, smile all the time while
I chop it up like Michael Watt's slow talk style
So the girlies can really catch all my accent
And the double-O got our own accent
Some niggas sell drugs to provide for they fam
Some niggas sell CDs up out they trunk, man
Some niggas they go to school for that higher learnin'
I play the O'Jays, while I'm turnin' lanes
We be on our shit
Freakin' Black & Milds, still controllin' the whip
Ain't no city like Cleveland
Cruisin' with my bad bitch in the evenin'
You wanna know exactly why I'm this way?
Take a trip to the land, swing this way
After the song done, ain't much I can say
Cleveland is my city
I be all day rollin' in my whip
Got my sippin' cup out on the low
I keep two pretty women by my side
I'm cooler than a polar bear's toes
And I say
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm leanin'
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is the reason I'm cool
Cleveland is that,  Cleveland is the 
Cleveland is my, my cityOh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, every bottle
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Woah, woah, ah
Hmm, hmm, hmm, hmm
Ah, ah, ooh, yeah, yeah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream
Somethin' twisted in me
Say, "I'm waitin' to die," I cry
Many nights I spent gettin' fucked up, livin' a lie
Prayin', I'm just fed up, this tequila in me
Don't tell me to be cool, this is how cool I can be, woah
You can try and read my mind
Been pushin' it for days, I'm on a mission to climb, woah
Losin' rеality, been sayin' I'm fine, try my hardest to sleep
Too many issues bubblin', say I'll work through it
How? Think thеy knowin' what the problems are
Had me goin' crazed through the city while I burn it down
This is just my way, keep on prayin' for me
Lonely on my ride as I fly, arms is open wide
Don't wanna leave without sayin' bye
Had a rough night, finna sip some
Don't even worry 'bout it, waitin' 'til the Devil comes
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Deep in Hell in dark corners
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody
Can't hear me scream 
He's callin' me
So much gone while I blow off steam
And the shit's the same
Oh, look at that, only you to blame 
It's like I'm swimmin' towards another bona fide life
It's like a fairy tale, wantin' more
But inside I'm vexed, used to question, why
Lord, he show me that I'm tested and I'm gonna fly
I ain't slippin', no, that's not for me
Be who you are, don't be nothin' less, please
Hear me, Lord, don't ever leave, see
I'm a man in the night in these dark streets
Somethin' else, how it felt
Take a drink, I live in excess, nothin' left
Every minute slippin' away, this is hell
They were warning him, figured he'd be cool, who's the fool?
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it 
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody 
Deep in Hell in dark corners 
Deep in my dreams perceived, nah 
Yeah, I take it, they don't know 'bout it 
Yeah, I take it, I don't need nobody 
Can't hear me scream 
Somethin' twisted in meHey
Seen nothing like that shorty with the fat back movin' to the vibes 
Say, "I'm just up in my habitat, playin' little Ratatat, kickin' with my tribe" 
I'm sayin' it's a known fact, show 'em, nigga, no act, sucker, fall in line 
I'm out to get mine, woah, woah, niggas seein' me shine 
Catch me baked outside, wonderin' daily, why, why?
Will she let me get behind? Baby, just close your eyes 
You see we takin' off, leave the stress, no time 
This ain't televised, see I'm her surprise, I
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, ooh, that vibe
Ooh-ooh, I need those fuckin' vibes
Doo-doo-doo-doo, and we ragin' 'til daylight
Things are gettin' gnarly, got my whiskey by my side
Soarin' through my world and I'm 'bout to take a dive
This is just the sadness in me, sad times
Just another evening and I'm leanin', oh 
Uh, ready, go, set, we won't hold you, neither 
Salute when you see that nigga 
Tell him, "Go off," when you see him, greet him 
Talkin' shit, fuck ya, legend of the cold one, nice
This my life, all my nights
Walkin' like a disco ball, all this ice, aye
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Ayy, ayy, ayy , ayy 
Slightly paranoid, can't believe 'em simply 
Nah, bullshit, miss me , ahh
Call it what it is then, lies
This my fantasy high, sayin' goodbye
I lay at night, it intensifiesMm-mm, yeah
Mm-mm
In the dead of the night, I have these dreams
What'll happen to me? Will I burn out?
Have I been wrong? What does it mean?
All these things, can't understand why
Say something's wrong with me, I know
By myself alone driving, I go
Full moon as it glows, I search for truth
Tryna be brand new, yeah, I will try
No, I won't do but through these screams
Fighting and bleed, blood in my eye
And I'll be 
God save me 
Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama 
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high 
This for the sad pеople who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journеy, you learn me
Close call, life on the edge
Ahh, when the time comes, I'll find peace
Still in search of, nights, I'm sittin' wishin'
I can find love in me
Lettin' go, ooh, this ain't livin'
I swim in pain
Never drown, keep my head up above the waves 
Tired of runnin', I won't run from fate
Late night, ooh, this is when I come alive, when the dreams made
Take me, ooh, just don't leave, babe
Come on, woah 
Scars on my heart, woah 
Yeah, baby, see I'm back in my zone
Just what I need, mama 
Nigga been in hell, the same ol'
On a mission and I'm gonna fly high 
This for the sad people who keep the blunt burning and we
Off on a journey, you learn meI done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
Tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can't stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
And it hurts
Cut me down, slice me deep, I dare you
Burn my crown, spit on my grave, I’ll make you
See my face, see my face, I’ll haunt you
Deep in the dark, behind your eyes, I’m on you
Salt of the Earth, bird of the Heavens, you hear them
All in the hell, the hollowest halls, don’t fear them
Here I am, the warrior man
Here I stand, the warrior man
But I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding
My heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
I done tried it all, tried it all, hey
Done tried it all, I can’t stop this internal bleeding
And my heart is leaking, heart is leaking out
And it hurts me*Yawn*
Shit...
Man...
Dream on, dream on...
Hey...
These voices they tell me go
Why should I ever go?
Man I'm so comfortable here
Why should I head to a place where people live in fear?
Standoff-ish to really hear
Somethin' they can really feel
But see I'll never get
Why the earth is a puzzle that I'll never fit
I'm not of their world
So why should I leave my sanctuary?
Man, the whole thought of that is scary
How do I know that their kind will truly hear me out?
Will they understand I'm flyin' from a different route?
Posed as a human being
Mother Moon tells me that people need my help
I guess these other cards she threw out and dealt
She said I gotta do it alone
She said I gotta do it alone
I guess I gotta go
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you mane
She said to pack my bags dog and never look back
This is something that I have to do
A hero to save the world
A hero with no girl or no family just sacrifice as a friend
And struggle is the enemy
But weed is the remedy
And if you get lonely boy you can just roll up a dutch and
Keep your head high
Wanna see home look at the sky
Remember you're not strange
But you are not the same mane
You gotta do it alone mane
You gotta do it alone
You gotta do it alone mane
Go on your own
It's bigger than you mane
It's bigger than you
It's bigger than you maneYup
Yup
Shades over my eyes
Make the creepers look back at themselves
Sittin' stuck, in emotional bliss
The skinny model girls rub coke on their gums
Tap my knee, I'm keepin' the rhythm
The young and wild take chances together
They all jump up, twist and groove
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood
There's a hunger in the night
The moonlight kissing the nips on a model frame
I kissed her inner thigh
Closed my eyes, she began to make me fish
She like to go the mile
All the while I could see her tear a bit
I forgot her name, somethin that sound like Penelope
Maybe a French twang to it
Her tongue was quick, she was French I knew it
A lovely foreigner, foreign to racism
She like that young nigga vibe
My brown skin, my shagged out 'fro
I'm king to her, and she will please her friend for me
So funny how the starvin' are guardless
Naked is always honest
Her hands all over my privates, lost in the mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the mood
But no one talks, lost in the motherfuckin' mood
No one talks, lost in the mood
No one talks, sweatin' it out, lost in the moodIffy, can't decide which one I want
All the girls at the party, come along, it's a party we started 
Mixin' drinks, how much? Who knows
I pour one out for dead homies , the dearly departed, baby 
Ain't missin' the moment, ain't no spillin' 
Dude, I been livin', illin', tryna find it then I'm peelin'
You feel it?  All's good until I hit the ceilin'
Good riddance, I figured I'd be straight, just need a minute, just a second 
How it's been on overload in my zone, gone
Nothing else can fix the problem but this herb grown, grown
Yes, that there, it got mе on one 
Ain't no tweakin', I'm professional
Bеtter give a nigga room, I be back, round two
It's the soldier in me , let them fuckers envy 
Goin' 7th Heaven-bound, who goin' trippin with C? 
The rager from the dark 
Day fades and the sun goes away 
Same old nigga and the same old pain 
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day 
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all 
Drop it , had me at "Hello", we in the spot
Can not stop it , ragin' with familiar, lames think they got it, not 
And you see me twistin' on the low, there he go
Yeah, baby, there he go, yeah, really, really 
Won't be out there lookin' crazy, hazy, ho 
And it's like I surf the waves forming in my dome
We keep floatin', hopin', coastin'
Ragin' through the day, sexy baby, turn me on-on 
Hear me out, hear me, hear me
Come on, ready or not, nigga comin' with it
Come on with the team, hear me, hear me
Oh no, hit 'em up and I'm rippin', rippin', isn't he? 
And I'm comin' full-blown to the tombstone 
How I'm livin', gotta push it, gotta set the tone 
It ain't nothin' to me, baby, say I'm livin' wrong 
 Day fades and the sun goes away 
Same old nigga and the same old pain 
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all
Thank God I saw another day 
But I can't go escape what I have made, nah
Ain't much change in me, y'all 
Seem like ain't nothin' change in me, y'all 
Hey, oh, hey, oh

Right on track, right on and I'm back
Rap Ex-Lax yeah, I be pooin' on ‘em
Damn right, Mr. Cudi he be dippin' on ‘em
Say it loud, y’all want the new-new
Explorer like Dora, that’s how I got a clue too
So fucking underground, barely on Youtube
'Till Day N Night, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ’s un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker
And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some thing for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
And, just when it seems that the game is hopeless
Rearrange some things for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
Do my little dance, sippin' out a cup
All my people in the back, my people in the front
I, I do, what I do
And I, I do, what I do, do
Do my little dance, sippin' out a cup
Pullin' up my pants, she come walkin' up, and I'm like...
I, I do, what I do
And I, I do, what I do, do
Whoah, Nigga!
Y'all motherfuckers need to understand the fuckin' game
Shit ain't gon' change unless a motherfucker come in this shit, switch it up
Niggas need to open they fuckin' minds, Nigga!
'Cause this is some shit, that y'all niggas ain't ready for
Ya underdig, ya understand me?
Movin' wit out movin', pure crush froovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
You make songs about some new dances
I make songs 'bout the black man advancements
I'm talkin' classic homie, I'm talkin' monumental
And I don't need much but Dot instrumentals
That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big
And I'mma say it right before the hook
Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000
And dream about an island wit model girls eyein'
Um... hello
Hey baby
Um... yeah
Some people call me Cudi, some people call me Scott
It don't matter what you wanna call me, as long as you call me something
As long as you call me, baby
But um...
You know...
You seem real pretty
And I ain't talkin' bout how you look
I'm talkin' 'bout your, your vibe
Your vibe is pretty
I'm pretty hungry, you want to go get something to eat?
Sip on something?
Where we going?
The moon...I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
Liquor all night, love it
Untamed youth, the Coupes moves like bullets
I guess the fact my father smoked and drank
Made it a young nigga destiny to do the exact same
Young wild'n all, me and my Codys
Watch the phonies, and hoes that claim they blew me
Dark skin China doll with the fake tits
Ice grillin' my Spanish chick, word
We all in together, now we off it
Cops be buggin', shotguns on the whip
Fuck 'em, I would never sweat for a piggie
You can catch me high, it's all good, no biggie
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young

Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
Four in the morning, gettin' cozy
So much Goose I let the fires soak it up some
Tuesday weekly, the Legend of the Rager
Most have witnessed the Cud in the club
We don't have Plain Pat ready
Ice is thrown and the whole crew gone
Done off for better and very celebratory
Fuck the blogs, I'ma tell my story
No matter the phase, my name is engraved
In the minds of the youngins who be livin' to they graves
You live and you learn
Doing bumps in the day and keep blunts to burn
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
Rage, 'cause I'm paid
Take the grey, and create another shade
Awesome, no more bitches playin' possum
Pop and lock 'em and send 'em on home
Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose
Know the code, want a woman with some toes
Optimos, takin' trips to Australia
Do some blow and hope you make it through the show
Hands, high
Go with your soul and try floatin' through the sky
Hide the pain with some pussy and Mimosas
Costa Rica next on the agenda
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young

Wild'n 'cause I'm young, wil-wild'n 'cause I'm young
I be wild'n 'cause I'm young, I be wild'n 'cause I'm young
And I'll be wild'n 'til I'm chillin' old
Kcuf a evig t'nod tsuj uoy semitemos
Tihs tuoba erac t'nod tsuj uoy semitemosHave you ever felt
Something evil
Lurking around
The moon is full
The streets are empty
Shadows cover the town
You can't call it
You can't shake the feeling
Quiet do not make a sound
But the wind seems to speak
Something's here in the room with me
I know that something is wrong here
I can feel it but no one believes me
I know that something is strange here
I can sense it but no one believes me
I feel like something is wrong here
I can sense it but no one believes me
I'm not crazy hell no I'm not loony
I'm not insane
Take a second
I heard it
I know it
Whispers say my name
Calling for me
Where do I go
Where should I runYou can depend on Cud Life to kill it
Having guillotine dreams with my enemies, oh
See 'em in the ditch, see 'em out, hit the exit
Can't stand to hear a bitch nigga mouth
I took a hook in the road to get in the mode, geronimo
Get in my jeans, white tee, and clean fitted
Hoes know me 'round the map, I can't hide the old summers
Hit the fuse and I lit it, the rest unfolds
Tell me how the fuck does he does it?
Levels unreachable, can't pin him to a mold
It's like a nigga been here before
Shit is a bore, my thoughts soar in the AM
Slay them like a machine round the clock
With the 12 gauge aim, telling Satan to fuck off
Hated the hand I was given
Tossed that shit back, like God must be kidding
And not for a nigga like me, not for the family
Not with a similar plans I just dumped
And I made me some choices, heard voices follow
No, can't stop a man with passion
These hoes don't distract a god, I am no clown
Grown man laying the stones all around in my throne
My kingdom, throwing from space
Fuck off expression on face, this is the case
I'm in place to be great, hmm
No fakes, raising the stakes
I'm in place to be great, hmm, hmm, hmm
Uh, doing music, TV and movies
Sitting on the floors we ain't heard of
And the media wanna act like I ain't out here 
Running laps around these hoes 
Running the game with no cheat codes 
Unfuckwittable with two T's nigga, who else but Cud?
Give a motherfuck

Thought the kid dough cause I'm in a oven often
The kush in the lungs, a bushel of nugs
Awaken the dope, but they never dissolve the coke
Got the homies in the hood and they wanna rage on
Fast lane, pushing to the limit
Uh, enjoy the spoils, but don't bask in it
But see, I really wanna get me a farm and grow crop
Live with some girls who love me and this cock
The more I grow, the more I double in powers
Non-ambitious for cowards, trippy go for toe
Won't be a drone clone, half-hearted
Sheep in the herd, brainwashed at what cost
I'm a raise some hell, you know this
And if I piss people off along the way, bonus
Cause these niggas are stale chips
All around thinking they're fresh with the stale shit
And corny bitches need corny niggas, that's well fit
God has a plan for everybody but I'm it, Chosen
Scotty 'bout to even the mood, get lost in the tune
Forget it all, take flight my doves
Say we are the, we are the knights in the world
Listen baby can you see in the club, we gettin' bent up
The sun up, egg, cheese, sunny-side up
I'm waiting for you, and taking the cue
Having a drink, let's make it a few
Here's to you, you, you, and you
Salute, hmmm, I bid you adieu
Salute

You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it, hmmm
You keep fronting for that new nigga and- and we know it
You blew it
Uh, I know you still think about me
I could tell he knows, he probably saudy
No more dodging this shit, the cat and mouse
Finding love in the shadows, ready to pounce
They yearning for my return
Laying next to him, you daydreaming of my meat
You remember when I said, "Put it on my face"?
Damn, girl, when will you learn? There's no escaping me
Passion never dissipates, no soul without your mate, relate
Man, I could've never fathomed
Hate you mingling with these corny niggas, though I don't care how it happened
It's cool now, 'cause I'm home
Sloppiest sex, the best way, we're both giving dome
Uh-uh, until the break of dawn
I gotta, getcha, getcha, getcha on, on
You know I'm the only one to get you revved up
Spread it open, pound it 'til it's numb, yum
In bed you would play a vision that's too thotty
Like, what's on your mind, babe?
One blink and you're caught lying
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like I
"I'm so through with him," she says
"I hate her," he says
The makeup sex is electric
He smiles her gazes
Her sun on gray weeks
Translates her heartbeat
"My leg's shakin'," she says
He grabs the back of her neck
And they live a little, mmm
And they live a little
Give a little
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to everyone
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
You fronting for that new nigga and, and we know it
Hmmm, hmmm-mmm-mmm-mmm
The curse of once dating an awesome nigga
Can't duck my energy, ever
Such a curse is a curse if you make it so
Which means we in control until forever
So stop wasting your fucking chi
Stop searching, chasing your tail
Running in circles to no destination
Remember we once saved each other from hell?
I'm never tryna persuade
You gotta figure what you want in you
I'll be clear, I'm a hell of a man
Flaws and all, somebody would love to have me, too
But you can tell I'm bored with these hoes
Sex is weak when there isn't a glow
Takes a man longer to see this fact
Women are quicker with this type of shit, we know
Uh, uh, show me the lane, dude
I'll be speeding down that bitch, I'm going straight to you
Uh, always knew you still thought about me
Now cut the doubt
Lying, lying entirely to everyone
Distant yearnings and fantasies
Keep lying, you keep lying entirely to every one
There isn't another soul who knows your soul
Like I, quite like I, quite like I, quite like I
Yeah, quite like I, quite like IAnd we're floating out to nowhere
No safety, fall, we'll land safely
Inadequate, feeling so unwanted 
Make him want to disappear 
From the fire calling 
Damn, that is so unfair
Inadequate, feeling he is so unwanted 
Make him want to disappear 
From the fire calling 
Damn, that is so unfair
How could I care? How could I care?
How could I care?
And we're floating out to nowhere
No safety, fall, we'll land safely 
Lost in my reflection, how do I chill?
Only crazy makes sense, hmm, it's starting to make sense
While I'm still
Her vagina is moist and warm
I'll keep you safe, just hold my arm
Hell is beyond the door
Heaven doesn't want one more
No more chicken sandwiches
Yes, I'll pay for the damages
I explore through the galaxy nightly, numb my body 
Accept yourself, except yourself
Exit yourself, access yourself
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
Inadequate, feeling so unwanted 
Make him want to disappear
No safety, fall, we'll end safely
"That song was kinda freaking me out, Butthead. 'And we're floating out in nowhere...'"
"No safety, fall, we will land safely, Beavis."
"Kind of makes me think about my life, you know?
"What life?"
"Yeah, yeah, exactly. The part like, you know, 'we're floating out in nowhere...'"
"Don't worry, Beavis, we will land safely."
"How come you're talking like that, Butthead?"
"Like what?"
"Come on, stop it."
"I'm not talking any differently than I normally talk, Beavis. Take some of these mushrooms that Cudi gave us, they'll make you feel better."
"Stop talking like that, Butthead."
"Like what, Beavis?"
"You're freaking me out."
"Take some mushrooms, Beavis. Take some."
"Oh boy, these mushrooms suck. But they're fast acting, aren't they? These taste horrible."
"Eat them all, Beavis."
"They're doing something. Hold on a second. Give me some more."
"Come with me, Beavis, to burning man. Take some."I've been tellin' these niggas

Built a whole empire in the city of the damned

Seashore with a bad bitch, pretty feet in sand
Might eat her in the Aventador, The Silence of the Lambs
I remember payin' twenty for a damn gram
Now I can't leave the plug without a pound in my hand
Boy, we know you not a thug, without a doubt in my head
It be niggas that you love that'll run their mouth to the feds

Two warriors, some soldiers 
Trippie alley-oop, pull up, landed in the coupe 
Niggas know the truth, far as you? Can't call it 
Got a bunch of niggas say you fake, maskin' and ballin'

Hands are out the roof, try and touch the sky 
And I'm yellin', "Do it," doin' how you like now

Tell 'em this the sequel to 
All them days that I was faded, figured I was through
Hmm, seem the days ain't the same now

Watchin' for these fuckers, never see me slackin', slippin'

I cannot trip kissin' your lips, kissin' between your thighs
Ooh, run it back, I'm needin' all your energy 
It's the life, you see, it's really got a hold of me
Burn this smoke while I'm thinking, "Man, will I survive?"
Just a nigga livin' in hell, my mama know I tried
But we free, the lonely, lonely 
As we watch the sunset
My mind is meltin' 
A thousand blunts, can't OD, ooh, but I'm hoping
This my paradise, I fly 
Hmm-hmm, hmm-hmmHave you ever been to heaven at night? Night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night
Have you ever been to heaven at night?
Closing your eyes, the feeling so right
At first you might see just one bright beam of light
Clutching your soul to the toll of the bright
Happy unites and feelings take flight
Blind to the evils, you give them no sight
Focus on floatin', your focus is tight
Like you rewrote an essay for a class, to pass in the night
Have you ever seen an ending so nice?
You feel so free, like you're high as a kite
Like how you feel if you drink some Bud Light, followed by Jag
Models who smile, then tilt their head back
These are a few of the visions I like
Mixed in with light, these are my favorites to dream in the night
This is my heaven at night
Have you
Ever been to heaven at night?
Heaven at night

Cover your wounds, don't show your scars
Smile for friends and carry on

Laying on a cliff, staring at the stars

To leap bounds
Soarin' over trees 
Oh look at me go 
In the middle of the day
I hear it in the prophecy, can't come down
It grows in my heart, not knowin' where it goes
Search through pain 
And the wishes with the rain 
I seem to deny all that blinding light
That only glows to those that really can't run
On just who they are 
It's clear as can be 
No need to lie into your emerald soul
You surely know gold is always in your glow
Why not let it shine? , hey

Most of my niggas back in Cleveland were plain dealers, uh
Who whipped Supremes, the candy-painted eyes
But the love from the boppers had 'him watchin they rise
Wasn't no love for a nigga in the smug
Sipping out a cup, a concoction for cruising
High off life? My nigga not even
I'mma go to war with the devil 'til we're even
Bobbing and weaving, spiritual hymn singing
No commentary my man, I come out swinging
And this will be the song that we sing
Any young nigga with visions when he's sleeping
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world?
Is there any love
In this world of ours?
Is there any love
In this world?Yo
Yo
Mmm
Ooh
Please, Lord, hear me now, hope you're listening
It's been centuries, least what it seems to me
I've been on this road, my eyes glistenin'
As I stare at Scott, I know he's all I got
Our pasts don't matter, babe, I'm much stronger
And fly much farther, soar overseas
Finally see, I'll keep on climbing
Ridin' the lightning and I am sure
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
But this is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide
I've been goin', goin' in circles
Reoccurring dreams, talkin' in my sleep
Then I'm floatin' up to the surface
I can finally breathe, I could do anything
And I don't know why it's alright
And it's not at the same time
Then I look up at a blue sky
And I know
At times I really didn't show
What was wrong with me, wrong with me
I told myself I cannot grow
Without lovin' me, lovin' me
This is just the hell that lives inside, hmm
Tell me now, where to? Please be my guide
Yo 
Yo 
Yo 
Mmm Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
I'm a madman, I cause problems that I truly never mean
I'm damaged, I trust no one, sometimes I can be real mean
To a magnitude extreme, I'm sorry but
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning
Pardon me babe, there are instructions I think that you should read
My heart it has no shell, I can sense everything
I love from deep inside, but there are pains I hope to fix
I have no bag of tricks, it's just you should
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, I'm so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, so fragile and delicate
Handle with care, here's your warning
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why, why
Why, oh why me, me?
Why, oh why me?
Beavis: "I don't know, Butthead. I'm feeling kind of... I don't know."
Butthead: "Wuss."
Teacher: "Come on, Butthead, m'kay? Sometimes when you have a very powerful artist like Cudi, it's possible that his songs invoke certain emotions and feelings and those feelings are valid, m'kay? You know, another thing that brings up some of these feeling is hallucinogens, which I know both of you have been doing, m'kay? So why don't you just sort of relax and maybe take this as an opportunity to meditate, m'kay? Go inside yourselves, look inward
Butthead: "Yeah Beavis, look inward. Look up your butt."
Beavis: "Shut up Butthead, your vibe's all wrong. You're not on the same frequency, butthole. You just don't get it Butthead, you just don't get it."Wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo, wee-ooo
Oh, wee-ooo, oh wee-ooo
Hmmm, of course we all have times when we're weak
Where you can not find the version of yourself you seek
You should dig deep
Hmmm, don't go through extremes, hmmm
Oh baby don't get so down, oh baby don't get so down
Now that you know, now that you know
Hmmm, here's what you do, you gotta dig deep, deep
Oh to find your truth, your truth will speak, speak to you
I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm
We all have times when we weep
It's a troubled life, traumatized psychologically
I pray, in the shadows when I'm speakin' to no one
Myself, did everything right, didn't I?
So why aren't I whole?
You know you better dig deeper
Don't lie to you
You better dig deep, deep
I'ma sew these wounds, I-I'ma sew these wounds myself
I'ma sew these wounds, I'ma sew these wounds myself
Hmmm, hmmm
I'ma sew these woundsKnock knock, CuDi open up, it's Chip
Gotta kush pack shells and some Henney we could sip
Keep a couple dolla's on, give a penny to a bitch
But I'm wit a couple ho's who said they really wanna get
Acquainted with some niggas who ain't the average niggas
They just wanna see why all they girlfriends be wanting pictures
I be flyer then a hundred gnats, worth a hundred hundred-stacks
I ain't gonna stop shoppin' till I hit a hundred sacks
Polo that's a given I ain't even gotta mention
Candy old-school put you niggas in detention
Slabbed niggas deeped-up tool in the clothes

Pimp tight get it right, homie, more or less

Oh, I rearrange faces when I drop

But get me to my fans, I'm country to the seas
Please, I stay up on my creep so to come up
Gotta look the part superstar, no stunnas
I'ma say some shit that make you think I lost my mind
I'm the only nigga that could watch the sun and don't go blind
She fine as she wanna be, but she wanna check, though
Dodging and popping pictures like the ho's was working with the law
Back in Shaker bitches, trynna play me to the left
Now I pick the hoes that I want and give my niggas what is left
I don't know if it's the name or the Bape gum bottoms

Hmmm, mhmm, mhmmI got some bad news this mornin'
Which in turn made my day
Lord help me out
Save my soul, need to find a new route
I don't even hear what other niggas talking about
Call me a hipster as long as you're a listener
Label me what you like
I'm close to my victory, dozed in the fight
When I open my eyes somehow seeing night
Beyond trying to see what being rich feel like
Six-figure checks, for my mom for peace
Everybody wants to stick on me like leech
Take my blood, give fake love, till I turn them down
I'm the one that who changed, bro?
Ask why I don't call cause when I was starving
You wasn't at all..around,now I gotta shut shit down
Be a man, pick friends, all selective now
You're cool, you're cool, fuck you
And to the bitch that's--oh yeah, fuck you too
Try to shine now everyone knows
Kid Cudi slipped up and loved them hoes
We all make mistakes, yes
No worries I just kill a bitch with success
While she at home stressed out eating ice cream
I'm at the Grammys living out a nice dream
No bitch on arm, just my words and my stoner charm
With my dimples deep, I smile at peace
Cause I went out and got what most y'all seek
Now I'm the one you meet
Who throws you the peace sign, missed not one step
And this is just the first step
God walks with me, but I'm still vexed
Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I've lived vicariously
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
How will my story ever be told now?
How will my story be told now?Hit me up, give no fucks
Gettin' busy out the cut , nigga, what?
And we do it to 'em, it's a pity, sing a song
Shy nigga, but I think she pretty , so it's on, baby 
Call to the lost, we deep, deep 
Had it all twisted, dead wrong 
How do I find what I can't see?
Lord, I was born to be strong 
Yes, yes, before I stress, I gotta get that feeling
This is just a sweet interlude, na-na
Amen, and the dice is thrown, they come in winnin'

In the mirror, used to hate what I'd see 
Healing but I'm dealing with some things, shit'll never stop
Just another Monday, burning indica with my bruh
See them lames, they rollin', smokin' mid, not me, Kid 
Never trip, I'll burn that clip then run it back, call Plain Pat
Haters crumble, I'm they enemy, crazy fucker, no, don't envy, get that, ooh

Turnt up
Now I don't give a fuck what niggas doing
I'm wearin' Balmain thousand dollar pants
Wake up, bake up, then I'm in my Benz
Come to think about it, don't have many friends
Go to brunch by my damn self
Flirt with girls when they see my car
Fuck 'em when they see that I'm a star
Never ever open up or show my heart
It's the coldest winter in the summer, dawg
Many women, mothafuck 'em all
They just really want to train a dog
I'm a real nigga to the core
Off top baby girl further more
Pedal to the metal to the floor
On Mulholland while I'm hitting corners hard
Yeah I gotta hit them corners hard
I guess I'm just a lost cause
Just a skinny nigga with so many flaws
Starin' in that night, tight jawed
Fingers digging right inside my palm
Waitin' waitin' for the calm
Seem to think I know what's goin' on
I'm finally comin' alive
And it seems the ghost is movin' on
You know what that is? I told you what that is, that's a alien bruv, believe it
See, I could never have a desk job
My work take a nigga abroad
Meeting up late with foreign broads
Relaxing cause a nigga hustle hard
Man I gotta take a load off
Need a dime that'll take her clothes off
Took a trip out to Doha
Filmin' short films on a whim
Got dinner in a few with prince Sheikh
Kanye changed a nigga life twice
Gotta ride, gotta rep, ay
Getting rid of all the dead weight
Niggas really want me dead, hate
Not my fault I'm intriguing
Drinkin' and drivin': no weavin'
Pop a molly, feelin' ten again

Can't ever do a damn thing right, you'll never be shit
They called him the loser, loser boy
And you'll never be anything but a fucking lowlife
Look at you, dumb stoner little boy
You'll never be nothing nigga, don't get this shit twisted
Oh, we shall see what fate shall bring
Stay tuned, stay tuned
Stay tuned, stay tuned
Yow, yow, help me, yow, how, yow, hey!
Yow, yow-yow-yow-yow, how, yow, how how how, yeah!
Hey! Hey!
Choose your potionHands up, we back in, born in the rage
Untamed, break free, beast out of the cage
Sky rainin' down flames, it's a war on the heavens
A beautiful scene in the night behind light
And much like that, when I'm dreamin', I'm in flight
Coast out of site, though I'm feelin' I'm not right
And Hell's got one hell of a grip, no shit
Your boy best not slip, get stuck in your grave
Just to live another day, fightin' through decay
Call on my angels and I kneel as I pray
Got my mind, my soul and my heart on the same wave
It took me a minute, now I'm all in it, damn
While I'm out of the dark, I push it to the limit, friend
So ready, I'm sharp, here comes the demolition man
Pack 'em up and just hittin', aimin' and never missin'
Servin' up the prescription, no time for intermission
Rippin'
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oh, no
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Nooooooo, oh
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Yeah, yo
Yeah
The world's got hope in the city with a reward
Made for the pain, it's a battle I'm runnin' toward
Call to the don, I'm embracin' it to the core
Forced into fightin', get ready for many more
And I'm for mine from the jump, I ride or die with the pump
I'm squeezin' for that release, I aim and let it dump
I hear a roar of a sound, I'm feelin' it through the ground
Mayhem in the city, escapin' but I am found
I rise up amongst the many with no fear
Full squad, we at it, we finish 'em all, clear
Through the rubble, we rumble, never runnin' from trouble
Keep my head on a swivel, you know I'm scorin' for double
Searchin' for that release, swimmin' at it, repeat
Wash your hands of them sins and fightin' 'til we see peace
It's the least we could do in a world that needs the brave
Know the lost can be saved, survivin' the end of days
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Findin' my way, somethin' is guidin' me
Feel it come along, comin' on and I know
Fight 'til I'm done, it's just the rage in me
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oh, no
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Nooooooo, oh
Someone will say, "What is lost can never be saved."
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh
Despite all my rage, I am still just a rat in a cage
Oooooh, oh, oh-ohhhh

We got you 
Yeah 
Do it all day for the kiddies 
Real-life dreamers in the suburbs and the cities 
Ridin' 'round town, windows up, steamin', beamin' 
Singin' along to it in the cut, heavy streamin' 
Mama don't know what a lil' nigga feelin' 
Daddy been gone and my brothers stay trippin' 
For every lil' homie that's lonely
This is all for you, give a fuck about the phony 
All in the plan, as you grow, make the moments last 
Even though in life, it seems the shit moves fast
Codе to the realest, hands high, feel this 
Smoke one to the head, but remember, shit's vicious 
Never lose hope, if you don't, you'll be golden 
Always keep your family close, keep your heart open
Here's to the chosen, solo dolo rollin', hm
This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to 
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through 
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-oh
This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to 
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through 
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-oh
Since day one, I been tryna feel alive 
Doin' what I wanna, go fast and hold tight
Seein' what I'm seein', the pain, I will write 
Ooh, we're children in the night 
Nigga with a vision, hope it come into fruition
Yeah, I know it well, dreamin', intermission now
Things are gettin' better, waited my whole life, oh, my, my, my, my 
As we glidin' through the streets
This is just the moment where you truly feel free
Got my blunt up to the heavens , tell 'em not to worry, no 
Guided by the moon, how I do what I do 
Everything's copacetic, push the limit 
Been in this hell so long
I know soon, peace will find you 
This is just the right vibe
Stars in the sky
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone 
This is just the right vibe, turn it loud if you need to
Stars in the sky, they will light your way through
Feelin' alone, just know you are not
We won't leave you alone, oh-ohHear me out

Middle finger up to the people who don’t like you
Who have no valid reason to say they never liked you
We don’t give a fuck fam
So what?! We never liked you niggas anyway
Pardon my wizard talk, but I’m elevated
No drank, no tree and I’m levitated

Places to go cause I need to build a travel log
I travel while you jake niggas run a blog
Now run along, I got some shit that needs posting

Two older brothers
And a single-parent mother who
Worked her ass off, did the best she could
There was nothing they could tell him
Let the boy know he wasn't worthless
Even though he was in the same home
He had felt alone, his pet gerbil passed on
He was so bored in the winter

His father had left him
White church, sitting in the front row
All-white casket closed, he won't see him no more
He tried to disguise himself
Made sure that no one could tell
That in his soul, there's a wide-open hole
Something scarred him, so he can't let him go
He won't
He was so bored in the winter

Instant pain, heyCrush a bit, little bit, roll it up, take a hit
Feelin' lit, feelin' right, 2 AM, summer night

People told me slow my roll, I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
I'm screaming out "Fuck that", I'm screaming out "Fuck that"
Fuck that, fuck that, fuck that, fuck that

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it, I'll be good
I'm on the pursuit of happiness and I know
Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold
Hey, I'll be fine once I get it
Tell me what you know about dreams, dreams?

Everything that shine ain't always gonna be gold

No need to worry, this the story of my life
I was high when the label said that I was dope
I was high in my eyes cause I had hope
I was high When I first had the taste of love
I was high when I left the city I was from
And I was low when I had a recent heartbreak
I was low cause I truly thought I had a mate
I was low when I lost her over silliness
I was low cause she twisted what my words meant
But I was high when I finally had the chance to see
Everything that's pretty ain't always good for me
I was high when she first said I like you
Man I must be too high to even write, dude
And these things show you growth
Some niggas show a little
But I'll show you the most
Highs and lows and succeed for sho
The only thing left to do is say a toast
Cause...
I be high, then I be low
I be low, then I be high
It's like a battle knife to a gun fight
But I be cool, this the story of my life
I be high, then I be low

Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Float in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
Sit and watch the embers, claw marks on the sleeve
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I realize there are no answers to rid me of this cancer
Still I really gotta leave, see I really gotta leave
Drown in a sea of emotions, taken over by fatigue
I told you I had to leave, I told you I had to leave
Hold my hand in heaven, count the heartbeats and count the seconds
I really don't want to leave, I really don't want to leave
I told you I had to leave
I told you I had to leave
I'm happy when I'm alone
Thank you ladies and gentlemen, byeAyy girl
Fine, as she wanna be, that girl
Gentle, as she wanna be, that girl
When I sleep at night
I think about, that girl
Where she come from?
She's beautiful, that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girl
In my mind, I see her 
In my mind, I meet her 
Then, we dance, we dance, I wanna keep her 
Yeah yeah
That girl
Ayy, oh-oh
Ayy, oh-oh
That girl, nice girl
I leave home to see you girl
Remember when I crept through the window 
Remember when I crept through the window 
Remember when I crept through the window  girl
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom 
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom 
Remember when I snuck in your bedroom  girl
Ooo-ooo that girl
Ooo-ooo that girlI hate when it rains
All I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking about the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga
I'm thinking about life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep somebody's looking through my window pane
Man, I swear I'm going catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin
Like Scarface, my mind's playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where Do is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when the soul will be gone
The spoken words to thoughts, never be spittin' in vain
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change
Ask God if he feels my pain
And please, won't you stop the rain?
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Rain clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears running down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use to have the evil dreams
Now I realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somethin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!
I'ma Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same
I'm a Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The Same]
Ok. Whys that?
You know in Cleveland it rains, not all the time but
To a kid who wants to go out and play, it seems like it rains everyday
Kids expect it to rain sometimes but, for one kid it rained too muchFocus baby don't look at me
See right through me
Understand my heartbeat
Murmurs to mock your rhythm
Yeah, my nuts, the other girls want 'em
But they can't have
At least for the moment
I'm with you there could be people around
I'm just focused on you
You can sip chardonnay
And I'mma have myself a brew
I'm a country ass nigga baby
You know how I roll
Your face, never seen something more perfect
You dance in my mind like Justice
I know you listening back like
"Damn, bro!"
Laid back so gentle like the violins
Lay on the beat
And we don't have to be discreet
Can I have a taste?
"Absolutely!"
You're my sweet tangerine
Let's make a smoothie
But baby
All jokes aside
My heart beats faster when you open your thighs
I'm just ready to slide, ride, and glide
Whenever, baby

I know I can't slow, Yeah, I know I can't slow
And the future's uncertain
But there's only one way and it's down this road, so
I'm speeding away, away, away
Things they don't seem to bother me
I've become so numb, I've become so numb, yeah
Disconnecting from the love in me
So far I have come, oh so far I have come
Have no fear of falling
Your destiny's calling
Don't be scared of what you find
Dug this grave a thousand times
So much fuel to feed the fire
Push so far and then they die
Have no fear of falling
It won't help you in the end
Dug this grave a thousand times

See the sun ducking down and the nights get cold
Yeah, the nights get cold
In my grave, in my bones

Where it ends is where it starts
In my hands, in my heart
No more playing, right after dark
You must wait, for your moment

Then they'd have a reason to say why they never like them
Ain't no need to seek it
I am content, dream like content
So unconscious, just me and my conscience
I'm runnin' with them wild things
Livin' to do wild things, Cudder
I live, I live, I live, I live for symphonies
I know that there's some place just right for meAyy-oh, ayy-oh, ayy-oh, ayy-oh
I've been trying to steer, been trying to steer it right
It's apparently clear how I might be screwed
The end is near, said the end is nearing
It's apparently clear we might be screwed
When life loses appeal, when the ghosts appear
Just a kid in the moonlight, just a kid in the moonlight
Headlights on a deer, headlights on the fear
Just a kid in the moonlight

Return of the rage, return of the rage
I got the rage running through my veins
No one's home, no one's home
Won't leave a note, won't leave hope
No one's home, no one's home
Oh what a nightmare, I'm done with these idiots
Got the rage pushing through my veins, listen to me
Born in the dark, born into pain
Return of the rage, return of the rage
Nobody's home, nobody's home
That was a warning, don't be an idiot
I will fucking bash in your brain
Listen to me, feel the blood boil in my veinsShe looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of the ways
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
The evils want to nix it, it could be working
Or it could be worth it, I think it's worth it
Her love is worth it and ya she knows that
There's levels to this shit and ya she knows that
Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for leaving, repent for leaving dents
I hate myself but I wanna fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
It could be worth it, it could be worth it
Love her, love her, yow, I love her
Oh, baby,  baby electric eyes piercing through me
She said she not worthy
Oh baby cut it with them lies what you want from me
Oh girl I'm not worthy
No worth, no worth
She said she's not worthy
No worth, no worth
Oh girl I'm not worthy
She looks for comfort in whoever
He has to have someone forever
For all of her nights for all of her days
For all of the wet sex and all of those ways
I hate myself but I want to fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
The evils want to nix it, it could be working
Or it could be worth it, it could be working
Her love is worth it and ya she knows this
There's levels to this shit and yes he has to know that
Repent for being bent, repent for being spent
Repent for being a dick, repent for leaving dents
I hate myself but I want to fix it
She hates herself but wants to fix it
He could be worth it, it could be worth it
Love her, love her
Oh baby, baby electric eyes piercing through me
She said she's not worthy
Oh baby, baby don't tell lies what you want from me
Oh girl I'm not worthy
No worth, no worth
She said she's not worthy
No worth, no worth
Oh girl I'm not worthyI can't get numb enough
I don't wanna know what's down or up
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, forever
The clouds stay gray
The devil wants to play, okay?
The devil wants to play, okay?
She likes to feed on the weak
Locking in on her prey
Dissolve your soul, fingertips turn cold
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever
Blood everywhere, blood everywhere
My outfit's fresh, of course it is
You said we do this to death
Cold until my last breath, slowly exhale
One last fuck you to the world
One last fuck you to the world
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever
I need to escape forever, forever
I need to escape forever, and ever
The clouds stay gray
You can't escape me, I will destroy you
Beavis: "You know Butthead, I say this a lot, but that was cool."
Butthead: "What a long strange trip it has been."
Beavis: "It sure has. I feel all different."
Butthead: "Beavis, the world will never be the same. Doves will fly into the sunset and there will be harmony, and there will be rainbows. There will be peace on earth. And there will be no haters, and if there are haters, we shall flex on them. We shall flex on them hard."
Beavis: "Flex on, yeah."
Butthead: "And finally we will score, the whole world will score. It's gonna be cool."
Beavis: "Really? We're gonna score? Are you sure? Wait a minute, are you sure? Because I always think I'm gonna score, and then it doesn't happen. And I don't want to get my hopes up because I'm all like, emotional right now."
Butthead: "Yes, Beavis, it is foretold."
Beavis: "Yeah, cool, that's good. Butthead, a minute ago you said 'hard.'"
Butthead: "Oh, yeah."Everything starts from now. You're crazy, man. You know what? When you said that last time, I was kinda trippin', right? But now, you're right. I am crazy. But you know what else? I don't give a fuck. I don't give a fuck about myself. You remember that, motherfucker. Cause I'm the one y'all need to be worried about

Parallel parked in the park in the dark
Don't be concerned if I'm makin' a grip
Own half of my masters, so muthafuck you bastards

When I step on the scene don't hear a sound
What more could I do?
So much, too much

Without a damn clue what was in store
And furthermore even if I could bra
I do it all again real shit bra
Advocate rappin' and doing me
I ended up rapping renewing me
Ended up being better then the last
Whole new Cudder for the new class
Every time I think about the first step I ever took alone made me realize this prince was made for the throne
Defeated the beast, Sword from the stone, smoking so much weed I'm better off alone
In my own zone, in my own zone, I'm so gone never the less
I can't disappear stress, my life is way beyond your momma knows best
You can't forget I'm blessed, the feel is so curse, I can't stop the verse from spitting
Without feeling like I'm phony cause I speak my thoughts every time I think them up
I guarantee I will win if I was ever wrong this moment ain't it
So I am psychic in the in end, I think my thoughts and reality lets them
In, in, in, in
Tell me who, is all ready to go
Tell me who... is all ready to go
Tell me who is all ready, to go higher up say higher upYeah Steven, lookout!
Yeah
Hello, hello, doctor, doctor
Doctor, there's something wrong inside of me
There's something, I don't know doctor, help me
Well is there, is there something I can do?
No remorse, no remorse
Got a couple bundles of dynamite
And some hand grenades
No remorse, no remorse
You never should've angered the kids
Yeah
The darkness is coming
The darkness is coming
No remorse, no remorse 
Hell like you wouldn't believe
The darkness is coming
The darkness is coming
Oh you fools start running
Dead man walking
Left foot, right foot
Right foot, Left foot
Doctor, what am I to do?
What am I to do?
The darkness is coming
And guess what it's wanting
Fools start running
Dead man walkingYeah baby
As he transforms to a whole 'nother being
Super duper
Nice
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?
Step up in the place just me and my buddy
Everywhere I go they screamin Kid Cudi!
Launching away from the helipad
Running out of bud, re-up before I'm hella mad
Hella like my dad in the sense of my ignorance
Now I give a shit bout less more than a little bit
One hell of a kid, and I kick it
Lord willing pure feelin' to the tenth power
Mash on the pedal, float above gravel
Weave through the city streets
Seize what the people seek
Please come follow a dude haters in the media call rude
How do you conclude to intro the interlude?
The game runs dry, bringin' the lube
Skinny as a fuck, still eatin' the food
Hard to kill Cudder like Steven Segal yeah
Haters applaud and they are appalled cause I see y'all
Can't hide in your closet, stop it
Be a boogie man, go do nothing beautiful
Sorry, I'm an honest man, fuck it
To my enemies: please squash it
You don't want Cudder to transform to a maniac
Kinda like Pat after plenty gin and tonic
Say I'm not a lyricist you fuckers need to figure out the logic
When I'm in rap mode it's nothing less than brolic
Don't run on beats motherfucker, I frolic
About...
Around...
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?
I'm lost in the kool-aid, I made my own flavor
Hawaiian super kush for everyone
Givin' free blunts to the ones who wanna dig
More than a man, super duper they feelin the kid
Let us get it in and get out
Exhale, inhale, eyes on the road seen foes
They linger ahead
Not really there, really here
Nor here, nor there, not really scared
But oh well, I'll still be where what they might see as the wrong path
Embrace bad with the good, keep doing the math
Trying to get it right so I can eliminate the pad when I scribble
Beer pong, I dabble; Shrooms on occasion, depending on the persuasion and who I'm with
Ask Ron Price, I was nice when I was younger
Yeah you was a Killer- "When You Were Young"
Though I'm 25 like I'm 16, first time high
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?
I am the one that you might see around town
Giving up daps and pounds
So high up but I'm holdin' it down
Screamin' what up? What it be?Wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost
Wondering if you could possibly help me
I'm looking for something, I need a fix
I need something that will give me a little bit of a boost
Yeah
Chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos, chaos
Start the séance 
Them weirding things are vicing
Till I finally say alright
Never will I close my eyes
I like to see my speaker smile 
Hello birdie, what's the wording?
How do you do, how do you play?
Climb your mountain, think you're a fountain
Don't you get to ride my face
Play the teacher, I'll play the student
Play the asshole on stage
Play the clitoris code is morse
A thousand thank you's way too late

Intellectually sexy, her body is sick, her face is dope
Somethin like a eye candy photo
Hope to God the broad ain't a ho though
The way she walks is in slow-mo
Yep, ma mind got Tee-Vo
Every punk truck around
Plotting and scheming, wishing and dreaming
Jus for a little nano second to holla at her quick
Tryin' to holla for her name
Yellow bone with a tan like damn
Smile at me, so I smile right back
She move so effortless complimentin' her looks
I be commentin' up in her book
You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check it
Mad views on her myspace shit
Just stoppin by, showing her love, while she sits
And all her friends are hot, but not like her she the number one spot
All I wanna do is really introduce Scott
Let her know my dreams and struggles to the top
Show her, that it feels good in a drop top
Rollin down sunset niggas can't stop
I can tell that she really got her mind right
Let me make that move when the time's right
Hope she don't mind a little limelight
You can't go wrong let's get right
And we gon let them other niggas stomp it out

You can be my super boo-oo-oo
You can be my super boo, I need you
To come and chill wit me c'mon
One, Two, Check itWow this career is so so commercial
I would say no
More after school special
Another story about an unruly teen
Become a triumphant
More than what it seemed
All of the glorious things that he dreamed
Made the life that he saw seem so sub par
A star that was shooting didn’t seem too far
All he needed was some rockets on the side of a car
Maybe a little weed to intensify the scene
To provide a solid answer to the question “why I lean?’
A bonafide fiend that be taking by the beams of light
Man on the moon ain’t a name it’s a way of life
And this is why I got hated
Until I found myself and embraced it
Its something I denied
Why lie to my soul
Truth be told…
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why 
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why 
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why 
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why 
I’m just a dreamer
Turned true to life leaner
Born to do good
So others can be believers
Once had a lover, but I had to leave her
My life is much bigger
The plan I mean
Its all set in motion, the plan I’ve seen
Couldn’t figure out my purpose till the sky changed scenes
While them other niggas ride watching screens
I was getting off of work daydreaming all alone
Daydream till I’m home
In my bed in my zone
Nobody would call
Not a ring on my phone
Raps so boring
I can’t buy ringtones
I’d rather have the Nokia alert
I’m so gone
Man I’m never alert
But I feel so good
No more hurt
I’m whole completely complete
Rainy days completely delete
I see…
Oh no
I thought my mind was capped
Until I open my eyes
And see what finally happened for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why 
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why 
Oh no
These niggas thought I was capped
Until they open their eyes
And see what finally happen for me
I know you made me different for a reason god
I think I know why 
I know you put me through it for a reason god
I think I know why Born to do it
Even though all my friends lookin at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just spit by new nigga
Feel cats talkin like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too

Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words man
Till you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of Kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can’t erase
Or eat what’s on the devils plate

Cause murder will not be the case
In london with hudson

So plain it's almost like I don't even rap, yo
Mack load, with flame from a spawning of hauntings that aren't me
Even with my damn eyes open
Yeah, it's like my own never never land
Smokin' on kush, from a bush you'll never touch
Being approached by hoes before you couldn't fuck
And all they wanna know if you be down 
If you really understand what happen from point A
What, hey, how you doing it wasn't even enough
To escape but I can't go
See I dream on and I'm over the peons
While I be doin' the beyond the
Hatin' niggas be puzzled like how did he get on?
See, I did not dare perform with that coolery
So ante like nothing else matters
Walkin' with a spirit so tattered
You, you, you can look up, I never come down

New type of warrior
Modern day hippie if I get enough sticky
And if you don't get it I'll explain it to you simply
And iffy iffy, then homie probably never get me
Nothin' really special about lil' ol' Cudder
Except the fact I'd slit my own throat for my mother
If it could make it stress free and then my brother could sacrifice
A meal best served raw with a little steak sauce
Oh no, I bet you probably think I'm looney tune
After big big country bought an album from a leak through
He was cool but just seems some type whatchamacall
Other worldly, but I'm more of a worldly other
Sucker niggas like to state they undercover
But I'll peep ya, I'll see you from my cloud sanctuary
And there's something about Mary
She made me un-tame
There was issues way before I smoked the phillies
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
Home boy, I tap dance on the clouds
Who, who, who is it?
You, you, you can look up, I never come down
I tap dance on the clouds
Expedited for you so homie run to it
We makin' the damn dough, who knew it
And everybody in the game with the same ol'
No-no's I'll be doin' it, but Cudi from a different mode
You can keep it goin' though, no I will never slow
Ol' girl want purp, she is silly, yo
I ain't trippin', I'm skippin' while I'm sippin' in
While I go in though 
Tell them motherfuckin' let somebody tell new ones
If you get high still strive to be someone
I am not a role model but I am the blueprint
Superstar concerts and honors when I spit
Only can be me, Scott, no one can do it, K
Only, I don't mean to be, I do it the CuDi way
No need to be mad if you not me
Lookin' for ill shit, you know where to find KC

Feel it in my veins
Feel it in my soul
Feel it in mind
Feel it my heart
Feel it in my soul
Feel it in my space
Feel it in my life
Feel it in my eyes, In my eyes I'm tripping, In my eyes, I'm tripping in my eyes
I can't see the sun if it doesn't come through my shades
I don't wanna see no one but myself today
Now I'm just tripping on the love I had yesterday
Time passes by me day by day
I feel it in my bones, Feel it in my lungs
Feel it in my brain, Feel it in a day Feel it a night
Feel it in a day
Never feel the same, I always feel different
Never feel the same
Now I'm just tripping Going on my trippy
Going on my trippy trippy trippy
No I can't get my radio to play no songs
No I can't get my spaceship to fly away
I think I can make it work but today is not my day
So now I think its time for us to fly away
Yeah
I can't see the sun if it doesn't come through my shades
I don't wanna see no one but myself today
I'm just tripping on the love I had yesterday
Time passes by me day by dayEverything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree
I got fam, dogg, I got my niggas
Got a little money y'all, and I ain't trippin
Most things are faded, feeling x-rated
Steady want them freaky hoes, then I want a lady
Holding the fam down, and my close homies
The peoples that were there
While some suckers left me lonely, phoney
When you see a nigga, don't approach me
Made it to the top, baby, it's all me
Cats trying to claim that they made me
However you feel, I know the real fugazi
I keep it hundred, never frontin', no need be
When I'm in the zone, no place for pussy, my nigga
Conyo to haters who don't know
Loco, how a nigga like the postal
The ones fans love, who was always approachable, yo
And I rep the double O's, double O's..
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that tree
Thousand pounds of weed
Driving in my car so fast I won't turn down the speed
Them hoes don't use their feet
They break down to their knees
And suck me like a king. Rosé in my champagne glass
And diamonds in my ring
Roll something
That's your bitch on my dick?
Well, I'mma let her hold something
You niggas smokin' seven I'mma need a whole onion. Woah youngin'!
Same ones that hate same ones that tag along
Them black dreads that make them lame niggas call my phone
Call me "World Wide Wiz" cause I'm never home
Ever leave me 'round your bitch, I'mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old tracks
And go play somewhere songs at
Fuckin high, fuckin high, fuckin high
Everything I'm having
No, they ain't necessity
Though I'm shining, keep on grinding
What you see ain't all of me
Though I keep them hoes, don't love them hoes
The code in which I roll
It's so simple what I need
You know I keep my fam, but I can't forget that treeTurned to a Mothra, bro, this that Godzilla
Turned to a monster, more like Othello
Phantom of the opera, it goes where it goes
My nightmares still haunt me  
When I sleep, they haunt me
When I sleep, they haunt me
And my nightmares, they haunt me
But I won't let 'em get the best of me
Hmm
Alien, alien
Extraterrestrial, flying in
Seen so much shot, they in love with him
I'm out the window, cut through the wind
Alien, alien
All about lovin' my team to win
Ain't no excuses, we runnin' in
Me and my future, we shall begin
Trippin' out on this LSD
Takin' the journey beyond the weed
I float around 'till we find the key
Couple girls, they my family
Here I am, here I am
Holdin' the bean since I was ten
Open your mouth for the stars and then
Hop on the board and we soarin' in
Nigga can never be tamed, I fall the hard
I weather the rain
I been on my Space Ops
Watch out for shady cops
And I pimp for the fallen, no stolen, my car
And been here for a minute now
Learn from my destiny
And I'm hearin you Lord
Oh, I'm hearin' you Lord, oh, I'm hearin' you Lord
I'm hearin' you Lord, oh, I'm hearin' you Lord
Alien, alien
Fall right through Hell and come back again
Fly to Hell in this whip we're in
Alien, alienJones!
We born to die 
So I get high just like I'm born to fly 
I'm in the court with marijuana eyes (Sorry judge}
We hit the clubs until the morning rise 
Cause day 'n' nite )
We run the streets hope I don't pay that price 
They got the nerve to tell me press my brakes 
And if I do then how will rent get paid, paid
So now I'm thinkin that 
Two hundred stacks what would it bring me back 
Especially now that recessions here 
My only answers to my questions is, is 
Ok now here's a thought 
Streets is a marriage that you can't divorce
Life is a bitch but I think I fell in love 
So I treat the game just like I'm sellin drugs, drugs
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
Cause day 'n' nite...
The lonely stoner seem to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change
The lonely loner seem to free his mind at night, ah-ah, at nite
Day 'n' nite...
I toss and turn, I keep stress in my mind, mind
I look for peace and see I don't attain
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play...play..
Now look at this...
Madness to magnets keeps attractin me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think I'm first, but surely finish last...last...
Hold the phone, the lonely stoner Mr. solo dolo
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep, a silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
Slow mo, when the tempo slows up and creates that new, new
He seems alive, though he is feelin blue
The sun is shinnin man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nites, they fade away he slips into his white Nikes
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
To free his mind in search of...
   I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the stars
No big names. No big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Cool Beans though, 10 Deep Jeans ho
Stampede fitted in the range with a knitted
No gimmick: Real time, Real heart
Real words...Elegant: A piece of art
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga first couple songs, no guest appearances
Now you sick, mayne. I ain't takin stabs
I'm just taking names, then I'm kickin' ass
I'll never be retro like a Cool Kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
Me and my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Till we fed up and wet up Where niggas keep they swag
To the 'R'. Ruin niggas hopes of success
After LeBron, I'm what's next
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars
Look up at da stars
Now I'm back on my grizzle, A plethora of strippers
I'm throwin around broads playing monkey in the middle
I'm curious Jorge, Fuck what dem whores say
Most of them is faker than the horse hair they forced in
I be in the club looking for a couple more of dem
Sorta like my first date. Fresher by the hullin'
I don't need your girl. Man I got a lot
They say he got a lot of whips, well I got A LOT
You can't unwind it. Rising and climbing
Ain't nobody brighter... I'm the man Winona Ryder
Lex Luger, narcissist, the mirrors get excited
The game is a store, Then miracle what I am
Maryland where I am, You niggas is behind us
There is not a list to find 'em
Anti-violent...Stylin, Lyrically inclined and
Who so ever hate, Mother shower him in violets
I've got so much to say
I know I've came so far
You understand my Swag
The you should look up in the stars
The stars, the stars, the starsWake up and see just what, what could be
My life as, as good as it ever be, ever be
Close, close my mind, to the outside light
I’m fuck fucked up and I can’t leave, can’t leave
You can’t, can’t be, where I,I be
Follow me and you’ll see and you’ll see
You can’t, can’t see, what I, I see
Follow me and you’ll be free, you’ll be free
So hard to cope it hurt, hurt my hope
My pride deep inside is fading slow
Fall, fall asleep my brain runs at speeds
I’m lost, lost in dreams and reality, reality
Please save me Lord, my life is such a chore
But I, I need this to be ok, be ok
What, what they think of me it ain’t no thing
My heart, heart is broke completely
Take time, and see where I’m at
Take, take, take time and see where I’m at
Oh, Oh, Oh, OhYeah yeah yeah..... cudi!..... fools gold
Awesome the words im too smart young black man
Not on any curbs
But I like them with the curves
Maybe from the hood or maybe from the burbs
Before I was embedded in the fog
Now people address me in theyre blogs
And I love it dog yeah yeah I rock this shit for y'all.... heyyyy
So when you see me salute this is for all the haters that ain't really give a hoot
If im not dope I'm the worst patoot and no homeboy I dont aim for the loot
But I aim for change within the CRAP game I mean the RAP game with soo many names
Some official some are like poo poo who a issue with you what the fuck?
Do you understand your position pimpin? all we hear about is sex and pinchin
Pass the next and we need to switch it early 90's hell yeah I miss it
Naughty By Nature 2Pac and BIG shit I am the piece of the puzzle thats probably missing
And I guess im here for that job, so all the swagger jackers need to step off
I know you hear it over and over
Sucka em-cee's should move over, over

Im runnin these haters over, over

Ima change the game
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ima do my thing with the game
Ooh ooh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Ima change the game

Within me is soul, I let myself flow
See these niggas is lame man its a shame
But see a hero will reign you'll all know his name
The man on the moon
The man on the moon, moon, moonI am so unstable

I was born on the pirate ship
Hold your tongue to say that
Super duper nervous all the time
Never chill back
Never caught slippin', even in my kicks made of ice
All day, all day lookin foward to the night
Feel like I'mma die any minute, so I live on tracks beyond these limits
You should stay free when I partyin and wippin
I can hear them coming, the demons like to listen
I trip out sippin, I re-lax stoned
Never feel safe even if I'm at my home
They can still find me, we ridin all the time
Hot damn she is fine, hope she party all the time
I can be your Eddie, my dick is up and ready
The lust takes over, merging all the hours
Before I go sour, I step back and look at
The evils got me tooken, most cats be shooken

Filled with angels and demonsWhen I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, miles and miles
For the love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me, so fucking boring
But I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll be okay
When I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case
Oh when I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the case

And I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles, hmm
Oh if I fall, oh if I fall
Or if I glide, no matter the case
I'm all smiles, I'm all smiles
I've traveled for miles, alone in the dark
With love in the core, love in the core
Some people bore me and I'm fucking dozing
With a smirk on my face, I'm all smiles
No matter the case, I'll find a way
Oh when I crash, when I crash
Or if I land, no matter the crash
When I crash, when I crash

Wa-wa-wa-wah,wa-wa-wa-wah
Yeah  yeah
I'm extra good 
I'm extra 
Hello
Hello hello I bring the new era of terror
Speaking and its peaking but its cool you hear me clearly
In the lac' how it sound when it's up
Don't act you ain't fuckin' with it
Cudi hate the fronters
They always in the back, fronting, saying something
Until I, open my mothafuckin' mind and let it spill
Over samples over sense over heavy kicks in the mix
Figured I was all singing til I began ripping
Ready to die ever since my father died
Infatuated with death since my uncles left
Go through the ghost of my family
Dancing in the valley when they hear the harps playin'
Day 'n' Nite in the night
Oh, I ever wondered if I get this rappin' right
Hmm, I know why the bitches treat me oh so, politely
I need the mushu and this occurs to
I'll explain more after a blunt or two
Hey
Oh, will they come around?
Wonder if they'll come around, now
Oh, oh will they come around
Will they ever come around, now
Now come around
Now do you get it, now do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?
Now do you get it, do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it 
Some niggas wear a Jesus piece
Trying to show their passion for ice
Instead of trying to show their passion for Christ
So until I get my world right homie I'm Jesus chainless
Waiting in the dungeon with the not many stainless
I'll be buckin at my demons
Truly for more reasons I couldn't put into words
Only assign melodies
If you ever hear a sweet sad sound
Those are the profound tones of
While I'm feeling lost, still waiting to found, down
Not by a model bitch, in her peace and Carey Anne
New motivation for the new generation
Born in 96' watching reruns of Fresh Prince
Inspiration come from all different angles
It is tangled in between
The bullshit that can claim you
Aye LeBron play this song before
You step on the court
This could your alley-oop
While you hop out the coupe
Never made it on the team
But I'm pimpin for sport
Ignorant to the fact I'm dying quick off this port
If any niggas set the goal for the sky to be the limit
You limit your role too stupid to even know
Damn son, what the hell?
We all need to think intergalactic
As I style as I smile
Finally after awhile, hold it now
They come around
Oh, will they come around?
Wonder if they'll come around, now
Oh, oh will they come around
Will they ever come around, now
Now come around
Now do you get it, now do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it?
Now do you get it, do you get it
Homeboy, mothafucka, do you get it 
Get wit' it!Momma told me wait
Momma told me wait
I can not relate
Eat what's on your plate
Fill yourself with hate

Eat what's on your plate

Fucking on the first date
Sucking on the first date
Fill yourself with hate
Shit!

The whispers the gossip
Words from a chick
He oh so cute
And he down to earth too
You can call me Moon Man
And I'm just visitin'
No beyond the beats
To lyrics you are listenin'
Everything I am is probably everything they not so
You can call me Moon Man
I have no plan
I just landed here to approach those lames
With the weakest of ears
Stop livin' in fear
Even though shits eerie
No matter the cost
Motha fuckas will hear me
And I will out shine and out rhyme Those lames you don't cut it
Midwest cleveland niggas
Please M-Dub it?
You can call me Moon Man
To the haters who still puzzle
It's okay I'm a dog who still muzzle
But once I'm unleashed like Jet Li
I'm kickin' it
You can call me Moon Man
Like a tribe of questin
Supplyin like a radio hot line request on the radio
Somewhat mentally challenged like Radio
Can't fade me
Like a bad barber
It's new sound it's E pill
Take it at your own risk word to Emile
I don't know B that's the words of Patrick
You can call me Moon Man
Shit it so damn sick
No antibiotic can ever fuckin stop it
If you copped it
Please OD
You can call me Moon Man
If not for me please do it for music
I make immortal songs for the mortals to cruise with
For mortals to live with
Expand they realm
For my people free
Find peace in these
You won't be free
'Till you live on the stars
Shootin' by the moon
I'll be seeing you soon
But for now I'm away steppin'
Put me up in your away message
Word for word I keep rollin' on 'em
Rollin' on 'em
Wha wha wha wha

Yeah! Cudi nice nigga!

What the fuck ya'll niggas ponder when you think of K-I-D-C
Another motherfucker tryna flow up 'bout the ce-ze
That's right bitch, you need to pay respect
The checks on my Nikes these ain't the only checks I hope to get
Critics talk about there ain't no talent in the land
But tell it to your man who would spread it to where he can
Y'all niggas street dreamin', that's probably where it ends
I look down at you rappers and I'm only 5'10" nigga
Tired of niggas talkin' fly shit out of they mouth
Acting like they know me and the city I'm comin' out
I’m not a Bone Thug, don’t study to rhyme fast
I rhyme at a steady pace and I'ma make the same cash
Instead of talkin' bullshit, tit for tat
Hearin' these other niggas spittin' wack on these tracks
Instead of smirking and laughing when you think of Cleveland rap
Bow down, to Kid Mesc nigga, y'all know we did that
'Cause I'm
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
Don't stereotype Kid Mesc dawg, I'm not them
Don't be like "Damn my nigga, you sound like him!"
What you niggas know now wish y'all niggas knew then
I'm not that nigga
I'm the other Kid!
And you best be believin' my heat gon' simmer
I'm a special deliver while it hits you in your liver
I'll make your soul shiver, lay you still at your wake
Give these pussy ass niggas a solid reason to hate
I done leaped over the gate, but y'all scared to hop it
Speakin' about all these guns but y'all lames don't pop it
My album's so hot even your moms will go cop it
It'll take you millenniums for your mark ass to top it
Look look, now check here what your boy boy speaks
"Michael Johnson with the flow, work at your own speed", oh
You can't hate on a nigga that's great
Now y'all can't fuck with me I'm tryna get this cake 'cause
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga
They don't know yet
But I'm not the average
'Cause they don't know yet
But I'm not the average nigga

CBD13
I'm not the average, I'm not the averageI'm, I-I-I'm sky high
Throw your diamonds in the sky if you feel the vibe
Flashing lights
I go for mine, I got to shine
I'm sky high
Throw your hands up hustlers, busters, boosters, hoes
Everybody
Like we always do it this time
I go for mine, I got to shine
Throw your motherfuckin' hands
Get 'em high
Feels good to be home baby, feels good to be home
Nigga I'm G-double-O-D Good
Back up in the blogs like a poppin' nigga should be
Never ever was a shoulda coulda woulda type
I am controlling what the people say they like
And no not the label, this is dream on
Play my songs so you can witness what I'm on
Besides 808's, okay now wait
When you hear my album it won't be hard to get a date
Yes M-dub it, I'm kickdrum strummin', hummin'
The product of a suburb is stonecold thorough
Very well-rounded, most people don't know though
Hey is that Diddy in that photo? 
Back home they don't know what I have went through
To get to you, y'all, everybody
G.O.O.D. Music up in the party
Paparazzi need not bother nobody
Can I talk my shit again?
I'm sky high
I can't believe I'm back up in this motherfucker
I'm sky high
The Roc is definitely in the building
I'm sky high
G.O.O.D. Music's definitely in the building
I'm sky highThe artist, however faithful to his personal vision of reality, becomes the last champion of the individual mind and sensibility Against an intrusive society and an officious state
He has, as Frost said, a lover's quarrel with the world
In pursuing his perceptions of reality
He must often sail against the currents of his time
This is not a popular role
Yet in retrospect, we see how the artist's fidelity has strengthened the fibre of our national life
If sometimes our great artists have been the most critical of our society
It is because their sensitivity
And their concern for justice, which must motivate any true artist
Makes him aware that our Nation falls short of its highest potential
I see little of more importance to the future of our country and our civilization than full recognition of the place of the artist
If art is to nourish the roots of our culture
Society must set the artist free to follow his vision wherever it takes him
We must never forget that art is not a form of propaganda, it is a form of truth
For poets, there is nothing worse for our trade than to be in style
In free society art is not a weapon and it does not belong to the spheres of polemic and ideology
The highest duty of the writer, the composer, the artist is to remain true to himself
And to let the chips fall where they may
Hey let's have some fun this timeIf my niggas don't fuck wit' you, I don't fuck wit' you
That's just a code in my hood, don't let these guns hit you
Be a man of your word, don't ever let 'em play you
Stand up for your shit, make sure these haters pay you
Can't nothing stop a room full of real niggas
I got some bad rich bitches, they my real niggas
It's like working four jobs not to kill niggas
My little niggas love to ride by and spill niggas
If y'all fell out over some chips that ain't your real nigga
If y'all fell out over a chick that ain't your real nigga
Before I be a house nigga be a field nigga
I gotta Port Arthur chick, call it my trill nigga
I met Duke in 92 and we still niggas
Rockin Hilfigers before they was like chill niggas
Living well me and my niggas go'n eat
Before you hate, hit the brakes with both feet
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be 
Hey yo, all right
If my brothers don't fuck with you ima fuck with you
Egg your fucking whip right in front of your bad bitch
Didn't care if my swag was weird they staired
Like 50 flights so they couldn't keep up with my fly
But it's like when they see me with a new joint they wanna cyph
But I'm laughing like ain't this nigga said I can't ride a bike
Started rocking these jerseys and it trended to my brothers
Like Ben got my brother franklin working started from a boss at young
But rally just chillin having fun
So when you see me just know I'm
Working
Trying to start a business
Ah tv show a clothing line
My nigga we be hoping the train back to the block
We saved guap for lil cezar pizza box  real nigga shit right there
For now crunch time is lunch time and one rhyme is dumb fine
Hey yo, all right
This is how it's supposed to be 
Hey yo, all right
Max with the homies, try to teach them things
Teach them how to make a piece of change, even keep the change
But they neva change, bought a set of chains with another chain
Upgraded to a better chain, that Beretta sing, I ain't playing
Shoes on the 'rari start to look like hooves
Pigs by the crib start to look like wolves
Money neva change me only change the situation
The paper I be chasin got them sucka niggas hatin
Started from the pavement, basement Satan
Couldn't match my flames so they compare me to a mason
Free like slaves but they based and crazy
We talkin' bout crack or we talkin about blacks?
Spliffing the blunt up, then they pickin the gun up
Motherfuckers is trippin, they fixin' to run up
Then they gettin the come up, yup bitch
And they do it 'til the sun up
And this is for my niggas and my gang
Through the fortune and the fame
Only thing that never change is my niggas
I got the niggas that I need with me
Any issues my nigga you know to please hit me
No question no hesitation when it comes to holding fam down
If you creep me the fuck out you probably ain't around
Now you can hate on the side lines, I'm skippin past
You got me fucked up, keep talkin and kiss my ass
No sweatin the ho shit, too in tune with the family
I do got the ones that do know Scott
They give me the love that a nigga need
If its a place to stay or a dime sack of weed
Word to Dennis, ridin' thick and thin until we finished
Focused to keep the pockets replenished, clothes on our kids
And keep my niggas from goin away on a bid
Only wanted all the fly shit when we got big
Chasin these hoes up in they ribs at they momma crib
Beat niggas up so 'bout it, 'bout it they go blind about it
We all grown, families of our own
Providing for 'em real niggas, real morals that's the code
Perform so long as I am my brother's keeper
He will provide me with a nine if I need or a street sweeper
The love I have for my niggas is another type
You gotta real nigga down with you for your whole life
Love for my niggas
The brothers that I never had made my life a lot less sad my niggaStop that, stop the madness! I rap off the dome! Let's do it

DangerousFirst name Scott, last name Mescudi
I will say it now so you all can say it properly
Even for awhile lotta people stayed mocking me
Then I went G.O.O.D. cause of 'ye now they jocking me
I have the same sound, same old fire, same lion heart
And I stayed smoking sour, every single minute now, gotta say an hour
I feel I am cross of John Lennon and my father
I remember when I finally left Cleveland
Being cool, it wasn't the only reason
My heart had urges, the feelings
Something special you could feel up in the evening
When the moons full and the drink is poured
And most of the real pretty girls are whores
Now I gotta say get the fuck outta here, I don't know you
No, you can't chill in here
Na na na na
Yeah yeah yeah

My last name Mescudi, first name Scott
I was the kid you knew who liked to joke and clown a lot
But when I went home school work to the side
I'mma go and study how to finish up these rhymes
Maybe hit a kidney and my family hit the grind
Before I feel I'll never ever find my own mind
Losing my pops really fucked me up
At that time in my mind I thought my luck was up
Its mostly cause I never got to show what I dream
I guess its cause I never had the time to let it show
But now I got an op im bout to give to the public
I know he lookin' down, I know he gotta love it
Ohio got a spokesman
They wanna know if I really smoke

While I cough up this blunt, I sit back in the cut
All my niggas ridin' with me, more excuses to stunt
And we pull  up the cup, and we fill up the Woods
Loud plane, got this plug, and the rest lookin' good
Get your girl off her, hey, said she ready to play
It's all a game, it's all a game, and I'm doin' my thang
More rage, more rage, black Porsche in the rain
Someone stop me, bitch, get off me, man, my life ain't the same
Natural killer, once I'm done feelin' their pain
Now it's like I'm on my Sepeher and I'm feelin' them games
Let dude hum it back, man, that's a wrap
Can't keep a nigga down, down, baby, that's a fact
And I rep it, Cleveland, city, runnin' through my veins
To BK, East New York, and I never change
And I keep my niggas close, just like I'm supposed
'Cause this is for people, to dance to what I wrote, uh-huh
And I feel like I can do what I want
Livin', livin', livin', livin', I'ma do what I want

Then you slowly take my hand
Then they open up and say
Do you want to play with me
I-I-I say Baby I'm all up on it

The path of crystals and shimmering rays
Welcoming me whole in all my ways

Headed home I'm bout to slam dunk
Pray to the box of mags, protect me when I'm old

Tired of hoes, all they want is to get chose

Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
You think you can take me?
See this is what makes me 
I look into you toothless until you know what's your past
To try it, it would be stupid, your choice of technique is foolish
Battle be strong the new kid
Don’t matter my scars were leaking
I’ll be standing still demanding, I’ll be winner
Rapid punches delivered
Your soul is feeling weaker by the moment
I stood before opponents all my energy I’m holding
Victory to me you see those other main components
Pow Pow Pow I knock em down
I am flawless in every round
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
No, no, no, I won't get bodied
My heart is powered with power from cowards
I may be tired from steppin up to a champion
Hit them up and break them down
I’m aiming to break some bones
I’m focused and overdosed on adrenaline
And I strengthen them with confidence
Every hit and every kick is rapid fire
And my thoughts is sour if I feel there is no lighter
Here, summon every single bit of courage
In my lion heart
They start it then I finish it
We’ll finish it
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blow
The road is vicious but I’ll be victorious
Scar for scar, the way a nigga would flow
I'm ready to fight now, fire to fire
Hit for hit now, blow for blowIf I go back to Cleveland with nada
I'mma have one disappointed mama, no!
I'mma have one disappointed fam, I'mma feel bad
That I can't provide for my fam
I can't help how my mom process
Mr. Hutch told a nigga "young, learn to be the best"
And if I can't do that mayne, what the fuck I'm living for?
I got a pack of Newports and a super-bad whore
I step out and I drink a lot of Hennessey
Battle in my sleep with the demons tryna ruin me
A bunch of discouraging words, saying that fame wasn't meant for me
Take it back to Cleveland, you heard?
I can't stop them from speaking
Their visions are intense, got me laid out leaking
Y'all don't know the half, kid cudi got issues mentally
That I scribble down fast, like
I won't fold, I can't fold
I won't fold dogg, I can't fold
Is what I say to myself over and over
Cruising through the city in my black Range Rover
Heard em' whispering, I heard them talking now
Now that I'm bubblin'
Thought I forgot how you
Tryna take me off my grind
Yup, yup, they tryna take me off my grind
But it's my time, boy
We going straight to the top
Watch me live, my nigga
When you making moves, everybody pounding you
But when you down and out, niggas won't acknowledge you
Sick to the stomach when I think about losing, but
I like this music, so this the life that I'm choosing..
I had to find out who the real Scott was
Meditated with the wolves, all focused to get my hunger back
So alone, just me and an instrumental
They say my music ain't normal
Must be something up with my mental
I don't spit about guns and drugs
Well dumb fuck I don't know about guns and drugs
I spit what I know, and you should too!
But you won't, we all know, you wanna jock the next dude
And you follow the next man
Well I was born to be a leader so you know that I'mma follow my heart fam
And I'mma roll with what my nigga Manny said
"Keep your individuality because that's what's gonna get you bread"
I ain't tryna make hits for the club no more
I'm just tryna make hits for my niggas at war
Day to day in the White Man's World
Getting head from the white man's girl, that's me
When I'm stressed
Having dreams of a dark-skinned chick with big breasts
While I'm thinking of steps to be king, just like in chess
Kid Cudi won't rest, that's when I'm at my best
Flow's good ? I see the rest mayne
A lot of cats tryna make it happen through the music
Truest thing about it is not everyone can do this
Gotta spit it different from another nigga living
If I ain't, I'm slippin
And I'm never getting up
With that in your head, dogg, I'm never giving up
Looking up at the ceiling, chillin at my wake
These lames gotta hate, see the lyrical wizardry
Airing out my dirty laundry for these niggas that ?I'd like to welcome everybody to the wonderful world of Kid Mes-Cudi
You know what I'm saying

We doing it big
We not playing games, Kid Cud
I love everybody
I love the hate
I love the positive
I love everything man
Show me love when you meet, when you see me
You know how to holla, dream onYeah
I hate when it rains... all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinkin about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rain dayz and the pain, just rest on my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebodys looking through my window pain
Mane, I swear I'm going catch em' but maybe I'm trippin like scarface
My minds playing tricks on me homie, will it
Rain, shit! I just wanna know where do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements, mommy let him come home
I think a niggas done doing wrong I get scared of the days when the soul will be gone
It's spoken word but thoughts never been spittin in vein
Seems like the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading the change, ask God if he feels my pain
And please would you stop the Rain...
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Feels My Pain
Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul, on this earth, was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
While my uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained
Sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play, I just wished I would die
Things
Rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy
Straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs...
To stop the rain
Please Stop The Rain
Ask God If He Can Feel My Pain
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see...
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life
While every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
There mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantel
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just somthin you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause I'm a just deal with the rain!
I'm a Deal With The Rain
Tell God Just To Keep It The SameLyrics from Snippet

A stubborn man won't go to hell
A stubborn man won’t...Yeah, Yeah Yeah, E..
I'm often often, sittin' in my world in the coffin, coughin off the herb of the curb
Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness

This is Plain Pat
DeliciousPeople keep asking me how I feel about Kendricks verse on Big Seans jams. It was dope!
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Ur suppose to want to bite the heads of ur opponents. Hip Hop ain't about hugs and high fives.
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
I personally don't think anyone should have responded. Niggas need to put that energy into makin a classic album and responding that way.
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Id feel this way had he mentioned me or not. Cuz at the end of the day Kendrick showed love, was polite and really genuine when we worked
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
And thats what matters.
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Every rapper should want to murder other rappers. Its a joke otherwise
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Im just happy i lost the "MOST EMO RAPPER AWARD" recently ha
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
To everyone who felt some type of way by Kendricks verse ha
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Its rap. niggas ain't saving lives or feeding the hungry. who caresses
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013
Ok so those are my thoughts
— Scott Mescudi  August 15, 2013Lyrics from Snippet
...gotcha now, baby
I bet ya know, hey
We got our lives from his soul
Done now...84 Kid Mesc was born
On my own since they cut the umbilical cord
When I was born, witness to divorce and scorn
Ever since that happened, I was daily torn
Didn't understand nothing but I'm happy
Instead of being cool, my family kept on snapping
Cool out shit 12 a nigga was rapping
My father died, the pain is still
Look in the mirror man, I see real
Touch my reflection, feels what I feel
The letter is written: stamped and sealed
Intoxicated, spill for spill
And I ain't never seen a gang making deals for deals
Cover my mind and witness why
There's the time in the world and no time to die
I ain't trying to upset nobody
I'm just trying to be me
Everywhere I go man, people like "he's still rapping?
Yeah that's right man, you still gun clapping?
I'm on to bigger positive things
Trying to live out a dream
I'm the MVP, look at my ring
What y'all know about the street games, you're just
Dreaming em up. Not trying to make a come-up
Going to sleep at night praying to god
Wishing that you had that bad bitch in your arm
I'm that kid tryna make things happen
Up in the club, watching gangstas clapping
And I'm that kid that be steady rapping in the booth
Throw out my demo and that's a Hot 97 proof
And you don't wanna sign me, fuck are y'all on?
I go next to the next dude that wanna put me on
And that's real, cause I'm only me
The K-I-D, not trying to become the next OG
Relax daily 
Ya know what I mean, less acting
More me and me, less them
In the pool of magical ones, I will not swim
Not on the hottest day or the warmest night
I'm free like a bird nigga, I should take flight
Plain nigga, the one less hoes like
Even if I had jewels that could dim light
Off they would never look, rather read a book
Know I'm semi-wrong, got 'em shook
Now they know Scott, and they know I plot
Don't trust hoes, they just want the knot
Till I abuse it, baby I love music, not
Really ain't no question, just lessons
At confessions, never false preaching
Real recognize through deception and lies
So, keep it music, baby keep it going steady
It won't be long, my niggas, till everybody witnessI've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening
I've been drinking all night, but I'm cool to roll
Red lights, stop at 'em very slow
Playing, "Feel So Good" by Mase
I got three chicks, one in the back, it's never up
Two chicks up in the front with me
They love the midwest accent thing
So I'm steady on my game talk
Steady on my good side
Love the Cleveland swag
Doors swinging, we some clowns right?
Girlies all around as we pull up to the Mirage
And I just open up the doors on 'em
Cudder lean got 'em in my Bathing Apes
Got 'em all intrigued
All I can do is just smile and wave
Cause that's how it be, when you paid
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening
Now the mood is good, the champagne's flowin'
And she's feeling me, I'm digging where we goin' 
After the club we headed straight to the IHOP 
But I'm sipping slow, trying to remain at ease
Waving my hand, doing my dance at peeps 
Me and my leaners we gon' party and all that, and all that 
So we gather on a zip, my shit rock
I rap hard, Kid Cudi got that mean mean, the crackheads
Hoes look who when I whip whip the cutlass, the cutlass
So I can't even trip because I love it when I'm ridin'
That Cleveland city whip appeal I need it I ain't lyin'
I love it just as much as model girls and Hennessy cognac
And it's all that, so I be
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the evening
Hey hey, yeah your boy stay fade
Higher than you sire, yes that's how I stay
About to blow fast you could call it Minute Maid
But I've never been that minute man I'm in it to amaze
Cudi killed the track, the flowers in the vase
Dude so cold you could put him in a grave
Here with some leaners
Dude's washed up, you could call us the cleaners
About to see home boy, sitting in the Beamer
With a dime chick cause she love my demeanor
Cudi, that's my buddy
He get a full discount, nigga just like a senior
Floatin', smoking on that funky cold me-haze
You see, we cruisin' like the Nina and the Pinta
Crack the Dutch, got light green with magenta
I'll show ya how to do this
Yes I'm the instructor
Come ride with a nigga cuz I'm the conductor
I've been cruisin' in my old school
While I'm rolling all through Cleveland, in the eveningHot damn, I am the man, I don't even need a scheme
I don't need a planI just say "Hi" then grab her hand
Told her I'm a dog with a birch to relax him
Say she want to window shop, I just laugh
Girl thought I was trickin', baby that's just sad
I pop so many tags, like I give grab bags
So when they see me, bitches do the mad dash
He will motion approaching up in the slab
Drink and smoking when they come to the pad
She just looking at me cuz she know I wanna smash
Eyes on my pockets now she checking out for my stash
Now this is the part where personalities clash
I subtract her then a nigga must add
I just need another to be ahead of the class
Cudi McLovin bitch I'm Superbad
When they street or see me in the club 
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
You don't got to know my name to know ?
But You know I'm gonna do my thing
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Just young nigga on my motherfuckin' grizzle
Other cats simple but your boy Cudi sizzle
Got your main line when I'm all up in the middle
All because of my songs, all because of riddles
That is amusing to me cuz I'm the niggy
All these women they all so pretty
Which one I need? Which one I want?
The one that like drinkin' and good rolling blunts
I had one chick she called herself Tila
She was so hood kept a chrome nina
When I first met her we was over on mulas
Said she was interested on getting on some new cock
She was so cool jumped right in my coupa
All of this ? Tila threw my a loopa
Gave me neck while I gripped up on the wheel
Eyes looking at me like :"Cudi how it feel?"
I'm probably the coolest motherfucker ever rappin'
Next to Snoop Dogg and Devin the Dude
When I touchdown I won't clown and do the Deion
I'mma keep winning because the rest of them are peons
Plus I'm a fool for gold, so I'm shinin'
Ferris in a bimmer, sittin' back reclinin'
Back in the day bitches told me "Dream on!"
Now at the shows in the front screaming "Lean on!"
Ain't that something? 
Ain't that something?
When they street or see me in the club 
All the girls always wanna show me love
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in
Watch a playa get it in

Understand I'm different and she listen what I spit
Met her at a club normally that ain't Cudi but
She was the cutest swag was tru-tru-tru-truest
Honest to the call I need 'em all
And she was leaving I had caught her at the door
She told me save I told her wait
I can't believe how she in my brain
Barely know her name
I love her facts, she ain't trippin on the fame
Day n' Nite thang the fools gold chain
The Crookers club banging and Plain Pat what up
So on my roster she was number one up
If the life was Mario she would be a 1-up
And she don't bark when the other girls wanna
Sign autographs then I'm on her ass

Oh in here
In my mind
In my mind, stay up, get upI think the braggadocio--the money, cash, hoes thing--needs to be deaded. I feel like that’s holding us back as a culture, as black people; it doesn’t advance us in any way, shape or form. We’ve been doing that same thing for years now, it’s like like, what, four decades of the same old . Sorry for my language. And I feel like, you know, if you’re gonna be an artist, there’s a time when you just have to embrace the responsibility and understand that the power of music is something so special, and to be able to do in on this magnitude where you reach millions of people, it’s like why not use that for good, why not tell kids something that they can connect with in their life.
And really, my mission statement since day one - And I'm getting so worked up talking about this. All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone and stop kids from comitting suicide. *Applause* Thank you.
And I'm never trying to be political, and I'm actually like shaking, I can't believe I'm saying this, but- *Arsenio interrupts*
Arsenio: Those two specific things, where does that come from?
Cudi: Well, I've dealt with suicide for the past 5 years, you know? Like, it wasn't a week or day that didn't go by where I was just like "You know? I want to check out" You know? I know what that feels like, and I know it comes from loneliness. I know it comes from not having self-worth, not loving yourself. And these are things that - you know, kids don't have music that can coach them and give them that guidance.
I didn't have that. I had to listen to Jay-Z and take certain things from it and the other shit, I just didn't know what he was talking about. *laughter* And like, now I'm 30  and I'm like, "Oh! that's what Hov was talking about, I get it now"
But what about the kids who- you never really had an artist where you connected with them all across the board. And I think that that's my job, I'm just really trying to guide people and help people, cause loneliness is a terrible, terrible thing man, and if you don't know how to conquer it, it can eat you alive.
Arsenio: How are you right now?
Cudi: I'm good, I'm alright.Hello world, how you do
All my life, I played the fool
See I don't understand you
Please won't you help me to
'Cause I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I need you to be, world
What I imagine you to be, world
See it's so funny to me 
It's so funny to me
The Lord works in mysterious ways but me gettin' what I dreamed ain't mysterious mane
How I ended up, after being stuck in a rut
Drinkin' warm beer outta red cups
Thinkin' 'bout the model girls, throw some D-cups
Wanna bone me 'cause I make some G-cuts
But what about the good days with them genuine girls with curls
Playin' double dutch on Kingsmen with Ben and them
Man this craze, remember the days, when it wasn't 'bout bills
Or finer tip drills or china chrome wheels, plus chrome on the grill
The smile of the moon is savin' me from my doom
And starin' four walls down in a small room
My Momma tell me that my dreams will come true
As I sit back and I smoke my weed
I collapse off my feet, it's funny to me
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha, woah
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha-ha
Walkin' down on Broadway in broad day
I some how feel there's somethin' wrong with me
My homie said "I don't know what's wrong with you man, don't you know this, this life was made for you" word? I'm cursed
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I'm cursed and I'm damned, I can't find my way out the dark
I need you to be, world
What I imagine you to be, world
See it's so funny to me, it's so funny to me
WoahI had to do it Mr. Ross
I had to
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars
I tap dance on the cloud like I'm Savion Glover
In tune with my roots like the Reading Rainbow nigga
I'm here to give the kids new li-ter-ature
I am the cure to the wack juice over flow
Gettin' a new beat, recycle' their old flows
What were they thinkin' when they wrote it?
The Lord knows, but I suppose raps hungry hungry hippos
Decided to look over Kid Cudi with the glow
Cool beans though, 10 Deep jeans hoes
Stampede fitted, in the Range with a knitted
No gimmick, real time, real heart, real words, elegant, a piece of art
I never be retro or like a cool kid
With only two songs, look at what I did
No famous name vouch and I'm still the shit
Nigga, first couple songs, no guest appearances
No big names, no big chains
Just Plain Pat visions with some sick aim
Now you sick mane, I ain't taking stabs
I'm just taking names then I'm kickin' ass
Me & my nigga Wale let them suckas pass
Until we fed up & wed up
Where niggas keep they swag to the heart
Ruin niggas hopes for success
After Lebron, I'm what's next
Next, next... to pass the baton of success
I pass an event, hoes seem to forget
My only cash flow was from bape
Now these hoes can't stunt pictures of my face
They know
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the stars
I am the man so proud I am
Came here as a boy, staying here as a man
People they don't get it, try to see it if you can
Livin' in la la land ain't all that bad
Because...
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
I'm the biggest grinder that you've seen this far
Want to look for me my nigga
You can look up at the starsAnother one!

Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man
Cudi! Ain't no fucking game man

Understand me, raps is intact
Like a perfect blunt rap, I take that
And getcha contact on my lyrical poetry
I rip shit down
 when I run around
Tryin' hold me back from greatness
I shake them quicker than puppets can do any man
Fuck them, I just stick with my mission, control
Niggas is clowns
Niggas wanna hold me up
Like security in an airport
Should I board now
Y’all got me wrong
Cause I'm dripping like the H1 documentaries, man
Who can fuck with me now?
Cudi ain't a fucking gimmick
 and vivid, baby don’t hold back
I live it, I breath it, won’t fade out
I spit fireball straight from my mouth
Bitches love my style
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas

Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

Homie
You ain't even gotta know me
Kill the raps and tracks
Get them buried in a hurry
Drink out beats, with the heat, just like a Honda
Keep rap hard, and my guards up
So doggy, what’s good?
Keep flowing just like a waterfall, faucet
Breaking niggas down like a brick
I toss it, jerks tellin’ fairytales
What would they dwell, say oh well
Most niggas are lame
I don’t even have time 
Like bananas that pick up they brain
I show you the big pick up in the frame
I’m bringing the flame, I’m bringing the heat
Lame niggas duck down
Cudi apocalypse now
I get around like 2Pac 
Niggas tongue-tied like nights, I take flight
These flows’ll melt ya
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you

Simp
Get the guards attack
Kick niggas in the grill like 
Get ready for ace like a fine wine is made
Metaphorically speaking the flow
Niggas is slow
And I know
, run it back
But fuck that, take it to the hill off
 a nigga was built
MVP’s and  possibly, yeah
I be the one
Got the glow like Leroy Green
Directing your feet, son
Cudi hot shit, son
People be dumb as rocks cause Cudi was born a rock
And all they say is “Cudi rap, bitches and panties gon' drop”
No...
Nigga understand my mind
A nigga will see, homie understand my grind
 and just to see the cash money
Life attempts to estop Mesc
My niggas know me, know me
Scott nigga!
Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas

Niggas wanna talk shit, bitches wanna hold you back
You gotta pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off you
Pushing niggas
Pushing niggas off youWake up in the morning same shirt same jeans
Wishing of the rich life, I roll when I lean
Not knowing what that life or that day bring
Wonder what if the light shines bright what if i can't see
If I do what I do to get through, then that's what I'mma do
Pure focus when I spew, having been in a pew for some time now
But that don't necessarily mean I'm hell bound
Stuck in my ways, hoping better days come through the cracks
Every day same thing: eat, sleep, shit, rap
Then shake it, mice running round my damn sticky trap
Ants on the plates and food, rapping the only thing cool
My mood chilling in my staring up at the ceiling
Nigga my life day to day is lord willing
The dry wall pillars metaphors for my feelings
Yeah, starting a new life no more drug dealing nigga
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
When I was younger I told myself I wouldn't smoke
That was the biggest joke
I'm addicted to these ports like they're pure coke
I'm selling this journey out with no real route
World thought I wanna go, all I really know is that I'm making moves
Whether it's robbing fools or making people groove my nigga
You know I'm choosing something
I remeber getting older and not caring 'bout nothing
All I knew was that I had a destiny; that was my sixth sense
I grind with six cents, and spent six years of rap
I'm hungry, Chris just made it happen
You know Mescudi, I was tired of being
Picture this; two bedrooms and four siblings
I slept on the couch for 14 years of my life
Finally copped him a bed in the living room it's alright
Let me shed a little light, I'mma crawl out the dark
And I'mma grind till the end till my life's cut off nigga
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this cream
Let me shed a little light for my niggas in the dark
Let me shed a little light for my niggas
All my niggas on that day to day grind tryna' to live they dreams
Just trying to get this creamWhoa

Rap Ex-Lax yeah, I be pooin' on 'em
Damn right, Mr. Cudi he be dippin' on 'em
Say it loud, y'all want the new-new
Explorer like Dora, that's how I got a clue too
So fucking underground, barely on Youtube
'Till Day N Nite, now they all got a clue who
Took me a minute man, took me a while
Hard headed nigga ever since I was wild, a child
But my ambitions made bitches beg for attention
DJ's un-mixin' their mixes, just to toss in some Cudder
And I tried to tell my mother
But she ain't underdig, figure me on some other
But see my mommy 'ain't a fronter
So nowadays she calls me a bad motherfucker
 x2
And, just when it seemed that the game is hopeless
We arranged some things for a dose of dopeness
I, I do, what I do
And, I, I do, what I do
Kid cudi keondris is tha dopest
My selfish little buddy like 2 poke shyt
Like ford im focus

Moovin' wit out moovin', Pure Crush Groovin'
Right on track, right on and I'm back
You make songs about some new dances
I make songs 'bout the black man advancements
I'm talkin' classic homie, I'm talkin' monumental
And I don't need much but Dot instrumentals
That's how I lay the stencil, me smilin' up out the window
I'm in the leaner dome, that's my crib on the moon
And I'm livin' in hotel rooms
In the mirror, laughing at my crooked tooth
How a nigga eat, is how a nigga speak
And how a nigga live, is sacrifice was big
And I'mma say it right before the hook
Maybe in due time, Pimpin', I'mma write a book
But now I'mma play my Andre 3000
And dream about an island wit model girls eyein'

Lyrically I'm a mac,  once it's written

As soon as you jump that bridge, you suckas ain't getting across
Pay the cost to be the boss, pay my payments in full
Your game is worse than the Cavs, I guess that make you the Bulls

Like a basket child until I get found
Gucci stick with it like a McLaren, It's all fitted
Illest nigga to spit it in the Indians 
City where niggas can split it, and stogies get split
Burners get lit where gully niggas carry the clips, the pits
Can't stop the genes in my cerebellum
Dumb niggas they don't understand hard to tell em
Niggas I know around the block, all felons
Freestylin with my boys, our flow is off the melons
See ya man, we been in the streets rule you fools

This is all metaphorically
If you wanna be in this class you gotta study me
This is the final, drink brew, get chewed, then I spit on some vinyl
And niggas tryna hate on mine though
And Imma have to chop em up bag em
Faster than Tony Soprano
I want keys like a fucking piano
Just call me Leroy I got the glow and them haters can't stand it
Young boy Kid must be the bandit, look nigga I planned it
Say your hot, ya'll niggas don't burn
Say you're sick but you don't spread germs
When ya'll niggas gon' learn?
K. I. D.'s gonna leave you under the dirt
Or cremated leave your ash in the urn
Nah I'm sick and tired of sitting back watching these lames get rich

And I ain't tryna be the savior
I just wanna read Cudi the Moon Man headlining on a paper
And I'm chilling, watching niggas fuck it up for me
Wanna make it dude, rap about selling D
Nope, I don't fuck with the dope
But I could if I wanted to, all the tips I get off the radio
And I ain't knocking the hustlers, never that
But when I don't rap that, they say my music is whack?
Damn, we got some fuck priorities
Hip Hop revolution should be top of the priority
I'm the minority, in my own minority
All the other bullshit bottom line is boring me
I'm here to make a change like Jigga to his clothes

This all talk about lil' ass shakin' in clubs
On every song that you got, be about the clubs
Niggas using samples, rapping on samples
Which is cool but it's bad when you don't know who you sample
Don't care who you sample, and that's just simple sense
We can't progress, we lack the knowledge of ignorance, well
In street, better see me for me
Give me some hot tracks, watch me R.I.P
Midwest Action ain't far from the lead
Who more than Kid Mesc could you possibly mean? Nigga
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Man, you know it's hard with the drama
Everybody wanna be hard, startin' a drama
Well I got some advice, be a gentleman first
Then next you should get it to some gangster shit
Make sure it's all real, no waste of shit
Be versatile, flip on some other shit
The only way hip-hop will progress
Is if we all put our all into a track 
Underneath the sternum to the lungs to the heart
This what everybody shoulda been doing from the start
Wish I from it, gave what the industry wanted
Just cause I'm black a nigga gotta stay drunk and blunted
Well, I do drink and I do get drunk
But you won't catch me coppin', 
But you will catch me droppin' the truth with the trunk
Kid Mesc got knowledge, Cleveland get him up
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct
Y'all lames talk false but y'all don't see
When you see a kid, pimp better show me respect
Cause I done did it, spit it, leave your main line wet
My niggas know, sucker get ya mind correct

Sucker get ya mind correct, correctBorn to do it
Even though my friends looking at me like who knew it
Run to it
The hoods just picked thy new nigga
Feel cats talking like who nigga
Is he
Where did he come from: CL
My mom prayed for me on my journey
Treat me like an alien something like Sigourney
Live through the game for the fame and the gurney
Tried to put me on the pedestal
Hoes treated me like who are you
Now I get to choose like you and her too
I just like girls not whores
But I have a chill time, make s'mores
But if I wanna plow something like a snowblower
I can work that ass like a workout plan
And then I holla at fam
Talkin bout Ye Don C Jigga man
Been represent since I met Quince and I get style tips from my homeboy Vin and
Com is the homie
Really doe is the homie
GLC is the homie
And Big Sean what up Gwan
I go monkeypaw on the record and they think I'm cuckoo
Niggas is sounding dated like they recorded in FUBU
Most niggas will quote you play scrabble with your words, man
'Til you see them at your shows is my dick that they blow, man
I would sit up some nights and think about my own place
Probably cause I took so many blunts of kush to the face
My bad thoughts I can't erase
Or eat what's on the devil's plate
I just tell the devil wait
Cause murder will not be the case
In London with Hudson
And them girls want some cutting
I'm with him so I'm cool
Plus my face on the telly
But I'm pissed at the moment
I got charged for some roaming
AT&T is on bullshit man I wish they'd stop fronting
But when I roll back to Brooklyn
Hit the store for a dutchie
They say homie keep rappin'
I say homie it's nothing
Now when I roll back to Cleveland
Hit the store for a philly
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
Cause them young niggas feel me
When I roll out to Cali
Hit the store for a Swisher
Niggas tell me keep rappin'
I say homie I get ya
CudderDay and night 
I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind 
I look for peace, but see I don't attain 
What I need for keeps, this silly game we play, play
Now look at this 
Madness, the magnet keeps attracting me, me 
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast 
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
Cause day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone through the day and night 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night
Day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone, some things will never change 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night
Hold the phone 
The lonely stoner, mister solo do-lo 
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade 
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep 
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep 
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too 
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
Cause day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone through the day and night 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night
Day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone, some things will never change  
The lonely loner seems to free his mind  at night, a-a-at  night
Slow mo 
When the tempo slows up and creates that new new 
He seems alive, though he is feelin' blue 
The sun is shinin', man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights 
They fade away, he slips into his white Nikes 
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way 
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
Day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone through the day and night 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night, a-a-at night
Day and night 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night 
He's all alone, some things will never change

Cudder Out          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Look at that handsome face!
Uhh! Okay. Just wanna check the mic first  get the sound right. This is not comedy hour, I promise.
The funny thing is: I used to go to this school. And my class used to sit like in this area, here. Yeah, O2, who’s an O2er?
Kendra, come here! Kendra, come on! Kendra  everybody! Come, give me a hug! I mean, how long has it been, two decades? Come up here! I was at all doing me. . How about that – reunion!
Okay. So, it’s just a little surreal, I haven’t been in this room since 1999, 2000 maybe. So, I’m 31, I just turned 31 on January 30th, how about that? Oh, thank you, thank you.
And, when I was approached to do this Ted Talk, I was immediately like: Why? And, then it was kinda like, put in perspective by me, in – I’m not really one to do speeches, I’m really weird, if you can imagine as I do the performing and I’m on stage, doing this is my job. It’s different to stand up in front of people like this when there’s this light and speak and, you know, express yourself in this way.
But, I told myself, okay, how am I gonna be able to do this, let me just talk about my life. That’s something I know, better than anyone else. And, I feel like coming from Cleveland, coming from Shaker, you know, such a diverse place, and just looking in the audience from the people I can’t see, it’s still … very diverse. But, I believe that my upbringing in this town, the school, district, is what made me the man I am today.
And when I moved away when I was 20 years old, my mom was extremely sad – where’s my mom at? Yeah. She was crying. Hey Mommy. My first big fan was my mom. And, it was really interesting, I remember leaving home, and she’s giving me a hug at the airport, and she leans and she goes: “You can always come back around, you can go right back home, you can change your mind, everything will be fine.” I’m like: “No, I’m going, this is happening.” And you know, walk into security and then looking back and just seeing her like: “Ohhh...” And me just being like: “Errr…”
However, as soon as I turned back around, I knew I was on a mission, on this very specific quest. You know? It was bigger than just wanting to be a musician, or do movies. It was about: Finally showing the world what Scott could do. I wasn’t the best student, I’mma be honest with you, Kendra knows this. If Kendra was in my class and she was sitting next to me I probably would have tried to cheat off her.
But that’s not the point. The point is, it’s like: When I think about it, you know, I wish I applied myself as much as I applied all the energy into music as I did, as in music as, you know, as in music, I wish I could have applied that same energy into my academics when I was in school. So a lot of people look at me now and they go: “Oh man, this must be dope to be a rapper.” And it is dope, it’s awesome. 
But, you know, I can’t say that I don’t wanna sometimes go back and relearn some things. I can’t say I don’t feel out of certain conversations that my friends have. You know, and these are things that I think about, you know, cause being at school is all about being cool and wearing the fresh – I was gonna curse but – wearing fresh clothing. And being popular. And, when you go out into the real world, you realize that that moment is just a little beep of your life. High school, you know. Now I remember Kendra , but everything else I don’t remember. No I’m just joking. But I’m just saying: At that moment in life you feel like that’s all that matters. High school, it’s like: Oh this girl doesn’t like me, this guy here and there’s all this drama, this drama, and you go into the real world and you know it’s about just trying to make your mark in the world. And I never got the chance to do that academically.
So I had this fire, I had this fire to pursue this musical career. I had no idea how to go about it. I was living with my uncle who was up in the age at the time. 80 years old. Older uncle. So when I moved to New York it’s not he could show me around, show me all the cool spots, you know, he was just kinda like: “There’s the train and you get a metro card, and you go.” And I was: “Yeah okay, we got the Rapid, I can do this. It’s all right.” I was immediately wrong for that, for assuming that it was gonna be the same. It is not the same.
Um, but, I embraced it. I embraced the fear, the danger. I enjoyed the fact that I was going in uncharted territory. It was like a sense of wonder for me. And, I can’t say I was one of those people that was into like having thrills and, you know, getting some type of stimulation from that, but it was nothing like saying, like: “Y’all I’m gonna out and pursue something and I know I’m gonna do it. And nobody’s gonna tell me I can’t. And everybody that doesn’t believe it I’mma prove it to ‘em sooner or later. And that’s just what it is.” Because I won’t point I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to pass that test. Or I didn’t feel like I was smart enough to go to this college.
But with music it was like: Nobody’s gonna take that from me. You know what I’m saying? Because it was things that I was dealing with as a youth at this school that I didn’t talk to people about. That probably kept me from put my best foot forward with my academics. You know? And with music, it was a platform for me to express myself and also realize that I’m not that crazy. That there’s other kids out there that might me depressed or lonely, dealing with suicide, things like this.
And, it was one of those things that, you know, I just feel really blessed to just have my mom who has been my supporter forever, who supplied that trip financially, first couple of months or whatever. Um, to have the support of my home town, I can come back in this room and just feel the love and energy, you guys got me really nervous, my palms are sweaty. But, um, it’s really just the clock, it’s like: 11 minutes, 24 seconds, 23 seconds, 22 seconds … It’s like what’s gonna happen when that clock’s over with? It’s like somebody gon’ just pull me off stage? Geez.
Um. But um, really, I, first thing I did when I went to New York, and most people think it was kinda like this amazing adventure – it wasn’t. It was pretty much finding a job. And for the first couple years I was working everywhere. You know, whether it was like at this clothing store here, or Abercrombie & Fitch, or American Apparel, or Dean & DeLuca, I always had a job. I was a hustler. And, you know, I still apply that same work ethic with the music.
You know what I mean, like, I’m almost in a way don’t know how to relax because my whole life has been just a grind. You know what I mean? And, I think that, when people ask me: “Man, how do you do it”, you know, I’m just kinda like: “I don’t know, like I was just … focused?” You know? Because it’s hard to put it into words because I can’t say that it’s just something I flipped, a switch I just flipped when I turned 20. Like I was always this guy.
You know, I was always outspoken and creative and artsy, I used to draw when I was a kid, it was before all the musical stuff came along. I was an artist. You know, I used to draw all my stuff, I used to draw all my tattoos and I said: “Oh when I get 18, I’mma draw, I’mma get these tatted.” It was about being a cartoonist up until I was like 15. And then I just wanted to be a rapper. And then it was all uphill from that.
But, you know, … if I could really just give people one piece of advice, you know, and it just passes along, and one thing I want you to take from this, is that like, we are all the commanders of our own destiny.
You know what I mean?
It’s like you see these movies where they say, like that one movie with … Lucy, where she has 100 percent of her brain power and she can do anything she wants. You know, and you realize that the average human doesn’t use at … two, three percent. You know what I mean? Some weird small percentage like that.
I really just told myself from jump like: “Hey man, I’m gonna do this, and I apply the information that I needed to execute that and in places, times of my life where I didn’t have the answers, I make sure to get the information or surround myself with people that had the information.” You know what I mean? You can’t hang out with people that ain’t doing nothing. How you gon’ get money, hanging around with people that ain’t got no money? You know what I’m saying?
Like, how you gon’ be inspired by people who aren’t at least trying to go the same way, at least, whether it’s music, or schooling, like I would be inspired by all my friends, cause, I went to college, I went to University Toledo for one year for film – it sucked, I hated it. You know, it wasn’t for me. But my film class, my film classes were amazing, um, and now that I’m doing acting, producing shows, writing shows, I wish I wrote that whole couple, three more years out, cause I would have information that I needed, and I wouldn’t have to go through so many hoops, to be able to direct or create my own film or TV show. Um, I don’t know why I said that, let me get back on track … Okay.
So, um, really, you know, people, like I say, come up to me all the time and they like: “Man but you did it man, you’re special, you’re different” – and I’m not. Any different. From you, you – we’re all the same. I came from this town. I went to this school. All my buddies, we all had the same opportunities, you know? It’s kinda just like: Having that self-confidence. You know? And it was a lot of areas in my personality where I wasn’t as confident. You know? Definitely with the chicks. Early on. I don’t know if Kendra knows this.
But the music, me doing something, where I was like: “Wow, I made this!” Like my first album, when that came out, I was like: “Wow! I made this, this is something that I put all my energy into, and it’s out and it’s released to the world on a professional level.” I was so proud of myself. But: “Let’s do it again.” I didn’t have time to be like: “Yeah, my first album, yeah, yeah, people like it”, it was like: “Okay, we did good, it didn’t suck, what are we gonna do again, we gotta do another one.” And then I did that one: “Okay, people like it, let’s do a third one.” You can’t get caught up in just all the other things, you know, I really was like, even still to this day, I have my front, but it’s focused, you know, it’s never, you know, even when I do straight, I’m still working. I’m still writing a song, I’m still doing something. I’m persistent.
You know, um, and that’s also another part, you know, I believe that some people get lazy. Some people might have that one painting that they started to paint and never finish it. Because they get caught up in their head and it’s: “Oh, I can’t do this, maybe I can’t do this.” It’s like sticking to something. One goal at a time. You know, that was like, that’s still big for me. I never put too much on my plate. You know, at first it was like the music, and then the acting kinda came into play, early on, and I, it was unexpected, but it was a blessing, that I was prepared for. I was like: “Man. I’ve been a class clown since forever, let’s do this.” And I used to do it for free, now I’m getting paid for, this is great. Um, so, you know, I’m glad you guys like my jokes, I’m not even a comedian, this is just…
Um, so, you know, just kinda fast forward cause it’s so much I’m tryna squeeze into 5 minutes, 56 seconds. Um, but, you know man, there are a lot of haters, there are a lot of doubters, there are a lot of people that would telling me: “Man you ain’t gon’ do that.” “That’s not gon’ happen.” “He’ll be back.” I would tell all my buddies: “I’m moving to New York” – “All right! You’ll be back!” Nah. Nah. I’m not coming back. And if I do come back, it’s for a concert. You know? And everybody be like: “Alright, whatever.”
And when I came back it was for a concert. It was for a concert, and it was the most beautiful homecoming I’ve ever had. It’s no show more important than this show. And I’m not just saying that because it was like: In Cleveland, and it’s like, my home town. It was the first time I saw my peers, friends I went to school with, being proud of me. I didn’t get the moment to walk across stage with everybody. I didn’t get the cap and gown. You know what I mean? I didn’t get the chance to see these guys because I moved to Solon, 11th grade. It’s like even seeing Kendra is wild, because I haven’t seen anybody in so long. Um, but, that’s the beautiful moment, still to this day, I do shows and I see a class mate in the crowd and I forget my raps, I’m gonna: “Oh … oh … happy, you got any kids, I’m sorry, I gotta …”, you know? It’s wild. You know?
And, I didn’t get that at school. I didn’t play on the football team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t play on the basketball team – I tried, but I was terrible. I didn’t wrestle. I tried – no, no. I did try. But I tried outside of the Shaker Heights High School, in another district in Cleveland Heights, where none of my peers could see me and me be embarrassed. It was kinda just like: “Okay I try this in 7th grade and be terrible and then nobody in Shaker will know about it – cause it’s in Cleveland Heights, they’re just talking over there.”
But my point is also like music was my plan G. You know, it wasn’t like I didn’t try anything else, like I tried everything else. I tried everything I thought, you know, was a traditional thing a young boy should do – sports, you know, and even going to college was me just tryna fulfill a destiny where I thought it was my own destiny, but also I wanted to make my mom happy. You know? And sometimes guys, we gotta do that. You know, there’s a lot of things that we don’t wanna do stuff, but it’s like, man, like, your parents , they really have to deal with a lot of our shit. And you know it’s like, and now I’m at 31 and I’m just like: I have to apologize to my mom, was it like seven years ago, I was like: “Mom, I am sorry.” Like: “I was a nightmare. But we got money now, so let’s just go like…” And we’re okay. We’re good now.
Um, and it’s funny, too, cause I took my mom to get her first tattoo ever, I forced her to get a tattoo, and it’s so funny, cause she – are you, are you embarrassed, I’m sorry. But this is big, you know, because our relationship from the kid I was at high school, it’s the best it’s ever been. You know, I used to put my mom through hell. But, she was my supporter. And that’s what parents are there to do. To give you the devil’s advocate, even when, I’m not gon’ say, every time I told my mom I was moving to New York, she was like: “Pff. Okay. Aight.” You know, but that was more so like the fear of letting your child go out into the world, more so like the people in the street that are just hating on you don’t wanna see you win.
Parents care. Now I got a four-and-a-half-year-old, she’ll be five in march. She’s the apple of my eye. She’s my little baby. And, she’s so funny, you know, cause, I’m the one who gets emotional when she has to leave, you know, and I’m kinda just like, when she’s leaving, I’m like: “You know I’mma miss you, right?” And then she’s like: “Yeah.” And I’m like: “You gon’ miss Daddy?” – “Yeah.” “Oh my … You know you can call me and stuff, when you miss me? And I’m just sad you’re leaving.” She’s like: “It’s okay. We always come back.” And I was just like: “That’s what I’m saying, all that, that’s why I’m crying, I’m so emotional!” But it was just like beautiful to just see, you know like, me be the parent now. You know what I’m saying? And to see that confidence of my child, and the same confidence I gave my mom and you gotta just kinda take it backseat and go: “Okay.” Cause I literally like follow my daughter’s lead. I mean, I just, whatever she is telling me to do, I just follow whatever she – well I mean, obviously not in every way. Or else like, I would be broke, but … in some ways I do what she asks me to do or what she tells me to do.
But, that’s the beauty of life y’all. You know what I’m saying? I used to come in this room, I used to sit right in that section. Sometimes I’d pay attention – sometimes I wouldn’t. Most of the time I’d be checking out chicks. Some chick I probably never talk to cause I never had the confidence, maybe if a – what’s the day that we would send carnations, Kendra? Valentine’s Day. That wasn’t a joke. I was the king of like, sending, like, carnations to chicks that I never talk to. I would be asking my mom for like: “Mom, can you give me five bucks, you know it’s  today, I wanna .” And, she would just be like: “Okay”, you know? Not knowing that I was buying carnations for all these chicks, you know, but, thanks for supplying that, Mom.
But, with 23 seconds left. I just what y’all know that life will throw you through shit ton of curve balls, it’s scary, but like, if you believe man. You know? I you believe. And if you want it. And if you wanna work hard enough for it. You can be so. Cause it’s no difference from me and you. I just really wanted this shit. I wanted it bad. You know? And I didn’t want to be a failure. And nobody’s a failure in this room. Don’t ever think that. We can all win. And that’s it.

Oh shit, this girl must want a nut
I'mma jizz up in her face
While I'm palming the butt
Didn't do my struck, cowboy mid-western
She did it all for me, now it's her friends turn
A young for more money, more models with asses
More heat, to spread to the masses
Funky glasses of a freakish nature
I'm crazy cool, nigga's need to learn paperHey
This one's so crazy
Uh oh
Oh boy, oh boy
Yeah
Cudi!
Rock this motherfucker

Y'all niggas know it

The real diller tiller on the beat
Yeah
Let's go
Let's beat this motherfucker
Cudi in the spot, all the lames ice-grillin'
Mad cause their girl call me Mr. Nice-feelin'
Must stay clear from the sneaks to the fade
I ain't even in the game and the nigga look paid
Cockroach niggas get sprayed with the Raid
No time for the drama, tryna get laid
Sippin', my mellow, Kid Mesc lady killer
Yo girl, I'm a fill her like gas to the tank
Nice skin, college girl, wanna come to Scotty's world
Like to wear it straight, wanna cut her hair like 
I wanna pop, but you're a bad bitch
Says she a magician, wanna show me tricks
Told her I'm a beast in the sheets and the booth
Says she ain't believe me, need to see some proof
Pulled out my demo, then pulled out a condom
Told her let's go, while we listen to my album
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
Met a older ho, birth name

All the motherfuckers run game just to keep it
But the bitch 
Ya boy had to delete it
I said: These are the things I'm on
Niggas see the potential, wreck shit King Kong
Beat bot tiller, he a beat Godzilla
I'm that nigga, boy boy, told you before
Screwed up shit in the deck and move slow
Got a neck from a chick and neck move slow
Perform on stage, hoes in the front row
They try to take that like i was Sean Combs
Bitch get down
You need to go home or you get dick down
I use slump, let the base line thump
And it bumps and it thumps that all the cops get mad
I chill cause I'm ill, up in the game all smacks
The races for cake, doing a hundred meters dash
Sit back and I laugh, cause these others are jokes
They might just get slapped and those will get choked
I'm that boy
I'm that
Niggas need to know
I spit high, high
I'm that boy
I'm that

Okay, so I'm kicking it right now
In the studio with my man DJ E-V
And, uhm..
I came here man
It was brought to my attention
By my nigga, Chip Tha Rip
That DJ E-V looks, very, very familiar to me
Like I've seen him before
I've met him once before
But when I met him for the first time, I was like man
I feel like I've seen this nigga somewhere
But, I couldn't really put my finger on it
But I realised, that I've never seen him before
But, I've seen somebody, that looked like the nigga
But then it hit me, this motherfucker looks like Tom Cruise
And I'm not talking about -
He look like motherfucking, Mission impossible 2, Tom Cruise
Motherfucking, Jerry Maguire, Tom Cruise, ya know what I'm saying
Not The Last Samurai, Tom Cruise
But I'll talk about this Tom Cruise
Ya know what I'm saying like, before he went crazy Tom Cruise
But naw, if you ever see DJ E-V
Come up to him be like, wassup Tom
You what I'm saying, give him dap
Tell him that you love his movies
And he would definently appreciate that
You heard it from me, heard it from
Kid Cudi, it's the K.I.D
You can call me moon manUh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn
It’s been a couple days since I started drinking
It’s been a couple days since I started thinking
Bout You Pal How is you in her arms
I want to do a Die in your arms song
Armstrong I’m strong, I’m a reach the moon
I tell tales of the world in my tunes
I’ll show them one day that this my sacrifice
I’ve got the skills to sing crackles crackling 5
I stand here still waiting for rain
Damn I know this life is so painful yet
Hateful but Graceful
I don’t care adjectives, meanings are fateful
My girl faithful before we broke up
She says we were not right her eyes soaked up
She left me there with my heart broken
No matter if she’s taken I’ve got the tokens
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn
Look Here Baby It’s me and Don coda
Low on the border high on the soda
Chuck! Don coda really hot!
Me! I’ve got a kind of cold heart
Shawty still bowling
We ain't rolling
Roll some Change in my cart we ain't holding
We ain't folding we are sold in
We are out of the house
It’s too much cold inside
You see that thing bright
That our ring light
Scary looking down because us at much height
We going to fight because we are fighters
May see us running but we not hiders
We burn it to the ground we lighters
Doubles! Sorry Missed Me because it’s My Turn
They’ll maybe burn you again and again
Hey I think in this lane I’ve been playing Baby
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damn
Hey Girl Long Time No See
Everyone thought you was dead but me
Trust me, you love me
Everything’s going down like the fluffy music Dub-D Ah!
If haters could reach us we’d be flying
World crying! And Attention this is violence
Hey Man Don’t you see this band is dying
Sorry we couldn’t save it a tick of silence
Homie Lean on me
Trust is love you’ve shown me
Without you I’m feeling lonely
Nobody’s there you are the only
I rap about the winning map
Rap about the fastest lap
Lapping and I’m happy
And I’m happy because I’m rapping
Tapping phone calls
My knees have faced fall
I liked baseball
Now, Attention I hate halls
Uh! Attention, I’d be on my campaign
Did I mention I’d be popping champagne?
I’d be sipping, flying in the airplane
Holla at your band name, I ’ma do it same damnAsher: I owe you a rhyme?
Asher: Alright man, turn it up, man. Turn it up. Yo
Cudi: Yeah, It's whatever, man
Asher: I think I got somethin' special for you, too
Asher: Cause you know, Cudi and I, we go all over the place We, we.... we cross over. We don't like to... We like to go all... We walked in on some foreign talk
Cudi: Let's go
Asher: My shit is like this when people walk in
We do this, we do that, we do rock, we do rap
We do jazz we do funk and then classical
With a clash to Outkast, back to Johnny Cash
Flash from Black Thought and A Tribe Called Quest
Les from Primus, Mos Def and Kweli
Zepplin, Onyx, Beck, and Chuck D
Feelin' of Bob Dylan, hints of John Lennon
Mixed with a bit of Pimp C and Bun B 
Marley in my heart with parts of Charlie Parker
Mozart's art and all of Shawn Carter
Bjork to Tom York, Europe to New York
Morrison of The Doors, and Morsel of Too Short.
In short this list is long and just goes on, y'all
Me and Cudi, we unstoppable!
Cudi:
Yeah, I be freshman, next in
Kickin' up the dirt and they be blessed then
When you come arrest him, we'll be out, in minutes
I don't give a fuck what bail-bondsman are spittin'
I'mma let y'all niggas know they well wishin'
Kid Cudi fall off? Never bossy, I'm getting money
Bounce all around the world; similar to bunny
Rabbit, you want my dick? Come grab it
I will break skull, motherfucker
Kid Cudi's in the mall poppin' tags and I'm duckin' 'em
Everytime they try to play the games, all the model girls claim
That they runnin' round town and they fuckin' him
No, they ain't fuckin' with him, no, not on that level
I never love the hoes, cause a nigga got several
I'm not tryna be caught up, like I'm
In this, movie that you, know
I'm not tryna be up in court
Baggin' all these hoes, no nigga
I am just trying to sit back and smoke my kush
You want doobie? No, what you know is hit the puss
You wish you weird, nigga, my nigga, Asher Roth
We the motherfucking bossiest of boss
What you know about that, boy, yes the ball I will toss
Asher:
Yeah, and this is it, down to this
To the nitty gritty, my finger nails as dirty as any, but anyway
We slice it, it's goin' against me, fightin' to show 
I'm tryin', but no one lets me I'm tired, so don't upset me
Cause I'm, tryna fight with both arms tied behind me
With a blindfold on, throwin' shots at my body, but I
Continue on like I carried the cross
Stroll past the crossroads to the land of the lost
And then, skip right to Satan, throw some penny's at his feet
Say I'd give him my soul, but I sold it to the industry, so
Not up to me, attached a couple of strings
And before decisions made I'm in different directions
It's nothin' but reps and, record execs and
You and the next man go get your investments, cause
Now more than ever, I'm hot with hostility
It's now or never and never's never a possibility
Cudi:
If you'd listened to Day'N'Nite in reverse
You'd probably think I was suicidal, with the knife in the bible
I don't give a fuck with niggas sittin' back and so idle
I'm that nigga, I'm you'r father, get in your room and study
I'm that nigga in the back, you can call me your buddy
Cause I'm rollin' up the weed, so we can smoke the next plenty
Hey, so talk records homie
We do it bigger than you ever could imagine
I'm something like Big Pun and Biggie Smalls
Combined, but on half paid
I let these niggas know I dry heave
When I spit the heat, motherfuckers better bundle up, air tight
I be in the club all day through the midnight
You could get it spit right, yeah
I'm tryna let these motherfoes somethin wrong in here
There's somethin' wrong up in my brain
I'm not the same as everyone else
Niggas know the flow is the best in the elf
And stealth, Metal Gear Solid
Move when I'm runnin' in the game, can't stop him
Asthma, nigga Asher Roth and Hamilton
We put the game over and we gon' win
They losin' the game if we choosin'
We off and playin' beer pong all day we boozin'
We choosin' the nice hoes, we tryna get it poppin' after every show
Asher:
I want to admit that I have a track for you
It's called "She Don't Want A Man"
I think you would... rap to
But I don't mean rap to, I need you on the hook
Shit, I hate to go outside the book, but look
I stole someone's Poland Springs, didn't mean to
I think it was yours and all, but shit, I'm just drinkin' to
Try to stay hyrdrated, you know all day
Hydroplane when I make my way to NY-hey-C
See me on MTV soon, but please, no drama to you
When I was in the Woodies, with the cool kids
We was chillin, I was in the same fuckin' Sperry's as these
Please, can't see me gettin' fuckin' cheese
But hey, in my pockets, these the same dirty jeans
I work for three weeks, same fuckin' jeans, same K-mart tee
I mean this is a K-mart sweatshirt that I haven't washed in two weeks, but fuck it, I'm fuckin' dirty as shit
But now it's off the top talkin' bout nonsense
I don't care cause it's all ral- relevant, hell of it
Hell of this, fear this MC shit
So Cudi gonna give me a hook right here
There, for your ears
Crystal clear, it's enough, this is enough
So what, I don't give a fuck, where's my man Snuff at?
Snuffaluffagus, from Sesame Street, deep, you can't see me
I'm like The Beets and Doug Funnie
"The Killer Tofu" is oh who?
Who? Asher Roth, motherfucker, and now you knew
Cudi:
Hear them callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more
Say, oh I hear 'em callin', me
And I ain't playin' no more, hey
Now I will show you what's in store
Nigga further more, I'm that young boy out in the game, hey
And I can hear 'em callin'
And I can hear 'em callin'
Asher: There you go. You got -- You just got a whole song!
 That's what it is, baby. Peace out radio.)
Cudi: That hook was off the dome
Asher: Yeah, we love you enough
Asher: That was love right there
Cudi: That hook was off the dome
Asher: That was love right there
Asher: But for real, yo, I came here because I was like, yo, let's do itDay 'n' nite
I toss and turn, I keep stressin' my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see, I don't attain
What I need for keeps' this silly game we play, game we p-p-play
Now look at this
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see, I'm not that fast
I think I'm first but surely finish last, finish l-l-last
'Cause day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner, Mr. Solo Doe Low
He's on the move, can't seem to shake the shade
Within his dreams he sees the life he made, made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through, thr-r-rough
'Cause day 'n' nite
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
He's all alone through the day 'n' nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite, a-a-at nite

OneMy casket needs to be 100% rose gold-plated
I wanna be in my ripped Levis jeans
And my Incesticide Nirvana t-shirt with my Converse
Don't cut my hair
No matter what, keep the casket closed
Send my body to space to be buried on the moon
Or sent through a wormhole with all my music
And my story on a jump drive, if possible
Upon my death, all rivalries are deaded
Dance and celebrate, no sadness
Let my fans have a seperate funeral for me
So my family can mourn privately
Cremation if there's barely anything left of me
Or else dig up my dad's body and bury us together
Whenever my mom sees fit
Funeral must be Yeah man. Scott I got the message and the thing man, this is Melwisky nigga. Me and  got the hoes like left and right back at the house man, you need to come through man. Be there in about five. You need to come through man. You know. Come through. Left and right man. Need to come through doe on the real. Tell that nigga to bring me my money. Yeah, peaceSilence:Kid Cudi:Kid Cudi:У меня 99 проблем и это всё сучки
Хотел бы я быть Jigga-man`ом, беззаботно жить
Но я не Шон или Мартин Льюис
Я и есть Кливленд, который крутит с парнями из Бруклина
Ты знаешь как это, когда начинаешь большую жизнь
Я управляю своей жизнью, Чарльз никогда не был главным
Ситком не мог научить Скотта драме
Или даже объяснить проблемы, которые преследовали мою маму
В Рождество моя мама усердно работала и
Дала мне большую часть того,чего я хотел, как ты это сделала,мам?
Она отдала игрушки, с которыми я бы играл один в своей комнате
"Почему он один?"
У него было было два старших брата, один капюшон, один хороший
Самостоятельная старшая сестра помогала мне летать, когда могла
Но они все не видели
Немного грусти во мне
Скотти
У меня были проблемы, которые никто не может увидеть
И все эти эмоции выплескиваются из меня
Я выношу их на свет для тебя, это только правда
Это саундтрек к моей жизни, это саундтрек к моей жизни
Я супер- параноик, как шестое чувство
С тех пор, как мой отец умер, я не прав
И я пытался собрать паззл вселенной
Измельчая 8 грибов, только поэтому я мог видеть вселенную
Я пытаюсь думать о себе, как жертва
Только чтобы показать детям,что они не одни просыпаются ночью
Луна будет освещать мою комнату и скоро меня поглотит судьба
Когда-то всем было похуй
Все сказано, и мой член сосут
Поэтому сейчас я наедине с собой, алкоголь в ране
Мое сердце- открытая рана, которая скоро, надеюсь, заживет
Я живу в коконе напротив Канкуна
Где никогда нет солнца, обратная сторона луны
Поэтому это больше, чем правда, я пытаюсь пролить свет на человека
Немного людей на этой планете понимают ... боль
У меня были проблемы, которые никто не может увидеть
И все эти эмоции выплескиваются из меня
Я выношу их на свет для тебя, это только правда
Это саундтрек к моей жизни, это саундтрек к моей жизни
Я близок к тому,чтобы попробовать кокс
И счастливый конец может перерезать мне горло
Незнание справится, незнание это счастье
Незнание это любовь и мне нужно это дерьмо
Если бы я не выступал,то стал бы мифом
Если бы я заботился о блогах, то был бы придурком
Похуй на то, что говорят люди, дружище
Хэйтеры жмут мне руку, но я держу мыло наготове
Надеюсь, я правда доживу до 30
Хочешь успокоиться, перестать флиртовать
Большинство чистых лиц самые грязные
Мне только нужна породистая сука, чтобы жарить ее, когда я голоден
Жопа огромная, мозг безумен
Меня успокаивает только киска и Cali tree
И я беру оба, но никогда по-настоящему не удовлетворен
Я счастлив, это самая грустная ложь
У меня были проблемы, которые никто не может увидеть
И все эти эмоции выплескиваются из меня
Я выношу их на свет для тебя, это только правда
Это саундтрек к моей жизни, это саундтрек к моей жизни
К моей жизни, к моей жизни, к моей жизни
У
Да, ага 
ДаEvery body put your peace signs up
Your blunts up, yeah
Excuse my mood, my nigga, but I feel a bit Decepticon
Revenge is sweet, years I was shitted on
I'm a cancerous lump in the throat of the game
Any hatin' niggas chemo flow, can never intervene
Already in veins, damn its a note under these shame
Mister skinny jeans, takin' things on another plane
They love it, they need it, and even if I'm never weeded
They will still seek it
I write it on crypt leaf
So the, the people read it, when I'm gone and dead
What is in his head, Complex magazine
Couldn't craft a better sketch of the depths that linger above
I talk to my dads corpse when I'm stoned enough
I be rollin' up, he see me shine see me holdin' up
They wasn't lyin' bout me takin' the train
Before I had the chain catch me on the jmc
I know some niggas hate me, I see you muggin' hard
Ah, you can't deny me, they all salute the underdog
I ain't gotta say it, I'm kinda like a big kid
Yeah
Excuse me, excuse my mood my nigga, yeah
Excuse my mood baby, yeah
Excuse my mood baby
Now, we told you all a year ago
That we weren't playin' anymore
And we mean what we say at dream on GOOD
This is gorilla

She blamed it on the a-a-a-a-a-alcohol
She had her hair did, it was bound to fall
Down, down for a damn, Cudi already said it
A pokerface book I already read it
But man, her head was gooder than the music
Electro body known to blow fuses
A stripper from the south lookin' for a payday
Said bitch you should do it for the love like Ray Jay
But they say you be on that conscious tip
Get your hair right & get up on this conscious dick
I embody everything from the Gali to the party
It's the way I was raised on the south side safari, so...

Tryin' to drank 'till my back start slumpin'
Like old man, live by the old rules
Fought all the steps infront of the old fools
Got me nowhere, nigga, it's a different time
F*ck '08, niggas thinkin' '09

Niggas can't form a line
Like Kindergarten waitin' for the water fountain
Standin' up, said, arms crossed, poutin'
Scott Mescudi, boys they was doubtin' him
'Till they Googled me and found that Imeem
They love a dooder, they love me I mean
I can't believe how I had a dream of Martin King

Stand up, put your arms to the cieling man
Show skin, baby-girl, yeah, I'm a fan
Won't do you wrong, like a pushover
See Cudi ridin' through, better pull over

Dunkin Donut eatin' muthaf*ckas hatin', damn

Playin' ray-cash, get my Cleveland city on
Brooklyn to Cali, jet-lagged and all
There's still enough time to hit the mall
Shit, one wish when I'm deceased

Holla at meЯ переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Очень редко можете поймать меня
Вы все сделали меня "специальным гостем"
Вы все шутили,что мне нужно снять стресс
Как только я войду, я как "Давай выйдем"
Я был не в себе, я был истощен
Я не принимал таблетки, меня называли сумасшедшим
Как увлекательно, погрязнуть в стыде
Мне нужен весь дождь, мне нужна вся боль
Мне нужен весь дым, мне нужно осуждение
Кардио-музыка, дай мне побегать по мозгу
Попали в Audy Home, нас всех задержали
Все вы Марио, все это игра
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
У меня были проблемы, не мог сделать многого
Мир- это то, что начинается с меня 
Иногда, задаваться целью
Легче, чем быть никчемным
Но мир- это то, что начинается с меня 
Я много думал, но не знал куда идти
Я прошел долгий путь от преследования
И двигался очень медленно
Тебя не остановить, ни за что
О, дела идут не как раньше
Тебя не остановить, ни за что
Пока нет стресса, я так счастлив и....
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Двигайся вперед, продолжай идти
Что-то было неправильно 
Не мог сдержаться, почему? 
Очень далеко 
Сиди здесь в шторм 
Время идет 
Правда, не мог найти выход из 
Шторма 
Куда мне идти?
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Я переродился, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти вперед
Никакого стресса, Бог, я двигаюсь вперед
Продолжай идти впередUh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh...
Day and night 
I toss and turn, I keep stressing my mind, mind 
I look for peace but see I don't attain 
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Now look at this 
Madness to magnet keeps attracting me, me 
I try to run but see I'm not that fast 
I think I'm first but surely finish last, last
Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night 
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night 
Hold the phone 
The lonely stoner, mr. solo doe low 
He's on the move can't seem to shake the shade 
Within his dreams he see's the life he made, made
The pain is deep 
A silent sleeper you won't hear a peep, peep 
The girl he wants don't see no one into 
It seems the feelings that she had are through, through
Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night 
Day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone, some things will never change  
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night 
Slow moe, 
When the temple slows up and creates that new, new 
He seems alive though he is feeling blue 
The sun is shining man he's super cool, cool
The lonely nights 
They fade away he slips into his white nights 
He smokes a clip and then he's on the way 
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
To free his mind in search of
Cuz day and night
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at night
He's all alone through the day and night
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at night

At, at, at night Pitbull
Kid Cudi, I love this record dawg so I had to spit somethin' on it right quick
Cyph, You know what it is, back dat up
Mr. 305 know let me explain to you my life
Day and night 
I found myself thanking god for my life 
'Cuz I took all the wrong and made it right 
And I picked rap instead of dealin' weight, weight, weight
I took my fathers hustle 
And I took all of my family struggles 
And I mixed it up with all my mothers pain 
Whatchu see is whatchu get, Pitbull's the name, name, name
'Cuz day and night 
I find myself alone in this fame 
They own my music but not my mind 
They can try but they can't stop my hustle, grind, grind, grind
[Verse 1}

At, at, at night, night
At, at, at night, nightI hate when it rains, all I really do is sit on my ass
Thinking of the next scheme just to double my cash
If I ain't thinking about cash, nigga I'm thinking bout' life
Making a change, no winners do the same shit twice
Rainy days are a pain, felt the rush through my veins
Can't go to sleep, somebody's looking through my window pane
Mane, I swear I'm gon' catch em'
But maybe I'm trippin' like Scarface
My mind's playing tricks on me homie
When it rains, shit, I just wanna know where Do' is
Is he safe, warm and out the elements?
Mommy let him come home
I think a nigga done doing wrong
I get scared of the day when his soul will be gone
It's spoken words to thoughts. never been spittin' in vain
It seems the only way to sunshine is through the hard rain
I need to find a path leading to change, ask God if he feels my pain
That please won't you stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Grey clouds started forming
Gathered around my father's homecoming
When his soul on this earth was summoned
I remember a white church
And my lips had a salty taste
From the tears runnin' down my face
Can't erase the hurt
Watchin' my father's body lowered in dirt
My uncle and cousin passed too
What's life worth?
If it rained sometimes I would just sit there and cry
At recess, didn't wanna play
I just wished I would die
Things rushed through my head back when I was eleven
Praying and hoping that my dad had made it to heaven
It was hard being the youngest
And no one helped me
Everybody seemed happy
And no one felt me
But regardless of the fact
I did the best that I can
Making the transition from boy straight to a grown man
But understand, I felt the shame
And I feel the same, that God just needs
To stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Please stop the rain
Ask God if he feels my pain
Please stop the rain
Back then I was young
Now I'm grown here to fend on my own
I'm speaking and bringing the truth through this lyrical poem
And it's hard cause these niggas can't see
Open up your eyes you can recognize me
I felt the rain like every other nigga did
Nigga always slip and stand up so I slid
It's part of the life while every thing seems trife
And everything wrong very well may be right
It's just confusing and some people can't handle
Their mind breaks down, and their hearts start to dismantle
But I'm that boy to use the hand of evil dreams
God realize that this life is way more then it seems
It's just something you learn on the daily as your mind matures
Can't ruin the life with a heart so pure
And since I realize that things won't change
God you can keep with the same
Cause Im'a just deal with the rain
Im'a deal with the rain
Tell God just to leave it the same
Im'a deal with the rain 
{Outro}
Rainy days
Okay, why's that?
Yeah in Cleveland, it rains
Not all the time but
To a kid who wants to go out and play
It seems like it rains every day
Kids expect it to rain sometimes but
For one kid it rained too much

        Day n nite
I toss and turn, I keep stressin my mind, mind
I look for peace, but see I don't attain
What I need for keeps this silly game we play, play
Play play play play play play play
Now look at this
Madness the magnet keeps attracting me, me
I try to run, but see I'm not that fast
I think the first but surely finish last, last
Last last last last last last last last
Cause day n nite 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
Hes all alone through the day n nite
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite

The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite

Hold the phone
The lonely stoner missed his solo doe low
Hes on the move, can't seem to shake the shake
Within his dreams he sees the life he made
Made
The pain is deep
A silent sleeper, you won't hear a peep, peep
The girl he wants don't seem to want him too
It seems the feelings that she had are through
Through through through through through through through
Cause day n nite 
The lonely stoner seems to free his mind at nite
Hes all alone through the day n nite 
The lonely loner seems to free his mind at nite

Money, money, money is what they concur
Do they Agree? what they might see, could be
Not exactly what they thought
The car the rap star allgededly bought is probly the same car that the rap star rented
Front end in tennis, supreme in the snowfish
Tailin' the whip, parkin lot a double piece, parked then
My mom swore that I'd be the next come up
Them otha niggas far from it
Can't stand how these dick rock bandits even get granted the access
All up in the mix
Wanna be a Kanye
Wanna be a Skateboard P, but nigga
All the BBC cannot put you, in the same place or give you the same face
Find you first and you couldn't raise the stakes, higher
Not talkin shit just fire, please muthafucka
All this BAPE shit I rock is none otha
Who the best MC's in the Cleve?
Cas, Chip, da Cudder, triple da illness
And Ohio gotta feel this
Took a decade just to say I'm paid
Took a took a decade just to get girls to lay down, spread eagle, pop dat pussy ho'
Need the love below I'm the champ that needs a gold medal
Styles of flow homeboy, I got plenty
I payed for my noodle, the digital vortex. Textin' a freak
Digital phone sex
She wanna suck a dong 'cus my songs got me digital checks
Gigabytes decide the words that I write, I get gone nigga day and night
Unh. Take it literally
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?
How more crystal clear can I be?And I feel like, you know
If you're gonna be an artist
There's a time when you just have, you know
Embrace the responsibility
And I'm just sayin' the power of music is something so special
And be able to do it on this magnitude
When you reach millions of people
It's like, why not use that for good?
Why not tell kids something that they can connect with
And use with their lives
And like, really my mission statement from day one
And I'm getting so worked up talking about this
All I wanted to do was help kids not feel alone
And stop kids from committing suicideKid Cudi
