It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up, look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place 
Uh
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through, you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

When I see you again
Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Yeah
First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship, a friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go

Money's the motivation, money's the conversation
You on vacation, we gettin' paid, so
We on paycation, I did it for the fam
It's whatever we had to do, it's just who I am
Yeah, it's the life I chose
Gunshots in the dark, one eye closed
And we got it cookin' like a one-eyed stove
You can catch me kissin' my girl with both eyes closed, yeah
Perfectin' my passion, thanks for askin'
Couldn't slow down, so we had to crash it
You used plastic, we 'bout cash
I see some people ahead that we gon' pass, yeah!
I never feared death or dyin' 
I only fear never tryin' 
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with?
This moment , we own it
And the same ones that I ride with
Be the same ones that I die with
Put it all out on the line with
If you lookin' for me, you can find Wiz
In a new car or the crowd with
My new broad, that's a fine chick
Ain't no other squad I'm down with
Ain't no way around it
What you say? Tell me what you say
Workin' hard, reppin' for my dogs, do this every day
Takin' off, lookin' out for all, makin' sure we ball
Like the mob, all you do is call
Catch you if you fall, Young Khalifa
I never feared death or dyin' 
I only fear never tryin'  
I am whatever I am
Only God can judge me now
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with 
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? 
This moment, we own it
This the biggest day of my life
We got big guns, been graduated from knives
It's the day in the life and I'm ready to ride
Got the spirit, I'm feelin' like a killer inside, uh
Financial outbreak, I'm free but I ain't out yet
Ridin' with the plug, so I'm close to the outlet
At the red light, rims sittin' offset
I look better on your girl than her outfit 
Stuck to the plan, always think that we would stand up, never ran
We the fam and loyalty never change up
Been down since day one, look at where we came from
Jumpin' out on anybody who try to say some
One thing about it: got a problem? I got the same one
Money rolls, we fold
Plenty clubs we closed
Follow the same code
Never turn our backs, our cars don't even lose control
One shot, everything rides on tonight
Even if I've got three strikes, I'ma go for it
This moment, we own it
And I'm not to be played with 
Because it can get dangerous
See these people I ride with? 
This moment, we own it
Hahaha
Uh
This moment, we own it
I ride or die for mine
I'm ride or die material
One life to live, so here we go
This moment, we own itI torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain
Dolla $ign! I'm a sucker for pain
I got the squad tatted on me from my neck to my ankles
Pressure from the man got us all in rebellion
We gon' go to war, yeah, without failure
Do it for the fam dog, ten toes down dog
Love and the loyalty that's what we stand for
Alienated by society
All this pressure give me anxiety
Walk slow through the fire
Like, who gon' try us?
Feeling the world go against us
So we put the world on our shoulders
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain
I been at it with my homies, it don't matter, you don't know me
I been rollin' with my team, we the illest on the scene
I been riding 'round the city with my squad
I been riding 'round the city with my, squad
We just posted, getting crazy, living like this is so amazing
Hold up, take a step back when we roll up cause I know what
We been loyal, we been fam, we the ones you trust in
Won't hesitate to go straight to your head like a concussion
I know I been bussin', no discussion for my family
No hesitation, through my scope I see my enemy
Like what's up? Hold up, we finna re-load up
Yes I re-load up, I know what up, I know what up
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm a slave to your games 
I wanna chain you up, I wanna tie you down
Oooohh, I'm just a sucker for pain
Uhh, devoted to destruction
A full dosage of detrimental dysfunction
I'm dying slow but the devil tryna rush me
See, I'm a fool for pain, I'm a dummy
Might cut my head off right after I slit my throat
Tongue kiss a shark, got jealous bitches up in the boat
Eating peanut butter and jelly fishes on toast
And if I get stung, I get stoked, might choke
Like I chewed a chunk of charcoal, naked in the North Pole
That's why my heart cold, full of sorrow, the lost soul
And only Lord knows when I'm coming to the crossroads
So I don't fear shit but tomorrow
And I'm a sucker for pain, it ain't nuttin' but pain
You just fuckin' complain, you ain't tough as you claim
Just stay up in your lane, just don't fuck with Lil Wayne
I'ma jump from my plane or stand in front of a train
'Cause I'm a sucker for pain
Used to doing bad now we feel like we just now getting it
Ain't got no other way so we start it and finish it
No pain, no gain
Never stand down, made our own way
Never going slow, we pick up the pace
This is what we wanted from a young age
No emotion, that's what business is
Lord have mercy on the witnesses
I torture you
Take my hand through the flames
I torture you
I'm just a sucker for pain
More pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin', beggin'
For more pain
Got me beggin'...She's about to earn some bragging rights
I'm 'bout to give it up like I've been holding back all night
Girl, take pride in what you want to do
Even if that means a new man every night inside of you
Baby, I don't mind
You can tell by how I roll
Cause my clique hot and my cup cold
My talk slurred cause I’m so throwed
And I'm wiping sweat from my last show
And he's TG and I'm XO
I'm only here for one night
Then I'ma be a memory
Say it in my ear, so I can hear what you say to me
I got cups full of that Rosé
Smoke anything that's passed to me
Don't worry 'bout my voice
I won't need it for what I'm about to do to you

Nigga listen
Break it down, rolling weed on the island of my kitchen
And not a thing goes down without permission
Look, everything I got on I was made for
Everything that I got I done came for
All the shit that you see I done slaved for
All the cars and the crib, yeah that's paid for
Need I say more
Spend so much money on clothes
Said fuck a store, making my own
I hope that you're rolling one up while you're singing along
And know I was rolling one while I was making this song

We lose control
Drop the top in that 69
And that motor roar in that old Chevelle
Can’t say a thing, how you supposed to feel
Stacking all of this paper, dawg
I like to call this shit old news
And these haters jocking our old moves
Popping champagne cause we made it
Back of the Phantom, we faded

Living young and wild and free
So what I keep ‘em rolled up?
Saggin’ my pants, not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for these hoes

Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501 jeans on it
Roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’til they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day
I’m with your bitch smokin’ grade A
You know what?

Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh my god, I’m on the chase, Chevy
It's gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keeps slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Upfront, four blunts, like, “Khalifa put the weed in a J”
So what we get drunk?
So what we smoke weed?
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
And I don't even care
Cause if me and my team in there
There's gonna be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin' and now you knowin'
When I step right up, get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are lookin' up
From the ground up, pound up, this Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up and mount up and do my thang
Now I'm chillin', fresh outta class, feelin'
Like I'm on my own and I could probably own a building
Got my own car, no job, no children
Had a science project, me and Mac killed it
T-H-C, M-A-C, D-E-V, H-D-3, high as me
This is us, we gon' fuss
And we gon' fight and we gon' roll
And live off life

We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out?

Back when I was young I had dreams of getting richer
Then my homie Breeze set me down schooled me to the picture
I was with some wild niggas put me on the game
Told me if you tryin' to make your move you gotta know your lane homie
All you got your name and your word so never break it
For this life you pay a price you get a chance you gotta take it
Cause most niggas never make it they stranded where I'm from
Ain't no conversation all they understand is get a gun
I was riding in my Bonneville hoping I could make it
Out selling P’s and smoking weed avoiding police right up the street
Way back in the day before I had all of this paper
Before I had all of these diamonds, before I had all of these haters
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there
And I'm throwing up my money for the ones who never made it
Sayin' fuck the ones who hated, roll one up and celebrate
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded

Roll that weed up and smoke it
Take your bitch home and poke it
Juicy be gettin' so faded
Thank God I got a chauffeur
Only good cali bud
Pulling hoes bad as fuck
Just like a youngin' my nigga
Juicy do all them drugs
Niggas smoking that babbage weed
I be on that light green
Pop molly in the after hours
A member of no sleep team
Get a whole pound smoke it by myself
Or maybe after Olympics with my homie Michael Phelps
You known I’m fresh up off that corner, twistin marijuana
They copy us, they clone us
Yeah we so fly we owners
Got acting like they been before
But they ain't never been at all
8 balls I was in the hall
Ain't have time to fuck with y'all
Champagne when we celebrate
Keen sense so I smell the hate
Middle finger we getting paid
It cost much but don't press that eight
That dotted line it ain't like that day
Comic book let me illustrate
Like power bang when they lift that cane
My cousin died wish I can get that day
Back like it's a vertebrae
Bring that nigga on front street
Talk about and never be about it
They don't wanna beef cause that's lunch meat
So anything you need you know that's on me
And that's OG, I swear homie
Now let's get medicated
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
Man, let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Let's get medicated
Man I'm hella faded
I'm hella faded
Riding down the street the way I'm grinding is unique
My city holding on to me so niggas holding on their heat
Throwing up their side, rolling up that leaf
All we do is get high, all we want is peace
Always on the grind that's every day so police looking
I'm just rapping killing beats and tryin' to stay away from booking
Yeah my niggas dirty crooked I just had to make it on
And let me hit the studio to show they happy to be home
Now I remember when, I seen it and to me it was stuntin'
I remember when, I bought it I ain't need it or nothing
Always in a different state so now they label me a goner
I ain't come up out of nowhere I'm from straight up off the corner
Now everywhere we go, they probably know my name cause I been there
Now everywhere we go, they said how much I spend when I'm in there

Let's go

Let's get it 
Haha
Roll up my weed as soon as the day start
Get me a pound and I break it apart
Kush on my clothes, smell the green in my car
Ain't coming close, you smell me from afar
Time after time, I keep smoking that herb
Joint after joint, I must be on the verge
Of overdosing, I be on that loud
Speeding me up, while I'm slowing you down
I just got back from an overseas trip
Smoking with Ty, he got me high as shit
Cause we keep nothing but good in our J
Repping our gang and we mob everyday
Break down an ounce, put it right on a tray
Ain't saving nothing, we smoke everything
Light up a joint, let it stink up the place
Or hit the bong, blow the smoke in your face
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high
Break it down and roll another one, I could get anything I want
I told her "You should bring a friend for the crew" 
Hear 'em talk but they ain't want it though, I'm in the Hall of Fame of smoke
'Cause everybody that I'm with, get high too 
Only rolling in a Wiz Khalifa paper 
Taylor Gang G Pen, smell the vapor 
Take it to the head before I walk up to the plane
I'll probably get so fucking high
Won't even know my fucking name
You got to be a pro, if you wanna get this blow
Never inhale, teach you how to hit this smoke
And I'm never running out of it 
Kush smoke, got a lot of it 
Smoke like we hit the lottery 
Seen Snoop, he was proud of me 
Won't go broke 'cause I never spend 
If them hoes don't smoke, don't let 'em in 
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real
And I love getting high
And I love getting high
I'ma get money, nigga, I'ma get money
I'm a real nigga so I'ma keep it real

All up in it in the mornin', knowin' damn well that I had you up late
Ain't buyin' it you ain't spendin' it, you keep throwin' it back so I'm givin' it

Wake up when I bake up that's just somethin' that I do

Up in my bed's where you probably belong
Givin' you all that I got 'til it's gone
Sexy as fuck you still got them heels on
Favorite position, we tryin' them all
Once I get in can't get out of my zone
Fuck you so good you won't pick up your phone
And when your girlfriends or whoever do call

You love when I get, you love when I get
You love when I get up in it
You love when I get, you love when I getI feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family 
Five, four, three, two, I got one shot
You lose the love and respect, that's where the trust stop
New work, top drop
I roll up every fifteen minutes like a bus stop
And you can smell just how I'm smokin' when I burn out
And you can catch me ridin' dirty, but my car not
It's love and loyalty until my heart lock
Never turn your back, won't know how it turned out
I said it once, I'll do it again
I'm playin' the game, I do it to win
With you and your friend, that's thick and thin
That's me and my team, you know we gon' win
You know we gon' ball, you know we gon' ride 'til the wheels fall off
You know we gon' stick to the course, we ain't thinkin' 'bout y'all
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down
Cause it's time to go hard or go home

Swingin' on the green like I'm tryna get a par four
You ain't sittin' at my table, hope you starve
Ho, don't be pushin' my buttons 'less you startin' up my car
Pressure make a diamond, that pressure made me a star
Got a method to my madness, to bring me down by the bar
People always askin' me how I got this far
My response is just to keep it honest and be who you are
Now they call me Mrs. Money like I'm married to the moolah
Just to measure my success I need at least a hundred rulers
Glory, hallelujah, I'mma take that ass to church
I'mma finish like I started, Iggy still got that work
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain't nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge, I won't back down

Game running
Wanna know my hotel
And who phone to ring when she coming
I keep it a hundred
Get love from the hoes, but it's
Money over bitches
Nothing above it
Like the weed loud
Like my engine when I speed up
Bitches holding they weave
Rolling trees
With they pretty feets up
Them suckas often imitate
But they can't be us
So super high
Look in the sky when you wanna see me bruh
Cut my speakers up
Drowning out what the critics say, just
Continue to smoke and remain G as fuck
Polo socks match my Polo hat
She leave once, it's a known fact
That she ain't coming back
Now Taylor Gang that
And ain't shit change
But the amount of horses in my motor
When I switch lanes
And I beat 'em blinding
With them diamonds in my big chain
Heavy in the game, little homie
I'm doing big things
And them bitches, they mesmerized
They recognize
I keep it so G 
Get you some money, fuckin' with me 
I don't love 'em

My game tight, seal and sign it
Them niggas just playing
Ain't really ballin'
Saying they being honest
Claiming that's your wife

She all in my hotel suite
At 3 in the morning
Taking her clothes off
Inhaling weed and coughing
Ain't her first time chiefing

She taking it off, most of these niggas just talk, ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I’m making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it’s a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No NBA, they say I’m a baller
Live for today, stunt like my my father
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day?
I’ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone
I’m gonna spend it all why wait for another day
I’ma take all this money I own and blow it all away
Cause I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can’t take it when I’m gone, gone, gone, gone, goneThe world turning, the weed burning
Them haters talking, I keep earning
Know some who say life's a bitch
Well I’mma keep flirting
Fuck that bitch for the money and Louis V purchases
Old folks jock my car cause they know just what this is
Niggas flexin’ hard with no bars, they got weak service
Keep verses, Mortal Kombat
Look at my ring, if I ain't ballin’ bitch then what you call that
Nothing but net, ain't back cause I never left
I did everything right nigga better yet
Rolling bomb for the niggas that's around us
Something like a contracto,r built it from the ground up
Now just, twist up this weed
Realize that you are in the presence of a G
Don’t fuck up my paper meaning my cheese
Or the ones I use to roll up my trees
Fuck it, you know what I mean
I’m riding round, smoking, my music up loud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
See me, when I’m alone, wishing they could fuck with me
My ex calling my phone, wishing she could stunt with me
But I’m just riding dawg, doing a buck fifty
Stunting like Jet Li, boat houses and jet skis
Thirty on the flight, ice like the Gretzky's
My dime pieces only recognize the best trees
Treat ‘em like I don’t need ‘em boy, you best believe
You in her face, I let her breathe
From debated on, to waited on
From hated on, to the nigga they put cake up on
Cause we are, young movie stars
Cause we are, young movie stars
I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
O-ooo-oh, now I just stunt on my own
Bitches ain't say shit to me
But now they won’t leave me alone
Used to walk the other way
But now they all come to my home
And they calling my phone, cause my paper is looong
Nothing, they ain't singing my song
Get hired up, if they want then I bring them along
We flying up, no you won't need a ticket at all
Need a ticket at all, tell a bitch I’ma ball
And I’ma buy a new crib for my niggas and all
Cause I remember days we’d sit and pictured it all
Nigga swear I’d leave or pictured I’d fall
Counting reasons why they hate, your bitch think I’m a star
Cause we are, young, gifted
Not to mention out here making muthafuckin millions
Yeah, I said it, muthafuckin millions
Got my money up, I’m in the building
I’m riding round, smoking, good music aloud
Gotta do my thing, no disrespect to the niggas before me
Some smile up in your face but then they hate on the low
Now I just stunt on my own
Now I just stunt on my own
I’m in a race, and taking the winner's place
No foot on the brakes
One of the best, homie that's what they call me
It’s lonely at the top, ain't no company so
Now I just stunt on my own

Highly faded, but I'm highly paid so I just live my life

Tired of niggas saying they in my gang cause dog, we ain't alike
I'm throwing money, when I walk up in this bitch, they know it's money
Money in my arms, other table full of money
Pocket full of joints I rolled, dropping ashes on my clothes
Balling super hard, smoking 'til I overdose
Hardly ever sober, bitch we party 'til it's over
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to
When this song come on, I'm spending money
Play something I can spend some money to

Spending money, popping hella bottles, making niggas mad
Going places, rolling Js, I live the life you wish you had
Throwing out dollars bills, putting shit on my tab
Got a joint full of that OG, got a clique full of them OGs

When you try to get the thing in the store
Have you ever seen a nigga lookin' crazy then the motherfucker
In it but the price you don't even know
Never seen nobody walk up in the store without no money
When they come out they hands are full of hella bags
Never seen nobody come into the store and get the treatment that I get
I guess that mean I spend hella bands
Have you ever got your suit tailor'd by the man
Have you ever got your suit flown in by the man
You don't get that kind of money you don't understand
You ain't ever touch a hundred grand

And you could sit right on your ass, doubtin'
While I'm somewhere rollin' up grass, going up where the clouds is
Some niggas say they get so high that I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
I say if them niggas got that high man I ain't fuckin' wit' em'
Doing nothin' wit' em, rollin' up or puffin wit em'
Goin' on the road, doin' shows or gettin' ducats wit' em'
I been smokin' in my pictures since Myspace
You niggas extra-curricular, bitch I fly straight
Some niggas try that shit for nothing, but I just tell em' to do what they do

Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing

High as fuck, choked up in my cabin
Got some OG from a fan and it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers
Never smokin' that bullshit with them fucked up names and them flavors
I remember puttin' weed in my videos, niggas thought I was insane
Now every time I turn on a video, I see the exact same thing
Cause niggas ain't original, niggas ain't cool
You niggas ain't got it naw, you niggas just ain't you
That shit is a problem for a nigga who can't lose
Lil homie I gotta ball, its something you can't do
So suckas hate

So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too 
Just give me weed in my joint and I ain't need it for nothing

All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin' with no other drug
I think Kush & OJ obviously is the one that broke you
To the consciousness. So people expect that from you
So it feels like, almost, homage to that but next level
Like the beat by Spaceghostpurrp takes it next level
The way the Seldgren's changing the sound a little bit
Takes it next level production-wise
And then you take it, next level
I'm glad you fuck with it
And that's what it's all about
Taking it to the next level
Elaborating on what we've done
Because a lot of people
They've elaborated on what we've doneListen to this track, bitch

Cutlass on them chrome spokes with the engine running
Sounding like a dinosaur empty stomach rumbling
Your bitch at the window cause she know I'm coming
She tell you that she 'bout to go jogging and on the corner
She jump in, take her to the honeycomb
Stuffing kush in Raw cones, playing Megaman 3
Your Wonderwoman giving dome out Miami

She just high, tomorrow night, she'll be titties out, dancing
Trying to leave with the next nigga in a Aston

I be overseas, I be in L.A.  
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be M.I.A.  
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid
I be overseas, I be in L.A. 
I be in New York, I be M.I.A.  
If you know me, you know I'm 'bout my bread
I count a hundred million dollars 'fore I go to bed
I'm smoking OG, I'm drinking champagne
I'm standing on the couch just throwing up my damn gang
I'm out in A town, 'bout to go to Mansion
My jewelry on so all my dogs is ready for the action
I'm in my old school, my niggas ridin' new
I'm in the Fountain Bleu like "What you tryin' to do?"
I brought the whole thang so that's what I'ma smoke
I spent the whole thang, I'm never going broke
I'm rocking gold chains, I'm drinking 'til I croak
Smokin' 'til I choke, my watch need a vote, oh
I be overseas, I be in L.A. 
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day 
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay 
I be in New York, I be M.I.A. 
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid
I be overseas , I be in L.A.  
I be in New York, I be M.I.A. 
On vacation weed in rotation
Relaxation, trippy nation
Chasing bands, model chicks
Look like Sports Illustrated
I'm getting high as a plane
With no final destination
On that gin, on that Hen
And that lean intoxication 
Rocking dollars, rocking gold
Money tall like Manute Bol
In a presidential suite
With some Playmate centerfolds
Niggas out here chasin' ass
But they should be chasin' cash
I be smoking 'til it's gone
Juicy J don't waste no gas 
With her legs lift up 
I thought it was a stick up 
Should've seen them hoes that pick up
Bands hard to lift up 
Yellow diamonds look like a bumble bee 
They call me the money tree 
All these bands on me, I can throw a jamboree
I be overseas, I be in L.A.  
I be in the South, trappin' hard all day
I'm from Pittsburgh, but I be in the Bay
I be in New York, I be M.I.A.  
I be in Chi-town where they quick to spray
I be in Detroit where they gettin' paid
I be overseas, I be in L.A

Everything you do, smoke weed

I'd rather be getting high 
Ridin' with my niggas getting right 
It ain't over 'till I say so 
Time flies, no lie 
I'd rather be getting high 
Ridin' with my niggas getting right 
It ain't over 'till I say so 
Hold up, roll up, mo money to throw up
Walk in the club, everybody go up
A hundred and 50K just to show up
And everything ain't what it seems
It's hard to live somebody else's dreams
I put all my trust in my team
Know that my money straight, won't let nothing come in between
Politic with my fam, never let the hate intervene
Smoking weed out of Vegas and thanking God for the scene
Thinking back to when we ain't have it
Made it on, came far, needed practice
Moving forward while you thinking backwards
Never sleep, hardly need a mattress
I kick my shoes off my feet, then fall asleep in my seat
Claiming you on your job, well doggie, it ain't complete
Claiming you got the squad but you niggas can't compete
Came with too many broads, can't fit them all in my suite
What can I say? Bring the champagne glasses, roll the J's faster
Time flies, no lie 
I'd rather be getting high 
Ridin' with my niggas getting right 
It ain't over 'till I say so 
Time flies, no lie 
I'd rather be getting high 
Ridin' with my niggas getting right 
It ain't over 'till I say so Young Chop on the beat
Uhh
Where you going? What you doin'? 
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more 
Got money, then I got me some more
Hundred bottles that's nothin'
I be out Greystone and I'm stuntin'
I be up standing on the couch bottle in my mouth
Pourin' champaigne and spitting champaigne out
Just cause I came up from not havin' shit
Made a couple mill off this rapping shit
Smoking papers ya'll smoking backwoods
Hustle smart, while ya'll hustle backwards
Niggas gettin' lost in the game
Me, I'm all getting sorts of change
Niggas tryna cross in my lane
I'm thinking that it's awesome, fixing up a cone
Porsche getting washed in the rain
Rolex watches, diamonds in my chain, damn look at all them rings
Don't know what to call it, smoke like a rasta
Drink like an alcoholic, like I just came back from college
Take another shot I'm balling, KK cones up in my wallet
Came here and turnt up, Now your hoes wanna' go with us
At the crib with my niggas
They ain't acting like they your bitches no more
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
When I started this ain't have all of this
Now I came up what chu' calling it?
Couple millionaires on my calling list
Need it Hookah's niggas yes men
Scared to tell the truth cause
Now these old heads think they the new us
Got a bitch so thick call her two cups
And my chain so cold got the roof up
I only been here for three years and made more than you in ten
Told my niggas we started broke and never going there again 
Them niggas hating but they know we don't stop
Now I'm flying out to different places
Talking shit
Demonstrating shit that makes us rich and famous
Money conversations
Obligations, not about a dollar is a foreign language
Now I got everything
A better car, a better team and I ain't worried about nigggaaaasss
Where you going? What you doin'?
They hating on it, but you keep it moving
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
Keep that KK, and it's rolled up
Got that bombay, now we slowed up
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more

If it's 'bout money, it's 'bout me
Made my way up in the game
When they doubted me, oh
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me some more
Got money, then I got me
If it's bout money, it's bout me
If you rolling up, ain't no getting high

Them hoes dont use they feet no more, they break down to their knees
And suck me like a king
Rosé in my champagne glass and diamonds in my ring
Uh, roll some, thats your bitch on my dick
I might let her hold something
You niggas smoking sevens I'mma need a whole onion, whole youngin, oh
Same ones that hate, same ones that tag along
No Blackberry, too many lame niggas call my phone
Call me world wide Wiz cause I’m never home
Ever leave me round your bitch I’mma get her stoned
And you know that I rock camos and brought fros back
And go download some of my old track
And go play somewhere there’s hoes at
Fucking high, and you down there where them lows at
Gettin tired of hearing my flow jacked
Go head hand me a joint, you can't roll that
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party
Quarter pound of that sour, thats four days on tour
Sleeping on how we smoke, see all these pillows on this floor
Every state we score, fill those papers they be raw
Look like a piece of chalk in my hand
But I ain't writing on the chalkboard
And I heard its a party, its a party its a party but I’m cool
Them niggas smoking garbage, I’m no fool
We give 5 j’s out half zips? Nigga thats really smoking
Ain't enough weed up in that swisha to get you high, you joking
Niggas claim that they be high, they be hella low
When they gang up in the building you gon’ smell that sour smoke
I could get that shit from my backyard, go pick it out myself
Yellow light let me slow it down, niggas need some help
28 ain't enough you need more
All this weed over here, thats 1 weed jar
When them planes get the flying, niggas wanna part
Smoking crash with the plane, Amelia Earhart
I got a whole lot of OGs, and
I’m rolling up for anyone in here that knows me
Everybody smoking, yea it's a party, oh, its a party
Everybody smoking papers, nobody smoking blunts
Bitches rolling weed and my niggas fucked up
Yea it's a party, oh, it's a party
What I smoke in one day, these niggas dont smoke in one week
Riding round and its just me, Pepsi can, playing that Bun B
Gotta smoke that dope on the run with me, comfortably, I’m smoking weed
Doing speeds, who with me, probably a chick from TMZ
I make her roll like two or three, let her smoke and feel the breeze
Ya’ll chip in on a half a zip, counting grams, saving weed
Average shit, it was us just smoking out in NY
Swear to GOD we let ten fly, thats ten planes with ten guys
Nine smoke, meaning someone left without his mind pot
Planes Continental, flights nonstop
You get some zips, well get some P’s
Smoke your spliffs around your bitch, tell me how does she breath
Perfect planes, we call them G6′s
And its just me chilling, me and three bitches
Rolling up its cool, come take this bong rip
Pack this bold straight dope, make your lungs ripStill blazin', still blazin', still blazin'

Where ain't nobody in my business, don't nobody gotta know
Let all your conscious go and blow it by the O
I'm here, but my minds gone
And it's gettin hard to see you, 'cuz my eyes low
Marijuana minutes, nigga time slow
On a kush clock, there's always time to smoke
Say I look high? I say I'm high, bro
Still blazin', no one with me, just facin
I remember days when I could only smoke on occasions
I couldn't wait to go and cop from ray and them
Rollin blunts of 50, stuck in my moms basement
Had dro for sale, but niggas was smokin' haze then
Blew a O a day then, don't know, but somehow I made away
And nigga them bills need pay, but I'm

400 a zip, nigga, that's what I'm on
And I'm gonna re-up as soon as the fires gone
Smokin OG kush from another time zone
As the smoke begins to pile on
Wettin' rags and puttin' bags over the fire alarm
You niggas styrofoam, lightweights

You can see it when it shine, you see it then it’s mine
Always on my hustle, always on my grind 24/7, 365
Came up off the corner, quarters, nicks, and dimes
Nigga don’t believe me, look into my eyes
Niggas moving pies, niggas losing lives
Niggas doing time, they just tryna’ survive
Niggas talking shit, see me then its fine
Broke and rich nigga, it’s a very thin line
Speeding in my ride, smoking weed, I’m getting high
Hope you niggas fire, gonna need em’ if you try
All black leather, all black Jordan 5's
Money in the bank, kay kay on my mind
Got some niggas that I’m cool with, some gangster ass ties
All my niggas riding, all you niggas smiling
Shades on so them haters can’t look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
So high that they say it’s hard to look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You’ll see all the shit I been through if you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
You gon’ see a real nigga when you look into my eyes
Look into my eyes, look into my eyes
My pops tell me I look tired when he look into my eyes
Soon as the cameras come on I know how to look alive
My mom tell me I look stressed when she look into my eyes
So many people in my business I’m just trying to live my life
You can tell I took a dab if you look into my eyes
See them kay kay clouds floating if you look into my ride
Say I look just like Sebastian if you look into my eyes
Know this whole world fucked up so I gotta raise him right
So we rolling, we smoking on that potent
A boss I got my own shit, Breeze holding on that chrome shit
He down to let you hold it, we all the same we close knit
Roll weed up by the ocean, you closing shop we open
We all know that the bullshit be talking and that real shit be walking
It’s a 9-11 I’m parking, you ain't getting money that’s awkward
Probably say I need a day off if you look into my eyes
Niggas faking but I can’t I don’t look good in that disguiseWhen I ride by, I want you to see what I see

Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Countin' my benjis
Puttin' it all in the bank but I don't really mind if I spend it
Can't take it? Don't cross the line when you finish
When you stay all on your grind you can get it
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen
Duckin' 'em shots, that's divine intervention

You make a choice, hope you like your decision
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted
Go up in smoke just like I'm a magician
She ain't have fun, then she probably was trippin'
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Get to this money, get high, my intentions
Family first, that's a valuable lesson
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together, we stick to the mission
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together, we stick to the mission
Rollin' that weed up without no permission, uh

Take a look outside, those are really ours
And we're really stars
We all travel safe and go really far
In that custom paint, in that suede floor
In that California, that's really hard
In that California, that's what we on
Smell that strong, you know I'm baked
Chances dog, that's what we take

Hey man, green is for the money, gold is for the honeys
Step up your game or step down
Whenever a problem troubles us all
If you trust in the Lord there will be a brighter tomorrow
For there's nothing too much for the great God to do
And all that he asks and expects of you
Is faith that's unshaken by tribulation and yield
Confidence and knowledge that God knows best
And trouble and sorrow, they are only a test
But without God testin' of our soul
It never could reach the ultimate goal
So keep on knowing and believing
All that God has promised you would be yours to receive
Preach, Church, tabernacle

Outside with my new car, my Chally parked by my old one
Got a couple of rollies dawg, but I'm usually rocking a gold one
Catching flight on them private planes, Ferrari doors I close 'em
Don't talk a mil', you ain't sold one, don't talk a pound, you ain't smoked one
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Smokin' and sippin' while watching hoes strippin'
Poppin' and rollin', I'm chieffin' this potent
Dope by my side with the pistol and chopper
Got from my bitch and she get from her mama
Talking like this, I be walking like this
Sold a few hoes and I bought a new bitch
Taylor Gang niggas the number one chieffas
Smokin' on gas prolly louder than speakers
Mix with the hash, dip in the lean blue dream, I'm a fucking fiend
Standing on Fairfax getting smoked out with them niggas from Supreme
Trippy sticks, bong rips, blunt dip, I'm down to do whatever
She wanna pop a molly man, Juicy J gon' fuckin' let her
For a stronger strain I'm spending bands, this ain't no reggie
When it's 'bout this gettin' high, ain't nothin you can tell me
Xanax bars, beans and syrup, that's my trippy kit
I'm like a pimp in the club working your bitch
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
Roll it up, light it up, have a puff, let's take a plane
I don't like to say I because we're a collective
Sledgren makes the beats and fuckin' Cardo
Or Jerm does the engineering
Or me and Chevy sit around and talk about shit
And come up with shit
We made it comfortable for a lot of people to do
Like what they're doin' and feel cool doin' that shit
So what we're gonna do with this mixtape is
Really just turn it around and step that upUh, I’mma tell you that you not my competition
I’mma always win, throw me in and I’m going in
I ain’t running, I’mma come until you leave
I'm 'bout to get it, talk about it ‘cause I really live it
On them nights on a mission, no fear, no hope in my vision
Don’t need no intervention, you ain’t down to rider
And even if you was I come out, point ‘em out, they all gon’ be missing
Wonder why I’m still here act a fool if you met me 
You try to be brave and step up with you crew it’s too scary
Plus I’m too legendary, It’s what we go hard for
I’m rocking your block, you on top you get knocked off
I’m taking your place yeah, I'll make it my property
May be a game to you, probably, that’s a way of life for me
And so it’s only right for me, annihilate ‘em if they in my way or sight
Keep 'em up off of me, a weakness in you only make an appetite
Anytime I get into it I be looking at them, looking pitiful
And their condition it be critical, nothing less than original
Cross me once that's the end of you - who’s next?]
Ear Drummers

Fuck her, don't need her no more
Six in a row, get a bitch, give her the bone
Break her like six in them stones
Niggas so cold, thinking I sit in the snow
I keep a bitch getting stoned
Smoke in my home, all my whips covered in chrome
All my dips love giving dome
Get it to go, back to my crib stuffing cones
Y'all either kids or my clones
We turnt up on marijuana and champagne
Them niggas talk ‘bout who they are, but they don’t do a thing
Can't tell me I ain't drunk I'm on that water in the club
Different strokes, find me a bitch I can poke
I'mma go get me an "O" and

Go straight to the brain, your shit ain't the same
A different lane, we sipping champagne
I been in the game, just give me a flame
She looking for change, I'm rolling up Jane
I'm balling insane, got more than six rings
In love with my slang, I'm puffing a J
I hunt her today, come up with a play
Most of these niggas be wanting to cuff on a bitch
I just be up in the way, stuff in the safe
I'm loving the race, stuck in first place
Fuck her for days
Them niggas wanna talk about it but they don't wanna roll
What it takes to be a real G, they don't even know
I go to her page, she come to my place
It look like a maze, we roll up a plane
She look at my change, she start giving brain
If they ain't the gang, then we ain't the same
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slow
Burn slow, burn slowDoes anybody have regular size papers out there?
King size? I'll use those
Let me see that grinder
Got the windows down, radio's on
You got it all, well at least you think you do
When it's time to ball, niggas better think of you
You see the life you wanna live on TV and wanna be a part of it
Spend every night just popping bottles, pouring drinks in VIP, and you love it
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, don't worry, that's just how the game go
The more you make, the more they hate, the more they're fake, but I'm just singin' the same note, playin' the same song
You got it all, well at least they think you do 
When they say workin' hard, man, they better think of you
Cause all these plaques, nigga, that's because of it
Wouldn't have shit if it wasn't for it
Smokin' on medicinal, spraying ozium to try cover it
In the game playin' hard, but I'm just in the game, I ain't in love with it
Y'all niggas tryin' to get famous, a nigga like me tryin' to get fuckin' rich
Fuckin' rich, fuckin' rich, broke ass niggas can't fuck with this
Fuck a deal, when it goes down, got a hundred mill on my bucket list
Y'all niggas gon' keep on hatin' but we ain't gonna stop then
You'll catch me in somethin' foreign and the top gon' be droppin'
When you think of those, you think of the
Jay Zs, the Diddys and Master P back when he was
Really, really getting it
Now, you didn't rank— number 11 is a nice place to land

Got a ticket on your head, let my homie hit the lotto
Big niggas, I don't fight it, see the boom or a bottle
Word on the street I'm a suspect
Helicopter too now, I'm a subject
Face on the news nigga, for the public
Gotta hide at my cousins at the projects
Smoking weed with the Crips in the complex
Twisting OG's with the Bloods in the commons
Cause only colour they see is green
And they're gonna do anything for the commas
TGOD, now they wanna call the feds
I'm a keep smoking all this, all this grass
What you smoking on, nigga? That's a bag full of trash

Where we goin' next week I let my hoes choose
No socks in my boat shoes
Guess a nigga eatin' good like Whole Foods
Not a couple cameras now they bring the whole crew
Bad bitch ridin' with me, so she pose too
See me and my guys like a plane flown through
Hella high, roll up weed up like I'm supposed to
And now I'm into big things
Own the building, you need to know the tenant rate
Gettin' paid still ridin' no shirt
Let a bitch give me brain call it homework
Niggas try hatin' on 'em but it don't work
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Slow money just as bad as gettin' no money
But learn to get good show money, that's your money
Get comfortable with it, really know money
Rich nigga shit, that really goes for me
Self made nigga, well played
I'm on the plane drinkin' champagne and lemonade
You tryna copy what's done, I'm tryna innovate
And club owners gettin' tired of tryna ventilate, big mistake
I'm too busy findin' places and trips to take
The more I smoke the more money my business make
Remember they used to be like who is this?
Now, I'm up in this bitch, they light up like independance day
When you around the real, you keep it real everyday
My niggas keep it real, so I hear what they say
Either you gettin' paid or you payin' to play
Either you on your grind or you stay out the way
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the roof top
Just made a million, got another million on my schedule
The pick up on my Ferrari, you jets or you jetless
You niggas ain't help us, on second thoughts you did
They hatin' was the fuel for this shit
So you wrote your own check off a ho ass
Sweatin' bullets at home, wonderin' if she comin' back
Whodi you a simp and she can smell it on ya
That's why you only see her when you buyin' stuff for her
We was sneakin' in then it was general admission
Now we own the arena decidin' who allowed in it
My windows ain't tinted, pimpin', I ain't trippin'
Had showered that shit, I'm just ballin' and chillin'
We plotted this out, one night in the city
Now we Los Angeles, medicine cabinet twistin'
Our habits are expensive, we gotta have it
TwitPicin' when we get it and they mad at us, fuck them niggas
A lotta shit done changed
New clothes, new car, new thangs
The same boys that used to be at the bottom came up
That’s what they say
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Used to not be allowed in the building
But now we on the rooftop
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes

Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
Lotta money, lotta luggage, lotta hoes
When you puttin' in work, that's how it goes
And if the kids tryna be like me
They probably smokin' by the O
Oh, that ain't my fault thoughWhere is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement
Top of the game, that's where my place is
Started off small, runnin' from cases
Can't take it back, I can't erase it
Money got long, I'm tryna chase it
Puffin' the J, I wanna get paid
It's one and the same, but that's every day
I'm livin' my life as real as I say
I spent it all once, so I'm tryna save
I'm rollin' that dank, she pourin' that drank
I'm out of my brain, weed got me all faded
Lovin' my life, I'm never gon' trade it
I want success, don't wanna be famous
Know how to stay on your grind, it's contagious
Rollies with diamonds for time that it's takin'
People these days, they easily change
But I stay the same 'cause life's what you make it
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic
Girl, I'm a star, look in amazement
Where is my mind? It's far away
Up in the sky, I'm high today
Break it on down, then we rollin' it up
I can see my house from up here
Who needs a jet when you're fly like me? Tell 'em
You don't need a jet to get high like me
From the sun up to the sundown
No, we never come down
Bobby Boy loud when he come around
Drivin' down Malibu
Stay driven like the valet do, I be cruisin'
Steady winnin', but I'm playin' like I'm losin'
I know that this shit can be confusin'
Talkin' rap, talkin' life, talkin' choosin'
Money over happiness, abusin'
Losin' your mind, losin' your heart
Second that I wake up, I feel like this world just wants to tear me apart
But I don't
Let it get me down, let it fuck me up
What my therapist say
They don't matter, no way
I started off slow, but I finally made it
No matter the cost, chances I'm takin'
Ride with my dawgs, no, we ain't fakin'
Travel the world, countin' up faces
Jump in my car, roll up and face it
No, I don't call, I'm on her faces
All of 'em model, none of 'em basic

Uh, then go crowd around it
And tell everyone that live in your whole town about it
Gon' and roll up that good weed, I put about a pound in
And get high as the mountains
I remember the days when niggas used to have some love for a g
But now they doubt it
Would've been down with me and my team, but now they outted
Put my all in my everything and what I got is
So much money I can't even motherfuckin' count it
Uh, and you can have all of this
After all the hard work you can have all of this
Money and the cars, clothes, you can have all of this
Roll up in the best clubs, you can have all the women
Homie when the checks come, you can have all of this
When you put your family on, you can have all of this
When you let the stress go, you can have all of this
You lookin' at the best, so that's why I got all of this
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh 
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh

Look how we changed the game
Look how far up we came, shit
Look how my chain done changed
Man look at they faces
Now when they look in our faces
Look when they look in our faces
They look at us and we're famous
And I don't know where my plane is
I haven't been home in ages
Got people blowin' my phone up
So many important waivers
My marijuana's the loudest
That mean my weed is the greatest
I give a fuck about a hater
We just go, we don't know no limit, limit ooh

Uh, how far you gotta go 'til you feel like you're already home?
And how much you gotta spend
Til you realize that you really never goin' broke
How many motherfuckers gotta tell you that you changed
Cause you got a little change
And how the fuck they gon' tell you you the best
When they told somebody else the same thing
 Cause you fly first class every day?
 Cause you roll up all that grass every day?
 Cause you spend up all that cash every day?
 Drivin' them foreign cars fast every day?
 And if you ain't, this the kind of shit you need to get on
I’m talking audemar piguet’s, leather seats to sit on
This ain't just how I feel today, this the shit I been on, I been on
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already on
And on and on, and on and on
Never smoked weed that was quite this strong
Never took a flight this long
Never drank champaign in Italy
Never spent a night in Rome
But it's funny cause those are the exact same things
That helped me write this song
Caught up livin' a life where tryin' to do all the right things feels wrong
So I keep rollin' and lightin' up and prayin' to God that we live long
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
It's summertime, lights fade away
It's wintertime, let's make it summer
Don't look down, keep your head up
Don't look down, keep your head up
People always talkin' about what they think they know
About what they think I'm doin', how I feel, and where I go
But no matter how much money I make, I'm gon' stay the same
Since I've been up at the top ain't too much changed
Cause we already on
We already on
We already onI hear it all the time

I get a nug up out the pound and put it straight in the bong
Imma stay real, Imma stay high
Imma stay ready, Imma stay in her, a mistake
Count til my thumbs hurt, smoke til my lungs hurt
What another man say, I know my own worth

Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't even remember goin to sleep
But I do know that these Louis's go with my feet
And the critics they feel how my lyrics do go over beats
Twenty-K shoppin' when dude go overseas
Smokin' weed in the most expensive suite
Even though we ain't supposed to be livin' anywhere close to these people
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people
Don't wish death on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em
And keep positive energy and hella smoke for 'em
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas

The team just consists of what has motivated me
To get to this point

Not me personally, but I feel like my spirit is worldwide
And we all share the same spiritOh
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?

You gotta grind if you really want it
Don’t hesitate
You came this far now finish out the whole dream
Nobody said it would be easy though, just stick to your plan
They don’t understand
Going up against the odds
Having no regards
Make our own laws, you could be your own boss
But they don’t tell you that
All you need is a foundation to stand on
And you can build it then the limit is the sky
Until then I’m with my niggas gettin' high
And plus we with it you all know the business
Scared money don’t make money, so what you scared for?
And real people do real things, so what you here for?

Put some reverb on there and turn me up, uh
Niggas got it fucked up
Probably thinking its a game
I might smile a lot
But I ain't playing with 'em
I'm up at eight, I work all night
I'm rolling weed, I'm on the flight
Soon as I land I'm gonna write
I'm on the grind
40 hours, 2 shows, 3 planes, 6 zeros
Flying all around the world
Like I'm a fucking hero
Pouring it straight out a bottle
That's how we drink Cliquot
And we all from the same hood
That's why we feel the same thing
Like say if one of our pockets hurting
We all gon' feel the same pain
Always smoking out the car service
Police escorting, not at all nervous
We the bomb, search us
Penthouse, whole room filled with cash in it
Old school backseat, with the stash in it
Big joint, OG mixed with hash in it
And it's TGOD, you niggas last minute
Your flow last year, the swag last fall
You just the last place, you ain't gon' last at all
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You know its Taylor Gang or die
Haha, word
Ah, fresh out the spot where they selling
You gotta pay 'em to cook
Ain't no rules out this motherfucker
Who sold you that book
Bitch we down when its cracking
Around my way and you know that
Can get more than I ever asked
So be afraid of the go back
Hear them talking, I'm cool and moving
No cameras, respect the shooters
I'm out on this money train
You don't know about hustle, do you?
It's everything in or nothing
Bitch you know how I get down
You wasn't mad at me before
So why is you mad at me now?
The alcohol got you talking
You do the same thing, and the cops
Know conversation, know where we playing
Only for money calls only
That mean I can't deal with them old games
That you trynna kick, this ain't Shinobi
I told her baby you thirsty
She responded I'm cool
Said your wrist, its got water
I told her bitch this a pool
Feel me gang that, or concrete dive head first
But if you owe me money, I need my bread first
You niggas want kush, we got ounces

You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
What you smoking on man? Aha

The same shit, new bitch with me
Buy 20, run through 50
I'm running through the stop lights, late night
I told baby girl get your cake right
That kush doesn't taste right
You take it to the head
All you smell is KK and cookie smoke in the Benz
Where my roof go, I stack up quick, while they move slow
White girls in my room, I'm smoking while they do blow
Plush life, no crushed ice
I'm 20k in the game, my bookie loves life
But fuck it, I like to blow cash
I don't tuck it, its nothing
Two first class flights to the function
20 zans, 120 grand, in the city where the pretty girls dance
And them plants grow, in the warehouse
Skinny cash, if you pass me bullshit, I'mma laugh
I'm the man, no lie baby
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got pounds
You niggas want kush, we got ounces
You niggas want cookies, we got poundsUh, you would have thought that from seeing me going hard
That that'd motivate these motherfuckers to get on they job
But instead they hating on what I've been doing
Having conversations in my face about what I should do for 'em
What I'mma do keep rolling and dropping weed on 'em
Pack my bags look like I'm staying for weeks but be gone in the morning
If the flight is private, we probably should board it
You see it you like it, I can probably afford it
If niggas really felt some type of way about the shit I'm doing
You picked a crazy time to start letting me know
Cause jealousy and envy that's a trait for mostly bitches
Not a man so you ain't one if you letting it show
Now the money like the weed how we letting it grow
And I ain't holding on to shit I'm letting it go
Started small but now we all in them bigger game
All in a bigger plane, ballin' and getting paid
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
Yeah, my phone is dead, but I got a contact
My sharpie paint pen on my Timbo combats
You talk shit, I won't respond back
But they gon' get, and you don't want that
That nigga will forget the deal
Remember what? Get for real
My whip appeal, my crib is real
My wrist as well you know...the Richard Mille
Hip-hop grunge nigga, I make her come quicker
Then rock toe socks, yellow sponge nigga
I Tebow, for hoes that eat hoes
Emojis fo' me and my people
The hoes love me, I'm on they TiVo
I work they thighs, and they kegels
Skateboard, I love Chanel
Retweet me bitch, I'm @Pharrell
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
Yeah, I hustle no muscle, I'll never be muzzled
I'm a piece to a puzzle, I'm Robert Townsend
And my words gon' Hollywood Shuffle
My nigga I move moo, my motivation is moves foo'
I get up and does do, I evenly do ten things at once
Multitaskin' super fast and king of tattin' super pimpin'
House of rollin' run a business while I'm tourin' on you bitches
Doing features while watching a double feature nigga
I see you suffering from haterism, get that check
I take nothin' and make somethin'
There's no breaks when the hustle's runnin'
Ain't dealin' with fakes, ain't fuckin' with snakes
They all in my face now they got what it takes
My nigga I'm straight
So don't reach out cause I peaced out
When I reached out, there's no response
Like knockin' on an empty house
Yeah, so I keep on while you peep on
What I be on and you're behind - that's what karma's about
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
First the love was there
Then the paper came
Then the haters came
But we still rise above
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'
Man what the fuck is wrong with these niggas
They rollin' up, let alone doin' a song with these niggas
Claimin' they ballin', to me they playin'
These niggas ain't really doin' what they sayin'I'm cool with the new me
Some niggas told me they wish I'd
Go back to the old me
But don't even know me!
Cause I be on some rich nigga shit
Guess they comfortable with the broke me
I blow by the O.Z
But you knew that and all you niggas knew this jack
And now you muthafuckas owe me
Some people ask why I be low-key
Guess I'm too real for me to act like I'm your homie
A lot of niggas try to get involved when they see you make it on your own
Hear they songs, but they not as real
Cause when you got it all, something's gotta give
And we ain't talking if it's not about a dollar bill
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow, unwinds...
Amazed how I get so much paper?
I'm more amazed how you could be such a hater!
Getting my lemonade squeezed fresh
No refrigerator touching my shit
Private island, waiter chef-made
Brother riding jet skis all day
Come home to bed already made for us
Niggas who's winning like it's the kind of name for us
Fucking champions cause we run the game, Forrest
I got so many things running through my mind...
Just drink and smoke, while the flow, unwinds...
I mean why'd you do that?
How does that fall in line with your whole ideology of being a Taylor?
Taylors do what they want to do
That's the ideology about it
For me, personally, I prided myself on doing
Things that were different
And kinda like unacceptable and weird
So when I start seeing things become the norm
I kinda stray away from thatY’ll already know what it is
We the last…
At night that’s when all the lights shine
Ask the stewardess what’s the flight time
Know we grown we all got shit to say
But we drunk so it’s the right time
Outer Space they got a high climb
Out of sight, I’m out of my mind
I did everything on my own, so
I could give a fuck how your advice sound
Who you know sick as Ca-P though
Flow tight as the clothes on the niggas who fight crime
It’s cool to dream I suppose, you never know how far it might go
You might need some love, it might get shown
You might stumble down the right road
Got problems with the structure? Time to renovate
Boy tighten up your circle, keep your business straight
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
We the niggas who could have it all
We the ones who only dream of it then do it on our own
Smoking one and got another roll
Came a long way from no direction now to formation
More legit, more to make, more to spend
Got a thing for champagne? Order it
Waking up in my trap house burning hella spliffs, grinding
Listening to Dolomite rhyming, I’m in
Exclusive bay, break you off something and I’ve got moves to make
Don’t be acting bougie ‘cause you came through with Nate
No Reuss, real nigga before Protools
Got game from niggas that's from the old school
But we them new niggas,  you should roll through
Woke up in the morning fucked up but that’s part of it
I got weed smoke and all this gin, Khalifa always wins
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'
Cause we're the last free souls in the world on our own
Just roamin', just roamin', just roamin', just roamin'Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah

I ain't talkin' English, I'm talkin' rubber bands
Jacksons, Franklins, either one of them
You ain't talkin' paper, dawg, so you don't understand
Spazzin' on these niggas, bitch I'm goin' H.A.M

Smokin' OG, by the LB now the Ocean's filled with ashes
And niggas keep on hatin', I just roll one get my cash and
Hear 'em talk bout what they gon' do, but I know that ain't gon' happen
When you think of a gang of real niggas spendin' money

Recently you wrote a letter to your fans
And it was about four or five paragraphs
And about two sentences said
“Rolling Papers, maybe I would’ve done it different.”
Honestly, that was just me being real with myself
And real with my fans
Rolling Papers was a learning experience
Just like how everything  was
And me getting with a label and trying new things
Like I say, I'm not a stubborn person
So, I work with different people
I write different records that people may say that they like
You gotta try different things, you gotta do different things
But when you talk about longevity
You can't base that off one year or six months
Or eight months or anything like that
So, really I was just speaking to anybody that was
Riding with me for the long run
And who's looking for the next thing for me
To doI had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? 
I had so much champagne up in the club

Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night

Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
Now I made my way in the game
So much money, don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
I’m too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane
Came here to spend it not leave with it
Got KK rolled up, let my team hit it
Some Bombay, let’s sip ‘til it’s mayday
That fuck shit don’t play
I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home

Yeah, keep the good times rollin’ and the champagne pourin’
On the plane and I don’t know where I’m goin’
Make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’
And the money keep fallin’ on the floor
Where you tryna go, only care about what’s in your drink
You tryna go hard, don’t think about tomorrow
Don’t care about what people think
You don’t care about waitin’ outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin’ “face down, ass up” up in the club
And now we all turning up 
I’m in the club rolling weed like I’m Marley
Smoking dearly departed
That’s kill, too real, come to me get it started
And The bottles be poppin’ like its 4th of July
We just pourin’ them shots, back shooting corks in the sky
Pouring some for the girls, and pouring more for my guys
Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas
Hear them niggas talking shit, but they ain’t my niggas
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night

If you lookin' for another nigga to put food on your motherfuckin' table nigga you dumb as fuck. You a stupid ass nigga, you should go fuckin' take a gun and put it to your brains and blow your own God damn brains out
You stupid as hell nigga, don't be beggin' no nigga for shit nigga, get your lazy ass up, get out here and work nigga. You know what I'm sayin'? That's how we get this bread, we hustle nigga. We gotta be out here man, up early in the motherfuckin' mornin' man to the next motherfuckin' morning, man. You know what I'm sayin'? How a nigga supposed to get this shit?
This shit don't, money don't grow on trees, shit don't fall out the sky, nigga. You know what I'm sayin'? I know you out there high and shit, you know what I'm sayin'? Niggas die for this shit man, niggas out here on some real grind, nigga. There's some fucked up motherfuckers out here man, you know what I'm sayin' man?
When a real life situation kick in, your motherfuckin' kids hungry, your bills due, your motherfuckin' car broke down, man. Nigga you gone be sicker than a motherfucker, man. We still gon' be gettin' money, we still gon' be gettin' high, we gon' be in the strip club, we gon' be bringin' in the bags left and motherfuckin' right. Bringin' them bitches in, throwin' that shit out like trash nigga. We gon' be gettin' high as fuck, laughin' at you ol' stupid ass niggas out here man, the fuck outta here man, kill yourself niggaGot no time for the conversations or funny shit
Nigga, only the reals who I get my money with
Used to turn on the TV, see what I want
And now the same one I dreamed about, the same one I'm stuntin' in
In the 6-2, almost 26
And every nigga that I'm with got a zip
I look at this shit as one big table and best believe every nigga I'm with got a sit
They try to hold us back, paint a picture of us, then sell it straight to the public
You young, black, then you thuggin'
What they don't talk about the kid that came from nothin'
Who stuck to what he believed in and turned himself into something great
They should use that story to motivate
But instead they'd rather focus on the fact that he's a pothead
Not the fact there's not a lot where I lived
25 and not dead
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
You make a little money, take care and right yourself
And people start coming up with they hand out
People take their stresses and make them yours
Well that's just what comes with being a man
I try to do all that I can to make sure that
My son grow up without having to see half of the stuff I've been through
But in life we all got our own path
Don't understand that by now you won't begin to
Cop another Rollex or Porsche try and get even with me
Pulled up to the club, swear it looked like the dealer with me
Cause we had so many cars it was stupid
So I don't see a reason to try and reason with me
Made a couple million and fast too
They ain't teach a young nigga that in the classroom
Or how to make your people better by taking knowledge and spreadin' it
Instead bein' in the game, be ahead of it, in a better whip
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hills
Thousand dollar benefit plates
No matter how high the stakes, niggas never outta place
Now I'm high, Empire State
Drunk stumblin', never will I tumble far from grace
I'm one of them under-celebrated greats
Under the influence of what Uncle Snoop threw me
Soon as I stepped off the plane
Switchin' four lanes like Jay and Jermaine
Killin' beats, visitin' grave sites and pissin' champagne
I been in the crib enjoying my habits
Suckers figured this'll be the perfect time to try me
Try me
Assumptions that I'm lunchin', gettin' sloppy
I'm just gettin' better, seasoned veteran
Eagle eye perspective, scope before I go in
Come out with the whole hen
A dollar and a dream
Have a house on the hill and the world on a string
I'm tryna tell you somethin', this shit's real
When you work hard to get it that's how you feel
Them haters talk but they knowin' they ain’t in the way, no
We started small to them houses in the hills
We started small to them houses in the hills
We started small to them houses in the hills
To them houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
Houses in the hills
To them houses in them hillsNigga all I smoke is papers

My niggas hop out and get to smashin’
Sock a nigga first then ask him
Where you niggas from? What you niggas bang?
Snatched a nigga chain, he ain’t with the Taylors
This nigga jewerly fake, he ain’t getting paper
He's a fuck nigga, not a real player
I took his bitch and made her learn how to roll papers
Off Youtube, you should do it too

Big bag of that, coming back for that
Roll ‘em back to back, keep a sack of that
Don’t imagine that, that’s a matter of fact
Eyes down in the clouds where you find ‘em at
In my MCM bag where the magic at?
Come back to my room, jump on the broom
Swear the magic happened, she hit the magic dragon
Her ass started clapping, I was glancing
Smoking kill, that’s that extra pack
Tell the DJ to bring it back and tell the weedman to bring a sack
I got a bong and I got a biatch, ass fat, body full of tats
Pick her up, fuck her on the jet, nothing less
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers
I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor, I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor
All I smoke is papers, all I smoke is papers
I’m a motherfuckin’ Taylor, throwin' up the gang like a bangerWake up to the cleanin' lady knockin' and shit
I close the door so I can bake up
Cause yesterday we, partied the night away, stumbled in close to four
Room full of expensive bags, still all the shit on the floor
But that's just how you live when your wife's a model
Smoke a pound soon as we touch down, do the same thing twice tomorrow
Not to mention what I spend in the club, nigga don't need a price the bottle
I promise my weed exotic, all my tree is fire, when you see me I'm just
Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating, floating
Down the street, pound a beat, I smoke a pound a week
Heard about it, don't believe, come to my house and see
I'll be high, I'll be somewhere where them ounces be
California kush, New York smokin' sour D
Detroit bubba kush, ATL it's OG
Ask my nigga Berner, err'body know me
Out in Amsterdam, Wizzle smokin' overseas

Floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
I'm just floating on that chronic, floating on that chronic
Floating, floating
You said a lot
I'ma translate just for the people:
That phone's been ringing
Hahahahahahahaha
They wanna know who can get up with Taylor Gang
I imagine these labels are really throwing
Some things at you for your business mind
As well as your artistry
I don't know how to say it
We don't have shit
When we start out we don't have shit
So we really make due with what we have
And in turn that turns into million dollar corporations
But what labels don't have is that mind frame
That spark that makes that million dollars
They know how to manifest that
And make more millions off of that
But they don't have that sparkWay before your time the world knew this would happen
Was destiny to many, was just hard work for you
As you were brought into this world
You tried to find out about your surroundings
The people, the feeling of being alive and breathing the air
The smiles you see at that point are the ones you should always remember
Authentic is due to the choices you make for yourself
It'll be a bunch of fake smiles so easy to forget
But some although not healthy for them will create an understanding of what the word real means
Us and never I is one of your greatest attributes
Others before thyself as long as long as thyself is taken care of is well being
And money, well, I know you know how to get money
I'm gonna say this one time only, live young man, you deserve it
Let's celebrate, Blacc Hollywood
And we be in the club, buying all our champagne
Spillin' it on the couches
Me and my niggas deserve this shit
We was there for the come up
I am Blacc Hollywood, I live Blacc Hollywood
Yea, yea, yea

That's no love

Hope you got thousands in your pocket cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Pull up to the club with my thugs smokin' so strong
Hop out and walk through the back, so high I don't know where I'm at
Them bitches get open, I'm with some niggas who all 'bout that action
Poppin' them bottles, you look outside, see them foreigns
She get them dollars out them niggas cause she ain't lookin' for love
Smoke that loud up by the pound, she get champagne and drink it up
Hope you ain't a Captain Savior cause she ain't lookin' for cuffs
In the club spinnin' face, she in your face, you think it's love
Said you throwin' dubs, bro that ain't enough
Money, clothes, and drugs, that's what bitches love

You ain't give her what she needed, and she ain't lookin' for love
Homie she don't want no flowers, only make her cum
Poppin' ass, kinda naughty, met her ass at the party
Took her to the after party, drink some gin off her body
Spend some ends, now I'm going in
Took her and her friend, hit the skins
Then we smoked again, eyes like I'm Korean
Shots of gin, that's what all this juice is for
In Blacc Hollywood, that's my newest car

Pockets filled with hundreds, fifties
Nothin' lower, come fuck with a stoner and get stoned
Yea, yea, yea

Hope you pop a lot of bottles cause she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you drive the newest car because she ain't lookin' for love
Hope you brought a lot of drugs because she ain't lookin' for love

Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams

Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black card, sack of dank
High School nigga what the fuck you think?
I’m passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I’m high as a muthafucker
Sun roof open, smoking while I’m rolling

Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Joint roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
Cause I put that game all in her head
She saw the crib, she know that I’m balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him

And now when we shop we don’t care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit

Closing the cabin door and reving up all my engines
The weed is rolled, the drink is cold
It's new to you, to me it's old
C-E-O

I just let it boost my confidence
Roll another joint, drop pilot shit, okay
This ain't the life that we chose
But it's the life that we living

Cause we'll get there in a minute
Ask me if I plan to be roof top chilling
With some pretty-ass women, you'd be glad to meet
Trees stuffed in the passenger seat
Charge it to my phone, couple changes of clothes
And the OG told me
All haters expose they self, so it's best to leave it alone
Pop the cork, put the tree in the bong
Been here for a minute you niggas just catching on
Master of the craft, I've grown
Haters trail the path, I've flown

They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA
Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed
You really sure you want to grow up to be just like me?
They say I'm livin' it
I'm all about, you all about it, they all about it, we all about it
Them, them haters, them ha-haters they sick of this

Uh, talkin' raw papers and long leathers
Nigga, my drawer filled with couture textures
Killin' these niggas, bring more stretchers
Amazed by how I'm in that new Mason Martin Margiela
With my team, we're at the car dealer
Smokin' big green, I'm talkin' Godzilla
You're talkin' money, then you sound familiar
The suite wasn't big enough so me, I bought the villa
The whip was sick enough, I went and got the ill one
Your tree wasn't enough, good thing I brought some killa
Bitch I'm a king, and all my team is loyal niggas
My wife's a queen with diamond rings and full chinchillas
And I was raised with niggas with get-money intentions
Lot of young niggas gettin' made, but I'm the realest
Give a fuck about if a nigga hatin'
My dollar accumulation; my only motivation
I'm pretty sure he likes my music
He might. he's aware of it, we know that
If you like rap music, if you like hard stuff
You can't deny itLook nigga I can roll up some more weed
Or order 22 more bottles of Don P
My presidential Rolex shining, that's on Gs
The clothes that I got on are designers from overseas
I pulled up getting high, told the valet to hold my keys
Hopped out, walk in that motherfucker, bought everything that I seen
Niggas hating, bitches wishing they can get in position for some infiltration
Taylor Gang motherfucker, don't deal with no shape shift
Only real motherfuckers come up in my playlist
I keep it way too real to fuck with your fake shit
This the real right here, roll one up and face it

Got them throwing more shade than a clouded out meadow
Living in a land called Lala, no Melo
Maserati sitting on lips all yellow
Smoked out interior like a cigarillo
Now these hoes wanna hang, leave them hanging like hello
 until my lifeless corpse in the depth of the Earth
Forever stay a real bitch and only fear God

And my struggles help build me, so endear eyes
Lauryn we'll forever love you, you'll forever fill hearts...

I woke up and wasn't no one there
Wasn't no one there, yeah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes I feel like I'm the only one here
I guess nobody cares
But everything's good 'til it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...
I'm tired of being tired
And dealin' with your BS
All the while supplyin'
The money for your request
Without me you're a dime
But with me you're a buck fifty
I can get another one quickly
But I'd rather wait it out
Take the broken pieces try and fix it
Or you could let your pride over weigh the right decision
And I'll be in the sky you can pay your boy a visit
Ha
I had a dream that the whole world was starin' at me
I woke up and wasn't no one there
Wasn't no one there, yeah
Same song to a different beat
Cause really sometimes I feel like I'm the only one here
I guess nobody cares
But everything's good 'til it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo

Remember what you said
But what you say to me ain't guaranteed to always be the Gospel
I was doing good way before I met you
Now you're off the set
And I'mma let you see the show go on without you
Take a bow, think about it
And hopefully we could be friends but I really doubt it
See you be catching feeling's now and I be catching planes
The story of my life, you're just another page
But everything's good until it goes bad
And your gonna tell all the people about the fun you used to have
It hurts when it don't last
No easy way saying bye
So I'mma spread my wings and head for the sky
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I fly solo
And I...
I had a dream that the whole World was starin' at me

At times I feel like I'm all by myself and I know you do too
I made some phone calls and checked emails cause I'm always grinding
Ain't no rush, I do things slow cause it's all about timing
Some people think when you get to this point in life you've made it
I've seen so many settle for less, that's when talent get wasted

Talkin’ champagne they brought it through
Hundred million they rep my gang
Goin’ fast when I’m in my lane 
Diamond, Taylor, that be my gang 
Smoked it up, you don’t smoke enough 
Boy you sweet, you so coconut
Weed is loud, get close enough
Shit get sticky on purple stuff, on moms
Damn, I just spent a hundred grand 
Them broke niggas don’t understand 
You ain’t gettin’ money, what’s your plan? 
I’m feelin’ like the fuckin’ man 
Damn, I just spent a hundred grand 
Them broke niggas don’t understand 
You ain’t gettin’ money, what’s your plan? 
I’m feelin’ like the fuckin’ man 
JR, look
Met a lil' chick on Melrose
Hopped out in them shell-toes
Need more room for my elbows
I dropped the bomb and then hell rose
These hoes be actin’ up
These niggas be lettin’ ‘em
Shawty rollin’ them veggies up
That’s more RAW's at the courtyard 
Take her to the Marriott
Watch a nigga paint, Basquiat
Bought my own crib, so I’m growin’ pot
Got my own water, so I bought a yacht
Y’all niggas complacent 
From Wauk-Town to that basement
To the top floor that’s so spacious
At the Westin, just restin’ 
Me, J.R., and Wiz go back like rentals 
Gettin’ money watchin’ for the wenchels 
Chains got to write like pencils 
Got magazines for them issues 
We on one, you damn right 
Pants small but them bands right 
She ain’t gay but she playin’ dyke
I’m no plumb’ but I’m layin’ pipe
Like what 
Nigga bout to take this shot 
Nigga really gettin’ this bread 
Niggas say they ballin’ but they not 
Smokin weed, livin’ in the air 
I grind so I’m getting what I got, ooh 
I go hard and these fuck niggas, man they ain’t got a clue, ooh 
Damn, I just spent a hundred grand 
Them broke niggas don’t understand 
You ain’t gettin’ money, what’s your plan?

Damn, I just spent a hundred grand 
Them broke niggas don’t understand 
You ain’t gettin’ money, what’s your plan? 
I’m feelin’ like the fuckin’ man 
So much chiefin’ and sippin’ that mud
Niggas think I am the plug
Crank in the club while you makin’ it rain, Juicy J he be makin’ it flood 
Fuck it man I threw it all 
She assed out never no drawers 
That shit be good I would pass her the sack, bitch I’m like Santa Claus 
Flippin' money and smokin’ weight
Make a mess I’m holdin’ cake 
Nigga I take yo bitch, nigga
That’s the reason why you love to hate
I buy Louis just to meditate 
Kush bales just to medicate 
I’m just tryna levitate
Hit the mall and blow a whip
Hundred K, I double dip 
Turn around and double it
Nigga I supply the hood
Got plastics filled with Benjamins
Juicy J I’m gettin’ that purp, work
Pockets never hurt
If I fall off , the trap where I revert 
Damn I just spent a hundred grandIt's about time right?
Where's the 'dro?
Drama Wiz
Count 'em up bitch
28 Grams
You know I stay high
I pull up in my ride
Shades so dark that you can't see my eyes
Smoking on loud, blowing on clouds
Just did a show but don't know the amount
Taking your bitch if you're leaving her out
You niggas so broke, you so homie the Clown
There she go over there
Other hoes don't compare
Throw them 1's in the air
Throw them 1's in the air
Kk with hash, a nigga with cash
I'm taking the money, smack it on her ass
She give me good brain, she ahead of her class
I came in her first but I'm leavin' her last
Baddest bitch in the club, gon' work somethin'
Bend it over for me baby, gon' twerk somethin'
Aww shit, don't hurt nothin'
Let me spend some ends on it if it's worth somethin'
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it
I roll one, I roll two
One for me, one for you
When we high, ain't no tellin' what we do
No where to go, so much to blow
Keepin' it private so nobody know
Doing your thing when you slide down the pole
Give you a drink, you get out of control
On your line cause you're nothin' like the rest of 'em
Oh, you know you're fucking with the best of 'em
Shots of that gin, her and a friend
We leave the club then I'm goin' in
Soon as I'm done, we do it again
Baddest bitch in the club, gon' work somethin'
Bend it over for me baby, gon' twerk somethin'
Aww shit, don't hurt nothin'
Let me spend some ends on it if it's worth somethin'
You gon' pick up all this money when I throw it

Welcome back
All hail Trap Wiz
Boy Drama
Pittsburgh, what's up?
Something's life and life is living!
Fucking awesome, yeah!
Hehehe, 28 grams
For ya'll that don't know what 28 grams is
It's an ounce of weed, preferablyI'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know
To shape you and hold you I admit that was my mission
But everything went wrong there cause you started acting different
The day you ran up on me I was smoking chilling
Swear you was trying to roll ain't know what was soo apealing
Fast forward I'm on the road your at home calling me back forth
Can't deal with this relationship but it's what you asked for
As for them picture of them bitches
Shit I probably wouldn't be with them if your ass wasn't tripping
Not to mention you actin like a kid is the fucked shit I gotta deal with
Send a text, leave me a message, try not to listen
Bring a ref you was the main player I had to bench you
When I showed your ass how to ball, that Louis I bought it all
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know
Gone on the road and I'm hardly home on the weekend
You be blowing my phone up trying to see who I'm seeing
But I'm chasing this paper so for this paper I'm reaching
Might fuck one or two bitches but dont consider it cheating
I consider the fact that we'll break up anyway 
Based on all the shit that you dont appreciate
Me switching states, working hard meeting dates
And you were thinking everything was sweet, piece of cake
Well that all changed
What we had was big, but you going to miss the small things
And that little cash I spent, that was small change
But above all things
I still love you
Just gotta do my own thing
I'm tired of arguin' and fightin' girl
Every night you keep callin' me with the same shit, I'm goin' insane
I swear I love you but this ain't right for us
I never thought it would end this way, it's gon' kill me to say
But you gotta
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Pack your stuff, leave my keys
Get your shit, gotta go
Told you that I'm movin' on
You didn't, well you outta know
Now I go
I'll never come back
And when you call
I'll never call back
Cause I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girl
Everything was all good
Then went all bad
No, I don't think 'bout the things that we had
Cuz I got a new girl
Yeah, I got a new girlNigga, my motherfuckin' life depends on this shit
Do this shit for my son
Turn me up
So I can hear myself a little more in the headphones
Came from the bottom, started this out with nothin'
Turned to fam and my squad, and turn this thing into somethin'
I grab a cone and I stuff it, never gon' get enough
Dependin' on how its goin', we only gonna get tougher
I done seen people suffer, hate turned into love
Lost some people to get here
But they watchin' from up above
On the road, hardly ever home
And money caught one in the dome
Now its hard to even pick up my phone
Leave me alone, I be in my zone
I'm gettin' grown but not too grown to let my feelin's show
Anythin' you want, you can get, you gotta build it though
I blew up quick and lost some shit
But now I'm dealing though
There's consequences to every decision
Good or wrong, just do the best with time you're given and live strong
Give your all 'cause a man gon' be a man
And do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)
Yeah, all of the fame just comes with the game
It's a gift and a curse when everybody know your name
How do you make a million dollars and still stay the same
How do you make a hundred millions and still stay sane
You got the money, the clothes, the cars, the girls
Tryin' to do better, but all this shit's in your world
Somethin' regular is what you'd prefer
But it's cool, it's too much pressure, you think you should curve
On the verge of packin' up and goin' back to where I came from
Tired of these rappers, I only run into lame ones
Tired of these girls, we all fuckin' the same ones
I ain't givin' chances no more, I already gave one
Gettin' money, you better save some
Don't be afraid of mistakes 'cause you gotta make some
It takes time, but a man gon'' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)
No turnin' back, I'm learnin' that
If you ever show someone love, you deserve it back
If you got an ounce and some papers, you should burn a pack
And if you ever do take a loss, you can earn it back
Never slack, never overreact, let your money stack
Look at where you're going and not where you at
You gon' get there if you work hard
When you make it, you'll get exactly what you work for
I want more, couple cars in my garage
A mansion with marble floors
And a butler to open my doors
Couple plaques on the wall
A Hoop court where my friends could ball
It may sounds strange but I'ma need it all
Winter Spring Summer Fall, I hit the road when I get the call
Got some family members that I don't see at all
It pays off 'cause a man gon'' be a man and do what he gotta do
Baby, this is rolling papers 2
I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it
(I'ma roll it, roll it, I'ma light it, light it
When it's time to make a change, I ain't gon' fight it, fight it)Daytrip took it to ten 
Left my heart and my soul, you see that I ran
Rings of gold and awards sit on my nightstand
I've got something they want, but it's mine to give 
Free my struggles, detach me from this island 
Bleed my knuckles, attack me for my finance
I'm dealing with this pain, I just can't let you come throw it away
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up 
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up 
Takin' off quick, too fast, on my tippy toes
Undefeated Boat, no L's, still 
Takin' off quick, too fast, on my tippy toes
Undefeated Boat, no L's, still six and oh
Run around town, profound mentality
Bad young ting, six rings sittin' under me
These dudes actin' like we ain't who they wanna be
Got me tickled, tryna act so selfishly
Pocket full of green stacked up like a pot of peas
Big boy dawg, walkin' 'round with a lot of fleas
Zoom quick, go too fast 
Every day, I gotta make it count
Every second, gotta make it last
Roll around, do the double dash
Big glow on my skin, takin' off in ten 
Nine , eight
Hold up, wait, got a date
Ladies love my speed, quick to run up trees 
Who you seen like me? Nobody 
Stayin' in my lane, best friend named Tails
Balance runnin' on rails, I can never fail
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up 
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up 
Speed me up, ayy, speed me up
Don't turn down the bass, someone tell the DJ leave me up
They was sleepin' on me, now they see me up, beam me up
Rings on me like LeBron, rings on me like 23
New 911, it gon' speed fast
He was talkin' down, I level up on his ****
Tell lil' baby I might hit her up, 'cause she bad
Money hit my phone and now I'm runnin' to the cash, yeah, yeah
Marathon, just like Nipsey the great 
Spin Dash to the safe, do the dash like Tay K
(I'm dealing with this pain, I just can't let you come throw it away
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy)
Don't crash, really go fast
Press on the gas, four hundred my dash
Never come last
Came a long way from the back of my dad's
Since I got racks, I'ma never look back
I'm goin' fast on my way to the bank
Level up, I'm movin' up on my rank
Pedal to metal, I'm winnin' the race, yeah
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up 
So I run , keep me up
Creep on me, they speak on me
They slow down when they bring me up like 
Speed me up

Gin getting poured up 
Everything slowed up 
Fuck niggas hate us 
Rich niggas know us

So I don't need no cup 
I'm drinkin' out the bottle 
Ridin' with the top down 
Smokin' on A.C 
Twenty five thousand 
'Bout to blow it out in A.C 
Niggas join us cause they can't beat us 
Ain't 'nan nigga play me 
Keep talking them pounds 
I'm blowin' that daily

My eyes all lazy 
Niggas see me getting that money 
So they look at me crazy 
My niggas out here stuntin' 
Doing drugs on Manny 
I'm buying brand new cars and shit 
I got high all day, I ain't coming down 
The tweak is heavy, it's going 'round 
Rolling up airplanes 
'Bout to catch an airplane 
Riding in my old-school 
Listening to old school 
Doing it how a G's supposed to do 
It's getting cold, I might close the roof 
Made it up to first class 
Staying in first class 
Remember when I ain't at first class 
Now I'm the only nigga in first class 
Started with a bus pass 
Then I copped a old-school 
Now I got so many cars 
I ain't got enough room 
Twenty mill and got more to go 
Roll some weed and then roll some mo'

Got something to say then fuck 'em
Ain't trying to lose out on all of this for nothing

No time to count the money that I got because all of it's getting spent
And all of my niggas grind so all of us getting rich
And most of these niggas fly but all of 'em ain't the shit
That's why you holding me down, been doing it ever since
Only one I wanna be 'round and counting up all these chips...wit'

Under they breath mumbling
Scared to tell them hoes what it is
You put yourself in that position

Smoking it all, the eighth onion
Get it twisted because you see me on your computer screen
Thinking because you got wireless you get as high as us
Bitches leaving they lame niggas to ride with us
Planes over everything in the fly we trust
Just by the smell it's obvious

That's the Louie 13, Louie in my glass
I'm just riding around on my side of town
Got my windows up and my speakers loud
And we smokin so I'm gonna need a pound
Bet the haters wish they could see me now
But the money in the way
Everyone of us get money bruh
But the money in the way
My nigga on the real, all you see is dollar bill
It's Rob Markman, you already know what it is
You know me and Cap go back
Taylor Allderdice it's just gettin' started
O.N.I.F.C. is next
The Gang album, Chevy Woods Gangland
Juicy J got like 4 mixtapes that he's just ready to drop on you
Keep movin' and movin'You already know who the fuck it is man, Taylor
Uh, smoke Kush so I got no stress
Stuntin' it ain't no contest
Diamonds all in my Rolex, cuz' I go hard like P90X
See you dudes copyin' our moves, now you follow in our steps
Lil' kids just in the mirror, all insecure just trying to flex
Speakin' of Flex, shout out to Flex
And everyone else that said dude is next
Tell these lame niggas cut the check
Try the rest, now try the best
Gangsters, trippy niggas all here
With me nigga, my weed, so strong
My Brain, so gone, Ooh
Outer space, solar, ooh
My Chain, polar, ooh
My bank, so long, ooh
Like I was playing poker ooh 
My face on the tele, so fuck what they tell me 
I always keep it real cuz' the people love the real me
They ran up on my bus cuz' police said they smell me
So me and L O L A, blow and smoke in LA
Flossin', Straight bossin', Take strains, we cross em'
My chains hang, they cost em', They hatin', we awesome
Throw back on drinkin' lately I've been thinkin'
I've been partyin' too much and livin' like the weekend
And then I think bout what my life could be
That's when I pour another drink and light this weed
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me
I wanna smoke with you so I can see...
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...
They claim that they get high but see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
They claim that they get high let's see, I doubt if they can go higher than me
I've never been this high before, levitate rise off the floor
Elevate, get high some more, drift with the wind to the sky I soar
Like a bird, like a bird
I feel like I'm floatin' through fantasy island in the brain, up in the plane lost
My vision, is simply not in good condition, did I mention
We go hard, and we don't even leave home at all
So what a nigga doin', we ball, ball, so carry on
The Mary and the Molly clearly got me very cloudy
So I sit back with my mind in the zone, mindin' my own
Need nobody, I can get high on my own
You're on the late flight,my flight is already gone
I'm in the sky you ain't even left home
I black out my mind and I feel free to be, whoever the hell I may wanna be...
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see 
I heard you claimin' you can get as high as me, I wanna smoke with you so I can see...
I heard you claimin' you get real high
You smoke this half a pound and your brain gona' fry
And it ain't no lie
Ghost sittin' low and my bitch real high
And it ain't no lie...

I'm representin' for them gangstas all across the world

And I still got love for the streets, it's the D.R.E.)

Since the last time you heard from me I lost some friends
Well, hell, me and Snoop, we dippin' again
Kept my ear to the streets
Signed Eminem, he's triple platinum, doin' 50 a week
Still, I stay close to the heat
And even when I was close to defeat, I rose to my feet
My life's like a soundtrack I wrote to the beat
Treat rap like Cali weed: I smoke 'til I sleep
Wake up in the A.M., compose a beat
I bring the fire 'til you're soakin' in your seat
It's not a fluke, it's been tried, I'm the truth
Since "Turn Out the Lights" from the World Class Wreckin Cru
I'm still at it, after-mathematics
In the home of drive-bys and ak-matics
Swap meets, sticky green, and bad traffic
I dip through, then I get skin, D.R.E

I got my own papers baby girl, I'm finna get my own weed too
Get you a pound and let you roll that shit
Uh, I'm rollin' up the windows while I'm smoking weed
Driving through my town like I don't know the speed
Countin' so much paper I can't fold it up
Bad bitch, she sucks me while I'm rollin' up
Yeah bitch, you probably see me everywhere
Money long, now my house got tv's everywhere
Literally everywhere you turn you see a flat-screen
New bitch...looked nothing like my last fling
Ridin in a Maserati nigga no shirt
Niggas probably hatin' on me but it won't work
Camo shorts on like a general
Mind on a mill blowin' on medicinal
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...
Been through every nigga town, neva had a problem
Young millionaire, never had a job though
Throw that money up and watch her hit the ground
As long as your money up she said it's goin' down
Brought her homegirl said that she don't do friends
Kicked the bitch out and make her find new friends
Should I get hella high or buy some new rims
745 or a new benz
I take every day and live like it's the weekend
Doin it all if you ain't ballin', take a seat then
If I said it, I meant it...throw a stack at that bitch-ass
And let her pay her rent with it
I'm just a young nigga hustlin', yeah...
Hustlin' yeah...Rolling up a seal, blowin' up but still
Going hard on my job like I ain't sitting on a mill
Now filet mignon come with every meal
I swear to God that I'm so high, feel like I'm going up a hill
Car marijuana coated
Paid 250,000 for it, still hop in that thing, ride like I stole it
I'm talking vacation island resorting
I made eleven million nigga without any endorsements
Took the niggas out I was out on the porch with
To Saint Tropes to race them in Audis and Porsches
Bentleys and rolls, plenty of smoke
Thousands for weed, Fendi's for clothes
I remember I couldn't get shit back then when I was broke
Now that I'm rich, everything's for the low
So I could give a fuck 'bout what they saying
Cause they wasn't with me way back when a nigga was just
Macking, Hanging

We living life shit, the bud is never ending
Kush God Bob Marley on my pendant
You know that lo is the life that I'm living
Ralph Lauren always keep a nigga spending, word
I can't lie, it's the truth, a stack for these joints
Five-hundred a boot, double R L I don't do Trues
That ain't for me
Getting money killing shows in the home of the maple leaf
These rap niggas live in a land of make-believe
Jimmity Cricket ass niggas and cool enough to fool with us
Nah, cool table geeks play the back, haters play the side door
Jet Life, Taylor Gang what you ride for
We keeping the ends, competition is slim
In case you looking for them niggas, have no fear, we are them

And young rappers might be like
Well, he's a veteran, signed to a young guy
Everybody seems to have an opinion on...
We all grew up on Three Six in Pittsburgh
And anybody who don't understand it or don't see it
It's just cause they aren't meant to
They aren't built, they don't have the mind capacity
To understand that this motherfucker
Influenced everything I do up until this point
As far as songwriting, as far as beat selection
As far as all of that shitClear the runway baby
I get money from Sunday to Sunday lady
Ohh behave I'm young, rich famous
Grinding, keep my pockets on Schwarzenegger
O.G in my Swisher so my blunt taste flavored, don't it?
Y'all niggas can get if you want it
Tryna catch a flight?
I'm in the back seat playing Xbox, car service just chillin'
Burners in the wall, money all through the ceiling
And Spitta on the phone, tell my dawg that we killin'
These fuckin blogs, they love a star and I'm flashin'
Life just like a movie
No casting. Ask if
The game been kinda slow but I'mma treat it like a Ashton
Pedal to the metal I'm mashin'
All we know is big money, medical weed, and fashion
So, try your best to imagine
Bro

You see me in every city on my way out to another one, another one, another one, another ooonne
You find me anywhere that paper go, go, oh, oh, ohhhhh
Bong rips
Double S's with the floor shift
Windows 20/20 clear
Peep the 20's on the rear
Order the car service
If I feel as though I don't want steer
Bitches freeze in the Xenon headlights like a deer
But not out of fear, she looking cause its money over here
Shine from above these land lovers I'm a chandelier
My girl gotta pocket bubbler in her purse
She keep it G and pack the bowl with weed and let me hit it first
Ain't tryna be a hogg, dawgy all I want is what I'm worth
80 days, 80 stages baby all around the earth
Amazing race for the paper you suckas eattin' dirt
Chew some orbit gum, brush your teeth and scrape your tongue
Fresh as they come, second to none
Pretty woman flirt
Batting eyelashes they need guidance
Lace em up like my New Balance
And keep flyin'
The closest that you lames ever came
To the planes was a Palm Pilot
I'm rollin up another one
Starring out this window, window, window, windowwww

Took her home and the sex was so bomb she killed him
She don't do thousands, she do millions
Take all that paper, stack it up to the ceiling
There's a lot of ballers in the the building, and she's trying to catch one
The last was the right nigga, the next was the best one
If she get a hold of you, problems, you'll get some
Better get outta Dodge, outer space, Jetsons
She looked me into my face and lied
She put me into her mouth, I died
She took me back to her place
And showed me what's left of the niggas who ever told me to never try
 x2
No we won't say no
Beautiful people say "go, go, go"
Beautiful people don't stress, stress, stress
We never rest
Beautiful people say "yes"
Ooh, you ain't even trying to catch a man
You just fall up in the club, doing what you do
New hair, new shoes, they've been told to stay away from you
But they break the rules
Sad to say but they deserve to lose
She's a black girl, baby, they don't lose
Should have payed attention to the clues
Now she stuck to you like glue
Now you like what, like who, write what, right there
Call you when you wanna roll up and make moves
Now the time's up, now it's clear
Gotta get the fuck up outta here
Real niggas gone do what they gotta do
Now baby-girl I ain't hating, I'm just using some hesitation
Some niggas got beef with you, I don't blame em
That's that bullshit, so I'm skating

Been in the jungle
Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey
We get it on our own
Real niggas in the struggle, you're not alone
We ain't have any major label backin'
Just me and my niggas and we made sure we was crackin'
The biggest squad get the biggest check
Ask around, we the last real niggas left
And there ain't nobody like us
Knew that we was on but the city didn't like us
Fuck your road, made our own path
Grew up low class, I ain't go to class
Front on the gang and it won't last
You get no pass, ain't no goin' back

Where's my bear to lick me clean?
Feed my soul milk and honey

It's like I wouldn't have any idea what it feel like to be you
When you work hard for everything you got
They can't come take it
When you go back on sayin' you'll keep your word
You can't unbreak it
When we was in that sprinter van they couldn't see us ballin'
Perfect record, now my team is flawless
Victory nigga, promise I go hard til you sick of me
For my squad, I give all of my energy
Make it hard not to remember me
Want it all, not just a little piece
We really started from nothin'
No handouts dog, we really got it from nothin'
You niggas got it from stuntin', got it from frontin'
Light up a J, I'mma roll up an onion

Twenty-thousand in his left, pistol in his right hand
Counting every dollar that he get, cause he worked for it
But don't run up on him cause you'll probably get murked for it
Mom's out working, Daddy wasn't home
Ain't nobody give it to him, so he got it on his own
Yeah, he got it on his own
You want something? Gotta take it
Tryna get up out the hood, but he’ll probably never make it

Slanging looking for them people hopping out them white vans
Standing on the corner rolling up their marijuana
Smoking weed and selling packs of D till you’re a gonner
Caught a case and lost some racks, the nigga got it back
In any case a nigga disrespect, he’s on his back
He bought a pack, then bought a strap
This niggas got his back
His life has changed it’s gone to smack
And ain’t no turning back

Wore a lot of jewelry, he slept with it on his nightstand
Made a lot of money and he got it all from hustling
Came from a good family but say he can’t get enough of it
All up in the club and he ain’t looking for a ring
Fucking other niggas bitches, yeah he swear that was his thing

Cause they found his body later
Guess that’s what he get for fucking with them...

There's a bad bitch in here
And you see her point her outBack when I was a kid I used to drive alone
Always feeling like I was stuck out here on my own
Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me
Time and time again I'm searching for reality
And feeling so alone
Alone again 
Alone...
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate
I'm tired of partying and getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last
Now it's 2015 and I got it all
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own
Out here all alone
Alone again 
Alone...
No use looking out
It’s within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You’ll be clear
Among the better menYeah
Kush and Orange Juice
Fuck it
Kid Frankie
I live life sucka free
That's why the niggas you be with talk down
Like they don't fuck wit' me

Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation

I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I smoke everyday that's that dedication 
Never sober always high that's that levitation
This shit get me where I'm going that's that transportation 
Niggas try to hold me back that's that desperation 
This shit go straight to my head that's that education
Niggas asking all those questions that's investigation
Wanna know my next move that's that anticipation 
Had to cut that bitch off that's that cancellation
I was smoking the day I got off probation 
I stay rolling up extendos bruh that's duplication
Got so much money in my pocket Imma cash station 
Got so much loud in my blunt that's a gas station 
Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration 
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation 
Only thing I hate bout drugs is the preparation 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication
Drinking, no chasing
Smoking that weed, but don't lace it
Roll up a joint and just face it 
I just be going through phases 
Hit your bitch all from the back while I'm pulling her braids 
Nigga we famous
When I walk into the club them niggas start throw the gang up
Gettin' this paper, get to my crib have relations
And never call her again 
I just be balling my friend
Made my own way through the game
Cause I'm smarter than them
And I go harder than them
Knew I was great when I ain't have a dollar to spend 
There go that pothead again
Ain't in the club with you less my whole squad getting in 
Tattoos all over my body don't fuck with security
Know all my real niggas got me
We in the lobby, smoking that weed like I’m Marley
TM this beat is a problem
Crazy to think you could stop us
And homie we ain’t got no patients cause we ain’t no doctors
Used to have weed in my locker
Now every bitch that you see on my team is a model
Drinking it straight out the bottle
Going so hard I don’t think I’ma wake up tomorrow
The GANG
Roll me up a 8th I need some inspiration
Pour me up a 8th I need some motivation 
Only thing I hate bout drugs is the preparation 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I ain't got no patience with my medication 
I’m bout to smoke me some gas, I’m bout to roll me a zip

All day err'day they say we wouldn't make it
It's just me and my niggas, just me and my niggasOh, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend 
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Losses a nigga took, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom and the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Never gets boring
And haters in your face, you just ignore em
Don't know what they talking shit for
See niggas get theirs, you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborne
Seen the bullshit comin' and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
And thoughts start getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
Feel your scars knowin what your pain is
But what's it all worth if it's painless?
Say you wanna be famous
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just starting, I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my light
But chances I don't get em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came fromFuck 
You know a nigga really don't wanna go to school today
Lemme call this bitch
Get my shit together
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
This one's for the g's all black Chucks on the cuffs of my jeans
King size papes stuffed full of trees, I be with the boss dogg ya'll fuck niggas fleas
Now they say I'm hot, hundred somethin' degrees
Taking pictures with a young nigga cheese
Remember days homey, I ain't had a thing
Now I'm hoping off the plane putting roaches on the wing
And my hoes like queens, but we smoke like kings
Jewelry froze like bling
Money come fast, yours slow like 
Rolling up grass, sold weed to half the staff, so I know I'm gonna pass
Third period, showing up last
With a late note blowin' great smoke 
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
We blow to the middle of the day
Wiz say dawg put a little in a J
Hey, why not? Not why?
We fly, we ride, she high, he high, we high
Fuck it, everybody to the libary
Got a new batch, some blue - booberry
Stuck in the hallway, with a pass say dawg he just smoke all day
It's a mind game like Kareem I seem to keep migraines
Reaching balance and bitch I brang you limeaid
I'm so lifted, like a parachuter
My grass stay off day off Ferris Bueller
Slip away, dip away, almost had to throw a whole zip away
But fuck that, this Taylor Gang, what you want dog
Shit I'm on everythang
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
You niggas never had and you never will
You niggas never had and you never will
I said you niggas never had and you never will
Big Snoop and Wiz smoke with the kill 
You niggers still in high-school, elementary ass niggas
Holla at me when you graduate
We be posted right by the 400 building
Room 420
Follow your nose, your nose knows 
When I pull up we look so fresh in my ride
We smoke the best you can buy
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Keep stunting just cause I can
These hoes know just who I am
Them niggas talking it but they just don't go harder than us
Niggas ain't hard like us
Niggas soft as doctors cotton swabs
You bitchin'?
Smoke somethin'You gotta smoke one to this
Yeah, you gotta light one
If you don't it's cool
But if you do...
You're way cooler
Uh, Versace on my dishes
Armani on my slippers
How do we smoke all this weed
Still handle all this business
A major key to success, is watch the competition
I move discrete as I can
Roll up without permission
Most of these niggas is hoes
Do anything for status
No real talent, just part of an Instagram challenge
Niggas is squares, a movie cast full of bad actors
Don't let the media fool you, these niggas movin backwards
I'm tryna stay as far away from lames as possible
They hardly mention my name, but
Know they watchin' though
Lost my brother this year
One thing it taught me though
Is that I'm built to win no matter the obstacle
Make sure my team is in order
Still got new crops to grow
3 million on settlements
But God got me though
I learned so many new things
And got a lot to show
Now we don't go anywhere without an ounce to blow
No summer tour this year, I'm doing festivals
I took a lil time off so that my neck could grow
Still writing checks and dressing the best head to toe
What you expect in the presence of a professional?
Nothing less, we smoke the best
A new strain? I might invest
I stay stoned, I stay stoned
Cause weed is legal 
Let's get higher, up to the ceiling, ooh
I stay stoned, I stay stoned
Cause weed is legal 
Bitch don't you blow my high, ohhI don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for
Uh, I get fly for the studio
I get fly for the airport
I get fly everywhere I go, oh, oh
30 bottles up in Greystone
In the club rollin' airplanes
You gettin' money, you already know, oh, oh
So much Cris, you would think we buy it wholesale
And my crib so big, look like a hotel
When we leave here, we smokin' out the hotel
When we leave ain't no tellin' who pay the whole bill
'Cause we all gettin' money, uh
I don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for 
I'm a broke nigga's nightmare, broke hoes sight stare
And a walking bank roll, as long as the dank rolled
It's gon' be hard to hear you niggas
Louis frames so I don't have to see you niggas
Me and the Taylor Gang floatin' on a private plane
Bad bitch, gimme brain, hide behind this tinted thing
Money bag, kush cologne, niggas wonder what I be on
All about the Benjies, nigga, Puffy Combs
I can make an actress do backflips on mattress
I can make a sack do a back flip on Saks Fifth
Get trippy with a star, it will get you far
Turnt up in the club, TMZ outside my car
I don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks for 
Catch me at the spot with more angels than Charlie
Take off, Cookies, kush, kilos, and mollies
Smelling like money, what a elegant fragrance
This watch I got on is a hell of a statement
Check the clock, you know the time
Girl, fuck your body, I want you mind
In need of getting this money, making and spending this money
Ain't part of your daily plan? Then you should probably die
I don't really gotta say much
I let my pack talk
I don't really gotta talk much
That's what these racks forFuck hoes everywhere we go
Taylor Gang, paper planes
Uh, they loving what I say
Tell her keep count
What you other niggas speak 'bout
Lamborghini dreams
Beach house wishes
Pour bottles of champagne
For my beach house bitches
It ain't new to me
That money, boy, I been 'bout
Throwing hundreds on the floor
I tell her keep count
Nigga
They in love with what I say
'Cause I
Really live the life you other niggas speak 'bout
Got my cameraman
He down to do a movie for me
Couple niggas 'round
That's down to do the shooting for me
I'm still riding with my main bitch
She rolling a joint
Something old school playing
She love me
We fucking
We in the fly-free zone
When some niggas will captain-save-it
I let her shop 'til she drop dead
Sleeping in her crib
Wake up to decent pot plant
Jordan shorts and a pair of Polo socks, blazing
With your bitch
You wanna lift, smoke this
I'm glad to be here, I been waiting
So long...
I finally found me a cloud to
Float on...
And I'mma float on...
And I don't have much
But I take all I got
And that's what I give
What I get in return
Is the money I earn
And the life I live
I'm so gone
As I burn after rolling
And float on...
Don't talk numbers
I hire people to speak for me
If you love her
Then hide your bitch so you keep shorty
Ever fly private?
So much diamonds in my chain
Hella sky mileage
I fell asleep on a plane
And never woke up
And now I'm living a dream
Suckas hate hard
Hoes treat me like I'm a king
They wanna live comfortably
Sipping on champagne
Real niggas fuck with me
So drama is not a thang
I gave my momma the old shit
Told her anything that come through the door
To open the whole clip
I'm with your bitch smoking
Let her keep the mid, I'mma roll this potent
Hotel so close to the water
You can even hear the ocean
Them bitches can't breathe
Beware them niggas with tattoo sleeves
Plus weed
I'm glad to be here, I been waiting
So long...
I finally found me a cloud to
Float on...
And I'mma float on...
And I don't have much
But I take all I got
And that's what I give
What I get in return
Is the money I earn
And the life I live
I'm so gone
As I burn after rolling
And float on...
Wanna smoke 'cause they know that I keep flavors
Tell me how them other niggas lame
And she love the cool crowd, so she fucking with the Taylors
Wear All-Stars and smoke papers
IPhone with no ringtones
Vibrate or on plane mode
Palm trees, and bomb pre-rolled
The weed burning, but the money just fold
While I'm looking at you niggas face
Light another L, and pull the liquor out the case
Niggas try and fail, see me, now they wanna hate
Fly another plane, a different city, 'nother state
My cash change the forecast
As a teen was half-baked before class
Now I smoke joints with others niggas' hoes
And this shit you burn after you roll
Fool
I'm glad to be here, I been waiting
So long...
I finally found me a cloud to
Float on...
And I'mma float on...
And I don't have much
But I take all I got
And that's what I give
What I get in return
Is the money I earn
And the life I live

Roll that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeahMy bad, I came in and fell straight asleep
Tired as a muhfucker
Uh!
It was 2009, and I was just gettin' home off tour
Doin' hella shows for my fans
And I could tell that everybody want more
Ain't ever wait for nobody, we kicked through that front door
And always did our own thing
Can't tell you niggas wanna front for
We bought cones and stuffed more, past girls, you cuffed yours
Spent nights on the airplane goin' too hard, like what for?
And all I did was make time but I ain't take enough for myself
Just doin' shit for everybody else, I ain't hardly even by myself
Family time is slowed down, cause they want me to burn out
Seen the end of this movie, they don't know how it turns out
Say they all gon' still love me if I don't make another hit song
If I don't take time to embrace it
What's the point of doin' this for?
I'm packin' up my bags, book a night, another hotel
It's a lot that could go down so I'm hopin' everything goes well
Came in to this game, givin' rules to you lames
Be the one that's holding you down, tryna count you out
It's a shame
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
It was 2014, and I was 'bout to go world tourin'
You was all up in my face sayin' that you want more
And I was gettin' tired of frontin' for the public
Sayin' I could do without it but you seem like you love it
I remember all of the subjects
That we would argue 'bout day and night
Do the best that I can, no matter what, I can't make it right
When you said you felt single, I remember like it was yesterday
How the fuck you hold me down
When you ain't take my last name?
I tried hard to move past things, came home, made shit change
Had to make a hard decision, let you go
It's time to do what's best for me
We went to Colorado, we was there for your friends' wedding
I was tryin' to hold it together but I felt like we were ending
I remember the beginning but this ain't nowhere close to that
Seen some shit you didn't like, said some shit that wasn't facts
Never thought 'bout gettin' back by puttin' your business out
In the end you made it seem like I ain't the one who held you down
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo', we ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' , we ain't fighting no mo' 
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' 
We ain't fighting no mo'
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
We ain't hurtin' no mo' , we ain't fighting no mo' 
Cause everything, cause everything is okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
Okay, okay, I'm a be okay
It was 2017, the day before my son birthday
The week before my mom birthday
That's the day you passed away
Can't feel too bad because I know I see you again one day
But right now I can't help but feel this pain
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okay
And that's fucked up
But as long as I got my family and my niggas
Everything'll be okaySee I've been going on and on forever
Them haters probably wonder when I'm gon' stop, never!
Most of this been good but I've seen some bad weather
And niggas who want shit now wouldn't even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was 16, finna get put out my home
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money grown
And I can do what I what, went from being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but wasn't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don't pick up the phone
I'm breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don't get a chance to see me face to face
So you have to talk about me when I gone
Stay away from the fake or phoney 
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The drinks poured up, weed's rolled up
And all my jewelery ice aged, the piece frozed up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the world but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy a drink then it's over cuz
We back around the time that she sober'd up
Shit ain't been the same since the limousine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never peeled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon' to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It's the way we know
Wake up in the morn' like "where did all my paper go"
Grow some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebrate it
Stay away from the fake or phoney 
Niggas who can't support their own
So keep hating me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star
Of the show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
Niggas losing their roles
Can't play their position
One day they're down for the team
Next day they're missing
Same ones was all in the front
Suppose to be there for support
And half the time it's the ones you care for
Fuck you here for? Huh?
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
You wanna be a, big shot, only number one
Everybody wanna be a superstar
Big shot, only number one
But everybody wanna be the star, though
Uhh, the money come, the money go
And when it come down to it
That's something niggas with real money should know
We partied a lot and drank, now they don't talk to me
I started off not so great, now I'm on top of things
Yeah, yeah, uh, yeah
I guess the difference is we ain't thinking the same
So if I'm guilty of change, I guess I'm the one to blame
I see the bigger picture on the wall in a frame
Spent a couple of days OT making it rain
That was cool but I was thinking ocean views
Polo trunks shades on and boat shoes
Cantox lick the oil, my nigga and I ain't slipping
You won't stall me out, uh, bad transmission
So if for the better, yeah, nigga different
That west coast weed, my homie Wiz twisting
Mattress money put up cause now my money different
Got a lot to say but ain't never try and listen
Record all night in the studio in the morn'
Playing back what we did, now tell me if that's wrong
Crack the Rozay, and pop a top or two
And toast to what this hard work got us toO-U-Y, yea, talking to you
Umhm
28 Grams
I ain't tryna hear about all them other niggas
I just woke, I just wanna come over and have

Everyday, a brand new creation
Everyday, got a brand new hater
Rewind, rewind
You can get the state of mind
And then never give in to it
Speak into existence
Put more weight on the best life, live relentless, !
Do the most, do the most
And if I'm close, I never think lose
Never think lose
Not this dude
And if it comes 'round to it, do it
Stand in my way, and I'm a show how we do it, do it
Thugs us no play, no conscience leave 'em all clueless
I do this, do this. Go against the goal. Need I say? That's foolish
Over dose out on the rope

See niggas taking shots but I'm so bulletproof
I just laugh at 'em, cop a Bentley coupe
I swear I be so high I gotta loose the roof
See niggas gotta lie, they know I'm the truth
See where I'm from nobody gives a fuck about you
I know rappers, I know trappers, I know real clappers
If you ain't getting money nigga then you hustle backwards
Choppers on the backseat if you want some action

Like the summer when I went out to New Orleans and came back bossing
And if a nigga play me we gone toss 'em

They waiting for me to fall but that ain't bout to happen
They playing tough but they ain't saying much about the captain
My niggas bout that action
You rid that vegan your bitch heard about the thing I'm packing
I don't care about no fashion, I'm a writer not a rapper
No day moving past us, niggas moving backwards
I ain't worried bout the pussy I'm just wondering where the cash is

If a nigga tripping get a thing and then we blast it
I just rolled some weed and fucked your bitch, thats why I'm laughing

It ain't in my lungs if it ain’t that pressure
First thing in the morning grab my joint from out the dresser

One phone call, brr, it's going down
Clique full of psychos, goon in some tight clothes
Need my paper straight, no typos
Right flows, but really I don't write
I'm in the studio all night
Make sure the shit you call a dream is what I really call my life
From my city, Harlem Nights, you niggas silly - this the 'burg
Not Philly, shout them niggas though that wheelie on them bikes
These niggas fans, they just sittin'
Talk about plans they ain't been in
Even rock brands they don't fit in
Ain't got to go to France, spend 100 bands
Gotta understand, damn!
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
Walk it how I talk it, if I roll it, I'mma spark it
If she bad, I tell her park it, I'mma hit it like a target
Oh shit! He blowing up your phone again
Must ain't let him know, you ain't coming home again
Leave that man alone, could be doing better
Do it on your own, could be on a jet, flying 'round the globe
Baby we gonna smoke a whole zone
Burning kush till her eyes gone
Cellphone by the remote control
When your girlfriends call, they just get the dial tone
Paper wild long
Try to draw the line between personal and business
But these niggas in their feelings like bitches
Mobbing through these trenches, always on a mission
Rules to the game, starve the competition
Khalifa Kush keep me high, to where I don’t wanna speak
Broke and jail - two things I don't wanna be
You talk tough, but your clique is nervous
Wash 'em up, get that quick detergent
Then we done with 'em
There's gotta be somebody to blame
It's a shame, shame, shame
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
What? What?
I can't stand fake niggas
I can't stand fake niggas
Fake ass, niggas, shit

They like ooh, they watchin' how I move 
Motherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool 
Fuck you thought this was? Nigga, I ain't no fool 
Gas in my joint, what you smokin' don't flatter me
My niggas got my back, ain't no need for a battery
Blowin' all these ones, look like we hit the lottery
My OG just hit me up, he told me that he proud of me
Always goin' hard, a lot of people that count on me
Always in the studio and that's increasin' my salary
I remember I was young when they hated and doubted me
Now a nigga bossed up with my name on the property
And no, we don't care what it cost
I start it, you hear the exhaust
Smokin' kushy with my dawgs
The way she made it clap, she got it lookin' like applause
I'm gettin' all these plaques, ain't got enough space on my wall
Diamonds drippin' like a faucet
Big bag, I want a big bag
If it ain't gettin' money, you can skip that 
Big bag, I want a big bag
Put you in a two-seater, let you kick back
I'm still Wiz 
Niggas got me in that mood 
How they hatin' when they know that I'm that dude? 
I hear they hatin' 'cause they know I got the juice , uh-huh 
They like ooh, they watchin' how I move 
Motherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool 
Fuck you thought this was? Nigga, I ain't no fool 
Still keep it real, still park the whip and chill
Still never poppin' pills, still got 'em in they feels
Still give 'em chills, peel hundred dollar bills
Had a crib in the hills, one trip, couple mil'
How a nigga fall asleep and still makin' sales?
One hand on the wheel, couple bands on the meal
Playin' on the field, weigh it on a scale
In the air for twenty hours, I was unavailable
Seen how much I'm worth, started thinkin' I was dateable
All my niggas gettin' rich, dues, I done paid a few
Smokin' weed by the zip, millions, I done made a few
State to state, I'm stackin' up and stayin' out the way
Big bag, I want a big bag
If it ain't gettin' money, you can skip that 
Big bag, I want a big bag
Put you in a Rolls-Royce, let you kick back
I'm still Wiz 
Niggas got me in that mood 
How they hatin' when they know that I'm that dude?

Motherfuckers, they be actin' like we cool 
Fuck you thought this was? Nigga, I ain't no fool 
I'm still WizLife
Looking out the window
Kush and orange Juice nigga
You might want to burn one to this
You couldn't walk a mile in these 11 and a halves even if you had a chance
Visions of this cash followed with the thought of the bitch thats chilling at my pad
It’s all part of the plan
To come through get high as I can, party, hit the studio jet lagged
Packing my over night carry on, we don't check bags
Old folks are proud to see I'm young and I Louied up to my eyes
True story word to the wise don't let these labels gas you up to be somethin'
Get yo paper never trust em
Watch the niggas you run with
I done seen niggas who had all they dreams fucked over, over some dumb shit
& make no assumptions hotel owners saying the odors to pungent blame it on the reefer consumption
The difference between you guys is you lie and we live it
In the sky so pay us a visit
Bet yo bitch be trying to kick it
What you ain't you trying to eat nigga
Come on, fuck is you waiting for
Nigga time just sitting around man. Come on
Everything was all good, now shit real
Soon as I enter the room its red carpets and bitches with pretty smelling perfume
Smoking cigars shit was fool
Now you roll hella doobs and anticipate that How Fly 2
Sucker shit we just can't excuse
Steady trying to duplicate but they ain't us
Got bitches dissing they lame ass niggas pot head kids rolling they dank up
Paparazzi taking pictures we famous
Hold my city down like a anchor
Now its champagne we drink
Non-smoking room we just ashen em in the sink
I love her attitude she love tracing my ink

You gon' regret this if you don't smoke
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe
I'm fresh off the dank, got more to bake
Never running out, same goes for the bank
Gas in the tank, top rank
About the cake, we don't use brakes
Too blazed, pilots say we can't get on the plane
No debate, pounds are putting on, I'm making weight
Money safe, put it in there for a rainy day
Niggas hate, don't fuck with them anyway
I hustle too many ways to get comfortable
You know how I'm coming
Call your girl, let's get into something
Money discussions, take my time, I ain't rushing
Want someone you could trust in
Me, I'ma fuck, and get up in the dusk
Got work tomorrow that's two of us
I feel like I can't lose
KK joints 'till I can't move
She happy I came through
Giving rolling lessons to a crew
Smoke like I do
No lie, we the truth
So high, leave the room, gang
Don't fear
Just love me until the moonlight
Shine on your body
So bright, yeah
Your beauty's blinding
But baby, turn around
My sight's alright
In the night, I'm in my zone
You gon' regret this if you don't smoke
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe
Big money ended up count me out
Burying safes with undisclosed amounts
They all over the place
Plus I fuck with the banks
I got a couple accounts
She got a million dollar mouth
She was born with it
She went to Dr. Miami for the rest of the shit
Stacked out, renegade on the Vegas strip
But she pay me for the game that I gave the bitch
A level headed gentleman with a crazy wrist
Boss player, thirty points plus twenty assists
I'm not selfish 'cause I throw all my niggas in the mix
Don't cuff none
Introduce my homie to the bitch if she want some
Chick will come through, get done, spend money, bang bitches but I don't love one
Hustle 'till the cars come Ferrari, drive out run
Pull up, hop out
Car stunts I've done
Don't fear
Just love me until the moonlight
Shine on your body
So bright, yeah
Your beauty's blinding
But baby, turn around
My sight's alright
In the night, I'm in my zone
You gon' regret this if you don't smoke
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe
Tapping fools out, Bruce in his first bout
I ain't searching for clout, bringing cars out
Large amounts of money, guard the vaults 'cause we stars
Chase paper, smoke strong
All my bitches get along, well informed
What's your nigga doing
Cut your phone off, hit you in the morn'
Said he borin', ain't important
True color showing
My whip look comfortable, don't it
Keep them papers rolling, don't see my opponents
Stay focused
Don't fear
Just love me until the moonlight
Shine on your body
So bright, yeah
Your beauty's blinding
But baby, turn around
My sight's alright
In the night, I'm in my zone
You gon' regret this if you don't smoke
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin'
Let's get to lovin', babe

The Ps come from out of estate
Grinded all of my life, but I do not skate
I used to play ball in the crate
Now I ball in the mall I’m having my way 
I'm just out living my life 
Diamonds they bright and they bite 
Remember running from the buzz?
Now I perform in front of the lights
Look busy, I'm short, they like the knife

Water with no pipe

Girl why is you playin', let's stick to the plan
The weed is so good that it stick to my hand
It come from the land, I know I'm the man
Bought a few packs, so they threw a few in
I don't understand, I know what you payin'
I smoke till it's gone, then grow it again
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
I was smoking trees at the party, I get gnarly
I got hundred pounds of weed, talking shawty, what you need?
Kush be so strong, hit it once, it's hard to breathe
Have you coughing up a lung, so much smoke you tryna leave
Blowing up a nigga phone, what I tell your ass?
Talking about that pack, I ain't tryna sell your ass
Goddamn, Rollie on my wrist, doobie in my fist
Sipping on the Cris, definitely going to jail if I take a piss
It ain't nothing to get that tip off
Arm out the window, it ain't nothing to get that clip off
It ain't nothing to knock your clique off
Put it in her mouth, I swear she tried to suck my dick off
GODAMN!
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
28 grams in a ziplocc
It ain't nothing to get that zip off
Got one rolled up, you should roll one too
Let's get fucked up, girl you know how we do
What time? What place? Drink gin, no chase
First time all up, next time, call us
Don't hit the bong, get this smoke, it's bad
Say you smoking strong but you wrong, you've been smoking trash
It ain't in my lungs if it ain't that pressure
First thing in the morning, grab my joint from off the dresser
Keep my OG in a jar cause I like it fresh
Said he’d hit the weed, he ain’t ready yet
Steady flexing on these children like I'm Willie Nelson
No discretion come to drugs, I got a big selection
YES!Yeah it’s real shit
Let me roll this weed up and wrap this shit, you know
Too much purple for me
Uh, coming up I always thought I’d be the runner up
Gave my all but it felt like it wasn’t enough
I remember spending summers in the studio
My pops told me have fun be a kid for once
What he ain’t know, was for a kid a that I had big dreams
I take a small frame turn it into a big screen
Taking best friends turn them to a good team
I’m watching Scarface living all the good scenes
Burning dope thinking about the days when I was broke
Desperate niggas in my city don’t know how to cope
Young nigga said he starving he ain’t got a meal
Down to catch a body all about a dollar bill
My niggas is all I got so it’s more than trust
We ain’t even have a car we was on the bus
Public transportation now it’s hundred grands we makin'
Throw it in the safe I can’t hear what they say
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away
There's just way to many niggas i use to know back in the day
Now when i see them out
I just don't got shit to say to you niggas
When i see you in the club i make my way through you niggas
You must be mad i ain't wait on you
But no matter the circumstances i never get hate on you
Im just taking all my dream trying to make it facts
Putting on for my team trying to make it crack
Getting all sorts of green trying to make a stack
Lose yourself in my city and never make it back
Said he will but the chances are he will never change
Daddy sold dope but you would probably do the same thing
If I get $30K i would probably spend it on my wrist
Fuck these politics when these kids ain't have a pot to piss
Fuck the Promises, the shit I'm on is common sense
If you ain't talking them I'm gone
I’m packing up my bags
Packing up my bags, packing up my bags
I gotta catch a plane
Gotta catch a plane, gotta catch a plane
I can’t be at home
Can’t be at home, can’t be at home
I gotta be away
Gotta be away, gotta be away

Fell asleep in a bed full of bitches that I ain't even fuckin'
Like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy, like Jimmy
I smoke a joint and wrapped a band around my motherfucking head like Jimmy
Niggas mad at me cause the hoes that I leave with so pretty
I'm a badass, do my own thing when I'm in your city
Purple haze, I'm on purple haze
To come down, I need a couple days
Bitches kissin' on me
Drinkin' liquor, takin' naked pictures for me
Fuck you with my vest and my boots on
Skinny but it's wide and it's real long
Red wine got her zonin'
Flip my tongue, now she open
If she bad I want it
Ass fat, got my name tatted on it
Don't call my phone with that fuck shit, nigga
If you call my phone it better be about some money

Or your hand better be on fire
Don't call my phone with that fuck shit.com
Follow me at don't call my phone with that fuck shitDamn...
Don't
Don't
Damn
Yeah, don't leave
Cause you're my oxygen
Without you I won't breathe
You're everything I want, need
For you I wear my heart on a short sleeve
I know some things need changing
That takes time; I need more, please
Say I ain't do everything I could've done
Like the shit that I did ain't good enough
Your friends said they been would've left
Ain't do you right, so you head to the left
I can't say that I blame you
Or ever thought that it would be this painful
People do it everyday, I can change too
But dealing with the heartbreak's what you can't do
True
And that's as real get
What you feel ain't easy to deal with
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back someday
Yeah, don't go
How to live my life without you
I just don't know
What you feel in this relationship
It's not that it can't
It just won't grow
I say I love you, say it don't show
Fuck the money then, them gifts don't count
What about the smaller things you needed
And why the fuck you had to leave 'fore I seen it
Damn, I need your love like a weed stick
Me without you, like Kathy no Regis
I kept secrets
And couldn't apologize enough times
For messing with that freak bitch
But I can still tell that you're leaving
And like I said, I can't blame you the least bit
The crying shame is
That time's changing
Best friends become strangers
That's how it is
When you find the girl you love
Has gone
You ask yourself why life
Must go on
You beg your Lord above
To send someone your way
But deep inside you pray
Oh, He'll bring her back somedayI love rapping in New York

Niggas runnin' off with styles that they ain't invent
Tried to grab a towel just to hide the scent
You smell the kush all through the vent
Go through the hallways lookin' innocent

Talk to the boss and not no middlemen
Is you with it or against it?
Please make a decision
Smoke a pound a day, eliminate the competition

My city hot as fuck and, came from the bottom of it
But not a product of it, bitch all my rides are custom
Smoking my ganja public, I'm all about that money
Dress like everyday sunny
Rolling weed like a Marley, smile like everything funny
But this industry shady, most these niggas are crazy
Most of them quick to lose they soul, no if or a maybe
These nudies what I'm wearing, the truth is what you're hearing
The bong is what I'm clearing, the kush is overbearing
Ferrari's what I'm steering, I'm smoking while I'm driving
Keep looking in the mirror, make sure no ones behind us
Cause niggas get jealous when your bank start to swell up
So much that people at the bank start to tell us
You need to have somebody bank for you fellas
Look at me
Look at me
Look at me
Look at them and look at me
I paint a perfect picture, a perfect portrait
Poverty, robbery kill or be killed psychology
I shine just me and my nine
Screw you niggas at 8 o'clock, sharp like it’s Columbine
Guess I'm one of a kind
I see you niggas soft when that shell hit your face
I'll hit your wake to flip your coffin
Bitch get to walkin', this Sabrina's orphan

Walking on the moon
I hope my legs don't break
Walking on the moon
We could walk forever
Walking on the moon

Walking on, walking on the moon
Private planes on my jet way
A hundred joints in my ashtray

This is from the heart, this is from the soul
Hahaha
We still having fun too though man
It's going to be a real big year
You watch
Haha
I'm telling you
They say the game done changed
There's just some new players in it
And they don't wanna see my team get up there and win it
Try to keep me still but look where I'm at now
I made it too far to look back down
But I ain’t never ever going forget what I been told
And I ain’t never ever going back to being broke
‘Cause FYI
I stay on my grind
Tryna stop my shine
That day'll be never ever
I started out just a fan, writing like every other kid
Grew up to be the man, paying bills at my mother's crib
Everyday I'm hustling to get us out this situation
Got to deal with phony shows, goofy hoes and niggas hating
Mostly ya’ll embrace the small percentage of my city, racist
Instead of doing good, they'd rather see me catching cases
The fans love me but I struggle trying to impress the label
And all this got me feeling like it's way too much put on the table
I'm still smoking out of O
Some speculations cause I'm hardly ever home
Easy to say 'bout how we supposed to move on
When we going through depression and our brother O's gone
Was told you gotta go through hell to get the big thing
And when you feel it can't get worse, that's when shit change
Obama's president, The Steelers won the 6th ring
So I ain’t through trying, I feel like I can do anything
Started small town
Now we major
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
We done made it to the top floor
From the basement
Big city, small town
Cause when your money's up, that's when they all 'round
But the minute that you slip, they dip
And it's no one to depend on when the chips fall down
Me, I never cut a corner short, I follow protocol
Got my focus on
Took my notes and all
This hard work gon' pay off
The second that I'm rich, I'll take the day off
If you out there on your grind
Put your hand up in the sky
Say “We grinding”
If you got it but you trying to get some more
Tell them boys “Yeah, we climbing”
This for my people
Who know about struggling
Trying to get something
Cause we came up for nothing
What you in a rush for?
It's all about timing
As soon as you're on
You know the limit's the sky
This your principal, Mr. Easy Rider
Reminding ya'll to get your tickets to the '09 prom, ya'll
That's right, it's gonna be a big event
Guys, grab a girl
And girls, grab on to that nigga's wallet
It's gonna be a special performance by my man Wiz Khalifa, ya'll
So lock your doors and hide your hoes
Cause it's gonna go down
I remember them days
Rolling up, 'bout 25 of them J's
White boys, we ain't smoke blunts back then
I was so high
But enough reminiscing
We gon' get back to the scheduled program
Right here on W.E.E.D
Where every eye is dry
On campus radio
Flight SchoolJust keep goin', and goin', and goin'..
I seen it coming
Yeah, I seen it coming
You do everything for these niggas
They treat you like you did nothing
But fuck that, because all of this came from nothing
Now when I pull up, I ain't on top of my nig
I'm stuntin. Smoking something
Playing my newest shit, and you know its bumpin
You ain't used to it, you gon grow accustomed
Niggas hate me cause they got no progression
All the realest niggas, they know and trust em
And plus, your money's slow as fuck
I bet soon as I roll one up
That they gon know it's us
Before I pass it, hit it twice and I hold it
Trying to get my money to the point where I can't fold it
Going away...
I made it happen, I made it happen
And niggas got mad at me cause I did this shit off of rapping
Hear what they saying
They need no luck because I macked it
And now I got my own gang, nigga
I'm the captain
You know me player, ballin nigga and stackin
All the same with a passion
All cause I'm bringing racks in
Remember when all those niggas was passed em?
But now they still call me the main attraction
Some niggas want the power, I want respect
Some niggas want the fame, I want the check
I'm in Dubai wake up I'm in Tibet
Them niggas had it, man, it's nothing short of savage..
We gettin' ratchet right? Let's get ratchet
How do you resolve that?
There is no resolution. These people they resolve within themselves
They're not really made at me, they want what I gotThis the life we chose, money, cars, and clothes
Takin' trips to different places, livin' like we supposed to
I've been on the road, she outta control
Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got
Top spot, catch me at the top spot
Wouldn't have made it where I'm at if I didn't know a lot
Progress helped me grow a lot
Hit my money, show a lot
Roll my weed up, smoke a lot
Pulled new cars off the parkin' lot
And old ones too
Show love, that's what real ones do
Get my cake long and stay strong
Put my niggas on too
My whips so foreign
My team ballin', my bitch bad, she keep callin'
Them niggas talk? We got heat for 'em
Been in the game, don't sleep on 'em
Hundred K, that's cheap for 'em
What you spend that in a week for?
What you still tryna keep her for?
She was mine, you just think she yours
Chauffeur, I don't open doors
Fly private, know the pilot

Niggas say they gettin' cake but they ain't even close
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't got
I seen it all before, I seen it all before
I gave it to her once and now she wantin' more

Chasin' money like fuck the talkin'

I ain't worried about what I don't got
I'm just focused on what I'm gettin'
I ain't worried about what I don't gotIs this the top? The top of the world?
Top floor, there's weed in the ashtray
It's top-shelf, cap!
Riding in my Challenger, faded off this weed brownie
Turning down the music cause the weed is loud enough already
Niggas ask me 'bout my pay, I say I keep it steady
Gripping on the wheel, spending money like a politician
Tipping on a bill, it's going down
Like this bitch was sitting on the hill
I keep my girlfriend in them expensive sort of heels and furs and shit
Eat champagne and lobster cause I fucking deserve this shit
Cap! Niggas say I've got an old soul
Well, I tell them that I'm here muh'fucka
And I made it cause my flow cold
I'ma roll some of this weed
I'ma pass it to you and we gon' be so gone

Paper hella-straight, nappy hair
Bitches seem not to care that you was even there
When we pulled up lit like Times Square
When we pulled up lit like road flares
When we pulled off, them hoes disappeared
Because they know what we be doing over here
She just wanna be high in her underwear
With her iPhone plugged in the wall, power low
Stepping out the shower, threw her a shirt to towel off with
One of the two qualities I want in a bitch
Cause baby girl fuckin with me is some major shit
Fair warning: I gotta wake up to a BJ every morning
And a J while I'm yawning, darling

I'm rolling up, fuck a wheelchair, ironically, my shit's medicated
Your eyes closed cause you asleep, my eyes closed cause I'm meditating
I gotta go make reservations, at a real nigga's destination
Two girls in the tub, that's luxury
You disagree? That's fuckery, saying, "Fuck you" cause you can't fuck with me

I'm accompanied by Finally Famous Over Everything, that's my company

Lookin' for your bitch, she out somewhere cuddled up
Circle is tight, look like a huddle-up
Tryna get right, young nigga double up 
I paid for the bitch to go get a new tummy tuck
Gang come in first, we don't run with runner-ups
Walk in the club with my motherfuckin' burner tucked 
I am your leader, your favorite achiever
I bought the baguettes, the Pave is cheaper
Quavo Huncho, I'm trappin' with Wiz Khalifa
Stackin' my paper up, no, I ain't make enough
Won't let these niggas up, smoke when I'm wakin' up
No, I ain't fake enough, money, I'm rakin' up
Time, I ain't takin' up, got your girl bakin' up
Your bed, she makin' up, my crib, I'm takin' up
Pillow, her face in it, whole lot of space in it
My car, I'm racin' it, crash and replacin' it
Don't want the basics in, smokin' and facin' it
Came from the bottom, I know where the basement is
Real G's move in silence, my niggas are dangerous
Smoke every day and I don't miss a plane
Stack everythin', at the club, make it rain
Got a new broad and she gettin' me paid
Fuck niggas hate, guess that come with the gameStarted out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you ain’t letting go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in
Oh
First class help you in the game like a free throw
Fill my bank up with cash, my glass with Clicquot
You ain't gotta tell your friends what we talk about
All the places that we go, we go
You're mine for the night, your man try and repo, oh
Work nights never sleep so you think she got no job
Go to school during the week on the weekend we go hard
Live so large, let you go tear down the mall like it’s your card
It's no problem, go ahead and sing it girl, this is your song
Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets
She wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in
Oh, nothin you can tell us, they get jealous when we show up show up
Make you feel like a little girl again, but fuck you like a grown up
High as you can be it's like the dream you never woke from
My life's like a movie, get ready for your close up
Pour bottles and toast up
Your man in your phone trying to see what your plans is
So what, you still turn up my songs soon as they playing it
Know what the sound is my new talks and you ain't saying shit
I'm a call you soon as I land
Probably roll some weed ride up on the beach while you tan
Party every week and you hardly would speak
But now you got my phone taking pictures
Laughing, smoking, chilling, yeah
Started out slow, out slow
Cause no matter how much she gets she wants more, girl
Now we're on the top floor, top floor
Holding on tight, you and I go
Can you feel it in?
Can you feel it in?
Feel it in
We don't need nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this high
We don't need no nobody talk
Probably cause we're in the sky, sky, sky, sky
When we really take off
And I tell her hold on
Cause she say she never been this highEarly night jumping out the Porsche
Joyrich hoodie and sweats, smoking as good as it gets
Life of the party, know I get it started
I take a shot you take a shot, I roll a joint you roll a joint
Let's turn this spot into a after-party
Ain't heard about me you should ask somebody
We play the music off our iPhones
Gon' light that weed up, nobody home and plus were growing
Young nigga with gin in this red cup
Turning up cause we don't give a fuck and only ones that gets us is us
Toking 'till I'm glaze, rolling smoking blaze
Rock expensive J's, glad I brought my shades
Got a bottle somebody gave me, and another one I saved that I bought on the way
Now that's faded, pour a shot cause' we made it
Two shots if you're feeling good, middle finger if you hate it
Got fly as I wanted to
Got high as I wanted to
Couldn't lie if I wanted to
Couldn't drive if I wanted to
I got two shots another one poured
'Bout to roll a joint and it's going down
I got Bombay in the bottom of my cup
Faded but I got enough to go around
I got shoes on you can't find em in the store
Pound of weed you can smell it by the door
Palm trees you can have this all season
I'm balling and the niggas running with me
Is ready for whatever Yeeh
It's young Khalifa man
I know I say that before every song
But that's really, actually who the fuck I am so
Uh uh
Damn it feels good to be a Taylor
To rock camo shorts, chuck-t's and smoke papers
Weed comin' in all flavors
Fall up in the spot as long as the champagnes there
Couple pretty hoes I don't know their name here
Smell the weed, see two fingers know my gang near
Yeh you ballin' but they ain't cheer
I guess they tired of rootin' for the same players
Real niggas run up on me at my shows, hoes show me love, promoters give me plane fare
I'm somewhere at the top I'm planning on stayin' there
Mouth full of kush ridin' in my favorite pair
And this is for anyone who seen a nigga vision from the begining realize that you made it clear
Laugh now fly later, damn it feels good to be a taylor
And that's what it is man, taylor gang or die
Damn it feels good to be a taylor
So ya'll just catchin' on it's all good

If I decide to give this up one day, they gon' retire with me
Enjoy the money and the fame and the power with me
And fucking hater, burn in hell
Sippin' champagne while the waiter breaking shells
Niggas scream my name, probably praying that I fail
The money so insane, gotta weigh it on a scale
 Cap, niggas blow that, bitches know that
Never touch blunts, chill with us once, never go back
Little homie, that's real
VVS diamonds, my stones are that ill
My watch is an Audemar, I'm smokin OG 'til my problems gone
You try to call your man he ain't got no more, probably cause I bought it all

I’m off in that Modena when I’m done, just sound the alarm
Bitch top drop like Mardi Gras beads bein thrown
Francesca you’s a mess girl, carry on
Car smelling like a pound when I pull up at the Avalon
Pull your own weight, I don’t have no time for tag-alongs
Don’t know what you yapping for, I'm stacking dough
Catalogue my closet, my belts, my watches
Cell phone in my pocket, my Blackberry biotches
Have ‘em ready, I’ll watch em, daddy back
Niggas plottin’ on the Jets but we got em
We just waiting to drop ‘em, they vexed cause we poppin’
And them hoes ain’t worry ’bout ‘em, they sure came up
What they sayin 'bout them boys from the bottom?
Paparazzi cameras spot em, flash when you see they faces
History in the making, I was high when I made it
So I can play it for them haters

Used to want a chain, now I got six
Used to want a Rollie like Pac now it’s on my wrist, woah
Livin’ the life niggas told me was a myth 
Same niggas tryna get up on my list 
Since I started buzzin’, I got eighteen eleven cousins
New bitches tryna join the team and old ones that I’m cutting
Sky high class livin but niggas still grinding
Cause I’m surrounded with the same niggas and girls since I had nothin’
Now, I got signed to my idol
Seen some of my favorite rappers turn rivals
‘Ye told me kill em so a nigga gotta drop ‘em
Peep the Jesus chain he gave me since I can't keep up with Bibles
Nah, young nigga heading to the title
Where it’s at? That's the top man, these niggas gon recycle
What, my shit is like a B.I.G recital
But you can’t hold a real nigga down, that's why I keep real niggas 'round

We started it, we gone, and this shit, what you think this is?
How you think you got in the benz?
I'ma roll a joint, write me a verse, before I finish it
Bad broad who I'm chillin' with
We gonna shoot a video so the whole world witness it
Young fly business man, got no love for the middleman
And you know we sip champagne with lunch, smoke J's and stunt
Came up but we ain't change much
I probably got a fitting, got another awards show
I smell just like a plant every time I pull up
They wanna be like us but that don't flatter me
I'd rather be stacking cheese with the ones I call my family, don't ever question why y'all mad at me
You look at now what I have, I'm moving forward that's a thing in the past, gang
I got so much love for you 
I got so many people trying to rep my gang
And I love them all the same
Time to let it go
If you a freak, let me know, make this night unforgettable
Yeah you try to start me off slow
But I ain't with that no mo'
I get the drugs so you hit the do'
Don't need to tell me what you've seen before
You in a whole another game
Nothing like them mama, roll with the gang
And while your girls acting so strange
Because my dog put her in a place
She should've known that before she came
I'm trying to put you on a different wave
Let you hit the J, relax your mind, ain't gotta fuss with me
After we smoke you know what's next
We go to the room, you get undressed, you tell your friends I'm the best
I like where you going
And from the things that you saying, you might be the one
Let's take a couple shots back and get out of control
Ain't got no rules but you already know, I'll make you mine, know you need to roll
I got so much love for you 
I got so many people trying to rep my gang 
And I love them all the same
You already know who it is, nigga
We flyin' more than we drivin', it's 2016, so, I'm OG'in this shit by now
I still keep in touch though
Roll up that good weed, keep smokin' them planes
Best of the best man
Drop a KK, pack off in every home in America
Uh, T-G-O-D
Why I got a filter on my voice?Cup full of gin, I want her and her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!"
Damn! How you get all that?
All that OG in my joint, how you hit all that?
I be always movin' forward, I ain't never movin' backwards
Natural with the talent, I don't ever have to practice
And since we talkin' practice bitch, I'm ballin' just like Iverson
My new bitch immaculate and I'm so used to traffickin'
I be with the baddest bitch and best believe I'm stabbin' it
I hit her with the magic stick, my car could do a magic trick
You can't lock me down baby, let me live my life
Whip a four into a six, 'cause baby I'm not nice
Ayy, you ain't bossed up nigga, you can't change that price
Tried to short me, got him on the phone like, "Make that right"
Got a plane to catch, we can only fuck for 30 minutes
Say she got a man, but she say she love me when I'm in it
I'm a real nigga, scratch my tattoos when I hit it
Fuck her real good, make her call a Uber when I'm finished
That's my nigga Chev, I get to the bag
Flight came wit' a bed, yo' bitch give me head
Like, "Ooh!", ooh she smart
This a spaceship, this a robot, watch it park
Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!", 
I can see the plot 
Ooh, I just bagged a thot 
Diamonds, they be dancing macarena in my watch
Sippin' Faygo, servin' Legos baby, you know I have blocks, ayy
Mother-fuck the neighbours, they was wishin' that it stop, woo
Gun in my crib and we gettin' it André
Gettin' them Benjamins all day
No I ain't payin' attention, my charm is a artist, my chain a magician
Pourin' and drinkin', I'm sippin', I'm in there one time roll that dank and I'm finished
And my bitch bad like Dennis the Menace, I gave her the business
I just fucked your baby mama, ooh boy, you the enemy
Text and said she sick and need the dick, she want the remedy
I just want the headshot, I just want the Kennedy
Got to rappin' like I'm Wopo, don't know what got into me
Cup full of gin, now we're huntin' her friend
I might fuck once, but I never ever call again
Fucked your bitch in my vans, slapped the shit up out yo' man
Fuck the police, I go HAM
Hit her from the back like, "Damn!"
Pounds of good smoke
Used to smoke blunts, but now it's paper she roll 
And I'm with some gangstas, gangstas
And I'm with some gangstas
Uh, heaven and glory
She so high tellin' me stories
Puttin' on for the G's before me
We the motherfucking gang, Army, Navy, Air Force
Blowin' KK got me airborne
Gettin' comfortable's what I'm here for
Confidence in my approach, the fans wanna hear more
Therefore, I built this whole belief that I'ma stand on the foundation, that's real
Smokin' on what Beatrix wanted to do to Bill
Chill, as my driver turns the wheel
Rollin' papers, never let the paper stand still
I'm on a mission and I can, will
Eliminate the competition to destroy the enemy, just gotta break the image
How do I anticipate
What I need in my relationship with you
How do I never hesitate
When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do
Got your nigga emotional
Goin' through his feelings
Never fit in but always manage to get my dividends
We at the crib, bring your friends
I could show you how I live
Say you want to fuck but it depends
I met her at Penn, leave 'em in the wind
Hardly ever call them again
Swedish bitch, call her Harley Quinn
Nigga, your squad hardly win
I could just send out one call them hoes fallin' in
They cheerin' for the kid 'cause I'm ballin'
Winter, spring, summer, fall, I just want it all
Got a joint rolled for each and every one of y'all
All my clothes is recent, all my hoes is decent
Can't join us or beat us
How do I anticipate
What I need in my relationship with you
How do I never hesitate
When I'm afraid and don't understand what to do
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers
Pullin' up to Ubers, wakin' up the neighbors
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers
Got you rollin' papers, got you rollin' papers

You ain't no lame
Are you ready for it? Are you ready for it?
Never bored, I'ma get my phone, press record
Girl, I'm grown so don't worry 'bout nobody knowin'
It was good, I just had to see what you was doin'
It's been a long time, but this thing ain't foreign
Give it to you hard, we fuckin' up the headboard
Switching up positions in the bed, we ain't boring
Takin' you up in the sky, feel like you soaring
I was supposed to be writin' songs but I'm in my low-low
When I'm
Ridin' 'round thinkin' 'bout you
Thinkin' 'bout what I might do
Don't know what got into me
Probably 'cause you keep sendin' me
Them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Keep sendin' them late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
Late night messages
'Cause when I say slide, you slide
And when you say ride, I ride
Keep a bad bitch by my side
And when I say go, you go
And when you say roll, I roll
You're the last one to hit my phone
In my car all aloneBone Snaps and crane kicks
Divine intervention, I was put here to change shit
By hook or Crooks and Castles draped up in the same fit
Been rockin' it for days now, and will until the pay stop
See there's no dinner or winner for second place huh?
Yea that what I figure, so I handle my business
Confidentiality, all my plans to get richer
Then I, master my role as my plan unfold
Right moves, make sure the left hand don't know
Words from a wiser predecessor: Never let up
I know how to spot a fool, cause he never shut up
If you speak it, you don't know it, you know it, you don't speak it
Can't feel me if you put your vertebrae on the speakers
See you got the beat, hitting at on ya
I got higher than Chong on bongs in California
Catch me in your in local cool spots catty corner
Virgins to the herb frown at that aroma
For those inquisitive, scoot closer to Phips a bit
I invite you to get higher than what you've experienced
Um, there's some who think they smoke, but we stay higher
And some think they get fly, but we get flyer
They lookin' for the planes, we done cruised right by ya
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say no 
It's everywhere we go
Woke up in the mornin'
Some ashes in the sink, couple drinks we was pourin' in
My niggas sleep, bitches rollin weed while I'm yawnin'
It's just a routine after a night of performin'
I turn the hotel into a Polo Party
Makin' them eggs with cheese, let 'em smoke so much weed
Them hoes think we in the '70s
Big Dog, better pedigree, she in this king size bed with me
Give her space boy, I let her breathe
And I mean that technically
Roll up the trees, like my weed grown medically
Less of the seeds, Niggas still got the hatin' disease
When actually they know, bite or bark, fight or heart
I'ma keep rollin' trees nigga, light or spark
Taylor in my walk, karate in my Talk
Now that's gangsta
Um, there's some who think they smoke, but we stay higher
And some think they get fly, but we get flyer
They lookin' for the planes, we done cruised right by ya
Smell what I smoke, they ask me if I supply, I say no 
It's everywhere we goLiam

And niggas think they ill when they rap but I'm the sickest
C'ause where I'm from its about who go the hardest not the quickest
Little nigga, big engine, big units, big business
Been doin' it, been spendin', me and you a big difference, yeah

They stay the same
No matter where they go
They stay the sameOne thing's for sure, two things for certain man

All my nights that I spent on my own tryna find my way
All the chances we take right or wrong' now we counting all day
I done been through the pain - seen it all for the fortune and fame
And did it for a first class flight on a plane
Can you stand the rain?
Can you niggas really stand the pain?
Can you stand to sit for 14 hours on the plane
If you get caught, you'll never smoke again
I'm leaving niggas with no bitches and cruel intentions
Make 'em dig in they pockets, makin' 'em pay attention
I don't gotta talk it cause God I live it
Say the competition, they all gonna be missin'
That's part of the mission, we ball and they missin'
Order all them rooms up, let all of my nigs in
We hop out them bitches, stay on our toes

Twist up the herb
Tell your friends they ain't gotta catch feelings
There's enough room for all ya'll - skinny, fat, tall

Growing up I ain't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and rolling stuff for I was old enough
Getting every dollar and fold it up
Putin' all my weed in papers instead of blunts so they could know it's us
Every party we showing up, baggy full of pre-rolls
Light it up and pass it you holding that one too long nigga matter fact you can have it
Another one in rotation my motivation is cabage my Rollie face filled with carrots
And niggas think they are but they know that they ain't comparing
And they ain't doing no harm but I don't think I'm really caring
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
From your broke ass, I just keep hustlin all the time and gettin more cash
And rolling weed you smell the chronic when I go past
You look at me and then put down notes on your notepad
Yeah, I'm kinda high, but you should know that

I'm just try to make it out here on my own
I say I do a lot of things but I prolly never change

Of getting rich and burying all my money in the desert sand
Wasn't no stroke of luck, I played my hand

And now my cheese ain't just American, cause I get overseas money
Everywhere I go, somebody scream for me
Looking out the window, my hotel room in Vegas

For your speakers to smoke it
Now pan on them lenses and focus on the dopest
In the Mitchell and Ness Marino, see how far back I’ve been quoted
And they hoe suckas know that from Spitta they styles stolen

Dissing these bitches, you entertained
You tell her you love her too, I tell her she’s out her brain
I’m on the road to the millies, I started on Penny Lane
Now the bandwagon is packed, you might could hop on the train
At the top, so now her top all off
I never pay hoes, I only pay cops off
And tell these niggas they gotta take that disguise off
I’m from Detroit, we eat you little hoes alive with hot sauce
Fucking bitch, I might come a little tardy though
Fatty rolled, Chris Farley smoke
You niggas rolling up Barley bro, I’m all-green as the safari’s go
You bitches already know
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can't
We in the party burning up that weed smoke
Smell us everywhere that we go
When niggas try to tell us, we like "Hold up, roll up"
And them bitches ain't coming if they can'tThat shit hard
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled
All my bitches roll, all my bitches smoke
All my niggas ride, all my money comin' from the go
All I do is grind, all I do is shine
All I do is take my time, take my place and never wait in line
Had to get my own, had to leave 'em 'lone
Had to fuck your bitch, had to grow some weed, had to get some dough
Pass another one, I got cash enough for both of us
Always rollin' up, smell that weed, you know it's us
Gang
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolled
3 in the roll, then we lit 3 more, continuous smoke
I don't need yours cause these was rolled 'fore I left the door
Nigga fasho, since 2009, this was the code
We collected and changed the trajectory of the globe
Highed up, sittin' in my '84
The second switch I hit'll make my bad bitch drop it low
I'm out front with the moonroof back
Sparks when the bumper scratch
Better tell 'em that, we done smoked the whole pack
I can't even hear what they're sayin'
Roll another plane up, take all the problems, blow it away
And I can't even hear what they're sayin'
I pull up in a ride that's so loud the motor blow you away
And I can't even go where I really wanna go
Cause I'm always on the road, but I'm gettin' dough
And I can't even say how much money I done made
We ain't gotta roll 'em up because they pre-rolledDP on the beat

Police ran up on my tour bus

Niggas at the Grammys

Wouldn't believe how many older women that be crushing
Never quick to make a scene to me that's really nothing
Claim your flow insane but niggas not so sick
Let 'em heat up 'fore I eat 'em
Hope the pot don't stick
And my nikes don't fit, but my jeans do
Apoligize for shitting on you niggas I ain't mean to

Liquor, Swisher, Tips and that bitch to fluff my pillow
California trips got me on some different swag
If you didn't know who I was, I bet you know it now

Just a lil bit so I can hear myself

Taylor gang or fuckin kill yourself man
That's how we get down
Uh ya
So far so good
Cause I been doing things that you wish y'all could
Hoppin outta planes
The kush numbs problems in my brain
And Rosé bottles for the pain
The lines that I ink make rappers get kinda nervous
People telling me to sink when I'm trying to surface
Groupies all up in my face like they got a purpose
Cause we ain't gotta pour drink bring bottle service
Orange juice and some more flutes
Let a friend sky dive man I need more chutes
I'm live wire you a cord loose
No charge I go so hard
Hookin up a table on a promo tour
Say I live a dream but I'm just on my job
And can't quit cause the first class flights get addictive
Try and get a ticket
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloud
Ain't comfortable but got my feet up
It's hard to hear you when you thirty thousand feet up
Claims since I got my cheese up
I been walking round chest out like some D cups
OG puff say you got it locked and we found out its the key stuck
Used to fuckin with that cheap stuff
I show you Rose bottles of that Clicquot
Then we drink till we fall
And when you wake up and realize what you did
It'll be me that you call
But I'll be on a plane
And even though we had fun
Shit I don't know your name
Say I'm on my way but I don't know where I'm going
Been gone so many days don't know my way back home
Now I'm starin out this window
And I see my life in aerial so
I might as well write my name on a cloudLet's go
It is what it is, man
What it was, what is wasn't
Only Nigga
Uh
Blow it by the O
Blow a lot of paper
I got rich when was young
Now, the folks say that I'm famous
If you smoke this, You'd get high
Won't know what your name is
All I do is keep it G
My nigga, that's my second nature
I'm in New York with the thugs
Oakland with the scrapers
London eating Nando
Smoking weed like I'm jamaican
Monday all through sunday
All this money I be making
Never been a pussy, dawg
And never did no hating
Always been the realest
On my section no debatin’
Rolling tree I got some kush in California waiting
Breakfast on a plane, breakfast on a plane
Don't got eat when I land

Diamonds in my time, my nig

Live the way I live
You get respect just for your change
Come to where I live

This shit on smash
Influenced by the reefer but I'm still positively speaking
Heading down to New Orleans fuck with Spitta for a weekend
Exotic bitches freakin', minks on the rug
I'm living Cliquot dreams, pouring drinks in the tub
One life to live, so I'mma live it up
Like you gotta pay for pussy, nigga
I don't give a fuck
Blow it on some new threads
Chickens give me new head
One look at my charm, they say I ain't doing too bad
My palms itching like you did when you rolled in grass
Flick another joint, I'm here but I just hope it lasts
On the beach with my amigos smoking hella Zags
Love the life we lead so we just make a toast and laugh
You say another day, I see it as another plane
Another dollar, another reason to ensure the fame
Every city they repping, they knowin' my name
We the Gang, Taylor-Jets painted on the wing
On the road to riches and diamond rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Smoking weed with your bitch is the song we sing
Fly niggas do fly things
On the road to riches and diamonds rings
Fly niggas do fly things
Take the pictures 'front the Chevy is the song we sing
Kids looking up to me cause I'm a G
Would it be cliche
To start my verse by saying something that I always say
The planes got it
I perfected my roll in the science of aeronautics
I swear on my soul I would never cosign no nonsense
Muscle car auction
I just cop it and then garage it
Wait on the night to set then really pop it and drive it
Bitches run on side it
Like those little Jamaican kids who saw that Benz with Buns and Ox inside it
Word to Wale, Spitta OT in DC for 4 or 5 days
I got enough pair of fresh J's in my Crooks bag
Smelling like a pound, TSA what they looking at
Wanna pat me down, came up with nothing cousin
Pull away from ground transportation puffin'
Baking kush berry muffins
Mind on a million, trying to get this shit is puzzling
In the grand scheme of things, where you sit in this discussionI pull up with your bitch in the Rolls

So I spend it on shoppin', all of this shit that I'm coppin'
Don't even go to the store, my outfit it ain't even droppin'
Pedal to the floor, smokin' in my new SS
Seen a lot of bumps on the road to success
But that ain't stop a nigga from cruisin' up
Pullin' weed out the ashtray, cuttin' the music up
Smokin', chillin'
Used to be underground but now we on top of the buildin'

Big Speaker here to tell you 
Better get your shit together 
You can't get no money 
Trying to live off hate forever 
I'm full of that midnight panic 
Floating light as a feather 
Walked in, iced out, made it rain, I changed the weather 
Soon as you pop, get a buzz
That's when they stop showing love 
Done rapping for some validation
All the hate just tired of being wasted 
Diamonds on my chest not to flex on you
Wanna make it to the top, shit, nigga, me too
I'm a killer with the truth 
I can see it in your eyes, they never lie
Hearing rumors, fuck them, why I'm not surprised
I can tell you're dying deep inside
Showing love is something maybe you should try 
Shouldn't be a hater all your life
Shouldn't be a hater all your life

Suede on the floor, doors plus the ceiling
And I keep it clean
Hoes wanna get in they gotta wipe they feet
Go over a few things then I'mma light this weed
Don't want no burn marks sweetheart
So hang it out the window
If you gotta fuck up once I get you outta here

Freaky bitches take the dick in any whole
Now they famous cause they in my video

You think its really worth losing your life
How bad you want stripes, my young niggas killers

Bunch of youngins' coming from a broken home
Slanging rock n roll but ain't no rolling stone
Streets welcome niggas in with open arms
If I catch the charge I'm a post a bond
You god damn right I'm a certified boss I can cut the check or I can cut your throat
Put you on the table tag on your toe smoking weed till' I overdose
You don't want beef you ain't thinking clear. I'm too busy tryna make a fucking village
Dripping more cheese then a chicken Philly, Pittsburgh niggas really bout they business
I got niggas with me don't got any feelings
They just really wit it, they just into killing
Hard as hell on the internet but nigga in the streets you like Richard Simmons
My money long and my passport got more stamps then a nigga mail
It ain't a problem if I catch a body then I'm heading over seas I'll never see a sail nigga!
MAFIA
GANG!For real man, we need that whip
That's the car I need
Motherfucker hit a plane and the plane blew up
Ugh, yup
Standing in the mirror
My vision of that money getting clearer
Scratch that, it's getting nearer
Some of this actually happened
I was weed nappin'
Wasn't shit
Now they pay us for the raps we kick
My hotel smell like confidence
They hate us but that weed smoke bring on compliments
So roll this paper
Tell the waitress - get my drink from off the coaster
Bring the bitch that love to smoke and get the weight from off my shoulders
Yeah, I be flying everywhere nigga
Sometimes I don't even know where the fuck I'm at
I be waking up, random motherfuckers be knocking on my door and shit
Like "who the fuck is that?"
Nosey ass cleaning lady
You wanna hit this weed?
Stains from your make-up
Roll me up a joint soon as I wake up
Young nigga, but got my cake up
Now I'm hoppin' off of the plane
Smelling like the sweetest scent, weed is lit
Look at my bitch, we the shit
Probably high - what they say when they see us
But they never say that we broke
Kush in every J that we smoke
Putting rings on every finger
Never put 'em out, just let the smoke linger
Champagne for the girls, straight shots for my niggas
Started small but now the money getting bigger
It all get better with time
Rather go hard instead of unwind
And play your part and I'mma play mine
Feel me?
Motherfuckers always speakin' out of turn
They don't know nothin' about this shit
That's why I'm me and you're you
Matter of fact, fuck that
This Taylor Gang
T.G.O.D. nigga
Ain't shit changed gang
What up Ricky P

Don't smoke that pound without me Richard
Don't eat your dinner in the bathroom
Jim Brown smash baby

Get her Jim! Get her Jim!
Oh shit!
I don't get no sleep
I'm fresh off the plane
I don't get no sleep, God damnWe on the way! Just know 
When the streets get dry, we on the way
It's on the way, it's on the way, it's on the way
They trying to stay, they trying to stay, they trying to stay
Don't be late 
 D Kelly!
Cannon, Cannon, Cannon
I smoke by the pound and I roll to the face 
I go out of town and take it on a plane 
They know that I got it, it's all that I said
That pack on the way, that pack on the way 
Man, that pack on the way, that pack on the way 
That pack on the way, man that pack on the way 
They know that I got it, it's all that I said 
That pack on the way, that pack on the way
Said you been smoking a blunt, that was back in the day 
I had it, I got it, I roll it then smoke to the face 
I make sure I smoke in the bed cause I smoke every day 
I hopped in my ride and I head to another new place 
I get on the plane then I'm rocking an animal 
Seen the price of my jeans and it ain't understandable 
I rap what you thinking and I'm smoking, I'm drinking
Niggas is sinking, all you little niggas need beatings
So I told 'em, a joint i'ma roll it
Her ass i'ma hold it, and mind i'ma mould it 
I came and got chosen, Her man didn't notice
And I be like hold up, don't go no where 
Trying to get a photo , thats a no-noMy momma ain't raise no fool nigga
Matter of fact, maybe she did 
My momma raised a fool 
But that don't mean we can't get rich
Too rich 
That's what they say
Humble beginnings, rich ass endings
Pockets on swole, big ass benjies
Started off losin', man it wasn't choosin'
Stuck with my nigga's, now we all winnin'
Rollin' up paper, ball like a Laker
Top on the building, I'm high as a 'scraper
What can I say now, cops know my name now
No time to play 'round, I'm rich and I'm paid now
Stay on that peaceful shit for nigga's that spray rounds
Hear all the talk, they gon' come see you any day now
Try not to fade out, try to find a way out
Nobodies innocent nigga, get down or lay down
Made so much money but look how much I'd paid out
Don't trust the bank no more so I went and got a safe in my house
Guess all these diamonds on my wrist, what you blinkin' about
It's all my money on my mind when I'm thinkin' about
Try to be the best that I can
Make all the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but I don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't 
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man
You know I try when people tell me  I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the same
Nigga's still hating, critics still waiting
Said that I'd change my ways and start catching these cases
But never said I'd stop counting these faces
Flyin' new places, buying them cases
Nigga's want problems, I don't entertain it
Cause if it's real problems, It's not entertainment
I'm rollin' a joint up, precise like a painter
The grind is what made us, the grind is what made us
Now the nigga's that I grew up with lookin' richer
Too much turnin' up, the club owners tryin' to censor
Tatted everywhere  my full body full of scriptures
Pull up in the phantom, paparazzi takin' pictures 
Sellin' so much swag, we should be your swag vender 
Big winner in the club, big cash spender
Throwin' signs to my man like he a damn pitcher
Some shit you can't witness, my nigga we been business
Try to be the best that I can 
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man 
You know I try to do shit with my heart
They talk but i don't listen
I just finish what I start
You know I tried the nigga's that said I can't 
They got the right decisions, handle business like a man 
You know I try when people say I should change
Sometimes I'm done with trying, I'm just trying to be the sameYear-round we them niggas
You seasonal, temporary living
Your run'll be done in a minute
You are not infinite
Bitches can tell the difference, they know better than to smoke with ya
Back up a lil' bit, you'll get the whole picture
So much sicker than them niggas, I'm coughing they just got hiccups
KC lights, roll bars on my Chevy pickup
Off-road style, lift kit, heavy duty springs
Stomper tires get it done when the time is crunch like sit-ups
To the challenge I rise, Lamborghini doors
'85 Countach never seen a real road
From the showroom floor to my seven car garage
Got a storage 'cross town with like seven more rides
Tucked inside - that Grand Theft Auto life
Rolling up in my safe house I'm looking down
Done it by my design, refusing to comprimise
Mestizo eyes
Mestizo eyes
They saying shit changed cause shit changed
Not just the horses in my motor, but the cost for me to show up
I'm a boss, and my whole team fly private
Black cars when we roll up, quarter pounds when we blow up
Hit the ground running
My watch new cause a nigga sound bumping
And ya girlfriend leaving you cause she just wanna be around something
Like playing Xbox and wearing weed socks, speeding 'round stunting
Orderin' thousand dollar room service, rolling weed up by the onion
Ooo I got it made, but I ain't make it on my own
Who would've thought a Pittsburgh nigga would go and buy an LA home
Rolling up papers, turning down favors
All these fake kushes, I got my own flavor
Homie that ain’t KK in that brand new bag
Got it made to make that brand new crib
Need a whip to match that brand new car
Thinking maybe Maybach brand new insides
Everything black, young ass nigga blowing OG in the back
Last time you heard from me, I was rolling bud up
Looking dope in my brand new clothes
Eyes closed like someone told 'em to shut upYeah, Jets nigga
The planes and the Taylor Gang, man
Lamborghini wings and champagne
Jets and Monsta Beatz
Bitches, now Taylor Gang that
Bitches, now Taylor Gang that
Jets, holla at Wiz
By the strength of the quality weed smell
You can tell that I'm somewhere in the building on my Batman shit
Niggas suspended from the ceiling
Not really, but that's the way the weed got me feeling
Gondola rides in Venice
Mami you got the vision and I see in HD
And it couldn't be any clearer
You should be with Spitta
And you know that this your chance
Don't blow it like birthday candles
Good guy Spitta keep his name outta them scandals
It's not a secret, I prefer my girls in sneakers, never sandals
Posing naked in only a pair of Nike Vandals
Bottles pop, back to back
Extra large chronic sack
Cellphone, camera's out
Mama I remember that
Anytime I look at that
I go to wondering where you at
So baby where you at, with it
I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
And maybe we get back up in a minute

Hit it out of the park
That's if you pitchin'
First you look at me wrong
Like uh-uh, no he didn't
Then you turn into Robin on me
You start to give-in, get it?
By the beach, watching tennis
Crack another bottle of Perignon
Louis V carry-ons when you visit
Sending all them signals in your sidekick sentence
Then I reply, like "Be there in a minute"
Just put me and Curren$y on your friend list
The weed come from a village
Truck tire, sour diesel scented, that's real shit
From smelling this she wanna see how the cigar taste
We lighting reefer, bumping 808's & heartbreaks
Skinny broad, but out them jeans she got a heart shape
Skip the movie date and take her to the horse race
And let you bet it all, keep the winnings
Young entrepreneur, give you the business, dig it
Fast cars
Fly clothes
G5's flying over seashores
Get it
Baby I'm just tryna hit it on the friendly
So tell me if you is
Or if you isn't

With itI got a couple sweets rolled and whole 'nother O in a Ziploc
They see the pockets on swole while the light hit the stones on the wristwatch
Don't gotta ask who run it, man it's easy baby they know my name
All the cash that we blow on some weed smoke - they say, bro it's a shame
Boy, you know it's a shame
Pockets bulky like Pop-eye
And I'm pimp all the hoes call me Papa
Gucci, Chuck Tays, I don't fuck with no Prada
Fresh off the plane and I'm smoking like High Times
It's better to be a star
NY - I'm copping them weed jars
LA - my hoes got medical weed cards
And my swag through the roof
I hit the mall a boutique and tear it down
See what I got on you want to wear it now
Think I'ma trick on her, but she get nothin'
Married to my money so bitch think I'm taken
She keep beggin' me to creep
I heard your song I can do better in my sleep
All my niggas rumble, some better with the heat
Better keep the peace 
There's ink everywhere you see
And I only smoke good weed
Only wear designer man
If I fuck with baby girl, gotta be a 9 or 10 
I got a couple sweets rolled and whole 'nother O in a Ziploc

All the cash that we blow on some weed smoke - they say, bro it's a shame
Boy, you know it's a shame
Last night I made a bitch forget all about her man
The reason for them guts in your garbage can
I roll expensive spliffs
She fuckin' me for free, but for you she's one expensive bitch
Keep blowin' up my sidekick, know I'm at the studio
Another couple thousand, every time I do a show
That meaning I'm really eating
And everyday of my life is like the weekend 
I wake up to good weed and new clothes
Go to sleep with more money and bad hoes
One of my 3 phones buzzin' through my sleep
I know you heard of my name
I'm buzzin' all through the streets 
And I be with bosses
Get your shit together nigga or count your losses
And in case you ain't get the portrait

And thank God I stay far away from the fake
Remember days wasn't safe
Now we got thousands tucked in the safe
Target practice case you wanna come and see
I take a look in the mirror at G in front of me
Difference between havin' dreams and bein' a wannabe
And livin' comfortably
I took my dreams and made 'em somethin'
Doesn't mean that I don't wake up with the same hunger
Another mansion for my team, couple wave runners
Couple niggas want our spot but they can't take it from us
I'm busy smoking like Jamaicans
Never worry bout you niggas
Hate, you jealous, I can see it on your face
I seen 100 dollar bills falling yesterday
I heard 'em ask who fault it is then I spoke my name
Young Khalifa man

A stranger, a stranger, a stranger

I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change
Ah now they're getting stranger
They're stranger, they're stranger, they're stranger
I wrote my name on the clouds
Said no waiters allowed
Do anything to make my Taylors proud
I do a show, throw a J in the crowd
Some say I got they favorite style
You in the game, never make it out
I blow a pound, rollin' weed by the ounce
Them niggas talk but they can't amount
Big bands in my bank account
Seen it all, I've been here before
Calculate my moves but nah it's kinda difficult
I'm always switching up and doing shit in intervals
Now we professionals, nah we ain't letting go
Them niggas talk not what they doing but they moving slow
While I'm knee deep in the game, Mr. Doing More
This the part where the teacher becomes the student
And you start to realize I'm the youngin' you need to move with
Girls run up on me, tell me they love my music
Niggas try to be genuine I know it's bullshit
It's like I'm talking to a stranger
A stranger, a stranger, a stranger

I think I'm in danger, gotta wake my game up
Gotta stay the same, watching everybody change

They beat me up so of course they wanna ride with us
You wasn't trapping on them blocks, you wasn't outside with us
A couple .40's, you got some 9's with us
And they can't beat us so of course they wanna side with us
They say if you ain't got no haters you ain't popping
I got pussy niggas, I got bitches pocket watching
I got blue hundreds on me in LA
I come straight from Hollywood then I pull up in the projects, go
Ay sorry homie you a stranger
One off in the head if I ever feel in danger
Started at the bottom but God damn it I done came up
Trill with my niggas, they can never say I changed up
Two cups stuffed and I get it out the mud
All I see is real hate, niggas showin' fake love
Givin' fake handshakes and that come with fake hugs
But I promise I'm the same

Probably in the hot tub with my girls soaking watching vh1 tripping or adult swim
Them niggas kinda cool but they can't flow with him
After we done I smoke one then we go again  
I'm tall slim and I know how to stack my bread
Instead of running you be throwing it back instead
I run game I don't know how to slack
You get money and don't know how to act
That's young nigga shit
I smoke strong cuz it help me relax
And the crib get controlled by an app
I pull up with the stick
Hit the switch hop out to get a bitch
Tell her I ain't really nothing like the nigga she with
She convinced so she hop up in my 6-4 then we dip
Got papers got grinders so we lit
Ima pull up with a zip
Pull up with a stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
Pull up with the stick, let it hit
I put this on the ten, I'ma end
His life, no beginnin', fuck a friend
Bitch I'm with the mob, you can't get in
We've committed sin, free my niggas in the pen
Free OmertaGang, gang
Gang, gang, gang
Gang
Leave it to me, I'll have you twisting that weed with a G
Got too much talent just to be sittin' around with
Weed and alcohol, that's the balance
Ridin' in the Benz with low mileage
Working 'til my hands get callouses
Been a player, I established it
Whips be the fastest
Chicks be the baddest and my kush above average
Legendary status and my crib like a palace
I know why they mad
'Cause your bitch layin' in my bed
Still got the weed smell in her hair
Comin' home later, nigga gettin' carats
Make a whole pound disappear
Come for the money, tryna get it all
If it's for the gang, Imma get involved
Look at me different now
Roll some weed and put your niggas on
You ain't bout the paper, what you in it for?
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that I'ma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch
Uh, they ain't goin hard as us
We courtside, chillin', smokin' out the building
Regardless if authorities give us permission
Boss bitches niggas breakin' they credit card limits
To try to ball with us
We in talks with those who own they own business
My spark lit, then I paint pictures
Don't leave witnesses, nah nigga, my gang different
Pull the Benz out in the rain
Hit her once, I won't even remember her name
Hella diamonds up in my chain
To say that I'm dope is an understatement but no, I ain't underrated
Came from a place where niggas make their own way
Got some girls who fuck me but got niggas so they don't say
I'm puttin' KK in the paper
On point, gang ready for danger
Long joints, rollin' them things like broken fingers
Too clean to ever have a stain
Khalifa the boss before you beat the game
And my eyes so low, soon as I walk in
I got a joint rolled you know that imma spark it
That's why I ride so slow, me and my gangsters
I hear 'em talkin' like they livin' but they ain't us
Pockets, they swole
I won't leave here alone, came here with no bitch
But when I walk out the door, I might leave here with your bitch
Pockets is gettin' swole
Used to smoke blunts now it's paper she roll
Diamonds to my toes
Everywhere I go, I'm froze
You already know
Fool
Gangsters too
This is how them gangsters doAnd they think they know you
Till one day they show you
So no matter what they say I go hard
And they think it’s over, but it’s never over
’cause soon as you think I’m down I go hard
Get up it’s that bitch card, been here before
But don’t ever let them see you on the ground
Dues, what you gotta pay, and people see you gotta say
So don’t ever let them see you on the ground
Yeah ya’ll, hey ya’ll
Dangerous thoughts mind of a militia
Bottles of the one fifty poured over twisters
Broken bones the pillars, Staten Island’s the illest
The biggest land fillers we creep like caterpillars
Love razors, dirty guns with a few bodies
Teach niggas how to walk again from the fucking shotty
Sixth sense, six pack, six degrees of separation
My evil third eye blinks with no hesitation
Dust bags, spoonfuls of sugar help the medi
Go down smooth and steady blowin' the green deadly
And weed pops isolator of hash bricks
Needle left stuck in his arm, died of a bad fix
We still rock, still dry drawers on the stove
Got bread from back in the days that’s growing some more
2Pac’s back, my Glock’s fat
After the guns smoke you’re screaming ‘where my block at?’
I go hard like Listerine on bacteria
Hulk so hard he got the power to avenger her
I go hard, herbal tea, kidney cleanser
I go hard LA Dwight Howard
Lungs pounding hard too much smoke in the chimney
Fire plus iron evaporates the enemy
Jason Statham mechanic all mechanically
Right about now I can really use some Hennessy
I go hard like you never thought I could
One swing with the hammer the nails in the wood
My iron fist is so ridiculous
Forever, continuous, venomous and dangerousReal deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real
Actin' brand new
Why the fuck you here
Uh, real deal, Holyfield
All my niggas real

Haha, we label mates nigga I shoulda been jumped on this shit
But it's all good I'mma take care of it
Start like
I started out lil' nigga with a dream
Now I'm on but it still ain't what it seem
Cause now I got more money
More niggas rather see me somewhere on the floor then the ceiling of this thing
But I can give a damn what a little nigga think
I pop more champagne, peel another sweet
Catch Wiz skinny ass chillin' on the beach
Cut my old hoes off, I ain't get with them in weeks
I pray to God every night before I go to sleep
To let her know I'm safe, kiss my mother on the cheek
My little sister grown, little cousin tall as me
And I'm proud cause he ain't fuckin' round in the streets
The fans love the old school sound that I bring
You like jab-work, I pound on the beat
And bein' from Pittsburgh they sayin' they concerned
With tryna make a lame cause my sound is unique
I love when a nigga talk down, think it's sweet
You couldn't play me if you was acting in the scene
The haters can't see 'em, the money's in the way like traffic
Pistolvania is straight action
I'm from the 
Where niggas ain't workin jobs
They only option is to hustle
They feel like they gotta get it
Not all about it then fuck you
You ain't someone that I grew up with
So why you think I would trust you?
Real talk like a dictionary
They say life's a bitch, I'm married
And we make love, she fuck other niggas tho
Can't keep up, you haters to slow, oh
Yea budy
That's how it is
That's it, that's all

Honestly I know it, take me boo, you the one I wanna go with

It pays to be discreet, your fragrance is sweet
Honeydew, money do
But this ain't about no money, this about me and you making ooh
Take it from me, first day of school I'm looking cool, I got my clothes pressed
I'm a senior but I'm seeming like an old vet
Time will pass me by if I don't graduate this time so I expand my mind
Find ways, to elevate it, motivate it, calculate it, reinstate it
Look at you girl, you got me dedicated
Uh, put me on the game
Though I keep my head in these books, I'm not a lame
Usually kinda square, I'm trying new shit for a change
Telling bitches things, like if wanna get with me you gone need a lot of brains
And just cause I don't play, who say I can't ball?
My nigga Mac, dude me and him is in the same hall
So don't get mad if I relax and get my bake on
Just promise that you'll try to catch me if my grades fall
Devin there you are, look at my repertoire
Spitting game, you know for reppin hard
Change that perspective, that's my objective
Cool and oh so collective, connected

See you the seed in my weed, baby help me grow
Let it go, let me know where to meet at
Student of the week, baby I will be that, you know I need that

Havin' problems in your house, it might be my fault
I just knocked your bitch on a IO Hawk
Fuck a hater, get some money, yeah them my thoughts
Brown bags in the closet, that's my fault

Don't act like you know, I know just who you are
Admit it or you don't cause baby I'm a star

Out of this world I'm from a different planet

Call me acid that's how I do ya'll
Heat niggas up till I can see right through ya'll

Still the same Cam, who I was is who I am
Drive the Chevy like a Lam, rollin' up by the gram
Always stickin' to the plan, them other niggas lack the vision
I'm 20/20 and my eyes lower than theirs
I ride slower, supersize motor when you pull up they outside of the crib
You outsiders, we in, we outshine 'em
Taylor gang or outline 'em, ya dig?
Ridin' with my windows down, roll another paper up
We just on our grind, workin', tryin' to get our paper up
Workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody else
Homie, I been workin' on myself, workin' on myself
While I work on everybody else, everybody elseThere's no such thing
There's no such thing
The millions they say I never know such things
Not only that they say I never blow such things
On shots vacation homes for my whole fucking team
The sweeter is the most expensive
They say I'm on but the weed I'm rolling gon' convince him
Bring in the best bottles of wine for dinner
Go ahead and let some of that stress out
We young niggas started from nothing now we pulling Porsche's and Vets out
Throwing back shots of coke in our chest out
 best style
Roll up that chronic so everyone can get high in this bitch
Roll one 
Realize I've been this shit
Realize some niggas been hating on us cuz they ignorant
Realize that I've been killing the game and I ain't innocent
Smoking my joint til it ash 
Sitting in a hot tub thinking about this bread of how I been getting it
For Pittsburgh just smoking up the
Upper east side
London andTokyo sounding pretty nice
Never going to sleep til the sun rise
Miami's heat, Paris life
I wanna live that penthouse life
Top of the world, above the sky
I wanna live that penthouse life
With a balcony to watch the stars
Now the waiter bringing in more bottles
In the floor drunk spinning like a floor model
Could buy anything on the floor
But I don't think the floor got em
Spending money with no hesitation
You can tell that we come from the bottom
30 bottles with no conversation
That's celebration for my Forbes spot
They give us love cuz we show love
Tryna be normal but it's hard cuz everybody knows us
When you broke got nothing to lose
When you rich you got nothing to prove
Riding with the niggas that I came up with
Ain't cutting corners or rushing moves
When you the owner you walk in and back
Rocking 15 hundred dollar shoes
My Porsche cruise the
Upper east side
London andTokyo sounding pretty nice
Never going to sleep til the sun rise
Miami's heat, Paris life
I wanna live that penthouse life
Top of the world, above the sky
I wanna live that penthouse life
With a balcony to watch the stars
We on top of the world
On top of the world
On top of the world
No, you've never been closer
Closer to the stars
Used to be the shit we dreamed of
And I still wanna get high tonight
High tonight 
Lets get high tonight
High tonightYeah
It's Young Khalifa
Mr. Look-the-fuck-up, all that
Feelin' real good about life
Got a drink poured, blunt lit
Let's go
Excuse me
My jeans Levi, my shoes is Gucci
Hoes like "Who he?"
On a paper chase, don't waste my loose leaf
A nigga paying bills, lighting L's on the beach
But I still move with the goons on a loose leash
Some call it weird, hoes call it unique
Swag like I just stepped out a boutique
And I spit like I got a mouth full of loose teeth
Closet full of new sneaks that I'll probably never wear
I'm in that President Suite, bad bitch
And if them niggas ain't me, average
I treat a beat like canvas
Bob Ross on a song, paint it perfect
Ever run out of weed, I'll throw a purp fit
I keep the army at ease 'cause y'all ain't worth it
Been considered hipster 'cause my shirts fit
The way your bitch hit my chirp make a hip hurt
Young nigga ridin' that wave, picture me surfin'
OT, probably see me in your circuit
Same niggas hate, the same ones on my first shit
Now that's irony
Hoes wanna frequent me, flow wrinkle free, no iron needed
I'm on a level y'all dyin' to be at
Or somewhere you gotta fly to be at
You know Leto's home
So we spendin' up the grands on the sand gettin' blowed
Four or five freaks at least, new in my phone
Give you my address, GPS to my home
I party like I own stocks
Smoke blunts with CEO's who own their own yachts
Chillin' with bad hoes who pour their own shots
And pop pills, while I approve million dollar deals
Niggas in a frenzy, city cops on my heels
But I'm too rich to give a fuck
Besides hate, the money gettin' up
The money, the money, the money gettin' up
The money gettin' up, the money gettin' up
The money, the money, the money gettin' uuuppp
The money gettin' up 
The money gettin' up
Yeah bitch!
Taylor Gang or kill yourself man
Look in the mirror, shoot the first thing you see
Yeah, that's not me, that's you
Bitch!Yeah nigga
This them weed raps y'all was talking about
Aye, turn my headphones up
I'm talking straight shit
I got money now motherfucker
I had money then but this real money bitch
Hahahah, ohh
King size papers, king size bed
Niggas blow money but I'd rather keep mine instead
Roll something nigga, blow something
Say you're ballin out of control, let a nigga hold something
Especially if you got it and he don't put his niggas on
Tell me what's the sense of even having it fo'
Cause when you're broke, you'll have everything to gain
When you lose it all, let you inhale out the vape
Do it for the taste
Usually I roll one up to pass around but now I'm smokin' to the face
Cause chiefing with niggas is such a waste
Unless they my niggas
And nine times out of ten, they got their own pound with them
Own pack of papers and filters, something to grind
We be smoking them things like six at a time, five in the air
Four breakin' down, three in my head, two on my mind, nigga
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than
A bit of a pothead, it has been said
I keep one rolled up like LL's pantlegs
Full of life in this bitch, though I may seem half-dead
Trust me, I'm cool, I just ain't talking to you
And them checks coming through as just as I predicted
Got a bigger portion cause the Jets eating off bigger dishes now
Ain't I the biggest fish up in this pond?
Since life's a bitch, tell her roll my shit up huh
Secret compartment in my car, James Bond
Though I'm James Bong, nigga bread long
And my name known in e'ry home household
Caught them pussies slippin' tryna squeeze in the mouse hole
That cheese is not yours, you are not chose by the gods
To live as we do so play your role in the movie, ain't no pause
No rewind for no man, wait time, so I ain't wasting mine
More grass, more green, more grind
Nigga I keep
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than one rolled, one rolled, one rolled
I keep more than
And these bitch ass niggas
Fuck around, might have to bitch-smack me a nigga
Roll around with a bunch of get-rich ass niggas
Who the man? You ain't even gotta ask these niggas
I'mma fuck around and take these niggas' last three pictures
Man these bitches breaking they neck just to pass weed with us
We roll, get high, get drunk, more shots, reload
Too high, he knows, three more, C4, we blow
Bitch, how could you be so fine?
Shake that ass, she so mine
Taking more double shots than free throw lines
I might hit like three, four times
They say "What the fuck is you on?" Fuck if I'm right
Fuck it, I'm on, you fucking at home
Watching my ass, mad that I'm on
On my way to the top, and I'm coming along with one rolled
One rolled, one rolled, one rolled

One rolled, one rolled, one rolled

How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why she got weed in her nails when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
How she keep blowin' clouds in the air when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Pack too loud, pack too loud
Smell me in the club when I came through the crowd
Say we can't do it, rollin' up right now
Anything that I rock, niggas takin' my style
All white Benz, think snow gettin' plowed
She say I'm the realest nigga that she seen in a while
Blowin' this KK, it got me up in the clouds
I be wakin' and bakin', and me, I puff by the pound
Throwin' this money, they waitin' for it to come down
Fall in the spot where only real ones allowed
Start from the bottom, that mean we built from the ground
Don't want no problems, I want mils in my account
New whips, new shit for my house
Tell her take two puffs, kick her out
Say she roll with me, then she lyin' then
We ain't even have sex, we was vibin'
How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why she got weed in her nails when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
How she keep blowin' clouds in the air when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Roll the gas up 
Fully loaded, what you waitin' on?
Ass up 
She a freak, and that pussy, I can't pass up
Heard you lookin' for the vibe, should've asked us 
For real 
Yes, I need a Rollie for a walkthrough 
I don't give a fuck what he bought you 
Bought me a foreign, bought a watch too 
I see you kickin' shit, but who taught you? 
Love that 
Keep a bottle like I'm Tommy, I'm a Rugrat 
Throw the pussy 'til you found out where the love at 
He got ten, I got ten, this a dub sack
Ayy, Wiz, let's get some more, fool 
How she know what to do with the pack when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why her clothes smell like kush when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
Why she got weed in her nails when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? 
How she keep blowin' clouds in the air when she keep sayin' that she don't smoke? And we living material, as long as the money straight they wanna see me fall
But I got a crib that's over looking the city though
And a lot of bitches who wanna get in our videos
Ten to twelve hour long trips, bong rips
I ain't interested in what you selling I run my own shit
Made it through a long list, did my all
Some will talk slick, but no contest, I'm best dressed
That's why the bitches love me
She leaving you to come where the liquor and drugs be
I'm glass floor now you passport and over seas we watching the sunrise
Smoke a joint out on the beach
Write my name in the sand, I
Never been a nigga who had a lucky nothin' you can say everything I planned out
Now I stand out
I fell asleep on the plane and woke up to people screaming my name!
No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road
But I never put my foot on the brake oh no
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh
I don' think it's wrong 
Doing a hundred but they tell me to take it slow 
But I never put my foot on the break oh no 
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh 
Livin' the life is just me
Some bitches my niggas in a crib full of vices
But I don't do drugs, just weed
Caution flags wave, and fuck it I still speed
And proceed to give them what they waiting for
Daytona 500 guess who lighting joints up in the pace car
Play hard, but I work way harder to afford
Boats, put your women on the water let 'em boogie board
Slightly older still, sexy broad, thank Demi Moore
Just strip for me without the tease, give me more
Still rockin' Golden Eye on the Nintendo 64
Sayin they don't make 'em like this anymore
Same goes for my whip, same goes for my kicks, rare
And I don't rush to the store, they save me a pair
Yeah, a nigga living in the air
Spending more time in the clouds then I spend on the ground
Do the opposite, fuck taking advice from these clowns
Thats why I mash the gas when they tell me slow down
Yeah!
No matter which way I go, they tell me don't take that road
But I never put my foot on the brake oh no
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh
I don' think it's wrong 
Doing a hundred but they tell me to take it slow 
But I never put my foot on the break oh no 
I never put my foot on the break oh no, ah no oh This a feeling I wish could never end
Remember days they didn't let us in but now we in this bitch, rollin up medicine in my kush stronger than it ever been
My bitch don't know better than my clique, down for whatever
Thinking back, first time in Vegas, when I caught my first suite, thinking I was major
Looking at it all the light smoking on the paper
Thinking how to get it out my grind, second nature
I don't ever wait
I love the rush, I don't hesitate
I'm trying to teach my son a better way
Watch who you call your friends
Watch who you left right in your 9 11

You gon' have me doin' shit, just solely off them snapshots

Came home from the studio, seen you with no t-shirt on

We ain't gotta go to the shop, we already matchin'
Paper through the roof, but baby money ain't the topic

Go through everyday just to get some shit accomplished
But I can't help but think bout them pictures of you topless
Like a nerd with no Macbook
Look how purty that lil cat look

And I'm tryin' to kick the habit, but you gotta nigga crack-hooked

And out of all the flicks, my favorite pictures when you grabbed it
Standin' with no towel on, wish I was where your hand is
That ring up in your nipple make a nigga think of marriage
Baby, you my everything, you all I ever wanted
We can do it real big, bigger than you ever done it
(Well y'all probably done it pretty big
But I got more than money girl)
Cause she hold me down every time I hit her up
When I get right I promise that we gonna live it up
And when the day's gone, I look her picture up
And I say the same thing every single time
I think of you undressed, think of you undressed
Think of you undressed, think of you undressed
You the best I ever had, best I ever had

Starsky and Hutch minus the fuzz
Mild flat boys, hmh-hmh-hmh
That's what you wanna call us anyway
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races
Starsky and Hutch minus the fuzz
Me and Spitta stick together like, huh
Cotton and mud, some chicks counting up buds
Mouth got cotton, prolly from the drugs
Lot of pot in my process, love
Don't hate a nigga cause I'm blessed, judge me by my progress, bruh
I obsess with every dollar I get
Fuck you think we made it out the projects for?
The object is to make money and get the most from it
And more money, cause more money ain't enough of it
I know niggas who had money and let it go to nothing
Just blow money and ain't got nothing to show for it, that’s fucking stupid
Same as my diamonds and the fact I’m buying all this new shit
Made a million a way, a nigga grind’ll be a blueprint
I’m talking champagne shit, Audemar tailor made shit
Look at my jackets, say hand made bitch
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races
And I'm a pimp, see
Leaning in my ride like how Bun B
Sitting tall on my chrome seat but I’m low in the seat
My girl in the sheet fast asleep, I’m in the street
After the cheddar, peddling melodies, purchasing better things
On the road to the riches, I done drove over niggas
My nigga we major, we been major since independent
Made it to what they saying, we made it but we ain't hearing it
We too busy getting it, hound dog sniffing it out
Twisting a whole pound, celebrating the fact that
Them wack fools had it but this here’s the take back
And them haters can’t hate that
Salute me from across a crowded club, homie, I take that as love
Real nigga shit the only thing I’m dealing with slim
Bitch you know that I’m the reason that you still in this club
Get out the corner of my eye and get in this truck
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races
Yelling, "Suck a dick or die hoe"
See your main bitch is my side hoe
Smoking top shelf on the top floor
I’m a boss bitch, I take my time and get it pronto
You probably fucking around
Doing some shit I ain't got time for 
Fuck you and your whole anatomy bitch
My new crib look like an academy bitch
It’s Finally Famous the faculty bitch
Killin’ these niggas, no casualties
Money and weed is a real nigga salary
Man, these rappers sound like me
And honestly that shit is so flattering bitch
 They want me to slip up and fall
Crash, burn, but I just keep pissing them off 
I got movies to make  I got women to call 
I got deals on the table, I can’t be dealing with y’all, nigga
Rather crash parties and burn money 
And if you pick the ashes up, you still can’t earn from me 
Bottom line is I never wait in line bitch
And I’m rolling King Kush, I’m your Royal Highness
They're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it

Kicked up sitting behind a mahogany desk
Crumbling 'erb just as Big Boi and Andre would suggest
Flow sick need a check up

Bad bitches gold digging lame niggas
Out a trip to foreign places or bracelet or necklace
Then slide through the set and fuck the JETS cause she respect us
You think you got a winner but you don't I bet she let us
Pickles, tomatos, onions, mayo, mustard, and ketchup, the works
Driving in a Aquifina truck to the club
Cause Wiz told me that these bitches was thirst
Crash test dummy honey need a helmet cause she jumping head first

Camera lens zooms from a mile away you can smell the fumes
College girls play me in their iPod or Zune
Even bitches with bad attitudes bumping to our tunes
They high maintenance
Give em wings let em fly places
Introduce you to high times, flavors, and sky scrapers
Rolling in lime papers and Randy's
Smoking out somewhere where the sand be
Plan B killing these kids
Not Michael Jackson
I ain't feeling these kids
And you hating such a shame that's where your energy is
I'm in a Gfizz flying
Leave your bitches with the planes now she sky diving
Hella vibing

Lame niggas putting locks and chains on they bitchesWell, I’m gonna make a lot of money 
Then I’m gonna quit this, quit this crazy scene
Well I'm a quit this crazy scene
Cause being famous ain't all what they make it to be
But back then y'all this was my favorite dream
But now, I wouldn't hesitate I would leave
Cause I'mma
Oh, well I guess got problems
I dropped out of school
Ain’t think about college
So my apologies to my mother and father
For bein' stubborn, ever since I was a toddler
Well I'mma quit this crazy dream
Cause when I hit the stage all the ladies scream
And when I pass by they all waving at me
But I be getting tired y'all, pray for me
Oh yeah, you say it could be worse?
Oh here, step into my shoes
Put yourself in my shirt!
I'm only human y'all so we all gotta work
But sometimes I wonder why I even came to this Earth
I'mma
Sometimes I just feel hopeless
Pacin' back and forth, man I can't even focus
That's why I'm always smokin' in the booth recordin'
As my mind races
Like Jeff Gordon
I'mma
It ain't supposed to be so hard
I always said I'd quit if it felt like a job
I'd rather be pissed than pretend that I'm not
And try to play along with the whole facade
I wanna:
It ain't a question to me
Look at me, I know what I'm destined to be
This is spiritual y'all, I'm wrestlin' beasts
But pretty soon, I'll be restin' in peace
I'mma
Come on, y'all actin' like I can't feel you
I can look in your eyes and tell you what you done been through
And I could give a fuck because I got bigger issues
So at this point in my life
How can I get through?
Look
A lot of haters attack but
It's my job to speak the truth on the track
So say what you like, you just givin' me gas
Cause by now, I got enough to drive to Venus and back
So I'mma:
Fuck the money I'm leavin'
I'm goin' back home after I break even
I said what I said so as long as I'm speakin'
B.o.B got the upper hand as long as I'm breathin'

Ain't bout the money, then I'm not involvedAye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll a joint, grab a bong
While I forget it all and get stoned
And I remember back in the day
Before I thought about gettin’ paid
The ladies ain’t wan’ give me no play
The haters ain't have nothin’ to say
They never let me into the club
The radio ain’t show me no love
Gave my all, but it just wasn’t enough
And complaining too, it’s just how it was
And now I’m just posted
With my baddest bitch and we just kick it
In this villa watching pictures gettin' roasted
Vision gettin’ clearer yea she open
But her eyes low, never under the clouds baby we floatin’
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll a joint, grab a bong
While I forget it all and get stoned
I started coming up in the game
And people started knowin’ my name
They tried to put me into that lane
And we had to go our separate ways
Instead of fussin’ and flippin’ out
I did my thing and figured it out
Security trippin' I ain’t puttin' it out
Smokin loud
And all my peoples got champagne, fast cars by the bar wasted
Potent marijuana that aroma make her wanna taste it
Horses in my car, little Louis on my bracelet
When you live just like a star it feels so amazing
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin’
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll a joint, grab a bong
While I forget it all and get stoned
Aye you probably think you know where this is goin'
But this ain’t one of them kinda songs
Somebody roll and let’s get it on
While I forget it all and get zoned

Sink or swim, I'm a hungry shark 
And I want it all, cribs and a foreign car, Audemars 
I could be gone tomorrow 
That's why I grind like it's my last day
Hundred fucking roaches in my ash tray
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
My weed kicks like Jet Li flicks
Test me kid, slap shots like Gretzky hits 
The best kept secret, yes he is
The cat's out of the bag, I puff puff and I pass
You dumb fucks and I laugh, motherfucker, what you hatin' for?
Why you just standin' outside, what you waitin' for? 
I'm blowin' on an eighth or more, touring for my paper, boy
Before I hit the club I need a blunt or two or three or four 
Bad bitches thirsty for stars with mad riches
Wanna ride with 'em, rest they heads on televisions
I don't bag bitches  they hop in, you just follow and
You beg bitches,  you're not a pimp, I was schooled by the
Best of them,  now they cuttin' checks for him
Ain't gettin money then it's probably for the rest of them
Something like a legend when I quote what I wrote 
Be in the big cloud from the blunts that I smoke 
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels good
Now I know I ain't living right
But it feels goodThis shit ain't as easy as it looks nigga
It's way fucking easier
Don't get it twisted bitch
But on some real shit though
Man these niggas don't want it
Riding in the car and the watch cost the same thing
Nigga that's stuntin'
Gettin' all this paper
Got me shittin' in public
That roof with a city view
I did that from nothing
And these niggas gon' keep hating me
But I'm just gonna keep stackin' up
No one thing I'll never change
I talk shit but I back it up
You niggas don't go hard as me
So why the fuck you mad at us
I'm rolling up the bombest weed
The first one wasn't fat enough
Your car don't go fast enough
You don't fly first class enough
You don't do no switching states
You don't do no packing up
All you do is gassin' up
That's why you wasn't past enough
Smokin' weed and crackin' up
All this cheese I'm racking up
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
Get it how I live it
Get it and don't care how I spend it
Swear to god, my credit card ain't got no limit
Time expensive so I spent hundred thousand on my watches
Full of diamonds
I ain't even reached the top and I'm still climbing
I'm still climbing
I'm still rhyming
Filling up papers with chronic
Keeping niggas out the way
Who got the hating shit in common
Let's be honest
Let's keep it real here
My bank is full of commas
I'm talkin' millions
And I got no problems
Spending what I spent yeah
Cause I'm probably
The realest nigga in here
Matter of fact I know I am
And I know my diamonds are frozen
Not to mention my bank overflowin'
And I just can't stop, I keep goin'
See one thing about me
I've always been about mine
As soon as you doubt me
I show you how hard I grind
Yeah I hear they hate me
But they do it all the time
There's no you without me
I know this so I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting go
I'm not letting goAnd the kush became so strong
And the flights became private
And the bread became so long
Fast money and fly whips
We high, don't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach
Now you see why, when we high, can't stop the smoke
And we fly G5, we so far from coach
Smokin' that Buddah fillin'
Blowin' that Kudda illin'
I'm runnin' through the millions
I'm sittin' roofless chillin'
Cooler than a polar bear
They flockin' cause they know it's there
Money gang, money straight
Like Joakim Noah hair
That's no bullshit, game time
Make you niggas change minds
Forfeit, or consume a full clip
Nigga like me eatin' swordfish
With your bitch, watchin' Swordfish
Niggas can't ignore this
You can't afford this - extravagant shit
We Louie Gucci Birkin baggin' this shit
Bag of the piff
Hot-boxin' in the back of the six
With Jimi Hendrix on... immaculate shit
Long way from... Compton
Where we used to, bag it in shifts with mags and the clips
Hurricane, right back on the shit
Back on the block with a package of spliffs
From blowin' cactus, the Wiz, what it is?
Uh, you niggas want kush? We got ounces
Cookies we got pounds, clips we got rounds
Hundred thousand dollars when I skip through your town
Baller shit, don't even want a piece, man, we want all of it
Thirty thousand on the piece where my collar sit
Went so hard in the middle, East don't know what to call this shit
Now I'm buyin' up all the champagne
Drinkin' away all of my problems, bitch
Might sound crazy
But I just left the private plane, promoter paid 100k
And I ain't even stay the whole day
Hit the crib, bought a pound and smoked the whole thing
That Givency Men's collection, copped the whole thing
Not to mention all these diamonds in my gold ring
Made it to the top with nobody knowin'
Niggas say they safe, but nobody's showin'
Man he beats this shit, but nobody flowin'
Old Versace shit, the newest Rick Owens
If I'm rollin' it, you know that it's potent
With The Game and we smokin'
Hah, it's self-explanatory how we get it
Roll the purp in a plane ticket
Stat hop to that money, but I don't ribbit
Post playa ball, nice in the pivot, Jays on but I fuck with Pippin
Kays on when them niggas trippin'
Uh, pools of your partner blood, ya boy stay slippin'
Never tippin', stay sippin'
Court side, Blake Griffin
Stay missin', stackin' fitted while you niggas stay bitchin'
Coka and Boca, the kush of them strokers
Grand daddy and oova, blow that smoke to Jehovah
Four-fifty my motor, use your bitch for my chauffeur
I done Kobe'd the Cobra, Mark Price'd the Rover
T-top in the Trans, hit the gas and it's over
Bitch please, this is how we get them hoes the doja
I got shooters, I know growers from Vancouver
Plus I'm cooler than the cooler at your grandmomma's picnic
Bitch you?
Somethin' chill from Brazil, on the L
With Wiz and Game, my life is like Corona commercials
Family matters, Kevin Love at you Urkles
That's them wolves, niggas
They here to reverse birth you
Murk you, lights out no curfew
Bitch ain't stoppin' 'till my unborn seed's seed is rich
Or 'till Jesus sit right next to me and smoke 'till the seasons switch, my niggaMan, I heard some crazy ass shit about some shit I never heard before. Then I met that bitch. I was like, "damn."

Hit the weed, giggle a little, then you get horny
I hit the weed, get on my mission, and then I'm goin' in
Knowin damn well they got boyfriends
Til they get the front door, asking which floor I'm on
I'm at the top, polo socks and pajamas on
She smoke chronic, know the lyrics to all my songs
It's like I died and went to heaven, me and all my dogs
That's why we sip champaign til the bottles gone
Roll weed on ya, take the bitches, I don't follow y'all

It's real talk what I'm saying to you
I don't wanna wake up, knowing just one thought of you
Got me fallen I can't get up 
So will you co-star with me?
Cuz my life is like a movie
Champagne parties in my hotel
Her friends don't even smoke, but they diggin' the smell
Ex-boyfriend ringin' ya cell
But every effort to save you's to no avail
Nuthin' but starter's on my team nigga coach Phil
And all we do is get high and watch the Adult Swim
Relatively fly like a meteor or spaceship
Party every night, and early morning get wasted
All the way 100 you others niggas are make-shift
Roll that rapper weed, you smoke and don't wanna taste it
Lets face it
She wanna fly where the planes is
Got her testin' out all of my trees, myth blazers
Champagne before we hit the papers
We stay smokin' that la-la-la
Easy rider, joint roller, my 9-5
You can prolly smell it in the car when we ridin' by
More like all the way up, we ain't kinda high
We more than fly, introduce you to the gang members
That's taylor, like blood, no gang members
No names enter, and now you on champagne land
I'm on an island of hard liquor
It be fans, joint lit, and guitar pickers
Goin' nowhere for awhile, I got good snickers
Now you wanna mingle, heard young single
Big face chips baby, stack my pringles
You call it tight, I say well-fit
And we ain't takin' no prisoners, now you jealous
In ya state please make sure the weed great
Fresh produce, purple and green crates
Groove, crisp bills in my jean pants
Telly room prolly doin' the Uncle Snoop dance, yeaLadies and gentleman
My name's Wiz Khalifa and I'm so damn good
I earn niggas respect before the cash came
You try me get a ticket I'm in the fast lane
I keep the bigger picture in the glass frame
Plus my city on my back like it's a motherfuckin last name
Where you goin when the driver know your last name
And first class ain't much different from the last plane
Say we the same but I'm nothin like you guys
Nigga, I'm a frequent flyer Taylor Gang or Drink n Drive
Die...
Now everybody's mourning I think we
Runnin' outta liqour bring some more in
Used to say I'm fresh
But now I'm gettin spoiled
Cause new shit gettin' old
These hotels kind of boring
Don't mean to sound unappreciative
But it's obvious the game ain't what you think it is
Yellow diamons speak spanglish on my neck and wrist

Hey hey hey hey
Don't say you will
You will, you will
Hey hey hey hey 
Please say you will 
For real 
I pray you will 
And they say don't say it 'less you mean it
Back when I was young
I said "I will be the one", people said they couldn't see it
But on the other hand, there was some saying I be this
Nigga on top, soon as you say I'm defeated
T-Pain, they saying they couldn't believe it
Funny 'cause now they say the same thing when they see me
The way I spit you would say I was bulimic
And this beat so hard, I had to say I did a remix
Niggas hate, they don't say it but they think it
When you lame, I can't hear what you saying when you speaking
Another plane, my mother saying "get some sleep in"
I can't, I'm living out what others saying they dream is
Now the hoes say that I'm conceited
'Cause they wanna give me brains, and I say that I don't need it
I'm getting paid and paying so much attention
To what radios playing and what they saying in meetings
I ain't saying I'm that deep in
But I'm saying I got my feet in
In a year they gon' say I'm Michael Phelps
And you gon' think to yourself, before you jump in that deep end
It was said that my city sleeping
Out of state, I had to say what that P meant
"I put on" like Kan' said on that Jeezy
Come to where I live, the kids say I'm like He-Man
Doing everything that you say I can't
Not a stroke of luck, player, you can say I plan
Tired of saying shit to make these niggas understand
So I'll be everything that you say I am
Very strange, yes
You niggas too plain, I'm a Taylor Gang Jet
And my lane's left, I talk money so I save breath
And niggas say I'm lucky, I say that I'm blessed
Every goddamn day
Yeah, and I work hard too
You know, I ain't just pop up out of nowhere
Been doing this shit
Hahahah
T-G-O-D Boiii

Hundreds on the mattress, twenties on the floor
Kids with dirty handguns posted by the door
When I was 14 they used to send me to the store
To bring back blunts, now I'm the one rollin' up
Speakers bump, iPhone plug-in for my truck
E. Knievel, showing you niggas how to stunt
I mess up flows like waves and potholes
West Coast, I fuck hoes and eat Roscoes

Big-face digits, whips ain’t rented
Walk inside the bank bitch I’m Ben Frank friendly
Big cake piled up on my plate shit endless
Throw it in her face watch the bitch make wishes
Walk inside the club, bottles of that liquor
Groupies actin’ up, dying to get a picture
Rose and Patron, Kush be my cologne
Shorty get to keep her weed them joints already rolled
All my diamonds clean, all I count is cheese
Walking on a dream while you tryin’ to intervene
On top of that money, them haters in-between
Smoking sour seem you can smell it on her weave
Smell it when I leave, niggas catching feelings
OG Kush prescription keep me way over the buildin’
Riding in my ride, banging in my system
High as Whitney tryin’ to find a way to get a million
Uh, know I’m smoking sour you can smell it down the hall
Learned this as a youngin’, what you sell could get you far
Captain of my team, tell you how to ball
Ain’t a game I put that on my marijuana jar
Breakfast on the plane, smell like alcohol
Diamonds in my chain, muscle in my car
Live a movie scene, hundred-dollar jeans
Pocket full’a Benji’s give them 20′s to my broad
Always on my job, been about my business
Killing all these rappers off now can I get a witness?
Lying to the judge, flying to the club
Chopper play the barber came to line a nigga up
Heavy in the game, still ain’t had enough
We takin’ all your bitches and buying all the drugs
Couple thousand for the Louis lining in my tub
G’d up from my feet up
Roof to the rug

Yea-hea... it's your boy Mr. Ez-Wider
Principal Ez-Wider to you young man
Here to break down a couple of rules to Flight School
Ya'll niggas ready to fly? Well lets go
Rule #1: You don't smoke unless you choke, you dug?
Lot of ya'll niggas be calling people bitches just for choking on the weed
That means theres some good good in that blunt ya'll, what you smoking on?
Rule #2: Bring enough for your crew
Lot of ya'll niggas just be bringing them little small ass sacks to a whole session talking about I ain't got enough
Get the fuck out of here with that
Thats how you get expelled ya'll
Rule #3: Ain't shit free
Don't ever come to Ez-Wider talking about oh I ain't got no weed but I got some blunts dawg
Thats a quick way to get bounced straight off the plane okay..
Rule #4: Smoke 'till you can't no more
I know sometimes that kush get real good
And you like in a UFC match and you wanna tap out
But hold on player! Hold on! You can do it
And the golden Rule #5 is always stay high
I don't care what kind of green you smoke pimpin'
Sticks and seeds, as long as it's weed you're good with me
And that's Mr. Ez-Wider's five rules to Flight School
Hope you wrote 'em down ya'll
'cuz you'll need them at the end of the year if you plan on graduating
Now we going to get back to some of that Wiz Khalifa

These snakes trying to get with us, they lookin' for the co-sign
But a real nigga don't give a fuck, I'm too busy gettin' high
You can hitch a ride on another truck
Now excuse me as I kiss the sky
Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me bye
She miss me like the sun in her eyes, can't catch a pop fly
Kush castles in the sky

So tonight, from our family to yours. From our home to yours, thank you for joining usI been in my zone 
I just wanna know 
Why you left me in the cold 
Now you're blowin' up my phone 
Only when I get a check, you wanna call me
Every other night, you go out poppin' molly
People think you're nice, but girl you're really naughty
I hit up Santa, had to tell him you're a thotty
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
Uh, got all the papers rolled
Used to be Backwoods, now it's cones
Fuck a DM, I'm slidin' through your home
You sendin' them pics to my phone
You like that I'm well known
But still be hella low
On point, your friends ain't gotta know
Don't go tellin' 'em 'bout my stroke
She might want to find out
Ain't nothin' new, this happens all the time
Pressure break pipes, hit me late night
Ain't the gang, it ain't right, yeah
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in

You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
Finally free, high off the tree
Nigga had a lockdown, she was under siege
Wanna be flyin' places and smokin' in peace
On the runnin' team with my own machine
They ain't comin' close, that's why you puttin' on your clothes
And rushin' out the door when it's over
Nowhere near sober, nigga say he need closure
I just throw another pound your way and hope
Next time I see you, you'll know how to roll
Gang or ain't, nothing at all
You'll never be my wife not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
You'll never be my wife, not me, I want none of that
When I roll the dice, you'll see, I get double that
Everytime I shoot, I'm like DeRozan, it goes in
Thought I took a shot on you, but girl, you were not chosen
I was born a star

I ain't have no pot to piss in now im checking bags
Chief and hash with politicans, helicopter pads
Some hoes to get to know and hella Zags, no tags
I ain't one to brag, but if you ain't trying to hear
About the money drugs and women then I ain't one to ask
Smoke so much that I'm going brain dead
Hoes mad at me cause my phone off until my plane land
I tell her whoa, slow down baby
The Spitta with me, it's enough to go round lady
You drive by, I give her wings Redbull and Jim buckets
A couple of paper planes
Broadcasting my name over Internet airwaves
Bitches hear me on Twitter put my music on there Myspace pages, yeah
If you smoke then roll up and play this
Me and Hot Spitta come where the planes is
She said she wants to sip Clicquot on my living room floor
Smoke weed hang with other famous people I know
Gain access to exculsive places I go
Lavish and dangerous, this the life I chose
But I wouldn't change it for nothing
Sex, money and drugs, runways, sports cars, and luggage
Better to be somebody for one day
Then to be a nobody for your whole life so fuck it
Yeah get the cork out the bottles
Put the purp in the easy wider
Spitta in the house, hide your lighters, I take 'em
A case of mistaken identity
My bad fool I could of swore I brought this one in with me
In the cinnamon interior
Not tinted early 80's box Chevy with a Crate engine
Hijacking your women, you left her unattended
Dr. Jekyll and Mr. Fly when I'm on that liqour
The way of the samauri, I got my chi centered
Sharp as blades, these bars I lay
Forever the player and never played
I slay them bitches I never save
Bomb ass trees they get blazed
Palm trees we use them for the shade
What else can I say I got it made
Like I had it built, Taylor Gang or get killed, yeahDetain the  boss, maybe it's ’cause these 'fits I been gettin' off
Cardo got wings
Okay
You niggas still lost
Uh
Tryna detain the boss
Maybe it’s 'cause these 'fits that I'm getting off
Outfits, murder one, I ain't killin' 'em soft
Big crib, that's a mansion and not a loft
I ain’t never falling off, won’t take part in that
Some niggas get money, don't know how to react
Ain’t a million dollars, my name ain't on the contract
She ain't a boss, you can have her back
I'm where her loft at
Smoking out, playing my favorite songs
Let her hit the weed and she sing along
Pink diamonds, Rolexes telling the time
And if I wanna make a movie, she gon’ tag along
I ain't one for boasting and bragging
I'm the type to put it in my raps, you find out that most of it happened
You smell the smoke, you know it's the captain
Bring in the bottles, I roll 'em and pass 'em
When I wake up in the morning
I'm rollin' up the weed and I'm thinking 'bout you
And what we gon' do, yeah
I might take you back to my home
Smoke all them joints and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And what we gon' do
I got it legalized
And now it's me and my homies when I need to fly
My money a bigger size
And if she ain't coming home tomorrow, I'm the reason why
For my team, down to ride, you see it in my eyes
Thirteenss on the side, my trees crystalize
'Bout the life to live, I ain't missing mine
Leave it all for my kid
I can hear 'em hatin' from the distance
The world's filled with all kinds of paper, I'm tryna get it
Treat her so good that she think of me when I'm finished
Going so hard they just wait for the intermission
But I ain't never letting up
Never rushing my moves
I just wait for them to slack off, giving me the perfect opportunity
Then I set 'em up
Chain cold as the weather in December
This that G.O.A.T. flow, I know you remember
When I wake up in the morning
I'm rollin' up the weed and I'm thinking 'bout you
And what we gon' do, yeah
I might take you back to my home
Smoke all them joints and I'm thinkin' 'bout you
And what we gon' do
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I tell her what I  do
Yeah
I tell her what I do, do
Yeah, yeah, I tell her what I do
Yeah, yeah, no, no, I tell her what I doPushin' your buttons, you ain't sayin' nothin'
That's an understatement
Grabbin' my keys and walkin' out, you takin' me places
Hidin' my weed
I text you before I leave that I'll be back but you ain't hearin' that
All you've been hearin' is my car steerin'
Smokin' weed all night with my friends
Hangin' out, you waitin' up for me to come in to the door
And it ain't like you don't want this anymore
But it's some shit that need worked on
Like each and every night I need to work
Tell me I need to slow shit down to make some time for her
That's when the drama start
You sayin' shit like you ain't got a heart
I'm walkin' around like I ain't got a problem

Them other niggas did you wrong and now I'm the one
Yeah right, look at what they did, now look at what I did
Not to mention I was the most faithful nigga in existence
But when it goes down that's how they flip shit
I'm too high, too lifted
Too fly, too gifted

Wanna get high you should come to my spot then
And smoke with some heavyweight niggas
Jets, Taylor Gang nigga losing's not a option

And everywhere I go people asking what I'm rocking
I tell em this is next year's fresh and this year's best
And some shit you niggas not in, so quit copyin'
Yeah man
You niggas got it confused, trying to do what we do
That's not the point
The point is for you to do you
It's a beautiful thing
I'm in the regal, you in a rut
Stuck, can't come up
Old, jealous niggas hatin' on us
Bitches is wishin' you'd shut the fuck up
I'm in the position, set my niggas up tough
What the fuck, just jump
Continents I promise it
I could go from bucks to billions in a minute
Made a split second decision
Executed with precision
I feel attention when I walk in the room
Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman
Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure
I could help you shine like a jeweler
Candy paint make an old whip newerThis the top?
Oh yeah, the tippy
It’s young Khalifa, man
Yeah
I see it clearly, the money that is
Oh, ya’ll niggas ain’t in the way
Keep doing what you doing
See right through you, yeah
Got me drinking out the bottle
Living for today, ain’t thinking about tomorrow
Niggas fake, I can see it with my eyes closed
In desperate need of a leader so they follow
And me, I only see Chavo
I roll a bleezy and hit it like a high note
My skin tough as a rhino’s
So keep hating, I keep dating these dime hoes
Diamonds on my neck
Got diamonds on my chain, yeah
City or your state
Catch me mobbing with my gang and
Nigga violated, they won’t hesitate to aim
And I got enough change
To afford the price of fame
I’m like poison to ya’ll lames
Or drugs with prescriptions
Turn my music on, get a buzz when you listenin’
You want ‘em then pay for ‘em
And niggas talk fly, but I’m space gone
Up out of here
I never sleep, but I got big dreams
A little nigga, I do big things
You know it’s everything that it seems
They say my life is like the big screen
Big screen
I fill my bank with every 16
My money straight and my bitch mean
You should wait and get a ticket please
They say my life’s like the big screen
Big screen
I feel like a desperado
On the track I just kick it like Rallo
See me on the TV
Yeah, I be in grind mode
But please believe
I’m in the streets like potholes
Antonio, no guitar though
Only instrumental is that pistol
Need a right hand so I fucks with Chevy
And underneath the wing so I hustle heavy
Tatted on my face, chest, neck, hands, stomach
Been on a paper chase since that cake start runnin’
Never touched a brick, I ain’t never slung a drug
Still get a feeling when I see that gold car comin’
Got my pops old soul, I’m a 80’s baby
Moms smoke hella weed, I’m a wavy baby
You mister me too and you need fuel, man
You niggas see through, air
 x2All I ever wanted was lights, camera, action
People staring at night, cameras flashin'
Living the movie not prepared to see the last scene
All I want is the pretty women for the casting
Won't confront him, put your money where your mask is
You a chump, talk guns, but scared to blast his
Buy them bottles by the case, we don't gotta chase
For the love of money, we in a million dollar race
Windows done tinted, niggas hate em, but I fish bowl
So I can let your ho see me while I'm in it, yeah
See I ain't got a deal
But everybody know that I ain't kinda real
I'm hundred dollar bill authentic, yeah
Hotel room, marijuana's in it
Chevy watchin' the game, your bitch she rollin' me planes
Passport payin my dividence for the fame
Mind in the gutter, you niggas ain't in my lane
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me
The money's got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes, the cars and clothes, living life is all I know
I found my lane and I won't change for nothing
There's only one way to go
Now they cop the mixtapes and watch my videos
Maybe cause I got bars like a serial... code
Louie pouch full of pre-rolled
Mouth full of kush, mind on my zero
Hoes always thought I was cute but wouldn't speak though
Now they see me they be jocking on my steelo
On a private ride higher than a ski slope
I'm just flyin', haters try and cut my wings though, whoa
Now they see us and wanna be us
I'm partyin' poppin' bottles
With models to meet and greet us
Fuck her, follow, and then retweet us
In the sky, so my nigga keep up
]
I don't know where this road will go, cause my life is crazy 
But I ain't changin', baby 
This is not the life I chose, but it's the life that chose me
The money's got me everywhere that all these hoes be
And they can't talk crazy cause they don't know me
Cause if you know me, I'm out here dreaming
The party hoes, the cars and clothes, living like it's all I know

The hardest regardless of what you dudes say, truthfully
Who are you to me? money talks was taught to speak fluently
It's nothing new to me, sometimes it takes three blunts to get through to me
It only took me months to get through the streets
But when you got beats and your lyrics are dumb hard
Nobody gotta let you in the game you just bombard
Yeah but niggas are gon hate though
No matter who you are there's another wanting your place bro
Mind on cash roll the grass and fade slow
Learn fast to mow the grass, the snakes low
A look past the love some niggas ain't sure
Made me my own man now I do my grown man
More advanced a young’n nearly in the game
Shit looking better now, but I remember the rain
Rain
I still remember the rain
I still remember
Feeling slept on knowing I'm the best songwriter or freestyler
I'll bite a nigga's head off
The flow was ill before I inked the deal
I signed cause a flow like mine needs a mill
I grind for real, and that’s no days off
You work hard for it and it's gon pay off
You can rap, even work a j-o-b
Or duckin' the policeman, when cars tryin' to pump weight off
See I was taught to get it how you live
Niggas know Wiz has been about his bread
In the stu I'm a beast, I can speak to 'em all day
In high school, have what you need in the hallway
Stuff long dutches with raw haze
Attention is nothing new, it's true I've been that nigga always
"So what you saying?"
Remain the same with fame I gained, it's good now but I remember the rain
Yeah I remember the rain!Back to back to back to back
At your bitch ass

Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh

Now we hit the club in a small T-shirt
Hoping that somebody will notice him

I step on stage and they say he's going in
Four hoes tryna leave with me and the motorman
I'm blunt roasting
On a cloud just coasting
Shift once, and I'm speeding
On my way, outer space
A couple niggas in this race

Drive a space ship sweetie, not a car
Come on dog, we ain't gotta wait for the weekend
I'll hit the West Coast and be back for the weekend
Swag
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, oh
I'm living life fast
Some tell me slow down but I continue speeding
The New York nights, Miami beaches, and Hollywood hoes
I'm fresh out the air so you won't see me there
Unless I'm weeded
That's all I know
Oh, oh, ohHello, how are you?

You should already know, I be lost and turned out
When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out
I got three cellphones, plants gettin' grown
I hit the studio, still in my zone
I got six cars chilliin' at home
And four on the way, smoke weed every day
A bad broad, I don't pay to play
She in love with Khalifa, man

When I wake up, gotta bake up
Everyday countin' paper lost and turned out
No matter the case, we gotta get this cake
I'm never at home, I'm in and out of state
Arguing on the phone, tell the room service bring me a plate
I'm rolling a joint, I'm gon' be kinda late
Real niggas relate, bitch ass niggas anticipate
The day that my bank disintegrate
Put me up with the greats
Let's look at my calendar, fill 'em dates
First class ain't a bed, the nigga wait
For all my Kush & Orange Juice fans
People who'v been rockin' with me since day one
Khalifa and Cardo
This somethin' just for you guys
Rolling Papers 2 on the way
But while you guys wait, man, get really really high
We gon' do the same
Roll up a plane, take it straight to the brain
Every part of the day, I be

Shout out to the gang, it's Taylor Gang over and over and over
Until it's over but it ain't ever gon' be over man
Y'all niggas gon' die before we start countin' this paper
I swearYeah
Some old school shit
When uhh, you be at the lunch table
This that right here
Uh yeah
I put my team on
Now we in the game
But I remember days when I ain't have no one to lean on
I learned to hold my own
They sayin' the skys the limit
Take a hundred dollar bill and make a paper plane
And try to make a name
And when you're done giving your all
You give your everything
You got what it takes
I told the world my song
They lovin' it
You can't tell me nothin', cause my whole clique's stuntin'
Boy wassup
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
So where you goin', your life's on a road
From the party to the plane and your name's in the light show
You find your way back home
Away from all the pressure and that women tryin' to stress you
Find a new one
You've reached a new phase
They got you lookin' at tomorrow like a new state
And not a new day
To some it may seem wrong
But fuck it, cause I'm good weed puffin'
And my whole team stuntin'
Boy wassup
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah
Then I hop up out the bed
Grab my iPhone
Put some kush in the swisher
Roll one up
When you live the star life
Gotta go hard, so you workin' all night
Sleep when the sun come up
Yeah, yeah
Ha, ha, ha
Yeah
OkayFresh off the plane
Pittsburgh pimpin' blew up and now he got his own strain
Diamond everything
We tired of paying for it so we put it in our name
To the top, but where we came from is way different
Been a boss and gon' remain
Know the cost, I can't complain
I'm back and rolling joints bigger than ever
The more time I take, the better I get
The more chains I cop, the wetter she get
All bullshit aside but never forget
Heard boss shit before but never like this
Blowing O's in my whip
Writing flows, bringing pounds where we ain't supposed to
But they don't even trip
Name on the list, we don't wait 'til it come out
Might buy every one so they don't exist
Rollie on the wrist
Competition try and miss
Diamonds on my fist
Gotta rock the coldest 'fits
Glad you noticed, never seen nothing like this so they focus
Mixing my new shit with my old shit
White diamonds on gold
We fell in love with how the money fold
Hundred millions I done sold, changed souls with the stories I told
Take it as a compliment when them younger niggas tell me that I'm getting old
That mean my money mature
Villas on shores, having conversations with billionaires
Skip the awards, we already there
Just keep the chronic smoke in the air
Model chick with long hair wearing weave cause it's easier to maintain
My niggas come from hunger pains
Now we all rocking two or three chains, Versace everything
Spilling our drinks, pulling out minks
Live a life that's as real as you think
It take a lot to keep a crew alive
Really socialize
Beef shit, we don't vocalize
Keep it in overdrive
Come through and catch a vibe
Bitches is over fine
G's up, stay cheesed up, smoke it then re-up
It takes a lot to keep a crew alive
From counting twenties and fives
To private jets when we flying
They can't believe us
It take a lot to keep a crew alive
So we keep the bottles on ice
Staying down, still cursin' to Jesus 
So if I tell you something, I meant it, man
I'm not just doing this shit for my motherfucking health
I ain't got time to waste
You know that old ass saying, "Time is money?"
Well I got a whole lot of money
And I don't got a whole lot of time
So don't mind me if I change that up
Let me sit
Paper been sitting up, just collecting dust
Though my Bentley clean as fuck, super sharp
Your bitch got cut, you mad but
You need to analyze the game that you laid
Had hella cracks in the frame, foundation was weak
She peeped early you was a lame
And proceeded to deplete your change
Smoking weed with my gang
Track suit tailored to feature my watch and bracelet
My reputation speak for me, I don't really say shit
Killer whales tip the scale, major sales
They praying that we fail though the real prevail
The illest niggas
Them haters really just wishing they could kick it with us
I swear that's why they so mad
Chevrolets candy painted, laid on the Ave
Hitting switches, drag the ass, sparking like a lighter
Million dollar rap writer, full time low-rider
A New Orleans East Sider
All my weed designer, all my hoes'll open fire
YeahMe, I'm ridin' clean, smokin' good, can barely keep my eyes open
Listenin' to my favorite song, leanin' in my car chokin'
Tell my dawg to 'hit this weed,' feel like I'm finna pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Half out, a half ounce, some shit I never seen in life
Said that once he bagged it, smelled so bad, he had to bag it twice
I told him 'roll that shit up', this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'mma satellite
I roll em' very nice
With smoke comin' out the end like a muffler, got game from the hustler
Never said I'm gon' quit, can't get enough of good weed in my lungs
Plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just starin' sayin' nothin'
I flick ashes, got big stashes
So I don't need a dime, I got big baggage bitch !
Yeah, I blow it by the zip
Anywhere I go, it's on the road, on every trip
Ask my nene, love her grandson, but she know that I'mma trip
Got my habit from this ?, smokin' roaches gettin' lit
Now I feel my blunt with so much weed, they say 'that all ain't gon' fit'
On some highly grown shit, with a hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush and a precisely rolled spliff
Hot as . . . ? Pole's Bic
On the way to see Marcella's,
Girl I'm in another world and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know, he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
Feel like I'm Soul Plane
I smoke the whole thing
Pound or O.Z
Kush fiend, Purple, Master, OG
And every nigga that grow weed should know me
My leather so soft, my swishers so sweet bitch !Cardo got wings
Uh, rolling 'em fat, don't roll 'em skinny no more
I'm getting mines, I got plenty of dough
I break it down, I got plenty to smoke
I'm with a dime piece
Stuffing cones
Watching new videos
Watch my digits grow
Now I'm on cause I'm getting low
Spread love, take some weed on the road
Teach my son how to be a boss
Never mind the cost
But never try to spend it if you don't got it
Instead of withdrawals, make deposits
Try to make a profit
Never mind the hate cause where I'm from, we've seen it all
Seen niggas rise, seen niggas fall
Ain't pick up when they get the call
Now they stuck, they look at me different
'Bout my business
Inner circle with winners
Thousand dollar-dinners
Still smelling like bomb-ass weed soon as we enter
Rolling 'em joints, looking like arms when they've been injured
Flying, show 'em, they all get the picture
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She on my team 'cause the Coach better
I be the flyest nigga at Coachella
I be the highest nigga at Coachella
Bad chick ride with me to Coachella
She on my team cause I coach better
Lucky I don't pull the yellow car out
Niggas talking trees but we smoking better
Homie, I'm a vet
Hope you don't get upset
Cop the new Viper demon and the Hellcat
Now where your muscle cars at?
Come to these broads, give 'em heart attacks
Love my fans, I'll always be they favorite artist
And plus, my team go the hardest
We smoking on it if it's Cali green
Was once the newest nigga on the scene
And now we ten years deep
Roll you a joint, just don't fall asleep
All my niggas eat
All my diamonds speak
Might be out the country, never really out of reach
Tryna get paid several days out the week
And there ain't nothing these lames can do about it
Throwing my gang, they just probably mad cause they girl shouted
I pull the paper planes out, put a couple new diamonds in my chain
Don't know 'bout you, fool, but Imma do my thing
Nigga, this gang

Still watch for undercovers
Like, I'm just on the sheet
Money make me feel complete
See, you don't do this everyday
That mean you can't compete
I'm on top of the game
But I came from underneath
Never tame me, I'ma beast
Watch my change increase
Used to just show up
But now I make them pay them fees
Used to smoke blunts
Now I need the paper
Being broke ain't in my nature
Either block out what they say
Or use the talk as motivation

My niggas ain't bluffin' wit' you, that choppa gon' erase ya!Uh the club lite turn to sunrise
You know I still ain't done right
Skip my place and take you to yo crib
Im trynna roll a mega joint, raid yo fridge
You got the ps3 you love yo kid
Ima play his shit since he not here
And I still got a fetish for other niggas hoes
Still keep the tooth brush in my car
With some basketball shorts and a charger for my phone
You never know what will happen, spontaneous action
In the city of the Mardi Gras parades and gun clappin, quarterbacking
Not the center but I'm snapping bongs
Shorty don't be smoking like that she grown
Leon Phelps, Hugh Hef grotto flow
Boogie nights at the roxbury, Which way should we go huh?
6 in the morn'
But I don't wanna go home
So im driving from the club alone
Hoping one of these hoes answer they phones
Yeah, 6 am chicks we slay them
Knowing favorite songs picks we play them
I ain't on some oh I'm just some big star shit, but tell you I sure afford it
My lifestyle, all the visuals are gorgeous
Spend nights out couple bitches at the fortress
Got all these lil hoes addicted, cause if it ain't broke then its rich bitch
I'm ridin' in my ride getting lifted
Thinkin' which chick I'ma Bruce Lee kick with
I roll another joint then start my mission
And hella watch her watch my prevision
Need a nigga that don't care what it cost him
Say you scared of heights but admit the view is awesome
And the weathers great, roll another plane, celebrate
And I'm in the sky so she ask me how I'm flyWe was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you
Higher than a bird hopping out the flying spur like I need a parachute
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you
In the concrete jungle where they ain’t afraid to hustle and they ain’t scared to shoot 
Where was you when I ain’t have a pot to piss in
Where was you when my homie came up missing
Where was you when I was out here on the clock
I can tell you this you waddn’t on the block
But its alright I hustle all night
You be smoking shit you be all hype
Mane that shit was vicious how can I forget it
Pushing all these chickens tryna get a ticket
I might leave a trail cause my swag drippin’
All this shit you talking bout you know I live it
I’m LeBron with the vision, nigga you a witness
This Jordan on my chain bigger than a midget
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you
Higher than a bird hopping out the flying spur like I need a parachute
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you
In the concrete jungle where they ain’t afraid to hustle and they ain’t scared to shoot 
Where the fuck was you nigga, when I was a young nigga
I done held guns for niggas, that was fun for my niggas
Smoking weed in the trap living comfortable nigga
If the police came we would run from them niggas
Couple niggas start snitching, we ain't fuck with them niggas
Gotta problem we pull up with a truck full niggas
I’m a boss I ain’t nothing like these other lil niggas
Got no trust for them niggas, got no love for them niggas
If this was back in the day we’d bust on them niggas
I ’ont argue in the street I don’t fucks with no nigga
We find out where we could meet then we jump on a nigga
And they do that shit for cheap, so its nothing lil nigga
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you 
Higher than a bird hopping out the flying spur like I need a parachute
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you 
In the concrete jungle where they ain’t afraid to hustle and they ain’t scared to shoot 
I might have a actress laying on my mattress
I ain’t with that talking bitch I’m bout that action
Call me uncle sam cause you know I’m taxing’
Yo bitch swallow my seed but you ain’t in my bracket
Please don’t get me twisted just because I’m rapping
I can send a hit out on you like a tackle
I could show you how to cook ‘em up and wrap ‘em
I could tell you bout that Mac and I ain’t talking Apple
Cause I can get you knocked off for no charge nigga
You gone take it in the chest like a charge nigga
I swear that street shit get my dawgs charged nigga
You say you can get me right but what you charge nigga
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you 
Higher than a bird hopping out the flying spur like I need a parachute
We was out there on the curb tryna’ get it where was you 
In the concrete jungle where they ain’t afraid to hustle and they ain’t scared to shoot 
Lemme chirp these fools
I can barely hear you, no wonder I can’t see you
I landed the jet and went and bought a bald eagle
I’m on tour with niggas from my hood thats my people
And they used to push the rock like Memphis Bleek and Beanie Sigel
I ain’t see you when I ain’t have a whip to get around
You wasn’t with me at the bottom, I’m not fuckin' with you now
Ran into a young nigga say he look up to me
Juicy drop that new shit you gon' fuck up the streets
Bought to fuck up a check, and then I’m off for a week
Met a bitch at the Versace store and fucked her to sleep
When I’m finished with her I’mma drop her off where I found her
And I wake up every morning to the sound of money countersHigh school nigga
And they tryin get the smoke from out of the booth
Haha..But they're not doing a good job naw they ain't!
Oh oh oh oh oh oh
My grades getting low but I’m still getting high
I might fuck around and say some crazy shit right there keep going
The might seem slow but time still going by
Hey oh I forgot to mention my girlfriend tripping
And my homies ain’t acting the same
Well, as long as their papers ain’t grinders i’m taking my time
And i’m roll my weed, and take one to the brain
Hook:
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded
My money been kind of funny
But i’m still getting fly
And i’m I don’t’ got the best whip but them hoes still jump inside yeah yeah
Oh and I forgot to mention my best friend trippin
And i’m doing all that I can
Hey as long as there papers and grinder i’m stayin in my ground
There’s gonna be haters outside i’m just tryin to take my shine
And that ain't part of the plan
Hook:
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loaded
I guess if you insist I will
I'm a twister feel mista feel good to ya
I got it if ya need it and you kno I will
And this is after school so we gon go until
The janitor, handed her, a pack of that
Righteously she brought it all back to mac
So I'm a do it back to back, got her fat
Bags are packed, posted by the cafeteria
Eatin on a snack, boy I make it crack-a-lack
Days goin to my nights, live a young wild life
King of the zoo
Devin what it do
Knockin all trees down, Devin and Mac with the sac
Rollin up with knees down, baby girl ease down
It's a holiday, we smokin pot today
I got alot to say, I keep it locked away
That's how it is
Dealin with the pressures of my school life
Livin on the edge, joints to the head
And so the man said...
I keep one rolled yeah I'm always puffin
Yea I stay baked cause nigga I love it
Had nothing but now we stuntin'
Tell em roll something cause nigga it's nothn
Niggas gettin mad cause my pockets swollen
And everywhere I go yea I'm loadedI work hard for everything, so why not salute?
They say a grind pays baby, all I got is proof
And a Swedish broad badder than my main bitch
Cigarillo rolled, you smell it when it ain’t lit
She don’t cook well, but she give me sweet brain
Make a rapper turn singer like T-Pain
Got her stayin’ up late; wakin’ up, bake
And to think this the life that I chose?
Arguing with attendants who’ve shorted my flight clothes
And every girl I fuck, feel like her boyfriend might know
Smokin’ all this weed as it smells, my weed come in barrels
Fuck wit bitches who fiend for Gucci and need her Chanel
Nigga, I’m higher off life so my eyes low
Can’t wait to see what’s in the future but I drive slow
And wait for the picture
Hated, now they say I can’t miss like mister
All of this smokin’
Oh you, got me thinkin’
And all of this dreamin’, I’m supposed to
Live life like, the weekend
Don’t know where I’m goin’
Cause I’m gone, On to
Show you succeeding
Yeah I’ve been livin’, Smokin’
Smokin’ Dreamin’ Livin’
I go to sleep with a picture of a Porche on my wall
Nigga I’m tryna come up on ya’ll
Pop the trunk n front him my car, in front of your broad
She reconsidering her decision to fuck wit ya
I think it because of the
Possibility of kickin it courtside, ringside, front row of anything
Livin my life simultaneously in this dream
Shit goin so good I swear
Airplanes stack change wit the gang, Taylor
Wings spread over cities, leave shadows everywhere
I care less about industry mingling
Niggas was WWF wrestlers, court jesters and cross dressers
I got them cross-trainers, Nike, SB
Niggas can’t fill my shoes I’ma nicer MC
I had a dream that I caked up
Tried to roll a joint, and count a million when I wake up
JETS, Nigga!Yeah

My eyes low, still paying attention
Ball hard, illest in my division
Better than all the competition
Set shot, puttin' my wrist in
Don't ball hard, learn how to dish it
Good from up close or distance
Make a million dollars in an instant
You get it all if you stay persistent
Now foreign countries, we be paying visits
Speaking of paying, lately, I've been playing with digits
So much coming from these words, it's making 'em nervous
Ain't a thing by chance, everything you see on purpose
Stayed down, became a boss, stayed real and observant

Stick to the code, everything go as planned
Need in advance, straight biz
Won't give you a chance to hit us with that song and dance
Fifteen hundred dollars on some pants
I get the same chicks with some cut-off shorts and a pair of Vans
Pull up, ask her what she got planned
We pull off as fast as we can
Car so fast, hope you see it again
I usually be with fam, usually be stacking them grands
Built it all with my hands, run it back and replay it
Went from students in the game
Now me and my brother run the faculty, wrap around balcony
Painting in the living room look like a masterpiece
Rollin' up them joints, that's a thou' a piece

Got a crib without the lease, I get a plate, my niggas feast

Spend money when ya moneys this long
Real street niggas ain’t no clone

Drank lean rose patron
Smoking on thousand dollar worth of strong
When the club bout to hear this song?
Got Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Got Racks on racks on racks
Got Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Racks on racks on racks
Nigga ain’t even tryna hold back
Got a car lot my garage
Got a condo down near the stars
I’m geeked up off them bars
Got a car ain't even gotta park
No keys push button start
She ain’t a dime I won’t get hard
Got hoes that need a green card
Say Ima dog but I dont even bark
Got em biting this swag like sharks
One hit I’ma knock it out the park
Trap beat so goddamn hard
Got Kush, Got Lean, Got barre
Got remix hard as scale
Got bricks don’t need no scale
I’m plugged in with the mail
I’m part of the cartel
Got rerock ain’t no cling
6 two hundred for a nin
Then fuck it all up on jeans
I’ma true religion fiend’
Got bands in the pockets of my jeans
Need a kickstand way I lean
Promethazine fiend
Stamped on sprite and lean
Racks on, racks off
See that blonde strip when my hats off
Looking at my rollie, bout 30 grand what that cost
Smoke like I’m in Cali, fuck, take a flight, i’ll blast off
Niggas talkin tattoos, we should have a tat off
Got racks on racks on racks, naps on naps on naps
Just made a mill, count another mill so put that on top of that
Way back in 2004 I told them it was a wrap
Now my life ain't my life no more I told you niggas its a wrap, eww
You claim you a dog, my nigga, I’m the vet
We can’t even talk unless you cut the check
I guess thats why all these niggas get mad
They say fuck a young nigga, fuck a young nigga
I know theres some girls in the crowd right now who wanna fuck a young nigga, ya
I roll one and roll another one bigger, niggas thinking they sick well I’m sicker
Ima smoke my weed, and ima drink my liquor
Better make sure you fuck your girl right before I dick her…. down
Y’all know I keep them racks
I stay counting them stacks
Ya girl won’t leave me 'lone
One fuck now she attached
Flow hot don’t need no match
Sell work don’t pay no tax
I’m turnt up to the max
Don’t even know how to relax
I drank so much that lean
Had to wake up on a bean
Got racks all in my jeans
Man busting out the seams
Got kush all in my lungs
Get High like cheech and chong
800 a zone I ain’t blowin unless it strong
Catch hell on my iPhone
Catch mine and then I’m gone
The girl won’t leave
I can not take her home
I’m gone on them bars
Bitch I’m not a star
I’m driving foreign cars
Strapped up no bodyguardsWe still at it mane
Ain't never lost a step
Take some of the low end out of my voice
Put some delay on there
Make your money don't let it make you
I learned that if you work hard it's funny where it'll take you
Probably roll you one up and bake you
I'm constantly on my job to see what's on my plate
Did it all without getting thank you I'm holding rank, rollin' dank
Porsche Carrera, 9 11, rollerskatin' see the city through my drapes
So what a tape
Smoke good weed to compliment my brain, ripped jeans to compliment my J's
I grind weed to put it in a j, on magazines and that center stage
What you make in a year I'm get in a day
Drink my fears away, work hard so I blew all my peers away
I'm smokin' strong to clear my brain, thankin' god I'm here today
Just long as my niggas safe, and all of my business straight
I'ma be able to move, cop some land and renovate
Plus I'm about to have a son, so I have to demonstrate
How to always stay real when the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but you still feel like you got none
When the world giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
When the world giving you fake it ain't hard to stay real
Niggas say they gon' run up on you believe they will
I'm from Pittsburgh where they kill and they deal
Young niggas itchin' to pop a nigga like a pain pill
Don't even mention the homicide outside it's way real
Some of my niggas is dead, in jail, or tryna' make bail
Young nigga listen told him stay out the streets he chill
Got a little older keep saying he won't, he will
Got shot a lil' bit ago now it's poppin' when I see him I just talk to him
Roll some weed up tell him 'bout shit that he don't wanna be
What can happen to the act if he don't wanna clean
The life he live the consequences he don't wanna see
The game's over, rich icon, chain smoker
The watch face cold, like it was playin' poker
Pot grower, party not-goer
Always not sober, shades on my face when the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Cause it ain't 'bout having a lot, it's 'bout you having some
Cause you could have it all but feel like you got none
When the world's giving you fake, fake, fake, fake, fake
Ya man
There's a lot of fake shit that the world got to offer
Fake niggas, fake jewerly, fake weed, fake friends
Fake cars, fake clothes

They don't even touch the paper 'cause they old news
Young nigga wanna be like me
Front but he don't even like me
She all up on me like icing
My chain in the color of lightnin'
I got hella paper
Said this goin' down, she fucked me in the elevator
They don't make 'em like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
Prolly watch me, like me 
Tryna be just like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
Prolly watch me, like me 
Tryna be just like me 
Go ask your chick just how I'm mobbin', she ain't feelin' you 
She talk too much, I told her give this dick an interview 
And she a project bitch so she ain't got no manners
She know what the fuck she want so them hoes can't stand her
She know I'm ballin', I ain't callin', that's your man's job 
Hands free when she suck it, keep her hands off
She just a thot, I get the top and then I smash off
My chain and watch, they do the wop and that's a dance off 
Look we got pistols too  'cause we got issues too 
But she just fuck the stick, she know I'm comin' through
Uh, hold a baby, ain't no runnin' plans
Chopper City on my way, you know just how I'm comin'
They don't make 'em like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
Prolly watch me, like me 
Tryna be just like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
They don't make 'em like me 
Prolly watch me, like me 
Tryna be just like me Yeah, yeah
Yuh, jets nigga now where haven't we...
Bitches, I 'Taylor Gang' that
Yuah
Yuaah
How fly, uh?
The backseat is for newborns
Homie, I'm grown
I'll hop in front and drive this bitch on my own
Out the driveway windows half raised
Bumpin' Ma$e or some Sade'
Chuckin' the deuces to my neighbors
Like them Houston players
Got the two door Caprice
Black and red, like a Sega Genesis
Password first pimpin' or you can't get into this hangar
Access denied, you can't fly you a lame
Spiderman tangled in a web of lies
Global travel, red eyes
Plan plots, strategize
Double XL, now I'm after The Source and the Vibe
Only magazines yet to recognize in 2009
Nigga worth it, he deserve it
He ain't perfect, but he workin' on that second album
Dropped the first one with Amalgam
Digital dollars, afford flights
Where the massages will be provided
By my down ass exotic dancing Italian goddess
The planes got it
That's why she's ridin' with the pilot
Find Spitta smoked out in the same crowd
Where Waldo was spotted
Orange rectangle boxes in my pockets
Niggas on a quest like Jonny and Hadji
Haha, yeah
How fly?
The mixtape it's officially done
This is it, right here
Haha, yeah, uh
I'm back better than ever
No hiatus, just weed crushers
Rollers, and one and a half wide papers
Catch me and Spitta smokin' up
You got trees? Nigga, light it
I heard this is a weed friendly environment
Seen 'em at my shows front row, gettin' excited
They all smoke and memorize my lines
Say I'm the tightest
Know bitches who rep the gang hard as niggas who do the same
And don't support the bullshit they only do the planes
In every city we smokin' like a train
They heard I'm swingin' past now them bitches gettin' gas, octane
Not a name to compare 'em to
I can skydive, no parachute
With just a dope pair of shoes
Zig zags and hella tattoos
Put you in a mindstate
That this is my movie
Put you in it too
The bomb weed make it critical
Sit with the vampire in his interviewCardo got wings
Bong rips before Benihanas
You need to come with me and unwind
Be there in a nick of time
We pull up and skip the line
You could order what you want, girl, it's just fine
I ain't gotta say it twice
You the type to play your cards right
Leave your homegirls and stay out all night
Get excited when you find out the price
Love me like your first piece of ice
Or your favorite pair of Nikes
Either scenario, I'm what you wearing
Style no comparing
Ain't care so it's nothing for you to share them
I'll hit you when my plane landing
Pay you a visit when I can
And when I see you don't be acting different
Through with them losers, now you back to winning
No, you don't need no man
Girl, you get it on your own
And we don't need no drugs
We already in our zone
Oh, you got it right back
Right back, right back
Right back, right back
Oh, you're back to winning
Oh, back to winning
Yeah, yeah
We built this so I'ma stand on it
Ain't right 'less me and my man own it
Know the bottom because we came from it
And they surprised 'cause we planned on it
Confrontation, never ran from it
Million dollar conversations, product placement
Trying to keep up but they out of date
Out of breath, out of line, all the way out of shape
Now they hate
If I roll it up it gotta be great
Bank account look like what the lottery say
Any time of day
Put a couple low-riders in your face
Wan' go, but she probably stay
Running game how it ought to be played
Ten years, ain't nobody take a shot at me
If it ain't cruise life, don't try to ride with me
One in the back, one on the side of me
In and out like a robbery
And the eyes never lied to me
No, you don't need no man
Girl, you get it on your own
And we don't need no drugs
We already in our zone
Oh, you got it right back
Right back, right back
Right back, right back
Oh, you're back to winning
Oh, back to winning

Flying topless, the plane got no roof
I'ma shine till my name in the sky
I'ma ball hard and break all the rules
Graduated and hopped in that coupe
With my main girl now I gotta say bye to you
I can count up a mil on a bad day
She ain't down then she ain't got no use
By the way that she making that ass shake
I just told baby do what she do
She the type I got to search for
Wasn't handed to me, had to work for it
They riding the wave like a surf board
While the boy hotter than the earth core
Told her wait til' I go get my cash right
When the money was low she didn't act right
Caught up living in the fast life
To be the boss I paid the mad price
I be with some women watching Friday
Smoking spliffs up on the highway
Shawty call me royal highness
'Cause I did this shit my way
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot

Then I tell her slow it down
Oh for real
Real expensive, my clothes
I'm reinventing flows
Presidential, my smoke
You guys are little clones
Go 'head and wash your self up
The only loud smell should be the dope
Everything else is top shelf
Dinner on a boat, smoking a joint
I call that time to kill
I don't trip, I let shit slide
But niggas 'round me will
5k, Vegas at Tao, The owner pay the bill
Best seats
We at the game, I'm ashing on the field
Soon as we board the plane, they screwing up they faces
Money in cases, old watches, colorful bracelets
Some of us famous
The others just started they come-up
If you don't know by now
I don't like driving, baby, I'm the pilot

Ha-ha-ha
Female
Ha-ha-ha
Don't be rude
Use your manners
Joints get lit
Hate on me, what's the point of it?
These niggas I'm disappointed in
Can't hang with me like an ornament
If she bring a friend, she joining in
My gang official, we born to win
I'm rollin' weed and pourin' gin, woo!
'Nother plane, I board again
I revived, feel born again
I'm in the sky, I'm soaring in
Got a few vibes, bring 'em foreigns in
Valet be gettin' the door for him
She get them ones off the floor for them
Makin' these lil' niggas forfeit
If I ain't rappin', that mean I'm tourin'
Show up, I'm very important
They be like "It is Khalifa?", of course it is
Grindin', you don't have to force the kid
Marry the game, won't divorce the bitch
Makin' the money, you never make me
On top of game, you could never play me
I was at class, sitting next to JAY-Z
Smoking a joint with Nas and Swizz Beatz
Took off the Celine's, A1's on my feet
I'm rollin' a J, my night is complete
Hello, morning, you look good, good to me
Kissing the sky, I can feel it move me
But on my own I would share this morning
Kiss the sunrise with my eyes, so give it ya
Damn
I'm really realizing that I'm the man
That if I really wanna do it, I can
I'm smoking that gas, I share with my fam
My foot on the gas, I stick to the plan
You don't know me personal, please don't call me Cam
And if you do, then some weed should be in your hand
I turn to the boss, got tired of the middle-man
I smoke when I want, roll up even in Japan
You hear me talk it, I live it
It's all 100, I don't got a gimmick
Pullin' my card and I don't got no limit
Rollin' the chronic up I'm like a chemist
Way that I ball, I might end up in Guinness
I know they probably think I'm a magician
Walk in and leave out with all of the bitches
I'm at the top, I don't see competition
If she with me, when I talk, she gon' listen
Run to the money, do not give it distance
Gettin' some millions, I got them intentions
And know I came from the bottom, my name at the top and I don't even ask for permission
And they all line up and ask for pictures
Hard to imagine this life that I'm living
Hello, morning, you look good, good to me
Kissing the sky, I can feel it move me
But on my own I would share this morning
Kiss the sunrise with my eyes, so give it ya
Morning sunrise 
Morning sunrise Beg your pardon but let me smoke
And my squad they be gettin' that dough
Gettin paid and we smoke
Taking them planes everywhere we go
Don't gotta ask cus you already know
Heard you niggas was ballin'
We ain't nothing alike
Dug some crack in my palm, on them cold nights
Now it's just champagne, on cold ice
And expensive cars and all the women that we like
You never had conversations with bad bitches
Who don't need you
Give them the up all night and they gon' feed you
You be living fast, but the pays right
You ain't ready you short still gettin' stage fright
Bout a dollar, twistin' that marijuana
The car older than me, I'm sliding in that Impala
Got niggas actin' like bitches, bitches realer than niggas
Pussy that shit ain't knew I been hustlin' with killers
Seen so much when that trunk pop
See them red and blue lights and we don't stop
Damn, that's just what a nigga been through
What the fuck you want me to do? Real shit
Hoppin' out that mofuckin'
Gettin' out that mofuckin'
I got so much mofuckin'
That I don't even mofuckin'
Why you niggas even mad at me
I'll gladly teach you niggas how to rap
You probably should be mad at the fact that you can't stack and you ass backwards
And that's when something bad happens
You be with, mad actors, mad slackers, you mad average
You niggas lookin' like mad rappers
Pull up in the Porsche, skirt up, smokin' that murda
Illest that you've heard of
Doin' shows with my shirt off
Problems with any of my dogs then they squared off
Hurt all, feelings cus of the dollars I've been getting
Smoking joints with your women
And we all chillin', Taylor Gang
20 grand in each ear
Space Jam 11 got three pair
Weed so strong I don't need clear
My cuddys locked up and I ain't seen him in three years
The world keeps turning, and my girls keep working
Hundred pack flipper, your team still hurting
Last minute trips to masterpiece don't tick
The rims on the whip all chrome clipse
I'm fly really, I don't try
Red eyes while cooking pies who am I? Dice guy
Big dog stacker, punk bitch slap a bitch trappin'
And I ain't never gonna switch up
I brought my new bitch with me to the pickup
And if they hit us they gon' leave blood with us
Drug dealers please pull my mud thicker
Pardon me for smokingYou can be my superstar
We can do anything you want
Whoo-ooowhooo
Taylor Gang, Paper Planes
Don't forget the Champagne
Lamborghini wangs too, oh yeah
Come on and fly with your boy
You look like, um
Just what I like
Yeah
Yeah, what say you my dear
We drink get drunk go straight to the crib
Got a thing for Ms. Thang over there
Them yellow diamonds lead straight to the Wiz
Entrepreneur, got straight to the biz
Jumped in my car, spaceship that is
And we fly out, them expensive things that we try out
Most lie about
You got me like Ne-Yo gone girl
Do your own thing, I can see in your own world
Got my homeboy spring cleanin' your homegirl
And shawty we gonna do this shit right
I'm tryna find a bottle of anything that you like
To wait I got no time I'm trying to take you tonight
And if you wanna roll, then maybe we can go
I ain't showing off this is really my life, yeah
Leave with us never be the same, you reppin' with the planes
Hahahaha. Yeah bitch! Uh! Haha
Yeah, bottles going off and I ain't concerned with how much it's gonna cost me
I'm-a drink it straight probably order you a long beach
Waiter bring the drinks I'm-a roll some of this bomb weed
Somewhere in outer space or somewhere under a palm, tree
The flyest thing you ever been on, me
And them other niggas claim to be the planes
But how they leave them land when they're on, E
No fuel, though my swag is sicker than no cure
Maybe it's all the alcohol making me so sure
Damn, baby we cop the brochure we gon' shop at those stores
Presidential panel, on top of those floors
Say you got fans I got lots of homeboys
And they love to smoke and chill like I do
So come to my hotel bring your friends and they can get high too
And
Hahaha, yeah, bitch!
Leave with us never be the same, you reppin' with the planesYeah!  
 
Yeah! Two-Up!
Uh
They call me young boy, young crack
Brought up where them slums at
Hustle, I done done that
Customers I brung back
Just cause how I sung raps
Some of them are slung crack
?? only some will let their gun clap
Me, I'm on a cash chase, I'm running where them funds at
Rolling up the L and put something where my lungs at
Money come in dumb stacks, niggas lookin hungry and they wonder where they lunch at
I already come for that
I ain't find comfort at, any spot less than the top
You niggas had it but ya records done flop
So I picked it up and ran with the rock
And I ain't gotta sing it on the cards for you to understand that I'm hot
I just face one, stand up and rock, I give my hat a good cock
To the side and do my damngity-bop
I'm the man to be watched, or the nigga to see
If you want it, then I got it, you can get it from me
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
Should I feel bad cause niggas sold you a dream
Now Young Khalifa I'm controlling the scene
I ain't roll with ya team, did my own little thing
Now the records I be making got me holding the cream
And I'm only a teen, got respect like a man though
But all the real niggas say they love how ya man flow
Love how I'm repping the Burgh at every damn show 
Sit back, puff on the herb, countin my damn dough
Smile in my face, doubt ya kid on the down low
They ain't believe it before, them fuckers now know
But now though, you see through like a plate of glass
Tryna hide, I see you with ya hating ass
I'm bout making cash, haze by the eighty bag
Me and sledgren switch the swag just to make em mad
And niggas watchin my moves, so I'm make em fast
I'm first up, you out of luck, and takin last
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us
I'm doing my thing a young nigga tryna get his cake up
Doing what you can't do so you niggas out here hating us

And all my weed strong like Kimbo Slice
The money's the only thing I do twice
I'm in the fast lane, yellow chain, blue lights
And you gon' need shades, they say I'm too bright
I'm shitting on the game, so bring through wipes
And you can clean up and try to beat us
I'm sure you niggas is balling, that's what they all say

And I ain't even pressed
Got you feeling underdressed
Any time you find him in the building, I'm a threat
Got some Gucci Chuck Tay's you ain't seen yet
Yellow Ice, so I may seem fresh
But if you did what I'm doing
Nigga, you'd be feeling spoiled rotten
In my city I got pull
So don't tug, or get drugged
Through the mud probably
Like my weed rolled
My steak done properly
I put my team on
And now we own property
And my swag so official
No magazines, so my cash not a issue
Tell the Ref to throw a flag, blow the whistle
Cause your style's outta date
That's a foul on the play
And your words don't hurt him
Cause I'm flying out the way
What you make a month
I probably spent today

Yeaaheaa
This one goes out to all my patients and paitent-ettes
With that medical weed card yall
And I heard it's legal in Nevada too
Recreation on Seattle
So if you got your ID
Make sure you show up to your local dispensary
And cop you some of that KK
And tell em I sent you
And to all the states that ain't legalize it yet
Get on board man
We need the green
Make the world a better place
By putting the grass all in your face
Free the weed
Let everybody's who's locked up out of jail
And let all these patients get well
There ain't nothing wrong with it
You was just raised to think it was bad
But now its time to change your mind
Open your eyes yall
Look around, everybody's getting highMotherfucker it's, W - I
Act up, knuckles'll fly
Swing somethin' that'll bubble your eye
I've been trouble since the day I was born
A couple mix-ups
So I switched up, made it a song
Put your fists up, say to the song
You know the style, get wild
Like a child I was raised in the corn...nigga
And everybody wanna face-off, until they face off
I'm like a jet when I take off
I'm the one the grip the beat, youngin'
No bullshit, I spit the heat, youngin'
Hit the streets, youngin'
You'll hear my name ring bells
At your face, I aim these shells
Young Wiz,"Hey pimpin"
Prince of the city of steel ain't trippin'
Pricks try to claim to be real, straight simpin'
Y'all niggas ain't listenin'
Hold up! Who you...
Know realer? Flow iller?
Move with a team of goons and go-rillas
Bruise all the crews that choose they don't feel us
Dudes probably thought I'd lose...NO, NIGGA!
Go figga, man I'm playin' to win
If a nigga act up, then I'm layin' him in
You can see a little change from the way that it's been
Said it before, I'll say it again..
Motherfucker it's W, I  Z , playa!
Cowards all stuck, I'm up at the top layer
Half of y'all suck, it's nothin' to drop haters
Stackin' all bucks, man fuck it it's not fa-ir
Cause my team keep winnin', keep women
Keep coming up with amounts of dollars, and keep spendin' em
From the home where the hammers' shootin'
Cats all day, hand-in-hand we're moving
They can't swing like a fan was movin'
Get chopped up like a jam in Houston
It's young Wiz, huh? Steel City, yeah!
Pittsburgh-fitted low, I'm the rookie of the year
Yeah! And I rock and roll
'Till the kid rock Rollies, and my pockets swole
Getting paid's not optional
I tell chicks, C.D.C. - Cash Daddy's Checks and rollJeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
Light skinned, dark skinned, bottom right, top heavy
Jeans fitting right, hair did, shawty you the best
You the one girl, you the one girl
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Something bout them jeans that you wearing
Yeah you got that body of a goddess
You got no competition you got it
You make me wanna say oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my
I got one in Miami, she mean with a mouth piece
She like LeBron, I’m taking my talents down the South Beach
Pineapple to chase it, go on girl just chase it
All we drink is my shit, coco loso wasted
Love that lil waist shit, damn them hips just sit out
Now I see who all these hating girls be talkin’ shit bout
From the front looking like she got some ass probably
They say that’s a sign girl: ass-trology
Tight denim with them little rips in ‘em
“Wait in line” jeans, take a minute to get in ‘em
BBD say you poison well I want some of that venom girl, girl
Ooooh, girl your ass is superthick
Lotta chicks off in this club and you the baddest in this bitch
Ooooh, look at what you wearing girl
The club owner should pay you whenever you make an appearance
And you got me hooked, I might try not to look but I keep staring
Come out to my city see, I run that bitch like errands oooh
Grown as hell I don’t care to choose
Who’s coming, you, her and you
Roll this up, after you hit this once, you’ll need a parachute
To tell the truth I’mma tear the roof
Out that muthafucker nail it too

La música de Harry Fraud
Let me just run through it in my head
Uh
Get up off your ass
This cash ain't gon’ get itself, the race ain't gon' win itself
Focus on your business and your health
Put them notches on your belt
Treat them haters like they not here
Only smoke it if it’s top tier
Never puttin' your trust in a girl, that's bein' smart, it's not fear
All that I'm sayin', they motive's not clear
Lookin’ for a come-up, you won’t get a shot here
And still them bottles gon' pop, ’nother 30K, you gotta go shop
Even though it pains 'em, I guarantee it ain't never gon' stop
I’m with a few G's, you ready or not?
We levelin' up, conversations 'bout television and such
Make a toast to the better us
We never die, never givin' up
Never let sucker sheep get ahead of us
Blow rapper weed on the regular
You just rappers with weed, et cetera
It's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, it's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, complaining, yeah
Whatever you like, I got it on ice
Trips to paradise, never seen you wear it twice
We don't care the price, diamonds in our wrist-wear
We celebrate 365 days out of the year
It took a lot to get here, some losses
Now we pour out our own liquor and race Porsches
Several options
Stay real and still made a fortune
Doesn't happen often
Pull up, don't let the valet park it
Mama get in, don't make it awkward
This some G shit you wanna take part in
And if it ain't, well then I'll gladly beg your pardon
Rollin' KK, got it straight from out the garden
Bank the largest
Thank the Lord when we make deposits
Lot of hate but we shake it off us
We invest if it's makin' dollars
This for legacy, it ain't for follows
It's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, it's our time
I don't wanna hear you cry
Stop complaining, complaining, yeahMac Miller, Wiz Khalifa nigga
Yeah, Turn this shit the fuck up, nigga
You know how we fucking do
Right from the 4-1-2
Crazy 8’s bitch
Late nights, chilling money, stacking to the ceiling
Up a couple hundred tryna get it to a million
Rose spillin’, already high but I’m good weed twisting
Niggas got game thanks to me, no need to mention
Automatic start, no keys when I enter
Them youngings take notes
These hoes take pictures, jaunt me at my shows
Wanna know if I know them off Twitter
I’m sorry baby, it’s highly unlikely like me in some Nike’s
Get money every day, I’m poppin’ bottles nightly
Louie be carry on, I carry lightly
Promoters throw me OZ’s, they think of us highly
If I’m in it that mean it’s custom prolly
Plus my ho exotic smoking kush that come from Cali
The best in it
If it come to that shit, don’t question it
You know I got it
Say the town I get it streets but they’ve been waitin’ for it
Just left the dealer so that’s prolly why they hatin’ for
Uh, look at the wrist, they got me taken for it
When they walk, money talks, I just can’t ignore it
See a piece of pie, and think that I could be makin’ more
My cake enormous, my paper gorgeous
Come live in the town with me
Baby, take a ride with me
I can see it’s goin’ places
Every night we’re goin’ places
Different cities, different faces
I know that was goin’ crazy
I can see it’s goin’ places
Every night we’re goin’ places
Different cities, different faces
I know that was goin’ crazy
Now they know my name so no repeatin’ since the day I started breathin’
It’s been good, I’m only deepin’ and my bitch is Puertorican
Grindin’, never sleepin’, eatin’ like I’m Kel and Kenan
Every weekend party all damn night but then I sleep in
We’ve been getting this money since we was young’ins bruh
I’m getting cake you losing weight just like a tummy tuck
You see me coming up, hit you like an uppercut
The bird great tender win the race and you the runner-up
I got a real success but I ain’t done enough
Jumping like a double duck, she’s hating, looking dumb as fuck
My weed the precious all my bitches come with bubble butts
Going on a ride, y’all should buckle up
I’m getting pussy, you the ugly duck
Swimming, sinking in the pool
Making money why the fuck I need to finish school??
Now they see me and they greet me “is it really you?”

To do the shit I do, now lets celebrate the impossible
Glasses up, I'm respected son
Unbelievable arsenal
Beat the streets with bars til niggas lay in the hospital
In case you didn't know everything about me phenomenal
And the way these niggas talk everything about it is comical
Whats even more comical, is what you read in an article
I broke your face for talkin', you should've been more responsible
You need to learn I ain't trying to stop, basically
Watch them choke when I'm pullin' up in a space ship, see?
When I float you see how we ballin' until we wasted
Mad because I poke your broad and be lettin' her taste it
Please appreciate this art and this Basquiat that I'm painting
Embrace a lot of love, but I love embracing the hatred
You niggas is the fuel for me
Leaving it mutilated
Pardon my delay on all of this greatness you ever waited
Now when I'm lookin' at the game I say shit done changed

You probably thinking that you seen someone like me before
But I'm a G and they don't make em like me anymore
The nerve of these niggas
Talkin' shit about me cause I'm on the top I ain't even heard of these niggas
Smokin' kill dressed to murder these niggas
Want beef? Cause I got bread
I guess you where burgers be nigga
They say I'm the event currently
But my niggas in the cut like surgery
And all my breakfasts, lunch, and dinners get served to me
You sayin' I ain't the realest, that's perjury
I'm smokin' out with my niggas up on the top floor of the villa lookin' out for those who be trynna copy us
Oh you ain't bout them dollars huh?
I guess that mean we can't chop it up
Pérignon poppin'

Don't know whatchu doin', you should stop thenIs this the top?

Too rich
Ain't holding on to nothing, I've been trained to blow it

Popping hella bottles don't care what it costs us
Started small time, now all my diamonds flawless
Fuck you talking bout bitch my new watch just changed the game

Champagne, I got lot of it, if it's new then I'm rocking it
Climbing all my money, standing on top of it
New chains I got 2 of those, lot of haters we through with those
Getting money and getting more
I used to smoking some OG, used to burn about an OZ
Sold weed that was '03, now a nigga need 4 keys
Bare arms, no sleeves, in my khaki shorts, no jeans
Shawn Don in my styrofoam, motherfuck that codeine
I'm east side, so what, bitch niggas got no nuts
Y'all B.G.'s, we grown ups, teach ya how to keep chrome tucked
Ain't a bad bitch that I won't fuck
And if her head good, she might can get her toes up
High socks and some low cuts, fat spliff I don't roll blunts
You shine while I glow chump 
Not a day that I'm sober, on the block and I'm posted
Cork poppin', we toastin'Even though I'm in love, sometimes I get so afraid

I get money with an attitude that's mad cash
But when you walked past, I was like damn
She want me to give her my all
I'm talkin' one night, no feelings involved
Early morn no passion
Show her my flight school skills, no crashin'
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'

Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill 
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill 
Okay!
Uh oh, everything Taylor'd, room with no neighbors
Hop inside and we'll fly where a bird or a plane is
What your name is, and who ya came with, listen
I'mma take you out and put in the right position, oh
And tell your nigga I ain't trippin
Never fallin' off, I ain't slackin' on my pimpin'
Niggas call me weirdo, bitches call me different
Send me naked pics when I'm on the road
Just to let you know, I think it's beautiful
Soon as I get home, I'm rushin' over like a head start
Fresh up out the shower to the sofa, skip the bed part
A sharp shooter, young Bret Hart
Probably would like to, Hollywood night you
Red eye flight you, somewhere near we can get lost
And let you pop off, gone
Girl ya lovin got me gone, me gone, me gone
You're like a drug to me I'm on, I'm on, I'm on
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
I'm rollin, I'm rollin', I'm rollin, I'm rollin'
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill 
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill 
Shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill 
Shawty-shawty make me feel like we fuckin on the pill Tss
So she ran up on me and she was like "Damn, I miss you"
I had to tell the young lady:
"You can't miss what you still have
See, can't nobody take your spot
You don't miss me, you just missing out"
Hahaha
Ugh
I got you open off the words I spit
They tired of the rest, they need some gangster shit
Say I'm the best once the weed get lit
Don't leave your girl around me 'cause she might get hit
I rock Celine and all types of shit
At night, we in the studio, where mics get ripped
Doing my thing like a titan
These niggas' mouth hurt from all the biting
Niggas soft, I ain't nothing like 'em, don't need 'em
Say they my man but I don't believe 'em
I'm getting tanned with a Puerto Rican
Dropping new shit for my fans
Rings on the fingers, we them champs
Pull up to the party, high as fuck, I roll up in advance
I already know you niggas fake, never trust you again
Keep a lil' McQueen in my cup, Taylor cuff in my pants
'Nother red carpet, if they hit you up when I land
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
G-A-N-G-S-T-A
I gotta keep it gangsta
It's Only Weed Bro
Hahahaha!
Relax
It's only weedIf I were a lame
Only just for a week
I'd look myself in the mirror
And shoot the first thing I seen
No honestly I'd try and find someone else
And I'd make it seem like it's his fault
That I'm broke and can't get on
And he's doin' shit I can't do for myself
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame
If I were a lame
I'd talk shit to the hoes
Like you shouldn't fuck with that nigga
He ain't rich
I heard he really broke
I would get on a song
And talk as bad as I can
'Bout how I wish I'd catch him slippin'
How his mixtapes don't be shit
And how I'm gone end his career
But I'm his number one fan
If I were a lame
I'd probably understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
Shit I'd say that I'd
Should be right in his place
And talk shit behind his back
But I'm smiling while I'm in his face
Cause I'm just a lame
It's killin' me how niggas act anytime I come around
No matter how much I do for myself
They wanna bring me down
But I just gotta do me at the end of the day
Cause I'm not a lame
So I can't understand
How it feels to hate myself so much
I gotta hate another man
No it ain't my fault
My shit flies off the shelf
So stop tryna be somebody
And worry about just bein' yourself
Nigga just be yourself
And don't be a lame
No don't be a lameYeah, uh
Listenin' to Cameo, smokin' on the patio
Polo chinos, a Pro Club
Plottin' out the next score
Couple weeks in Cali
Smokin' the best, gettin' some rest
Then it's back to the full-court press
Niggas playin' for keeps
Tryna be the next Suga Slim, Baby or Master P
I don't pass that weed, it's all for me
I rolled it, so I'm only fo' sho gon' smoke it
Go and get your own shit
Focused on rollin' on, wrote for me and all of my dogs
Involved with takin' Jet Life, Taylor Gang to the stars
I done bought Ferraris from pennin' these rap bars
And I didn't stop there, I got so much more
Inspiration, somethin' you should reach for
See me in that Porsche, that should push you to go hard
I've done it, you can do it, ain't no difference
It's only real ones in the buildin'
Need to start really livin', make money every minute
The more things change, the more they stay the same
I stay high, peep game, sound the trumpets
And celebrate with buckets of champagne
Save the sparklers, I got the light show in my ring
And when we exit, they'll say the best just left here
And the rest is just like, yeah
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
And all the bad bitches fuck with me
And them pussy-ass niggas don't want none of me
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
Sports cars in the front yard
Dream big and we live large
Uh
All the gang rules apply when you fuckin' with the guys
Brought enough so we all could get high
She with me, don't be actin' all surprised
I get more money today than you see for the rest of your life
Tell you once, I don't gotta tell you twice
All my bitches treat me nice and my crib feel like paradise
Ain't gon' have as much fun as she had tonight
And if you got a plus one, everything alright
When it come to girls, I don't trust none
Khalifa kush, I'ma crush some, we gon' smoke 'til the sun come up
Ya nigga got a problem with it, hope he don't run up
I'ma take a shot, that's enough for both of us 
And if you bring a friend, I'ma let her in
Andretti OG, that's the medicine
I'm tryna get as high as the rent
Niggas comment on the smell, but I take that as a compliment
Don't fuck with no hatin' 'cause we don't do that
We countin' up paper, no we don't lose that
Since I leveled up, I never moved back
World of weed, bringin' all the booze
Don't stress her 'cause she gon' choose
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
And all the bad bitches fuck with me
And them pussy-ass niggas don't want none of me
This is the life, bitches and Nikes
Planes and Chucks, bottles and luxury
Sports cars in the front yard
Dream big and we live largeYeah, I'ma need the whole thing
Justize

We gon' take that
Put a few O's in there
Turn a couple of them around
And voila
Matter fact, we gon' have them everywhere
Yeah, bitch, yeah
I'm rolling up another joint soon as the weeds gone
You ain't on gas, it just seems strong
You ain't a boss unless your team on
You niggas going broke, you need someone to lean on
Young rich nigga from the burgh
Said I was gon' make it and meant every word
I remember I was getting curved
Always back it up, 'cause actions speak louder than words
I be outta state growing strains
I be smoking ounces to the brain 
I be pulling up with one rolled
Just say my name if you wanna smoke
I'm in my weed farm 
I'm in my weed farm 
I'm in my weed farm

O a day, That's two pounds a month
Put it in my lungs and then I'm good
Only smoking fire like I should
Used to deal with niggas tryna tax
Now I'm throwin' pounds and growing them back
Multi million dollars in the safe 
Homie I been getting it from the gate
Pushing weight outta state
Putting big ass orders up on my plate
See, you was down to stand in line, I couldn't wait
You must not heard about the amount I'm finna make

Ain’t nobody here to play around

Cause it’s time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family
Family, family, family
You know what it is when you hear haaan
Started from the the bottom with a dream
Started with a thought, now I got a whole team
All we had was hope now you see the whole team hot
Pull up in a boat, feel that rolls peel out
Montana, I'm I that third lane
First of the third man, stunt like Birdman
Pull up the Herman
The man that go up to two strippers naked
Getting turnt up like new year in Vegas
Your fourteen days, two weeks
I flew fourteen planes in two weeks
All white wraith looking like a tank
Got the whole team with me and we coming for the paint
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain’t nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge I won’t back down
Cause it’s time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family
Family, family, family
That blood just make us relate
I know you got some girls that can’t behave
We hate who? that I can’t relate to
But my one family got me made to
They say when you getting all this money it can change you
But when you be getting all this money can they blame you
Nothing ever changed you, I would stay the same you
Change is the only thing that will never change
Don’t nobody know how to roll it down like Jermain do
Judge took my dog out the pound told him thank you
I done gave cars to my partners, watches
Chicks dig the whip when I dip through the projects
Hanging out the side, giving money from my ride
Aye boy, your fingers dirty, don't you be touching all inside
You know I’m from around the way, tell your momma I said hi
Chase your dreams until you die, Never slack up on your grind
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain’t nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge I won’t back down
Cause it’s time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out
I give it all, all for the family
We stay up, no bail outs
Give it all, all for the family
Family, family, Fa-Fa-Family
Do it for the family
When I'm hydro planing, no gravity
Doing donuts in the street like i'm krispy kremes
Swerving
Dipping through the city with my top off, showing titties
All my thugs with me, niggas with me
All my niggas got , lamborghini ghost
Hundreds racks on the set, we race, you gonna lose
Do it for the squad, I'mma do my job
Going straight to the top
I feel like the sky is falling down
Ain’t nobody here to play around
Push it to the edge I won’t back down
Cause it’s time to go hard or go home
One way up, no way out

Heavy ass Mercedes Benz on top rims
Big chain, pink diamonds, candy ring
Couple million dollars off my own strain
Your life like a video game, Gran Turismo
I'm in that GT-R 'cause I parked the six four
I had the match for the cash
Underground garage where I stash
These niggas still in competition

Okay, I only care 'bout the money

Leavin' out the Gucci store, nigga, ain't shit bummy
On the paper chase on your ring, they shit runnin'
Took four years off and the checks kept comin'
All the girls wanna treat me like I'm special or somethin'
We at number one, mean we standin' next to nothin'
And the shit you rock is fake, but that's another discussion
I see a lotta dudes hate and the shit is disgusting
And I travel all the time, always gettin' through customs
And my livin' room new, everything in there custom
And the gang with me, everything I got is because 'em
Fools need better luck, they be wishin' it was them
Go on tour when I want, 50k for the clubin'
We a bunch of rich niggas and our kids'll be cousins
And don't gotta open doors, we just pushin' the button
That's on gang, life 
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang 
Stay papered up, woah
Stay papered up, on gang 
Three hundred thousand on your block, stars in the hardtop

Money is all I'm 'bout, don't know how much I got
'Cause it's never enough, fill another safe up
They only play tough, they really cream puff
I roll another one, forever highed up
Uh, Off-White kicks

Yeah
It's all about a dollar man
Don't let nobody else tell you anything otherwise
Unless it's me
Uh
Leave my iPhone cracked if I take a loss
Know I'm gon get it back, I'm always on attack
Learn to let the money stack, homies turn to rats
When you deal with certain cats, they deserve the facts
Stay in constant meditation, always burning back
Wipe them ashes off my lap, you ain't part of my set
It's harder to maintain than it is to get
That's why you hold on to it and don't ever forget
That you did good with less just gotta deal with the stress
It's part of the game
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out
Knowing your worth is half the battle
Keep fuck niggas out of your circle
Yeah they gon try to hurt you
See you focusing, they try to divert you
Being fake ain't rare, it's universal
That's why I'll never work with you
Family first, till I'm in the dirt
How these niggas bosses but they needing work
That's exactly why I don't believe em
Goals, set em, achieve em
Joints smoke em and leave em
Ten toes, no matter the season
Hot tub with my feet in
Living comfortably cheesing
Sometimes things ain't gon work out
How you think you want it to go
Sometimes you gotta keep going
When you think you can't no more
Sometimes you can't depend on
Who you think you can no more
Sometimes you gotta try, gotta try and
Figure it out
You know what, playboy?
They always gonna wonder why
You gotta have a brand new car
Or why you gotta have the flyest watch
But you know what, playboy?
You just gotta keep doing you
Coz ain't nobody do you better than you
You look good doing it too, playboy
And you know what else
Them haters, they just gon keep hating man
And when you on top, people always gon want your spot
But you know what, playboy?
It's up to you whether you give it to them or not
So keep that in mind, playboyHow it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby 
When you got visions of being the man
Sometimes other people won't understand
Gotta go hard for yours, maintain the upper hand
Rollin’ up grams with this chick who's super thick but she from Japan
Soaking up some vibes, workin' on my tan
Another show, another two hundred grand stuffed in the safe
There ain’t no comparison to my watch and the one you wearin'
Weed so loud, you hear it
Pull up and we the ones they wanna stare at
Fuck an appearance
You hear us talk it then we really live it
Houses with tanks, fifty thousand dollar fish up in 'em
My team was built to win
Hit your broad with that venom
Pro clubs and Levi denims
You can tell by our women
And all these legendary bars I'm pennin'
Come to my mansion if you wanna kick it
Flooded with digits, boss up, it's your decision
You lookin' fucked, we stuck to the business
Yeah yup
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?

Ten steps ahead of these niggas
Wanna last in this game, then you better be
Rollin' so much weed, look like the ’70s
Newer chain, copped a better piece
The crib mine, nigga, fuck a lease
She off the leash, bank account in Greece
Gettin’ mine to say the least
Put it down, she tell me I'm a beast
Soon as 2009 get released
We got more heat for the streets
Fuckin’ up her sheets, 100K a week
Rich but I stay discreet
You know how them major players be
Tell her she can stay or leave
Can't believe, but we really achieved it
Bars are seamless
Money large, wrist anemic
I ain't there unless my team is in it
Ain't nothing new, we been here a minute
Trips to Spain and Venice just to handle our business
Don’t leave a thing unfinished
Champagne with our dinners
Going strong every inning
Some shit you might wanna witness
Yeah yup
How it feel, how it feel
To have a real one in your corner, baby?
They can never clone it, baby
How it feel, how it feel

Weigh your options, you ain't gotta wait for nobody else
Uh, I got a lot of live for
Weed, I got a lot to give

It all depends on what the options is
I stay positive but still focused on haters because they all plotting
Ain't trying to say it but they all watching
And I know that I'm they favourite
But I wouldn't be here if I was faking
Fuck all the money they say they making

Been around the world and yeah-yeah-yeah
Been rollin' KK, gettin' everybody high
Smokin' in places I ain't even supposed to but they'll never try
Getting bitches naked like Mardi Gras
We already fried when we walk in the party
That's when the conversation starts
Them cameras all in our faces
We don't care 'bout what they say
Get money, three different places at the same time
Pull up, hop out, no shirt on and skip the line
Niggas, you really be sick of lying
Booking me all these shows like I ain't really sick of flying
All I know is the grind
Rolling the biggest joints, never show up on time
Shorty, we smoke like it ain't a crime
Taylor Gang or you dying
Now you ain't gon' get it to it if you don't let yourself
And if you out there on your grind, better protect yourself

Getting money is the joke to these guys
When you get my type of money, you don't notice them guys
Stay focused on the money or be broke when you die
Niggas know not to be stepping on my situation
You know the top is where I'm head it
I throw money like confetti
Hate the struggle, hate the grind at my nigga basement
Used to hate it on the nigga, cause your fake ass never made it
Real talk, I can’t quit
Hustle till I die, bitch I’m still getting higher than an elevator
Bye bitch, I'm everywhere the cash is
You ain't got no assets
You're a liability to loyalty, now back that
Try to get you niggas game, you had to make a check
But you won't survive if you treat me like your last connect

Bought the Bentley off the lot in some damn slippers
I got neighbors on my ass cause i'm smoking to much gas
My accountant keeping tabs
20 bags full of cash
Spent 250 on the watch to make most of my time
It ain't no second for bitches who don't fuck to survive
Came up from the mud to a solid gold tub
Had to struggle, had to grind, had to dedicate my time nigga

I'm livin' like Ox, big-ass house, weed nuggets in the bowl
I don't watch soccer, but I like the jerseys
They look good with my jewelry on
And my butter brown skin tone
Bitches choosin', but none I bring home
I break 'em off on sight
Introduced 'em to the rest of the stage, done like a couple nights
If she's really down, soul on ice like my Rollie crown
We control the town from the couch, nigga, I'm smoked out
You really want that funk U.B. delivered to us in the trunk
Andretti OG, Khalifa Kush all stuffed in one joint
I proved my point when I parked that Rolls Royce, hopped out
Forgot my phone was in my lap, my mothafuckin' screen cracked
It's all good, I'll text your bitch and have her slide through Mac
That Apple Care kicked in, bring me a new phone and an iPad back
Hustlers on the map, in pursuit of the scratch
Never would we relax, money addicts relapsed 
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Stayed real, struck it rich, how can you hate on that?
Two dopeboys in a Cadillac
Weed clouds in the air, diamonds in the back
Plenty bosses, pretty watches
Pull up, they ask what it cost us
Stayin' cautious, play your posture
Never takin' any losses
We declinin' offers
Too much sauce, can't get it off us
Shout out to Sauce Walka
Foreign cars and old Impalas
Million dollars, million problems
Gotta keep them millions on us
Hate 'em, dodgin', bake 'em, watch 'em
Money, tryna make it often
Now we fathers, know that God got us
They be tryna foul us
But we never die-ers, gang lifers, rap game survivors
Paid the prices
We make history and made it twice
Off of savin' Nikes and convincin' girls to stay the night
That's our way of life, dropped 2009 to say it twice
Every day's a flight
You just hatin', dawg, that ain't advice
Got my paper right, ain't just buyin' everything in sight
Now I'm the savin' type, so my son is straight for life
Always grindin', money on the mind, Rollie tellin' time
You out of line, sayin' this gang life is not the vibe

Tall nigga so my flights got room
Small nigga so I always got goons

Few Rosays, now you drunk saying boy

Only 2 things poppin, thats Jet Set and The Gang
Eating sushi, few groupies, new clothes and left over room keys

Fresh outta first class
Fresh outta purp nap
My outfit straight outta hearse
So fresh to death
My car from overseas
The steering wheel on the other side
I'm givin' it
All I got is smokin' what's left
So much money on weed
So much smoke in my chest
I take the lessons I learned
And put 'em all in my flesh
Tatted, got a strong weed habit
Going hard, could have sworn you niggas had it
Buying champagne, what the tab is
We order more drinks, bring the cabs in
Rip up jeans, call it fashion
A lot of cash and a lot of grass
You niggas broke, you ain't gotta pass
Chanel bags and them Prada tags
Spendin' stash, you ain't gotta stack
Young and rich, don't know how to act
As the wheels keep spinnin' and my joint keep burning
And my team keep winnin'
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold up
Thinking of some shit, that rap taught me
Sittin' in a whip, that rap bought me
Look at all the things, that I'm affording
My nigga mean I'm ballin' like a sports team
You doin' some shit, you think is flossin'
I was doing that back, when I was fourteen
Gettin' it, buying the most, flippin' it
Sixteen, time to pay rent in this bitch
I wasn't even thinking of making millions
I was just thinking smokin' and chillin'
And trying to pay the bills
Try get my mom out of this building
And I got my mom out of this building
I never took a hand out
Matter fact I put my hand in
Now everything you see is planned by me
Boss of my own shit, Taylor Gang Ent
Nothing but that cali strong
Gettin' blown by the pound, bitch TNT
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold upSports coupe spoiler
Sipping on a bottled water
Dead serious like the fourth quarter
Niggas can't get the shit, it's on back order
Holla at the waiting list, I'm already sporting 'em
Bout to give away the shits, can't get bored of the money spending
High performance exhaust system
Straight bossing, more than often
Nigga I'm always getting it, straight Jet living
I got all my cars, all my weed, all my women
Valeting exotics at mafia style dinners
Ducking pictures as we toast to getting richer
It was all planned out for us to stand out
The have-nots have it all, without accepting handouts, dog
Twisting the top off the big jar
Higher than a...
Niggas out they rabid ass mind
Thinking I ain't gon' try to get as much money as I can make this year
You must be on some hardcore drugs
I'm just flipping through magazines and rolling them Raws up
My red cup filled up with gin
That's my gang and they destined to win
In this thing and you better spend
Give good brain, you should let her in
Leave your cigars, joints already rolled
In the morn' look at a Polaroid of it
Wake up feeling way better than you ever did
With the nigga that you was with
And now you got the nigga all upset because of it
Would call my phone but he know that I don't play that
Send some real niggas where he stay at
Made it quite clear, take ya lips put 'em right hereI don't wanna rush into things, no let's take it slow
Been doin' this too long, I don't wanna let go, oh no

You've been lookin' for something strong
You feel strange cause I might be the one
You ain't used to just holdin' on
You put a couple dudes in position, they did you wrong
But I'ma go on straight to the mission
Put my key in ignition
You should talk but with me you just listen
From the seat, to the whip, to the crib
Now we on the bed

You just wanna catch a nigga when he slack off
But you don't want to be the reason that I pack up, nah
Don't even let 'em get you mad though
They just some rebound bitches off the backboard
See you the reason I'm always in the trap for
And if them niggas come, you open up the back door
You know
Yeah we argue and fight
But I'd rather fuck you all night
We can just get high, cook me dinner
And live a comfortable life
You can keep it to yourself
I don't want nobody else
I'm the realest nigga left
You can put me to the test
I ain't nothin' like the rest

Life stealers, who quite realer than them old niggas
In the background of your pictures, ho nigga
Your daddy was scared of the goons who used to drop me off at school
People ain't know the kinda shit I was off into
Silent rider, destined for dollars
Musical scholar, pennin' his own products, straight narcotics
Watch me turn this beat into a foreign with a spoiler on it
Shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
So I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
That's why I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
Yeah, yeah
Ball forever, pocket full of mozzarella
I remember when the owner didn't let us
Now we pull our car up where our jet is
All you see is letters, T.G.O.D., we ain't dyin' never
We in the sky forever, stay applyin' pressure
Pack my bags for any weather
Boy, you broke and need to get your shit together
Silence any competition
Got the crib that I dreamed of and not to mention
Bathtub like a swimmin' pool, smokin' out and trippin'
Always handle business
Always left hella game on the table for anyone to witness
Trips to Vegas, we don't need a ticket
Blow presidential smoke and our drinks are expensive
Our wins are extensive
Penthouse, wonderful view, I live how a prince live
But back when we started, wasn't a way to predict this
Stuck to the script, made our own movie
Got a vid, it's comin' real soon, fool, you gotta see it
If the shit fall, who could I call? 
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg 
So I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball
If the shit fall, who could I call?
Nobody, fool, all I got is myself, dawg
That's why I hustle hard, a hunnid stacks in the vault
Just a lil' bounce back, make sure that we forever ball, yeahUh
I just got the fuck off a plane
6 car garage, I got more than 1 job
Be a boss, go hard
Wake up, smelling kush when I yawn
Shorty wanna fuck with the king, tired of them pawns
Ain't on the top? Well, that's nonsense
Bank account full of G's, so that's all you gon' get
TSA know my face so they don't trip
Chain frost, big bitch that I'm with don't give me no lip
We done touch M's, now we on to billions
Hard to explain how these new rugs feeling
Blowin' kush up in high ceiling's
Having meetings at the crib, confidential dealings
And I ain't gotta tell you who the realest is
That's my nigga Spitta, foreign cooked chef
And where the kitchen is
Money straight where my business is
And the girls fuck with me so I'm always where the bitches is
Kid
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I see all the sexy mami's in here
Hey, ayy, Wiz I smell you up here, too
Make sure you pass that KK to the DJ booth
Aw shit, here comes Spitta on them gold BBS
Yep, swung through, gold BBS and the spoiler kit
1986, slinging that shit
They want the family price on them bricks
But I just had a son and I only love him
So I ain't coming down on the price
Ain't no where else you gon' get shit this nice
Got cocaine white, Air Force Nikes
Bought K-Swisses for all my bitches
Put hightop troops on all my shooters
Bought the Goose down jacket from the boosters
Shootouts on the roof, racing in them coupes
She wore the Gucci frames with the door knocker hoops
And the lying motherfucker tell you I ain't the truth
Rich uncle come through, pop the truck, pull the duffel
Lay the merchandise out, get the loot, motherfucker
East side real nigga, show ya how to hustle
Outside, put the fucking Chevrolet's on the bumper
If it don't hop, nigga, park that shit
That ain't no low rider, thats a rollin' imposter
Put the stocks on fool, quit playing like you out here
2009, all kind of high
How Fly had fools on the moon trying to drive
Its a stoned duo, solid gold judo
Kicked the fuck out that game and now she won't go
Ladies, if you ain't go your own drinks, you gotta get out the section
You heard my man Spitta
Fellas, raise your glasses
Tip your bartenders
And make sure you take that nigga bitch
We bout to ride out
Jet Life, Taylor Gang, owFrom in studio preview
Open up, countin' up, going hard, passing out
Waking up, counting up, going hard
I dont want to go home
Talking the game Im on top of the list
Walk in this thing I look stylish as shitUh
Cause I be bakin' when I'm waken
Shinin' cause I'm grindin'
Smokin' while I'm drivin'
Diamonds in my timing, bitch
Overflow with smoke
I smell like OJ, when I pull up
Only fuck with OGs, so that's what my clique is full of
Niggas get a 'lil love
Actin' like they're famous
Found out what your name is
Now you think you made it
If you're so fucking hot, my nig'
You should be gettin' paid then
But you ain't selling out
You're just an internet sensation
Got a package coming, every state I stay in
Ain't no writing checks at the bank no more
I just waitin'
Rolling up the weed, put the KK in the equation
Let you hit the Marley
It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
It's part of the game, it's all that I know
We sleep on the plane, we live on the road
And away we goBlowin' on this ray, spitting game to these hoes
Money ain't a thing cause I got paper to blow
I'm heavy in the game it ain't a thing to a pro
Baby I'm a star and you already know, that I'm getting bankroll
 See me I was cheifin' on my reefer getting blowed
In my home alone that's when Sledgren hit my phone
He said Wizzle what you doing
I said we should hit the club
I could swing through and grab Motor, cuh you just hit Lonnie up
Then I jumped in the shower, took me bout an hour
Smoked a blunt of ray and put on my star power
All black Chuck Tays, some Armani frames
15 carats in my chain bitch I'm heavy in the game
In my truck I'm switching lanes, feel that beat off in my trunk
I'm smokin' Mary Wayne
I speed off to the hood and we gone roll about 10 blunts 'fore I'm ready
I'm spending all this cash up tonite, if you let me
I tap my horn once, I tap again
This nigga must not hear me, I 'ooowop' he let me in
I meet up with my mens, then dip out to the spot
The whole Khalifa gang, 10 cars deep off in the lot
You be off in the front, we creepin' thru the back
And we gon' blow some stacks, them hoes ain't know how to act
No I.D. I'm underage but far from underpaid
I'm fresh to death, stay fly until I'm sleep off in a grave
You got them hoes you fuck with groupies that I used to know
Say you gettin' money man, now money's what I choose to blow
Finna pop some bottles, scream I'm through
Came to shut the club down
So make some room, I'm...
Now we in the club, hear the DJ scream my name
He shout out Heavy Hustle cause the DJ know my gang
I'm standin' on the couch in V.I.P. I swing my chain
The DJ play my song, I throw my cheese and go insane
And I got what they need, they come and shake it for a boss
These hoes just out here choosin' homie take it as a lost
Sweat comin' out my pores this Patron got me heated
Security know what it is with me, I'm gettin' weeded
The hoes say I'm conceited. Niggas say I'm a fool

More than a rapper, in fact
Man, you fuckin with the finest here

Sometimes I gotta sit back and think, ya know
The audacity I have for these n*ggas man, ya know
But you know I just gotta focus on the positive, ya know
Cuz' the negative ain't gonna do nothin' but.. you know what I'm sayin'
Bring me down, and I've worked too hard to get where I'm at
I can guarantee you one thing, I ain't going nowhere
I'ma be right here baby, 412
Uh huh, and this the Prince, yeah, yeah
Homie we came up, niggas hatin' cuz not havin' paper just ain't us
Take it from me, shit for free, nobody gave us
Tired of strugglin' so we hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah
Hustle to get the change up, yeah, yeah 
Uh, look homie I'm from the ill-gritty, city where they kill plenty
Lost some niggas along the way, some of em' still wit' me
So why don't ya'll come through, while the boys show you
How we livin' in the 412
Where young niggas got no intentions of workin' jobs
Cookin' that raw is they definition of workin' hard
Chop it, bag it, hit the block and work it hard
Tired of strugglin', so we started hustlin'
Gotta bring that money in, didn't wanna run the streets
But lookin' at an empty plate'll make a nigga wanna eat
And get up on his feet, hustlin' and scramblin'
A  will let the cold world make a man of him
And fam listen, pay attention to who you 'round
Another man can never pull you up, but he can pull you down
This somethin' every real nigga can feel here
They hate me for the fact that I'm still here 
Yo, some say I mention drugs in every one of my songs
Not knowin' you ain't gotta be doin' wrong to get your hustle on
Long as you're goin' hard, I was taught, growin' up in Pittsburgh
Shit it means, gettin' cake by any means
Niggas on that rap shit, niggas on that crack shit
Most niggas will clap quick, end up on your back split
Some niggas will 9 to 5, and never make a pack flip
Tryin' to get that cheese, some niggas end up on that rat shit
'Round here that's how you get sent into a back-flip
Nothin' else to be said, my niggas try and see bread
Tired of them stomach pains, niggas try and keep fed
Fillin' up your pipe veins, green for the weed-head
City full of pipe-dreams, believe me i been sold those
Heavy chronic habit, we gon' need the whole zone
I stay higher than the Ozone Layer
I'm from the Burgh, nigga don't go there
I never backed or run away, slacked for one day
Had somethin' on my chest, and held back what i wanna say
That's how i wasn't raised, manned up quicker
The young boy grew up into a stand up nigga
Fuck you pay me, I demand them figures
I'm gettin' mine shorty, we young niggas on the rise, on the grind Shorty had enough of the lies
Jealous niggas I despise, look in my eyesSweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar
Follow me as I get high, and ride
In the car I just bought, but I prolly never drive
I heard it's easier that way
My weed is gettin' stronger my Visa is gettin' straight
My whole team is gettin' cake
Call us leaders in the game, niggas follow cause they need us
Ain't just wannabe's they want to be us
Thats why they throw our gang up when they see us
Rollin' planes up, hear them niggas who talk the same
But they ain't us
Took my success and I shared it with everyone next to me
So they sayin' that we came up
Got some fire weed and some niggas down to smoke
So we all gon' be high as can be
At that point you aspire to be
Hermes belt, I'm the flyest degree
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar
The view from my lair
Will have a married woman playin' truth or dare
At my crib cleanin' rooms in there
So many shoes, you think I buy my shoes a pair
A fuckin' fool, highed up with Pittsburgh pimpin'
Ever since my old crib, splittin' ounces
Goin' half on Chinese food
To flights Hawaiian, a two week cruise excursion
Far from the madness splurging
Learnin' 'bout scuba gear, sting ray sea urchins
Do it for my old heads
Same way they would've done for the OG's before them
They like, "how thick is your skin?"
I been through Hell and back fillin' up the tank for another spin
All the way out there goin' in, cash pourin' in
Gas pedals to the floor in 'em vintage wheel historian
Open the garage door finna bring another in
Sweeter than sugar
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
Sweeter than sugar, sweeter than love
...Yo, yo, what up? What up?
It's your boy Nick Budsworth
Right here with your 4/20 check-in
I know you riding high out there
So make sure you buckle your seatbelts
We got a lot of traffic so you might wanna have one rolled
Drink lots of water 'cause it's hot out
And if you're gonna be out all night, don't watch for the police
'Cause they don't give a fuck if you're smoking these days
It's legal, bitch
You know I got what you need, baby
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserve 
If my gang's in it, then you know it's legit
Buy the diamond rings, frozen fist
Legendary status, close to it
Pounds, growin' it, then we smokin' it
I ain't through with the game 'til I recoup everything that I'm supposed to get
Couple doors, open them
So niggas after me can get rich before they close again
If we ain't close, then we closin' in
Hittin' that chronic and holdin' it in
How many days he gon' roll again?
Made a mil' gettin' stoned with his friends
Makin' sure we look good for them pictures that we posin' in
Champagne bottles cold in the fridge
I'm goin' in and goin' again
Niggas sick, they got no defense
Can't block shit
Gettin' dollars make a lot of sense
Boy, your pockets full of lint
Pull 'em inside out before you sit
You know I got what you need, baby 
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserve
Keep the drinks cold
Seen shit get worse so we don't care when they reach
Before the paper meet the ink, think
Got our own weed, got our own everything
Trips every week, 20k for a seat
Tried to stay low-key but paparazzi won't let me
Old Chevies, new Mercedes, a few ladies
A couple niggas who wanted millions since we was babies
I get the room, it's so comfortable, say she gotta stay 
Money, I made a lot today 
Pulling out them private tables
Thirty a hand if you wanna play
Risk it all before I play it safe
If you broke, I'ma stay away
It goes down if I okay it
Four cars where I stay at
Racin' boats, catchin' all the wave action
Jetlife, Taylor Gang captain
The ones you named your plane after
You know I got what you need, baby
Know what you deserve
You know I got what you need, baby
I'm what you deserveUh, my bank branch know me first name basis
House party lookin' like a Thursday at Aces 
Good gracious, all these blue faces
Told them niggas hold they breath, they can't take it
Stans and Lavers, that's Adidas paper
Authentic Harlem, they ain't wanna see us caked up 
The rates' up, the gigs' up too
Double header in France, went for a bag and I picked up two
Back across the water, bosses aura
Belaire Rose flowin' like faucet water
Get love from the plug, he endorse my order
Finesse a few plays, get mo' bucks
Fast as a 'Rari, bad broad hoppin' out of planes
Put my pot down, now I'm 'bout to twist another strain
Uh, disappear like David Blaine 
Got a few things I can do with this Mary Jane like
Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it 
We gon' prolly get rich to this 
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
She wanna roll 
What she say, she can come but she can't stay
I'll smash on you, but I can't lay
Back shots, still got my sweatsuit on
In my hi-tops, fo' chains and my Plain Jane watch
Her homegirl watch from the rooftop
I'm the true new season, new coupes out
What you 'bout? I'm on a new route
Bitches shakin' ass lookin' like Uncle Luke house
Roll so many O's, it's just "Ooo" now
Andretti, couple more Chevy's
In the paint shop, they almost ready
When they hit the streets, you'll know
'Cause all of sudden, nigga turn ice cold
Big paper get where small money can't go
Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it 
We gon' prolly get rich to this 
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this 
I got a priority flow, I'm right at yo do'
Kickin' flavors wrapped in paper, they ain't labeled before
Southern lights, ain't a device that could disable the glow
I school a bitch, get down with, you went and catered the ho
I'm on a level that never be, like planets you'll never see
I sit somewhere in between, rhythms and melodies
Allow me to primp, primp, get out with a pimp limp
Put it on a blimp for a bitch that done jumped ship
I got this here on cruise control
Ooze the type of cool that Eskimos would know
Rose the type of bread that only Huck could fold
Blindfold folk at my house before I entered the code
‘Cause a lame break and enter where he ain't enter before
But I block 'em like a center the ball
The way I shine, like I shine like the sun ain't been shinin' at all
2AM in the morning, bet she know who to call
Krizzle
Pull up in my ride, sick wit' it
We gon' prolly get rich to this
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
She gon' prolly get lit to this
Every time that your girlfriend play this
She gon' prolly get lit to this

I'll be waitin' on you, Let's plan

Wrestling, lettin' all your worries go
Feel like you'll never stress again
Hopefully one day there can be an us again
Us again, us again
But if not, fuck it then
Nah I'm playin', you my dying wish bucket list
Thinkin' 'bout you any time I'm with my other bitch
This OT fling, my out of town girl
We don't need roads, we in our own world
I know they gonna feel me on this one
Yeah, bitch
Come fly with the planes
Captain of the spaceship
Taylor Gang, champagne, Lamborghini wangsSometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do
Seems that you’re runnin' around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin' you
Sometimes…
I hear you talkin' to me
You sick and tired of the kid lying, sometime you feel like you talkin' through me
That’s when you walk up to me, trying for attention
Ma listen, you wild’n, stop trippin'
'Cause a nigga work too hard, too long
Always got a show or in the stu', new song
Them other dudes couldn't walk with my shoes on
Still I come home, hearin' 'bout what I do wrong
Pullin stunts and, rollin' blunts
With my dudes from the hood, but to you, they no good
I’m just doin' what I could, and that’s givin the circumstances
You only get one shot at these certain chances
Instead of trying to find dirt, and where your man is
Try and understand when that work demanded
And no, mama, that’s not a punch line
I’m always there when it’s crunch time
But still you say
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do what you do
Seems that you’re runnin' around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin' you
Sometimes…
Now I know you hear the "he say, she say"
Your home girls got my every move on replay
Screamin' how you know niggas, and the games that we play
But all the while I’ve been grindin' for this week's pay
Hustlin' each day, in order to eat right
Call me sayin' she need me in order to sleep right
Not really knowin' what these streets like
So you stay up until I come back
A nigga love that
Help me relax, warm plate and the dub sack
And after that, proceed to bend the back
Then I’m back to politics as usual
And sometimes I wanna talk to get through to you
But… damn…
I don't know if I ought to bring it up
Seems like such a funny thing to talk about
Don't know if it's right to do
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do, what you do
Seems that you’re runnin around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin you
Sometimes.....
]
I may get mad
But I don't really wanna fuss with you, I got love for you
'Cause every man needs a home
But that sometime, that man can feel the need to roam
Say you know my type, can't leave the freaks alone
To each his own, I'm getting grown and
'Cause you always think I'm lying to you
I can't deal with all the crying you do, you say
Sometimes I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
Everytime you get mad when I ask you what you do, what you do
Seems that you’re runnin around
Every night late comin' home when I call
And I don’t know what to do
'Cause I feel like you’re lyin' to me when I’m askin you
Sometimes.....
 & Vali Porter]
I don’t know if you’re tellin' the truth
Everytime
You get mad when I ask you what you doMhm
Let me talk to you
Show you something that you probably seen before, but you never seen it like this
Physically fit, smoking that shit you can't get
If it don't make dollars, then well it don't make sense
Got my crib out in Cali, buy everything for my kid
You hear me talk about it, fuckin' right, it's what I live
Lean back, hit the chronic
She like "Why it so intense?"
I say don't "Don't worry 'bout it, keep your mind up on these chips"
And these niggas out plotting
They broke so they got something against us
Pot, we smoke it anywhere
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Got that ODB, 'cause they say they like it raw
Don't get to a comfortable point
And back off
Gotta be sharp, the game's filled with whack artists
I ain't hating on you dawg, get yours
But don't ever think I'm convinced
These eyes covered by lenses
'Cause I'm probably high as your rent
See the Forbes list, think it got him content
But I'm not, I'm still hustling hard

The one with that man name on it, man
For'real man, I'm tryna inhale that one time, man
For'realRiding something butter soft, interior smoked out
See you try to budget yours. Me? I don't care what it costs
Blowing hella cake I'm switching states to get my numbers off
Spin the parking lot and fuck the finest thing I come across
Phone full of missed calls, keep some bitches on my line
Conscious with my conversation, caking is my occupation
Keep them 'rillos rolling up, filled to the tipple
Good weed and I blow it by the zip, I'm in my whip
Riding weed and switching lanes, cruising to my newest shit
Hoes been acting funny so I'm fucking with my newest bitch
Everything designer on, diamonds look like Lemonheads
On the beach with foreign freaks, you tricking with them chickenheads?
Gotta get my bread  so I hardly sleep at night
I do a show to studio, I'm just in time to catch a flight
Young but I'm paid, it comes from grinding everyday
And having patience, blowing Master Kush in my spaceship
Cruising with my hat back, tat-tat-tatted up
Gucci on my loafers, getting chauffeured now my status up
Paid to cost, I'm the thinnest boss, fuck them other guys
Blowing weed I'm never sober, you can't tell me otherwise
Name well known, ranked at the top
Bad bitch in every city, big face on the watch
Kush on my clothes, big bank in my knot
Smoke a hundred cigarillos, pullin straight up out a pillow
Now I'm eating, staplin in cases for my pillows
To my city I'm a prince so I sit behind tints
Mad I found an avenue to get my revenue
I'm with a model bitch cheifing in a tailor made suit
Taylor Gang president, heavy hustle under boss
In my car blowing smoke signals out the roof
Money conversation talking paper then come fuck with me
I'm in the air, that's why you look up to me, you know?I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch

I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way
Yeah, I'm no my way but I ain't tryina stay
I'm just tryina smashing dash like the other day
Ain't nothing changed, give me brain, I'm stuck in my way
I ain't tricking, I pay up bitch to get out my face
See, that's the pimping in, I want these niggas envy
I hit their bitch and I'd be gone she leave your pockets empty
I swear my trigger finger got her bustin' like a semi
I play these hoes like Michael Jordan, you just Scottie Pippen
See, I be dodgin' bitches, I got a lot of misses
May your bitches wanna get my dick a lot of kisses
She keep telling me she love me, I don't wanna hear it
Bitch the only time I'm tricky when I'm disappearing
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way
I'm always on the mission, I got a lot of women
Ain't no relationship after I get that mouth I'm dippin'
Put so much OG Kush upon a scale I got a tippin'
And now she caught me trippin', that wasn't my intention
Bombay I'm always sippin', KK that's my religion
Them niggas talking down to one come up missing
Them bitches on the ‘gram ain’t got a pot to piss in
Tryina get in, I don’t give a fuck about your mentions
Who paying for the clothes?
Why your clique full of hoes?
Why you always at my shows?
All the real niggas know!
And ain't too many left of us
She ain't new to this, she do this on the regular
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch

I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the way
I just touch down in the city and I need that fix
If the head right it up, I might keep you on the list
I bet the bitch are coming fuck me for some kicks
She wanna fuck me cause I got a Maybach on my wrist
I call her hair darker, she keep the head proper
She need a head board cause I'm the bed rocker
Told her she running out of time, I got a shot clock
She wanna kick it all day, but we ain't playin' soccer
I hit her, she hit me right back
My nigga she know what I'm on
I'll let her play with the money
Other than play with my ball
She told me her nigga was weak
So I let her smokin' this strong
I hear that they're putting to sleep
But I get right back in my zone
I'm on the way, I'm on the way, little bitch
I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch

I'm tryina fuck you, but I ain't trying to stay, little bitch
I'm on the wayUh, long days, gotta recharge to run the play
Paper straight, come up with bars to get us paid
Major weight make it hard for them to imitate
Rolex tell the daytime and the date
If I eat, all my niggas gon' get a plate
If you hate, guaranteed, you ain't in the way
Clown shit, we don't entertain
Always been a young nigga with the vision and I'm still the same
Turned an idea into a strain
Do it once, I fuck with you, I respect you, you do it again
Nothin' but the best for the fam
I don't gotta flex for the 'Gram
Too many rings for my hands, so we stack 'em and stash 'em
We them fuckin' champs
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ah-ah, uh
You ain't gotta lie to kick it
You ain't close to rich enough to be in here
Papered up and stoned at every appearance
Martha's Vineyard, baby left her diamond necklace behind
At the bed and breakfast, it's fine
She got that on a heist, she'll steal a better one on the next one
I only fuck with professionals
Sniper scopes and silencers stuck inside of leather sectionals
Watch where you sit at, might hear that click-clack
I copped the BMW six pack, M package
Highway action, state mansion
That's what G's do, you smell that fire in the breeze, fool
Don't you dare call this shit a part two
This a whole 'nother animal, this that mankind mandible
Chanel drip on your television channel
Counting cake lit as a birthday candle
Pay me just like a fan do
Real one so they don't know how much my shit they can handle
Chicks love social media, so I watch out for them scandals
Don't measure that kush, give you a handful
Gotta grind 'cause my son hungry and the rent due
We changed how you smoke, changed how you dress
Your whole life was blessed by the presence of the stoned legends
Ho, retrace our steps and see what you get
If you never let suckers talk you out shootin' your shot
Hustle with every breath, huh?
McQueen
Ounces of weed
Got your own

You ain't got enough niggas so you don't go nowhere
I got a crib out in California
I got a three-year old kid so I live out in California
But shit's real out in California
You take a loss, ayy, that's just how it is out in California
But anywhere niggas run up on ya

Back when I didn't have shit
Niggas act like they ain't know me

All of my potnas got phony
Everybody stop answering their phone
Nigga that shit was so lonely
I was scraping up $1.24 for a lil pack of bologna
Now I got the chips with the dip
And all these bitches back on me
Throwing hundreds in the air like Wilt
Cutting niggas off like Tony
If you ain't talkin' 'bout no money
Nigga turn down your convo
Kush got me like a mummy
Got my shirt off like Tonto

Grew up like "Boyz N the Hood," shit wasn't all good
And now my mom got a crib, the backyard is all woods 
Shoutout to Chevy and my brothers too
Uh, try to copy my style, but wasn't ready
I'm at the crib rackin' up plaques and buildin' Chevies
A lot of food stacked on my plate, I'm gettin' heavy
I came and took my spot in the game, no one let me
Now outer space is my destination
Stuck around niggas who showed love instead of hatin'
And gettin' money's my occupation, haha
Look at the time you wastin'
If you can't roll up a paper, leave it to me
Turn up the bass and wake up the neighbors, leave it to me
Makin' sure everyone's safe, leave it to me
6AM, gin shot straight, leave it to me
This exactly where I'm supposed to be
Hella weed, nothin' but real ones close to me
Get in the gym and never fold
Real peaceful nigga, but hands they don't wanna throw with me
Lotta legends been on the road with me
Really good aim, I don't use no scope
One shot and that's all she wrote I'm a boss in the game

What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
Throwin' tips to the distributors
Only focus is our kids and the culture we contribute to
Pull up book, invite the prime minister
Hundred black cars in a line, bulletproof, never dyin'
Gold pieces with diamonds to tell our time
All our women fine, team solid, never drop dimes
Came up out the sky with a Louis bag and a pound
Some pairs of Air Force Ones
I'll make a million dollars 'fore I'm done
Focused on funds, cars with engines in the trunk
We leavin' the venue drunk
They pointin', sayin' we livin' it up
Get as much as you give? Well, shit
I'm tryna give it all so I can get it back
Now Taylor Gang that
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my life
Since the first turkey bag, we ain't never look back
My nigga said he'd get the hotel
I said "Nah, I'll sleep on the couch," and that was that
We here right on time, hater, relax
Raw papers by the pack
Wakin' up neighbors
Was on the road for a couple months so I stacked
Taylor Gang, Jet Life, fill the walls up with plaques
Leadin' by action, rollin' weed up in a classic
Relaxin', leave the show with too much cash to spend
Get back to the pad
Remember days when niggas was doin' bad
Now our girls look like they doin' ads
Wasn't into sports or too into class
But all my chains look like your phone flashin'
New estate, the gate automatic
What I'm smokin' got me feelin'
Like we ain't ever comin' down tonight
And I came from the bottom, nowadays they see me winnin'
The Taylor way is how I live my lifeHow you want it? Now or later, I blow a pound of flavors
I'm always rollin kush, don't be with entertainers
This ain't just for the look, don't feel like I need favors
Don't play it by the book, occupation smokin' papers
When I pull up they look, cool with the cops and neighbors
I got these niggas shook, like helicopter chases
My car win races, my broad was racist
But now she wanna kick it, get her little brother tickets
I talk, I live it, I ball, I pivot
I go the distance, I'm so persistent
How I'm livin', stackin' millions
Rappin' to children, gettin' that pack in the buildin'
That real shit, I'm bringin' the feelin'
That bad bitch, she bringin' my meal in
My swag good, you think you could steal it
That bag good, I think it's a million
Count it up
Count the motherfuckin' money man
When's the last time you ran somethin'?
Never, motherfucka!
Ha ha ha ha
Matter fact, as long as you know how to roll in 2020, you good
You gang!
Ha ha ha ha ha ha
Who that is
Countin' up, keep the weed tucked
Got a bottle of that new McQueen stuff
Your bitch trippin', tell her ease up
You can see the ink when my sleeves up
It's hoes down, always g's up
Put some money down, Rollie freeze up
What would you do if you paid 4.5?
You would live comfortable too, decorate all of your rooms
I don't know why they assume, only make boss type of moves
They clout chase, I'm hardly amused, but I still try to be cool
I spend a thousand on shoes, I got a house with a pool
I got a mountain to move, she got a mouth, I recruit
If I'm gettin' paper, she count it up too
If I know the price, my accountant do too
I fly in a place, smoke a pound, and I'm through
All my niggas eat full, what happened to you?
Y'all niggas lookin' real sad
You look happy, but you look sad
All that partyin' and shit and buyin' shit
You just fillin' an empty motherfuckin' space
Some shit you wish you had
It's cool 'cause I know what it feel like 'cause I got it nigga
Yeah
I got itIt's that 
Damn, Pliz
There go your tag
I made everything I'm in, it's some exclusive shit
You ain't gotta test my diamonds 'cause they too legit
I just got rid of my wallet, all I need's a safe
On my grind twenty-four seven, I don't need a break
Front yard full of cars, I don't need a whip
Eighteen hour flight to China, we can take a trip
Pouring shots of McQueen, told her take a sip
Money long, this that Bokhara scent
I might drive my '62 with the gold rims
I might put the diamonds up and bring the gold in
I remember when I had a flip cell phone
Bad bitch, thick thighs and her hair long
New vibes, let her hop in, tell her test drive
Talkin' big, I don't keep the flex light
Turks and Caicos trips, we on the next flight
Seven hundred horses runnin' red lights 
Red lights , red lights 
Strippers know I'm tippin', see them red lights 
Red lights , red lights 
Walk up in it, kill these niggas, that's a grave site
I made everything I'm in, it's some exclusive shit

Steerin' wheel got a grip for drag, uh
New car, skrrt, might crash

Got no limit when I hit the gas
My engine go vroom, blast
When I cop don't look at the tag
Rear view, put him in the past
Switch gears like I switch my swag
Pop the trunk put the bag in it, I be lag switching when I skrrt-skrrt
840 horsepower, hit the gas, leave him in the dirt-dirt
Loyalty, love, and cars
Got a bad broad but I'm here when the bag talk
Better move off the road when we on the road 'cause we 'bout to turn you to asphalt
Yeah, my family like the mob
When I move the squad, we got a hundred-one rods
We got a hundred-one broads
Ain't in a Wraith, but we can look up at the stars
I say a prayer to God
Give Him my all, I can tell that you floss
Switch whips like I'm switching my car
Shittin' on him, I just came out a stall

She lit the first one up like you know who I am
My weed roller
She's only good for three blunts then it's over
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her
She know I need that weed as soon I come home off the road
To make it easy on me she got one already rolled
A nice long swisher
And shes a good twister
Yeah I got one that will roll my weed for me
And she don't smoke so that's more weed for me
No I can't front this shawty got me impressed
Make a cigarillo look like a cigarette
Shes my weed roller
And when I'm with her guarantee I'm never sober
She know exactly what I need she keep them swishers
The way she rolling up that weed I gotta keep her I gotta keep her(Alright, testing, testing, testing
Hey, is this thing on!?
Testing! Test... Is this thing on?
Can you hear me back there?
Yeah, well, then shut up!
Alright? Hey, listen)
Is that him in the studio?
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard ya grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that
Yeah, I move blocks to rude pops and dude drops
I'm too hot; mix J, Big, and 2Pac
So move not, I'm way big and dude shot
Your crew watch, I'm hot bitch and you not
I'm not a fake, not a
Nigga that'll pop shit about my cake, holla
Make dollars
But you perp, and you make nada
Not a man, not a cent, ho I stay propa
Fake scholar, they can let the tre 8's holla
And punk nigga, play dumb, get your face swallowed
You not a hustler, dogg
You don't know what a half a brick means
In rap, you'll get ate, like half of sixteen
I'll bash your team, dang I'm sickening
I'm dope, plus coke that'll smash your trip beam, man
Before them boys come and lump your face
With all that tough talkin', pump your brakes
Ease back shorty
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let you mouth write that
We ain't playin, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard you grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that
Uh, your rhyming's a waste can
I mean that it's basic, look
The Nin' to your face
It'll eat through your face, and then
I breeze through the place
No heat on my waist, but still
Will eat through your face
With knees at his face and grill
I'm on the move now, high price, big places
Leave a nigga like them hunneds, with the big face, and
Niggas try to act bad in them rare cases
Til that metal's in they mouth, like a pair of braces
Big bro talk slick up in them fake lines
Same time, he just another fruit up in the grapevine
You see I laugh, clock math, cause I take time
And you trash, bust ass than a waistline
And don't test, cause dude you'll be losing your breath
Got respect like I'm moving a Tec
And I advise you and your crew be doing your best
Try and get your mind right, or we'll be moving it left
Nigga
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard your grill
That's how it is, cause it's like that
You see it's rare that a nigga say he ball, and really got dough
Rare that he say he push coke, and really got blow
Common that he claiming that he thug, but he not though
And when do a nigga say he spit, and really got flow?
I ain't playing around
Not a gangster, but if you cross mine, I'll be laying 'em down
And you talk about poppin' your heat
But when the beef's on the real OG's will come and rock you to sleep, coward
In my advice you should think twice
Before you cross the path of a real nigga, live the street life
Who pull cards, and they reach for they heat, right
And you'll get smoked, like the trees in the peace pipe
Man, they put you in the dirt here
You steady throwin' up the set, but you ain't never put in work there
So all that talk about the gang you bang
Just stay in your lane, before a shot lay in your frame
These dudes better stay in they lanes
And keep they brains on the right track
Now you got a check that you can't cash
And you let your mouth write that
We ain't playing, man, the shit get real
Talk slick, get your life snatched
And don't rest, better guard your grill

Paper phasers is what they labeled us
Twelve whips plus, but this one is my favorite
Cooled up, playing my latest shit
Your girl tired of curated playlists
Nothing else to say, but let's get paid
We ain't promised tomorrow, so we live today
Different stroke, same weed, rolled in a J
Another tour planned, slave to make a million dollars on a stage
Stick to the script, we on the same page
And if I ain't do it yet, then you can bet
More diamond chains, Porsches, and Corvettes
Pullin' up to the set, get nothing but respect
Niggas fuck with the gang and love the Jets

Raise generations, we don't need awards
Ain't doing red carpets no more
Just send my shit straight to the crib if I win
Lately, I been going in, customizing rims

All this good weed that I'm puffing got me feeling
Like there ain't a place I can't go
Ain't a thing I won't do
And I'm awake
So I guess my dreams come true
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take away
Down to take a trip
My nigga, what's the ticket hitting for?
I got some hoes that wanna roll too
And if you wanna see what it's like to be just the team
And tired of the background, so you make your own scene
I'll hit you up when I roll through
Yeah, California weed
Keep a Pistolvania mind state
Hard to get it honest
So my niggas boost the crime rate
It's obvious I'm ghetto
Still they love me like I'm Kid Rock
Try your luck with what's around my neck
And get your wig chopped
Fucking with I, can get you so much cash
Or nowhere fast
I got your bitch in awe, she never flown first class
Or had the driver get her bags
And the game gave me a feeling
That no one can take away from me
I said no one can take away from me
On the road doing shows, oh no one can take away from me
I get a feeling that no one can take awaySledgren

First Flight on the way, but 'til it drops then

A new year, got a couple shows locked in
Couple of important folks doing some talking
I'm with the stars and niggas who go hard
Getting chavo
Niggas duckin' from rosado
Checking battery life now, charging my iPhone

I switch those like clothes
Charm like a computer with a virus cause mine's froze
Whoa

Spend a whole lot of cake on them Prada clothes
When you mention my name, they ain't gotta know
This for thinking they oughta know
I wanna thank yaYou see I run with them dudes, get loose with them pipes out
You sweet as ice cream, two scoops what your life bout

Flow like the Rope-a-Dope
Crack, call me coke to smoke
You niggas washed up and they ain't even started yet
A lot of new niggas coming out but I'm the hardest yet 
One I can fear, I ain't met an artist yet
Throw the lead, that'll roll his head right up off his neck
 
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I ain't gotta clap at 'em niggas scared of that black
Gettin' cake's what my life bout

I'm a hustler, cake is my lifestyle
And for the fam, takin' your lights out
You niggas want a problem you can get it
I'll take your wig, all of it get splitted
Leave your dome throbbin' in your fitted
My advice to you is just be cool
And that's for all of y'all
A pimp always with a bad chick like in Monster's Ball

Yea, the rap livin', crack spittin' bars and all
And your punch lines are hardly hard
It ain't the flow, its the fact you niggas broke that make me "hardy-har"
Wiz Khalifa leave your body scarred
Fuck your plans up
And if I can't get to you dog, I fuck your mans up
So just listen fag, most niggas quick to brag
Me, I'll get you zip and tagged
Dragged in a kitchen bag
Who you know keep it gudda as me
Popular, me so I'm floodin' the streets
Wolves hungry so I stay with my heat
They wanna slump me, leave me six feet deep
They want me cuffed doin' time up creek
I spit hot when I rap to the beat
I stay high off the limiest chief
Every day I be grindin' for cheese
In the club with the nine in my sleeve
Act tough and you could die when I squeeze
Got shooters in the weeds like I'm Vietnamese
They keep clappin' 'till them hammers go ding
My money long you could call me the king
Thought your man was gettin' money caught him pawning his bling
Niggas say they blood in like 'Ricans and Vatos
I'm hood in, hood out, like Dominicans papo
See y'all broke, on the block servin' fiends Dove soap
I keep the snub close, pop let the chrome glow
Shots in ya dome ho, chyea
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap
I'm the realest to run it, I just happen to rap

Heavy Hustle in this bitch
Yea, hahaha
Yup, yea
The way lil shorty go
I'm tryna think where I should take her
Watch her hit tha flo'
I'm out here spending all this paper
Bustin' cigarillos down
I blow it by the acre
If you lookin' this good
Well shit I wanna meet your maker
Take her
To my home
Say hello to my neighbors
She my biggest fan
I see her man just tryna save her
Put it in her mouth
And now my taste she's tryna savor
Shorty saying Khalifa Man
Should have his own flavor
Haters wanna be me
But can't walk in my Chuck Taylor's
All black eleven's
Mac-11 with the laser
Mami keep on shaking it
Like she a salt shaker
Hand on the ground
Everybody around
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'

Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'

Heavy Hustle Gang
Swisher Sweets with the jacuzzi

You don't like it, nigga sue me
Shawty from the hood
But in the club she actin' bougie
Body like a centerfold
Boy look at that loody
My ink got her gone
Wanting to know who tattoos me
Head game righteous
Said she'd like to ride, yeah
DJ play my song
When it come on she get excited
Before I leave the club

Swagger on some different shit

Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'
Yeah it's goin' down, it's goin' down
Watch her hit tha flo', watch her hit tha flo'Pop champagne, roll some weed up
We in a slow game, I brung the speed up
High-octane, hella' inked up
Bird or plane, you prolly seen us
Made a little change, but it's all good
Never throw it in your face, I'm from a small hood
Best dressed like a star should
Beat on so I could hardly see y'all
We are, some Taylor Gang fucking bosses
And I live every day, not caring what the cost is
Pop more bands, cop more clothes
Drive fast cars, fuck bad hoes
I fly in circles, you non-workers in dirt last
Reading tweets and falling asleep in first class
Might have heard my song, but lot of y'all ain't know the kid
So I took over the net like Hova did
And set my goals where the solar is
Now my swag on Polar Bear
And you here, so pretend your man don't even exist
And get your lips wet like a lisp
I'm dressed like a pimp, some dislike from them
But I'm a big fish, you just tiger shrimp
Flirted with fame, but at night I dream of success
If you sleepin' on me, then you gettin' good rest
Yes, cause when niggas' ask; Who hot?
If it ain't Drizzy, then they talkin' 'bout meNow I don’t mean to be rude
But every since I ran into you
I’ve been thinking about things I wanna do
I told you I’ve got a room, well
You said you tryna come through
And if your girl trippin’ then bring her too!
Cause I, I ain't gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Cause I, I ain't gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
One for the money, two for the show
Three rooms, four chicks who brought pounds to smoke
Five times in your city, now your town should know
Six bottles waiting, Seven time
And you know me, I’m VIP smoking tropical
Love the way my diamond shining like Mop and Glo
Take off, take off
She ready for take off
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off
And I live fast like the brakes off
Bigger cake in my bank bitch, bake-off
Your pockets on E, weight loss
My goons on top of the beef, steak sauce
And when I’m in the club I blind them hoes like Ray Charles
Used to be your old lady but you got laid off
Take off, take off
She ready for take off
The more you wear to the club the more you gotta take off
Now I don’t mean to be rude
But every since I ran into you
I’ve been thinking about things I wanna do
I told you I’ve got a room, well
You said you tryna come through
And if your girl trippin’ then bring her too
Cause I, I ain't gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Cause I, I ain't gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night long
Ain’t gon’ wait all night longI blow it by the O

Victory I envision, so my mission is to win
One look at my arm, she like "Wizzle, where your skin?"
Hatin' niggas talk, hear their whispers in the wind
But I don't wanna do 'em harm, so I kill 'em with my pen
Nicky Santoro, money don't bend
Root of all evil, guess my bank is full of sin
Couldn't be a suit and tie, tired of barely paying rent
Told them fuckers I'm doing numbers, so take it on the chin
Metabolism quick, so it's hard to see what I'm eatin'
Going on retreats and rollin' sweets while I'm tweetin'
Paradise for a weekend, then I'm back in the trap
Never dealt with any drugs, still the Task's on my back
Money on my mind, everything's strapped
You kiddin' and playin', I teach a class how to act
Somebody tell Youtube I prolly need a plaque
Couple hundred thousand views, and I did that on my Mac
'09's mine, '08 was great
They honored Kanye and paid Lil Wayne
Gucci did a bid, but came home and got straight
And every nigga in the biz did a song with T-Pain
No front page, but for those who did
I send 'em my best wishes, the industry's a bitch
That's why I'm on my shit, new luggage and a flip
Shooting movies all my life, no script, no script

OKAY!Fuck them corny niggas, best believe we get it poppin'
I just gotta talk, I'm clumsy so I'll probably drop it
Go figure, gettin' money so they try to stop it
I pull out a knot that's thicker than your father's wallet
Always had to work, all my nigga from the projects
Ballin', no alert, nope, we don't do no gossip
Too much for my shit, bro, I don't do no moshpits
She with me, she gettin' flipped like a fuckin' socket
Doobie in my shirt, 'nother OZ in my pants
Ice on my hands, melt it, help you water plants
Yours never dance, eyes like I'm from Japan
In my Benz, gettin' fried like I come from France
Money too wide for a rubber band
Runnin' in, tryna cure the hate that they sufferin'
From underneath the sun, tryn' catch a tan
Tour all summer, now I'm home hittin' sex again
Gettin' fresh, hundred mil, nuttin' less
Give me brain, pass the test
Smell the strain, they impressed
Ma, rest, told me "Change my address"
Always aim for the neck, if you miss, hit the chest
I'm well known for showin' them shit they didn't know
But if you Snapchatting or Instagramming, you gotta go
There ain't no one else like me that's in the game
Lightening in my chain, I'm icy as hockey games
Need a real one that don't like me 'cause of the fame
Hold my team down like a fight before the bell ring
Ain't no refund when you cop, so what you payin'?
Ain't no details for the cops so what you sayin'?
You went from food to starvation 'cause y'all hatin'
See what I got? That's all patience and God's amazing
See what I came out of dawg? That should be motivation
Now all I think about's broad chasing and car racing
Money so long, my arm shaking, the foreign banking
I'm off the shore, flow so hot, I could spar with Satan
I open doors with my voice so  my face is
Rollie mixed race, got a big face
Gotta get cake, brought a big plate
Prada windbreak, thought I went late
Now that Benz skate, down the interstate
How'd I get great? Not a mistakeIf that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, pussy, dope and bankrolls
Pussy, dope and bankrolls, you know how this game go
Bitch been sellin' pussy, lookin' for them rookies
Man your bitch is took in if I catch Her lookin'
She just wanna come with me and smoke on this Cookie
I think all these bitches gay and all these niggas crooked
On my way to Cali smokin' on some Cali
Mo' money, mo' problems when I'm in the valley
I swear I love the dough, I swear I love to count it
I can tell you everything you need to know about it
What's beef to a nigga ridin' with a chopper?
Money on my mind, ain't thinkin' 'bout a robber
Run up on this Bentley you gon' need a doctor
I just have my lil' homie hop out, pop it and drop you
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself
Do it by myself, I don't need no help

If I wasn't a boss don't know what I'd be
Was 19 years old in the club with no ID
I just need to flex, then she comin' home with me
All-A-All about the money, that's the only thing
Married to the game, I don't need no wedding ring
She wanna fuck a rapper, that's her biggest dream
Might get out on you, but she ain't foolin' me
In a week I might just take down two or three
Takin' trips to Vegas, I'm a major player
Smokin' kush in papers, I don't fuck with fakers
Put that pussy on a platter, she's a waitress
It ain't 'bout the money, I'm like see you later
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself
If that bankroll all 100's, it speak for itself

Swear to God, I'm fresh to death
Bitches got you hypnotized, see it in your damn eyes
Niggas out here kickin' doors lookin' for the grand prize
See, I'm just lookin' for the baddest bitch to fuck tonight
She wanna give it up to me cause you ain't fuck her right
Shawty actin' like her fingers all she want is pipe
This my last day in town, she wanna fuck all night
But I'ma fuck and kick her out, then call another one
Yea, I'm a nasty boy so I need to double up
The world is filled with hoes, nigga, get you one
If player-hatin' was a sport you would be number one
If that pussy good it's gon' sell itself
If that dope A1 then it's gon' sell itself

Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough, they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
Now I made my way in the game
So much money, don’t know how a nigga stayin’ the same
I’m too straight, I get high all day, I take it straight to the brain
I stay fly all week, like seven days on a plane
Came here to spend it not leave with it
Got KK rolled up, let my team hit it
Some Bombay, let’s sip ‘til it’s mayday
That fuck shit don’t play
I had so much champagne up in the club
And I ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home, home
So won't you take me home? Yeah

So won't you take me home? Yeah
Yeah, keep the good times rollin’ and the champagne pourin’
On the plane and I don’t know where I’m goin’
Make sure my team keep ballin’ and the hoes keep callin’
And the money keep fallin’ on the floor
Where you tryna go, only care about what’s in your drink
Say you tryna go hard, don’t think about tomorrow
Don’t care about what people think
You don’t care about waitin’ outside
You be with everybody up in the front
You yellin’ “Face down, ass up” up in the club
And now we turning up 
I’m in the club rolling weed like I’m Marley
Smoking dearly departed
That’s kill, too real, come to me, get it started
And the bottles be poppin’ like it's 4th of July
We just pourin’ them shots, back shooting corks in the sky
Pouring some for the girls and pouring more for my guys
Cause we made it my niggas, I just wanna thank my niggas
Hear them niggas talking shit, but they ain’t my niggas
Now we rollin’ up, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting drunk, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Crashing a party, stayin’ out all night
Stayin’ out all night, stayin’ out all night
Getting this money, stayin’ out all night

Rolling joints up with laser precision
I got major decisions to make
Whether to get the Maybach or just chill
My niggas is real in the feel
Blow so much marijuana smoke the smell's still in the ceiling
Owner said the club closed but we still in the building
Pullin' foreigns outside and stuffin' women up in 'em

She half Sicilian, her family don't even like blacks

Let me borrow the Lambo and the path familiar
Got every game on Xbox
Don't need to get dressed, when I come over it's sweats and socks
Them other niggas say they like the Taylors, just stop
Cop a new pad, and smoke one for the life that we never had 
Cop a new whip, and smoke one for the shit we could never get 
Cop a new chain, and smoke one for the time we wanted better days 
Gettin' dollars makes sense, me and my dog worked hard
So we don't mind spendin' just a little bit 
Actin' like a nigga that ain't ever had
Pull up in a foreign with the paper tag
This a Rolls Royce bitch, not a Jag
Keep a closet full of unpopped tags
Niggas bring that bullshit, they get zapped
Never chasin' bitches, I be gettin' cash
My roof in the trunk, joint full of skunk
My speakers blast like they from 12 gauge pump
Nigga your crew on the stump, ain't got a bag in months
Nigga my crew on the hunt, get everything we want
We was wilin' when we was young , Taylor Gang or get jumped
Jet Life, all you is a chump, knew we was the ones

New Orleans where I'm from, motherfucker like what
Cop a new pad, and smoke one for the life that we never had 
Cop a new whip, and smoke one for the shit we could never get 
Cop a new chain, and smoke one for the time we wanted better days 
Gettin' dollars makes sense, me and my dog worked hard
So we don't mind spendin' just a little bit Everything Taylor, dumb fuck

Kiss they cousin, ewww

You lil niggas can't touch this
And I'm too legit to quit, Uh
Too much grip to trip, the weed I'm smoking on be like six a zip
The car I'm driving cause me a tick
To whip all these diamonds and be on me being ridiculous
And it's all this grinding got me on the millions list

Gang gang gang gang
Gang gang gang gang gang
Gang gang gang gang
Gang gang gang gang gangThats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me
Listen close here youngin'
See Ive been doing this here the most fed coming 'chea
And not a dude that a post here frontin
See niggas pay attention to mine
You listen and find, you gone hear something
I know niggas wanna know how I came up
He only 18, they see him stacking his change up
And alot of niggas chose to get in the game
Bat difference from you damn pricks
The prince was hand picked
The young guy is about as fly as it can get
They want I, cause I supply and demand quick
I'm C4 explosive is how your man spit
And I got a seat for anyone who can't stand it
I ain't chose the game, the game chose me
A little fame from the rap, but still the same OG
Cause when I came in it, cats said I stayed lowkey
But always making sure they know me
Thats when the game told me
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me
And you know I can't get enough, it's like I got a fetish for it
Too many wack MC's for me to just ignore it
I get on track simply to flood the state with heat
Stack my cake and eat, preaching more then they the streets
Seen them teens drop out the bumping the corner
Money and order, so they dont even want their diploma
Me, I'm trying to make a company owner
So while that may be tempting, this rap shit is bringing the ends in
And some say that  there will be no one greater than him
One day that  non believers, I'll convince em
I'm more of a leader and eating like im supposed to
Talk by the older dude, stand on my own two 
And im deep in the game, not like I toasted be
I get somewhere if a lane, they took over me
Somewhere down the line, the grind molded me
It's so sick and this what the game told to me
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told me
Now I'mma take you back to '97
I put in work to grind better
I was now with a rhyme fetish
Aged quicker, and seeing things in a different way
Was fourteen when I figured I had some shit to say
So I let it be known
That the tighter with top spitter
I'm coming for em, ready to own
And if somebody better let em be shown
I'm a comptetitive dude
Plus I'm ten steps ahead of you fools
They say
Thats what the game told me
Ain't nothin change, still the same man, the game chose me, sing
You know the game chose me
Ain't nothin change, this is what the game told meUh
Gotta have a plot to get it
This life, it costs a lot to live it
So you gotta watch the competition
Stay on point, make executive decisions
Never switch when the rest of 'em different
That money put us in the best of positions
Always maintain leverage, keep ice in the beverage
Go car shopping 'stead of clothes
You like it you get it
My closet filled with all types of shit
It's bad you'd probably work your whole life for this and I'll get it in one night
Win some lose some, my car ill as they come
And I'm 'bout to build another one soon as I'm done
I'm putting it right on the street
You know what's going down when Taylor Life 
Jet Gang hook up with Monsta Beatz
Audio dope supply the needs
Fiends itching, sniffing for new audio feeds
This how it outta be
More often, too stoned highed up bosses with good intentions to see each other winning
Taking no shorts or losses but I know that we a rarity
Something they'll never see
'Til our sons click up and commence to hustling heavily
Sacrifices made, now we sitting in them better seats
And I ain't even watching the game
I just came to floss this outfit, now I'm on national TV
Sitting court side playing my Nintendo Switch
With a Nike headband fresh from 1996
Kicks sick, collection quarantined
Deadstock 23's or some bathing apes I'm sure you haven't seen
Every verse is like a key
Could turn you to a boss if you don't know D 
Drunk on power, gold bathroom fixtures and marble showers
2009 'til the end of time, its all ours
Keep the E in it
Chevy gon' switch
Nigga, we smoking weed in it
Laughing in our pictures
And I wouldn't talk about it
If nigga didn't live it
If you need to see it then you come visit
Or you can ask one of your bitches
If she bad, she probably kick it
Taylor Gang and Jet LivingD-D-D-Dame Grease on this motherfucker
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I'm with my dawgs, they with me all the time
We gon' stay the same 
And we all go
When we got something to prove
We stuntin' everywhere we go 
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I forgot me back on my grind, makin' major moves
Is it real? So you niggas so you know I ride with you
Money, we just have to stunt so I'm goin' hard
NBG, know I gotta do it for the squad
Y'all 'ready know that it's free Max B
I live what I spend, homie, check the rap sheet 
I had to make a change just to make a lil' change 
It's in my bloodline, I'm addicted to the game
Focused on the music, no more goin' to the pen'
Taylor waves stunt hard, bitch, tell a friend
I'm with my same niggas, keep my circle nice and small
I won't stop until I'm worldwide with my dawgs
Take my momma out the hood, I make her smile now
I'm doin' right, there's no longer livin' foul now
Hit the road, run it, homie, there is no lookin' back
Y'all playin' games, I'll be chasin' bigger stacks
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I'm with my dawgs, they with me all the time
We gon' stay the same 
And we all go
When we got something to prove
We stuntin' everywhere we go 
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind 
I got change to make 
Nights like this
I just roll one and twist
All the hate don't exist
I bet my name is on the list
You can have anything when you're rich
Pulled up high to the event
Made it out of the abyss
Now I'm all the way content
You can always repent
It's all about your intent
If you want it, just come in
Plus you gotta represent
Don't be thinkin' past tense
Stay focused like a lens
Get money with your friends
And do it all again
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I'm with my dawgs, they with me all the time
We gon' stay the same 
And we all go
When we got something to prove, we stuntin' everywhere we go 
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
The all-white mink represents the grind 
 in the kitchen resembles my mind 
At it all night with no hesitation 
The shit behind the pain got a combination
The million dollars fly in the stage box 
Never gon' broke, that's why we stash rocks 
You always doubted me, now we made it
You're fake right in front of you, you just gotta take it 
All my life I thought I'm blessed with a curse 
But you just gotta stay humble
Take a step back and vision the growth
'Cause it's nice tossin' and turnin' in my sleep 
Searchin' for the meaning, but never too deep 
I get a blank sheet, tryna scribble down my feelings 
I let go and let God, that's a perfect healing 
If you could read my mind and the stress I've been dealin'
You would appreciate the grind
And the way is appealin', get up and get out and go for it
The ball in your corner, don't drop it, just score it
The lost blessin' on your side
Don't you ever ignore it
Gotta get on my grind and search for it
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I'm with my dawgs, they with me all the time
We gon' stay the same 
And we all go
When we got something to prove
We stuntin' everywhere we go 
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
Yaş on dört, tam boksör, yıpranmadı boynuzlar
Gece yok, uyku yok, arka arkaya soygunlar
Yaş ilerledikçe sırf, pislik işte doyumlar
Artık gerek kalmadı, dünya çaplı oyunlar
Dolu kar olsa bile, yoldaşlar hep yanımda
Ghettodan selamlar, kırmızı-beyaz kanım var
Yıka çıkmaz lekeler geçse seneler, bize geceler
Dipten gelen şimdi tepede
Çeteler sardı her yeri, bi' nefes al keder
Son nefes al yeter hep musallattı şer, kan kusana bi' sel
Var mı sevaplara yer?
Var mı cevaplara yer?
Var mı yorulmadan ter?
Omuza karga, geri salla
Gir garda, yine darla
Yüksektir gelen dalga
Yürektir bunu anla
Yere balta, dolu çanta
Nakit gerisini salla
Geldiğimiz yeri unutmayız
Bedeli öderiz canla
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make 
I'm with my dawgs, they with me all the time
We gon' stay the same 
And we all go
When we got something to prove
We stuntin' everywhere we go 
I gotta go, gotta get on my grind
I got change to make Uh, yeah
She always in the latest
It gotta be something about her, I can't do no basic
Need us annihilate then, that's just to keep it player
Been getting money, don't be stupid, can't do me no favors
I got this project chick always play Lil Wayne
I think she tryna drive me crazy, told her stay in her lane
They always told me it was fire when it came to that 'caine
Yeah I was serving hard in like James and kept a rocket
Way too G'd up, feet up, light the weed up
I took his honey from him, she told me you wan' be us
He had a buzz, that was a light year
With 20-20, you pussy, we see it quite clear
I hit your BM in her DM then had her with me by PM
Stevie Wonder, I get money off keys and never see 'em, uh
Ain't saying shit, boy, you all talk
And ain't no prices ever dropping over here, this ain't WalmartStarted small with nothing
Now I got it all
I still want more
Who say I can't have that too?
You feel me..
Foot on the gas, both hands on the steering wheel
Jumped in the game, 'cause I know it's real
Heard it'll change you, I know it will
Gatting still, we made it over the hill
Being broke, I know how it feel
All about a dollar bill
And seeing my son grow up
See, they ain't know what they focus was
That's when I see my lane open up
Drinking champagne on boats
So drunk that I'll probably spend a month sober
Little more famous but a lot older
Been through situations, niggas acting bipolar
You don't always keep it real with me, I don't know ya
Say they good intentions, but they not even close
Say they got sick of whips, but i'm driving the most
Nigga I be on my shit, you ain't gotta provoke me
Fuck you talking bout it
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door
All I know is I been here before
Blew that smoke in the air before
Smell like dope in the airport
I'm the one that they're cheering for
Lotta kush smoke, that's what they preparing for
Gave you solid shit before now you hearing more
Seeing my niggas on top that's what I stand for
And only money conversations what I care for
And anytime you eat just know you gotta share yours
Them niggas out to get you, claiming they down
Shit change when you turn around
So it's no love for them
It's only papers when I roll up
Focus on the money now and not later
Ain't got the time to play
Thirteen cars in the driveway
God telling me keep going
One foot on the gas, two hands when I'm rolling
Getting mine and staying focused
You know it ain't like it was before
I know it feel like I've been here before
We know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door....
Hit the bank and I'm counting more
I know to the top's where we can go
You know that it's all about the dough
What that mean
If it ain't we out the door
So you really need all those?
That's how much you gon smoke?Let me set it straight, cake like a heavy weight
Still got a squad of crews moving that heavy weight
I'm past most of you lames, brake fast off in the lane
You just ashamed cause you playin' and I'm coaching the game
Hat cocked to the side, wide birds flock to the guys
Ride that Glock to ya side, flyin' that hospital ride
I'm bout my money dummy, so we can take it there
All you need is 4, 5 niggas so we can make it fair
Can't compare, I'mma go hard till a nigga drop
Bigga chain, hundred cars, Starbursts is in the watch
I, with these bars and lines, I dun' scarred some minds
Great plus the baby face got the whores in line
But the difference is wit yours and mine
I'm with a group of tens, friend, it's the march of dimes, yeah
Cause I'm the lady lover, crazy since the 80's fucka
Nasty flow, scrappy no, hate or love us, baby brother
If rap was movin' packs, I'm servin' pounds now
Yeah, you hot in ya hood, I'm burnin' towns down
My main purpose to surface and switch the style round
The game's turned to a circus, too many clowns now
So move with the pump, grab your tools, split your blunts
Cruise with the crews that'll bruise if they hit you up
See I'm the cake'o'holic tryna' make this paper brolic
Trip or scrap, listen this a wrap, man it's safe to call it
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"
Oh no keep an eye out for the po-po
Bigger raps make my figures stack like a totem pole
Bigger stacks so to bigger gats on the road, yo
Spittin crack, sick of niggas act like you don't know
Sittin' back, twistin' somethin' fat, it's that hydro
I know, it's a wrap, creepin' through the side door
Wiz Khalifa murk the game, youngin' but my mind grown
It's a keeper worth some change, youngin' leave ya mind blown
And when the winter get cool, I switch the time zones
You's a beginner, you fool, the dumbest I've know
You steady frontin' and rhymin', say you puttin' ya time in
Claimin' that you in diamonds but they rhinestones
See I'll crack a man, I don't wanna clap a man
So I put the cheese on ya head like a Packer fan
A hundred niggas in all black gon' pack a van
Hop out and get the shit to clappin' like in Pakistan
See I'll pack a stand, say you deep but know you not
Bubble music blowin' pop, pause, I'm as hard as rock
All you other artists stop braggin' on the DVD
Fag is what you seem to be and tragic what it means to me
Laughin' when I see you be, askin' if you think it's me
Relaxin' with my faction and we stackin' cheese repeatedly
And chicks dig the kid, cook, clean, and ride for me
Birds flock cuz I'm hot, stop you see a flying V
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"
My weight's up how I handle these beats
So wake up, I'm the man in these streets
Cause Wiz Khalifa got that
Fast to that slow flow, cash gettin' mojo
Say ya rap, niggas play it back they like "Oh no!"Yeah, too drunk to even talk in this bitch

But in my case never complained, never simped
Especially nowadays cause now I'm payed in a bitch
Hopping off that plane, somewhere I already been
The menu come in english, but the waiters speaking french
And haters ain't convinced
I ain't mad at em
I also made a 100K today and then laugh at em
I'm smokin on the bag that a nigga then have to stash
I payed cash for it, even my OG niggas be passin on it
My outfit always on some dumb shit
Yeah I'm that ignorant
And keep my camera man with me cause I'm that historic
Bank account enormous

Not to mention, got a closet full of that Dior shit
Niggas claimin that they new
Nothin new they bore me

Horses in my bet
Porsches growlin' loud, big money portions
You made it off the porch, I let nature run its course

And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
And please don't pretend like we homies scram
Where was all this love at when I was only Cam?
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?

And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand

Im tryna have the strip all whipped out
Crib all pimped out
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out
Waiting for that one time, a rap nigga dig her out
But you gone have to slow up love
Tryna skee cause she think ima blow up cuz
All she thinking me getting her nails done, and her hair done
Ma I'm not the one
Ion need no chick plotting all my chips
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, its..
"Never too late, too late to stop stop"
"Cause I wan't to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody, because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself , we have to understand that"
I'm tryna have the city on lockdown
Fam off the block now
Money coming fast, more cash then the cops now
Would harass, but they can't really not now
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
I used to rap for the kids in class
Told em I would use rap just to get my cash
And I was only worried bout how to get my math
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
Cause I can't find a interest in my book
So I stayed to myself in every class I took
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks
Cause I get motivation everywhere I look
And I show no regret for any chance I took
But I learn from mistakes just like I should
So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools its..
"Never too late, too late too stop stop, never too late, too late to stop stop"Gold bottoms, everything trill
White cup, hand full of pills
Got the money so the bitches chill

And me I'm so high, I'm flying defying physics
I'm wearing hundred dollar draws no flaws
Wizzle on the hands free call, young boss
Blackberry ringing, Sidekick buzzin'
Got my money right, can't tell me nothin'

In your city, every state, with my Taylor Gang family
Yup, this good living got me open
Make you feel like you took a hit of what I'm smoking
The high life, yeah that's my life
And it's possible to die twice
But you only live once, so I'mma live it up
Pop bottle after bottle, rolling kush filled blunts
I feel like I've been chosen
And I dont fix it if its broken, I buy a new one
The way I blow hundreds
Make people say they should of never gave niggas money
If you was me, I guarantee you'd do the same thing
Cop anything when you want it
They say fame's the most dangerous drug
I played with it, now I can't get enough
And came up - a customer
But now I'm the supplier

In it with my thugs, spendin' dubs like no tomorrow

Saw me in the club once, shawty got a crush now

I look at you and tell you to get right like me
And check your main broad because she might like me
Waitin for the right time and tonight might be 
She say she want a nigga with that moola and that guap

You shouldn’t listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince
I'm sick with the spit
You pissed I get chips for this shit
This for my homies that be OT, whip full of bricks
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride
I'm ahead of my time
I'm a threat to you guys, why?
I’m still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich
I’m fresh cause we don't sound like that other bullshit
My team hustle, no days off
And weigh so much salt
That you might have to take a snow day off
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you
See Wiz Khalifa’s like a teacher I could show you to
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S
But like you're under 21 you can't fuck with my bars
Ask about me the streets think im the youngest in charge
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads
And if its on then im crushing them all
You niggas prolly right
When you say that I ain't fUckin with y'all, dogg
I’m on a paper chase, moving unit state to state
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating of a paper plate
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate
I see you playin with me, its different, its not a game
I’m moving heavy in the trenches
Best flow, back door
When I knock any nigga senseless
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to meO.N.I.F.C. drops August 28th

Sittin on the bank , nigga what you think I'm rollin up that dank for my nigga tom hanks chillin on that island

Young Wiz Khalifa man
California grapes, I'm breaking fine wines
Me I'm sky high, my bitch down to earth
Money in the bank, weed roller in her purse
And I ain't slackin on the job, my dog I been alert
Been gettin cake, bank being the verb
Big numbers on the net so niggas show love
And the diamonds on my neck should make these hoes trust
On the road, at the venue filled with model hoes
College shows, smokin grade a honor roll
Bad broad, light skin, hood niggas, white friends
And I ain't gotta talk much, it's in your face
Give me brain, cause she say she got expensive taste!
Let her rub my tattoos, now she flyin'
Smokin' zig zags too, nigga rap like crack so I

Malik...Md7
Too Mucking Fuch lets go
Turn off my BB and my HTC
Please don't interrupt me when I'm smoking THC
I'm out to prove, what I'm about to do with this ounce of food 
First class flights, higher altitude
Lead astray by the hash tray
I am half baked
If there's no smoking sign I'mma eat my hash cake
Only with my back up, I'm out to get paid
And I roll my spliffs backwards, the Amsterdam way
Hey, hey!
Got mental health problems, forget it!
I will give you two draws, you will turn schizophrenic
This smell of your police, pull us over for the hell of it
But fine often, cause we smoked out for the evidence
Inhale, exhale, on smoke...
There was big on... then I used to roll spillfs
Get the whole sip, now I'm in the days
On the... 'till I drift away
I'll be on it, on it all night
Yeah, that's super strong
Down to the last...
I don't know, should I roll, should I hit the bong
Paint the town red like the soles on the loboutins
Hydroponic , home grown  
We're playing chronic, this is a smoke zone
Rolling flower power joints, nose cones
If I light this shit up I'm fucking up the ozone
I smoke that... is legit
Just a hit make you twitch like smoking on friday
Live your life, that's what I say
... while we speed, that's the highway!
Let's go!...
You can smell it through my pocket
Country boy from illinois yea im a pothead
Hyrdoponic you can smeell it through ya pocket
It ain't tricking if you got it, girl I got bread
Anybody feel like rolling up a blunt of kush?
I would, but she got me sleeping, feeling good
Sick of position body stiffer than a brick of wood
That's me feeling like a real nigga should
I'm addicted so consistent lets roll up another
Light green swisha sweet casa loma suites in the d
You know the ones wit the upstairs
When im powered up I devour blunts doing what I gotta do until a mothafucka
Up there, up where in the air you can't come up here
Real players do whatever that they want here...
Moving quicker than jamaicans in the fast lane
I'm babysitting, don't forget to tell em pass mane
Break it down, roll it up
Break it down, roll it up
Br-break it down roll it up
Calliko, Wiz Khalifa, roll up in there!Listen, I came in the game feet first
Hit the ground runnin, a hustler 'till I meet dirt
Gotta be consumption I'm pumpin, the people need work
Love the niggas frontin' I came from nothin and seen worse
The long-armed Khalifa reachin with each verse
I got that food for your thought, plus what the streets thirst
And you can ask around the haters'll know
I'm tame with the flow, I'm sorta like the jaeger and blow
I see the dream like a Martin Luther, I preach to the constitution in peace
But violate it, get that ass annihilated
I'm on the grind, money is time so why waste it
And everything but my piss clean, I'm high maintenance
You niggas are weak, sweet like one of them Now and Laters
The cannon blast your candy ass if you try and hate it
I made it, cause I stayed a couple steps ahead of y'all and
A hundred percent, since benji got the bread involved I'm
Lovin this shit, come fuck with the prince
I'm leavin heads hollowed like them things stuffed in the clips
And the streets gon' remember this cat name, I'm beatin the rap game
Just like nigga huggin the strip 
Cause that's how a hustler do, fall back I don't fuck with you
We make it happen the clappin know we can scrum with you
Yeah we can take it to the heads, give you a lump or two
A fool is still, team bring heat like a oven dude
Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up
This is pure skill, far from damned luck
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up
And man up, to positively stand up
Once again the youngest sin came to drop the hammer
How could a bystander feel that this is not bananas?
We earn stripes, you all hype in that propaganda
Gats spot, you cats shot, but not from cameras
Back Glock, cause snap shots'll stop your plan up
Stuck in my ways, the haze taste like tropicana
Thinkin the days of way back, people will say that
The youngin was gifted sick when he stayed back
Now the people listenin play back, I got it made
Obligated to gettin passin grades and blaze tracks
You'll be amazed at how I make units move
Self-made, twelfth grade, boy I'll take you to school
I'm through the streets of pistolvania where my goonies move
 can't miss these trucks with the rims on them
And you can find me speedin, listenin to Big and Em
Fresh outta class with the weed tucked in my Timberlands
Ladies stand up, gentlemen stand up
This is pure skill, far from damned luck
You gotta make a plan to never give your man up
And man up, to positively stand upUh! I'm smoking right now..
Adjust my Louie V vision
Fall up in the spot
As long as me and my gang get in
Every nigga I came with, came to spend chips
On popping champagne and tipping waitresses
G’d up, what you think this is?
Put your feet up, this the fast, life mama speed up
Pop the cork, roll the weed up
Nowadays ain’t fucking with the bar
Still ain't nothing changed but the horses in my car
Usually ain’t into showing hoes where I live
But tonight we gon’ go to my crib
Be on your toes, your boyfriend smell that weed on your clothes
He don’t know what I did, drop you off at your whip
Work by 8, almost 6, plus your nigga calling
Think he starting to catch wind
Look at your phone, press end
Can’t hurt him with what he doesn’t know
Plus you figure we’re both grown, come on
Money ain’t a thang
Tell the waitress call and bring a bottle for every nigga that’s here with me
That’s the kinda G-Shit I’m on
G-Shit I’m on, G-Shit I’m on
Got niggas rolling weed
Bitches with their hands in the air
Tell the DJ damn that’s my song
I ain’t trying fall in love with you
Let me fill your cup then find our way home
High off the life I’m living
Rooftop you gonna need binocular vision
Order a few shots and them things that you say you do not do
You probably gonna give in
Say it’s wrong, I call it a statement for the mission
To get you high as you want, break dress code
Skip the line to the front
Ride top down, fire the skunk, soon as the dooby get down
Roll another one
Need a couple of you, bring my brother one
The bitches can’t roll weed, I ain’t fucking with them
That’s just real shit, spend Vegas chips, all expense paid trips
Buy the champagne and spill it, we don’t save a sip
And you here with me in VIP taking risk
Home girl saying shit like "Rosé my favorite"
Plus I’m rolling up all this weed you ever smell
Weed in your hair, weed in your nail, she under a spellSo just lay down for me
Stay down for me

I like to welcome y'all to rock with PG's youngest ball
From the bottom of the pot, yeah I'm the Pitts of the Burgh
With the kids on the curb, and small time, is pitching the herb
I'm back, and those who didn't previously know what i'm crack
To the people, I'm legalized the lethal
We all got problems involving the root of evil
But they caught me non-dodging, long arming the people, yup!
And for the record, I ain't no half stepper
I rose from the city of steel, the streets greedy for real
Cats chasing their paper, that's basic
Mathematics, hate to run the streets but took a staff at it
As I look back at hard it seems
I remember when this music thing was all but a dream
But I'm here for my city
And can't name no one that's near fucking with me

Went and seen the doctor tryna find me a prescription
Told him since an early teen all I seen the color green
He said it ain't nothing wrong, probably wasn't listening
Listening, out of town
I'm anywhere the paper be
Grandma tell me go to church somebody need to pray for me
So I leave and go and see the preacher he said "holy smoke!"
See I'm nothing like you, my pockets got the holy ghost
From that side of town where you can get for the shorty low
Fuck about a price tag everything's affordable

And when brotherhood come first then the line
Will never be crossed established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn and that line is what
We reach so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gonna be with me for the last ride

Now my pockets is full and I'm still riding slow
What goes on in my head, don't nobody really know
I'm in the light, all on my life get put on display
Nothing to call my own, ducking, dodging everyday
Put that camera phone away and keep it real with me
Time to time again I'm searching for reality
And feeling so alone
Alone again 
Alone...
I'm smoking that weed everyday but never hide my faith
They calling my phone, I don't even got the time a day
Don't know their motives anymore that's why I hesitate
I'm tired of partying, getting drunk, I'm trying to elevate
I remember back in the day, I ain't had no cash
I was coming up off of nothing hoping it would last
Now it's 2015 and I got it all
Feeling like I did, when I started on my own
Out here all alone
Alone again 
Alone...
No use looking out
It’s within that brings that
Lonely feeling
Understand that when you leave here
You’ll be clear
Among the better menHah, good one, Richard
Z cooking on the track
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it
They say I smoke too much, I say I don't smoke enough
You ain't dealing with what I'm dealing with, bruh
Remembering when the crib I lived in didn't look like this
The carpet had burn holes, nigga, we was in there smoking
And thinking on how to grab us some mid
Me and my dog was close to going half on a chopper
And like a pound of weed and just lockin' in and gettin' it
But then lightening hit
Wasn't trying to change the world
But we fucked around and did it
Kept all my cars, but I kept trading in woman
Neon lights spell out my company name on the side of the building
It's going down in my life, baby girl, but I really be chilling
Reminiscing, lost wages, bum deals
I should've ran magnifying glasses on them pages and that's for real, yeah
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase it
Give it all back to my son, millions plus one
I don't do 'less it's fun, to focus the funds
I remember taking trips with weed in the trunk
Now police don't even trip when we rolling up
Legal stunts, got a pound with each our name on it
Setting up the family, that's the main focus
Game polished, did our best to keep these lames off us
Turned down what the labels offer
Now everything in our name
Influenced the game with our slang
Its all a hundred percent, never changed
All my niggas stay solid as the friend
You broke, won't never fix you again
Some of them supposed to go, some of them supposed to stay
I ain't tryna ruin yours, I'm tryna make a way, yeah
I be at the top, that's my favorite place
That money gonna come, I don't gotta chase it
Them bitches gonna come, I don't gotta chase em
I'ma keep getting love, I don't gotta chase it
Diamonds in my chain, watch, and my bracelet
Got love for all my dawgs, I don't gotta chase itSo real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa 
More McQueen chilled up 
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' 
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard they on me and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I’m at work while you goin' on vacation there
We smokin' on the shores in Jamaica
Versace robe, Balenciaga windbreaker
Come to weed, I own acres
You niggas fallin' off, need replacements
We each own our Porsche down the streets racin'
Gotta keep one eye out for leechers, swingin' for the bleachers
Bad bitch with some real features
Waitin' for my time I ain't reachin'
Joint filled up with bomb weed
Can't walk a mile in my sneaks
I'm stoned on an island full of freaks
My niggas got millions on they mind, drink liquor all the time
Fuck bitches in they prime
Drive car with switches, count tons of riches
Always stay committed
Gettin' on the plane, make sure my company name bigger
Roll up the strain, turn on the beat and I pain't picture
They understand me and see me clear as a movie is
Value the process, wether I lose or win
Jheeze, my wrist below thirty degrees
Weed from California, my bitch come from Belize
Rollin' trees, there ain't a seat in here
Tryna get y'all to think the same way as the millionnaires
When it's all said and done, we the niggas who never run
They spendin' up all the funds, gotta save for my son
The waittress just hit the bottle, we poppin' off everyone
Smokin' weed and the motto was all that we got is trust
So real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa 
More McQueen chilled up 
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' 
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard the  and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I map work while you goin' on vacation there
Sixteen hours flight to Brazil
When I get there shit is real
Got a lot of beautiful women
But they money's what appeal to me
I know exactly how it feel
Say I've been here before, I know to me it ain't enough
Games I don't play with 'em
They be so mad 'cause after I fuck I don't stay
Fuck around, got another one on the way
If she give me an attitude
I'm killin' stage, the crowds of fans that would laugh at you
I'm rollin' up, while you can't smoke, I'ma pass a few
We gettin' money, the niggas with me they havin' too
Eatin' steak and shrimp, hotels tell us that we can't smoke, ain't that a bitch?
Come to my room and we gon' blow the whole zip
Security might come up but they won't trip
And if they do, I'ma walk out and I'ma talk to that nigga like
"Hmm, it's nice to meet you sir, I'm Young Khalifa
If you don't mind, I'ma spark this weed up
I know you got some family members you can call that I can take a picture for, yeah I'll be glad to meet 'em
It ain't my fault, you can take it or leave it
You smell the kush, so it's not a secret"
Ain't the one you wanna look around and you ain't on the team with
I'm a boss, I be on some G shit
So real I
Said fuck the suite, get the villa 
More McQueen chilled up 
Now I'm smokin' making 'em uncomfortable
When we step in the buildin' 
Hunnid dollars bills pounds on the flight conceal
Heard the  and they worried 'bout my paper trail
I map work while you goin' on vacation there
They don't make 'em like they used to
The way me and my gang move around the world like we ain't got a thing to prove
Why you worried about who's who?
We takin' trips goin' to beaches
And spend the money on dinners and places we thought we'd never be
Experiencin' things we thought we'd never see
Was hated on heavily
Now our girls look heavenly
And you can tell it's me, just by the smell
Our own kush to inhale, the McQeen shots to celebrate the times when we couldn't be here
Rollin' up another paper to elevate my mind
Not knowin' if the owner's cool or not
I just got a show to do and a bunch of fans to meet
So if I'm not in my best mind state, how you expect me to do my best?
Thank you, I'ma continue smokin' now
Prayin' to make it home is an understatement
But I know God got my back
He wouldn't give me more than I could handle
I just gotta step up to the play, and be a boss when the time comes
Who wants to chase success and run from their real responsibilities at the same time?
That sounds like hustlin' backwards to me
But I'm tryna hold it down, 'til we back in the villa againWoah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
Woah-oh, woah-oh
I'm so high, I know if I drive, I'm gon' crash it
Know she came from out of town, got a lil' action
Lil' brown-skin, she bad and she got ass, uh 
And she got friends too, wanna know if there's room in the back
I got codeine, kinda diluted
Up to no good, six in the mornin'
Lil' better, keep a lil' bitch moanin'
Fallin' asleep, 'bout to hit my speed
Man, not with the minimum wage
It's thirty bands just to look at my face
Yeah, look at the wrist
Ten years that they used to the scene
Keep up, gotta take it, my friends
So I'm livin' life like it never began, uh
Pour me shot of gin
Though I said I ain't drinkin' again
I'm a real boss, I'ma pay for somethin'
If it's some mills, I'ma stay for some 
If they bad, I'ma wait for some
Pussy niggas, stay away from them 
Got tired of seein' niggas with mills, got out and made it me some 
Don't need no bitches when I walk into the club, I came with some 
Ooh, since I was young, I knew that my day would come 
And now I don't drive the car every day unless it's my favorite one
Just watched a movie 'bout a foreign whip, went to the club to get a foreign bitch
If she ain't hustlin', she borin', I wanted cake since I was born
I wake up get some money, wake up next week, get some more
I tell the valet, "Get my door", I tell her, "Get the money off the floor"
Made fifty million this year and I ain't even go on tour
Made sixty points in the game, you could say I'm ballin' like Jordan
Man, not with the minimum wage
It's thirty bands just to look at my face 
Yeah, look at the wrist
Ten years that they used to the scene 
Keep up, gotta take it, my friends
So I'm livin' life like it never began, uh 
Pour me shot of gin

Soon after we locked eyes
I had a vision of me inside
I stimulate your mind and give your body everything that it wants
Private school her whole life
Got an infatuation with being bad
You take her out to shop
To spend it all cause she don't see those tags
I get deep inside her soul though
If she was a guitar I'd treat her like a solo
And put my fingers through your hair
And last night was amazing I can honestly say that you the best I ever had
And you don't remember cause you weren't even there..
But your soul was..
Keep going..
Just.. just catch up with the next one..
Ay..
Ay Ay..
Ay..
We don't make love I touch your soul girl.. *laugh*
She don't party where the rest go
You need to be able to let your hair down so you can feel good..
Here you can buy your own drinks, drive your own car, purchase the Louis bags on your own
Her parents money long but since she grown she'd rather spend yours..
I get deep inside her soul though
Go into the drag and beat it like I'm bolo..
Until you think it's to much..
And even though now you figuring out how or what we shouldn't did..
To your friends you'll admit that we had fun.. okay..
Ay Ay..
Ay Ay..
Let's ride to the gate so you can meet the man..
Call me Peter Pan I'mma take you to never never land..
When your all dried up here's an ocean to wet the sand..
Of course I'mma see what's good with your physical..
I'm relighting in the dark to her lock I got the key
And niggas down to get a copy..
Damn..
How does it feel this great when your not even here..
And you climax with the thought of me
That mean we gotta be..Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin
Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin
Thrown round by the wind
Thrown down in a spin
These niggas hate me cause the streets ain't make me crazy
They raised me showed me how to win follwed in them shadows
Then I jumped up on my own two feet and made it happen
Figured out I'm makin rap and if not I'll take you clappin
See I'm on top of this art and on the blocks that I trout its hotter than hot liver than rock
Fiends jerkin they got product to cop the cops searchin for the product the rock

The parks where they pump out boy

Gotta look out for my team in the field
Gotta stay fresh like my ideas
Gotta keep old cars switching gears
Gotta spit fire for my engineer
Listen here, the flow sharp like kitchenware
Different tier, we do our job then we disappear
Vision clear, money got us on a mission
They hooked, we supply the addiction
Only multiply and addition, no division
Drive the coldest edition, exotic bud twistin', got it out the mud
Models hoppin' out our showers and tubs
Dealers be givin' us ounces just because, showin' us love
50K just to show up in club
Versace frames, Gucci on the rug
I own the strain, you just know the plug
We don't do this for the fame, we doin' it 'cause we really kings
Well-oiled machines, keep all of 'em clean

Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved

When he caught sight of them niggas fuckin' with his lil' bruh
What we in it for? Make 'em remember us
Ten years plus, 10K's a new pair of rims for us
Come and kick it with some niggas who don't empty guts
They broke so they envy us
Laughin' to the bank while these suckers so serious
You ain't a boss, let me talk to your superior
Leather interior, bet I don't marry her
New year, gearin' up for success in different areas
Niggas was lost, switched the criteria
Hard not to stare at us
Think she home, but she here with us
Gettin' that kush smoke in her hair and stuff
Thirty thousand feet in the air
Always been and will be prepared for any affair
No diamonds in my teeth but that's all I wear
Solitaires by the pair, been ballin' my whole career
Ball 'til you fall
Don't let 'em monitor your millions, get 'em all
Gotta stay hands on, heavily involved
Try to handle your business and stay up out of ours
Then your problem's solved

By trying to rock your vest, it'll do nothing
We let the metal clap, and make you pedal back
Wait, your face'll break, and your head'll crack
This for my guys, no choice but to peddle crack
Beef we'll settle that drama we'll level cats
And on the block known, but never spots blown
Go ahead and shop them rocks, get your block sewn
And if you hustle grams, get more weight like a muscle man

Cuz I done had it up to here, I'm bout to explode
Yes oh, you know how the kid roll
Get dough, sick flow, but I make it sound so simple
Don't get it twisted though cuz nigga I could switch a flow
I ain't got a dime so the shine is my principle
You never catch me slipping cuz my rhymes never listen, yo
I'm like the definition that defines what's invincible
This for my peeps stressed, let's take a deep breath
Cuz ain't too many real niggas on the street left
So I'ma spit it til I'm lamping with my feet stretched
Laying on the beach rest next to a 
This for my homies gone, that knew only wrong

And pull clips to rip and tear your back out
Take over strips with fifths and cause a black out
Lil nigga listen here, I'm from a city where
You talk shit, the fifth will make you disappear
If not fifths, then fists will leave you sitting there
Wishing it was just another time in a different year
And I ain't nearly reached my prime but I'm getting it
This is real talk, not just rhyming and spitting here
Bitch niggas, I can smell their kind when they getting near
Ain't got no place with them long as I keep away from them
And as long as I'm alive, yeah, I'll be erasing them

I'm tryna get high, where my weed at where my blunt at?
When it come down to that money, I need that, I want that, yeah]
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating away
I, swear I got so high, last night I don't remember going to sleep
But I do know that these louis's go in my feet
And the critics they found how these lyrics do go over beats
Twenty-k shopping when dude go overseas
Smoking weed in the most expensive suite
Even though we ain't supposed to be living anywhere close to these people
How they gon' hate on me, I got more bread than most of these people
Don't wish that on my enemies, I pour a toast for 'em
And keep positive energy and have a smoke for 'em
Bombay and high-grade liquor for my niggas
Never seen a ghost in person, now she riding in one
Never seen a ghost in person, cost me five figures
That's like fifty g's a person if you ridin' with us
To the sky's limits
Roll some weed, and get high with winners
My niggas eating when it's time for dinner
Gettin' paid's just a regular thing to us
Cause if it ain't gettin' money, it's strange to us
And if you don't wanna smoke, you ain't gotta pay
Rolling up by myself trying to find a way
Floating away, floating away
Floating away, floating awayUh huh uh huh
Should I stay should I leave
Dont know which way to go
My mind is sayin yes
My heart keeps sayin no
Youve got not words to explain
You always take it wrong
Call up the station tell em
Play it on the radio
Plat it on the radio
Play it on the radio
Play it on the radio
Play it on the radio
I wanna call my girlfriend
But shes all mad
Everything was good then
Nows shes all bad
I hit your phone up
You never call back
Would I be wrong if I took
Everything I brought back
Me and you against the world
Girl I thought that
I be able to see them signs
No contracts
So high off of life
Will make a hater catch a contact
But now I treat her like im
Jumpin out a plane and fall back
Cause I can only dream of what we had
Try to work but seem that we go wrong
Sometimes I pray that god will take me back
Then run and tell the homies ive moved on
But soon as I get my head right
You gon think im stuck and im just
Frontin no headlights
Put you in the club and brought you
Stuff you never wear twice
Now the thrill is gone and the
Decisions in the air like
DamnSo 
So, so 
I can't believe you 
So 
So I see your face again, back where I've been traveling
Time, I think it seems to have it's grip on me
Friends, they say they call it real, no matter what I feel
Can't believe in history, living in this misery
Yeah, as the joint burns, to the point that it stinging my fingers
Tracks my talk show platform, part Phil Donahue, part Jerry Springer
Momma come when I bring her
She go where I send her, kept it trill from the beginning
From Square One maintain Square Business
Don't concern yourself with my mingling with other bitches
So crafty, mastered the flow Alaska cold, silent foot assassin approach
High when I stroll, not even leaving foot prints in the snow, you know
And still them clowns imitate him
Ain't even out of town, we feel like we on vacation
Bottles of champagne a lot of sour inspiration
Captain of my plane rolling J's, waiting for takeoff
Put in nothing but hardwork because it pays off
Fool, she in the mood for jet infused music
Nothing like the rest of these niggas
R.I.P. when I'm done, lay the rest of these niggas
So I see the setting sun and I get to feeling numb
Down on that side of town, back where no funs around
Back where I felt like me and everything you want to be
Just flows so easily, some I think may call it freeYeah, yeah
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty
Love when they strip, I love when they classy
Niggas be fake, these niggas be plastic
And I've been cakin' if you askin'
There's the fake and there's the real, you ain't foolin' me, nigga
Lotta money to be made out here, just who gonna get it?
In a class of my own, I don't see no compеtition
Shawty ass kinda swole, she bend it ovеr, I'm tippin'
I'm up early in the morning 'cause you know we be grindin'
Do anything for my dawgs, just let me know the assignment
Need a jet, need a check, with a whole bunch of commas
If I step for the now i get a whole bunch of profit
Niggas used to holdin' choppers, now we smoke out with doctors
Money bulgin' out my pocket, if you want it I got it
We don't do regular problems, stay away from the gossip
Runnin' up them bank deposits, new bitch straight out of college
Nigga this is real life, this ain't no cops or robbers
All my niggas from the bottom and they wanna move proper
All I know is do it big, that's what I seen as a toddler
Stay the fuck up out the way, you hang around you get caught up
You niggas broke, you always with some niggas fuckin' the product
You the type that can't do right because no one ever taught him
Always late to catch a flight, I never rush to get on
I've been trappin' all night then I'm up early in the mornin'
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty

Lotta money to be made out here, just who gonna get it?
In a class of my own, I don't see no competition
Shawty ass kinda swole, she bend it over, I'm tippin'
Droppin' the top, I'm in the roof
Everything is exclusive
Even down to my bitch, you with one that's ran through
I just stick to the code, I am makin' the rules
If you niggas still broke, there really ain't no excuses
Pull up in the four-door,all my niggas pull out them coupes
Wipin' off my prints quick 'cause they investigate clues
Niggas see what's on my neck, and give respect for jeweler
Tell 'em I don't need a script 'cause every day like the moves
I don't wear it on me, got no idea what I've been through
Smell a lot of KK on me, in the block and spin through
Know I smoke a lotta gas, so I gotta refuel
Hit 'em once and then I pass, I'ma hardly reuse
Kept it solid, rep the gang, 'cause that's what a G do
If you 'bout money, rollin' up and countin' hunnids me too
You could tell by all the times we keep on winnin', we up
I could smoke a pound a day and by the night I reup
Can't imagine bein' average
Reppin' my gang 'til I'm in the casket
Diamonds rings, don't mean to be flashin'
One of 'em straight, one of 'em nasty
Love when they strip, I love when they classy
Niggas be fake, these niggas be plastic

I'm not average 
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-oohI dreamed of kush blunts, hot fashion and females
She never smoked once but love the way the weed smells
Pistols in the front, choppers on the back porch
Lord knows I wanna teach him but he asked for
So im doin words, let my money do the talking
I think the game needs some change like you do for parking
We the planes, you motherfuckers ground control
We escape, skip the rates, pick a cloud and go
My chick by racial, bisexual, buy everything I want soon as I let her know
I snap my fingers and God will be there to hunt your head
Call me the deep and you try and sink like the London Bridge
Big city small problems, hate me cause I get a plate often
What are they starving? Where I'm at? tourin
Say you got another question, call it
Ask me if I'm ballin
WowIt's not supposed to be happenin' now
What is she callin' about?
What you doin'?
I have no idea
Oh, pull up, door open
I ain't gotta say much 
They be tryna catch up
New whip, that's us
Bad bitch, she rollin' up
No time for the player haters
On my grind, I can't lay up
I think rich, so I gotta keep my bucks long
Thousand dollar fits but still got some blue Chucks on
You gon' jog or you gon' stampede?
We in the diamond lane, breaded, all my niggas smell like good leaves
Bitch that back talk, I love the way she badass
We be on the grind, full speed, I need an asset
I'm in a circle full of cold niggas
Don't gotta say much, we pull up, the dips is gon' roll with us
Doors open up like Lamborghini
She a light weight she with it, she gon' go up off a Martini
I need it all, don't want the half, I don't slow step
We be in the foreign, she gon' bob until her throat stretch
Oh, pull up, door open
I ain't gotta say much 
They be tryna catch up
New whip, that's us
Bad bitch, she rollin' up
No time for the players, haters
On my grind , I can't lay up
If they only knew, what that thing do
See a million dollars everytime I think of you
Take my business to the top, dream come true
Want me to drop the top, no clouds, sky blue
Red sixty-one or sixty-nine, Skyblue
Pull up on Snoop, watch a movie when we drive through
Get you some ice, pull it out, you look surprised
A real winner, I can see it in your eyes
Don't make our moves too fast 'cause we strategize
Grade A, G-shit, when they categorize
Spend that money then your picture off in private
Put some diamonds on my wrist, that's perfect timin'
Oh, pull up, door open 
I ain't gotta say much 
They be tryna catch up
(Don't compete with each other, man
Y'all just do the same thing, y'all get the same shit, haha)

No time for the players, haters
On my grind, I can't lay upAyo, I never had common sense
But I had enough sense to calm my ass down and make my dollars stretch
Yeah
Uh, ayo, I never had common sense
But I had enough sense to calm my ass down and make my dollars stretch
I'm like basketball to net how I make it all connect
Move strong so the funds I collect come correct when the boss nigga check ya
If you don't come from the set, I don't respect ya
Better yet, jump on a jet and give them checks up
I never give nothin' less than my best
You can tell by the way that I'm dressed
Grey bottom and my dreads always fresh
Smoke so much, I swear that I'm blessed
Know so much, I swear I'm a genius
And I'm K-Oing niggas, we ain't callin' it even
Spent too much time online, I'm with your broad for the evening
She a big ol' freak, I pull it out and she eat it
You might think I got time to kill 'cause I'm so real
Lot of niggas I could've checked this year, but I'ma chill
I ain't gotta tell that they fake, in time, it will
When it come to being certified, I'm signed and sealed
Signed a deal since I was 16, I been gettin' cream
A young nigga smokin' weed like it's nicotine
Made my own scene
If that's your girl, then why she kick it with the whole team?
Smoke the whole thing
Eyes hella low, never tried, then you'll never know
Young Khalifa flows so incredible
Off of six joints and a edible
I don't write it down, it ain't legible
Professional from the head to toe
Big vegetables, we ain't smokin' no oregano
Never pedal slow, we just catch and go
And when I'm finished with this shit, it's gon' be set in stone
A real king, before I'm done, I'll have to get a throne
Better know as the nigga killin' every fuckin' verse
And puttin' rappers in a hearse
And when you do it like me, niggas see your blessings as a curse
But, shit, I could be doing worse

I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Ridin' in my ride, so blowed, don't how to think
But I'm stayin' high
I'ma roll me a nice, long Swisher, filled with light green
Oh, I think they like me, let me get a light, B
Off that Cali bud, what the fuck you chokin' on?
Mr. Bud by the Zone, O's like Omarion
And we ain't tuckin' nothin' cousin, what's the hold up?
Keep 'em comin' back to back to back, we roll up
Get a pound, break it down
I ain't stingy, it's enough to go around
And I'm blazin' right now, niggas tellin' me to hold on
Crank it, twist it, light it, take a pull and hold on
I gotta have it, gotta have it, that's unheard about
Rollin' up another blunt, before I put the first one out
My eyes low, have me chiefin' 'til I choke
Niggas askin' me what's wrong
Blew some smoke up out my nose and said I'm gone
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that brownish drank
Niggas know how I roll, it look like my eyes closed
Hennessey and Hydro, rhyme slow
Nigga, I'm on a different type of a vibe
This a different type of weed
And I'm a different type a high
To a place that you probably never been in life
Smokin' Purple Kryptonite
Make sure you curl that Swisher right
Cause I ain't tryna have this home grown runnin'
Homie thinkin' he gon' smoke for free
I duck 'em, roll somethin'
In my ride, doin' 80 in a 45 Zone, half a zone
Got me blown, I get more than high
Fresh off of the plane
Head start into my hotel
Weed man in every city, yeah, I smoke well
I ain't the only one, all my niggas puff pounds
Swingin' blunts 'round, sun up 'till sun down
My eyes low and my words are getting slow
Niggas askin' me what's wrong
I blew some smoke up out my nose and said, I'm gone
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag low
I said, I'm gone off that pound of dank
Purple, purple in my pocket and my jeans sag lowCan't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Crazy since the 80’s fucking, crazy since the 80’s fucking
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Can't compare, I been going crazy since the 80's fucker
Crazy since the 80’s fuckin, crazy since the 80’s
If you wondering who it is I'm the youngest in charge
Back with another one of them classic ones, fuck with the boy
Say you tired of hired help come and fuck with the boss
Niggas say "Man you winning" fuck it I tell 'em of course
I get love like a star, units move, cake appear
412 PGH you hatin' cause we cakin' here
Ask around you'll hear about the noise the youngin's making here
Hit 'em with that 'Oh No', now I'm record breaking here
See this that slow flow you heard of
Seeing mo dough and re-ing more dro to burn up
Keep it low though before the po-po swerve up
Pull us to the side and them homos search us
Gotta keep the work up, cause I was taught supply-demand
Smoking putting Pistolvania on the map cause I'm the man
Hustle hard plus the ladies love the nasty flow, scrappy know
So why you hate me? Cause he crazy since the 80's 
Yeah it’s young Wiz ain’t nobody do it how I done it son
Killed ‘em with the first and gotta hit 'em with another one
Not quite the remix, you see this G-Shit?
For you to Pittsburgh ditty-bop to the beat with
Fresh with my A-1’s, keep a leaning fitted cap
For those who sick of rap thank God ya niggas back
A lot of niggas wack and that’s just sad to see
We in a marathon you cats are lapped to me
Khalifa still the same, ain’t nothing change but my change
And my foot got a lil deeper  up in the game
It’s hard seeing through all this reefer up in my brain
Let the trunk bang while you weaving and switching them lanes
Hope if you in the club let ‘em know you moving through
To pop something, roll something, man do what you do
18, making major moves that’s why they hate me brother
Plus I’m getting cakey I been crazy since the 80’s fucker
Let me make it clear, when that cake appear
Ima make more in one day than most niggas make a year
I put my time in,  nothing but grinding
Moving these units they coming back for what I’m supplying
I’m from the Steel-City, ya’ll niggas still lost
I’m the youngest in charge spittin' that real raw
My dutchies real long plus I work real hard
Fuck a battle dog I’ll show you how to make a real song
Or how to switch states, get cake from a mixtape
Couple hundred-thousand off my face from Myspace
You’ll be frustrated from tryna keep up with my pace
How I control the track you fools get over-lapped
You’ll get left in the dust just cause you lesser than us
And coming at the kid? Simply said it’s just pressing ya luck
See I was hungry on this grind when you was lazy brother
So why you hate me? I been crazy since the 80’s fuckerYeah!
Y'all know what it is
It's another one of those...
Yes!
Man it's ya boy Wiz Khalifa, man
Let's do it
Yo, uh
I'm kinda hot now, money gettin longer too
Pressure by the cops now, and niggas hating on ya dude
See I ain't step on no toes to get here
This hard work, young'n got a flow. the shit's clear
But I see jealousy in their face when they eye me
Love the lames wanting to trouble W-I-Z
Doesn't surprise me that some would despise me
So I dip through, stick, move like Ali
I chose wisely, some say I'm an old soul
A broke load of a young nigga who flows gold
And life to live it, them punches but still the bore road
Sky's the limit, dig it, I blown the whole globe
But still I made it back, the new face of rap
E figured out the flow was coke, then we made it crack
Not too hard to pay attention and listen
This for all my people, ghetto niggas, women and children
Now pay attention what I kick in ya ear
You might learn sumthin, burn sumthin
I'm from where you worth nothing, until you get out there and earn sumthin
And we allergic to that term "frontin'"
So if you get it legit or on the curb pumpin', burn sumthin... yeah
We all strugglin', in some way, we all hustlin'
To take nothin' & make sumthin, ya know
If there's one thing I know well, it's how to get my grind on
24/7 perfectin' to keep the rhymes strong
Stackin' my paper, waitin' to get my shine on
Hustlin' all day, wonderin' where the time gone
I'm too quick on my feet, I ain't gettin' to sleep
Rules to be made, losin' weight, I'm forgettin' to eat
And some say I'm livin' too fast, slow down
Tryna get my fam a plate big enough to go 'round
So I go hard, told y'all it's going down
A rap nigga back big enough to hold the town
They wanna hold you down but gettin' them figures, knew it was comin' though
I can see the bitch in you niggas, but steal the young'n flow
Hater match the chips gettin' bigger, comes with the territory
I'm just glad I'm able to tell my story
To get to the top, I learned from those there before me
And when I'm on, I'm gon' share my glory
Now pay attention what I kick in ya ear
You might learn sumthin, burn sumthin
I'm from where you worth nothing, until you get out there and earn sumthin
And we allergic to that term "frontin'"
So if you get it legit or on the curb pumpin', burn sumthin... yeah
We all strugglin', in some way, we all hustlin'
To take nothin' & make sumthin, ya know
Look into my eyes  tell me what you see 
A prospect with his mind set on what to be 
A lot of chronic smoke, young broad, come puff wit me
A attitude like y'all dudes can't fuck wit me
Still, I stay humble, focused on my hustle
Later forgetting it, but everything got doubled
And my team got bubble
Anybody that seen our struggle got respect, nah mean for the young'n 'cause
This more than just music, it's hood than jets music
Want war then let's do it
The Burgh's best, yes, here in the flesh, truest
Smart to do, you talking less, then just prove it
That's why my shit go large, yours get less movement
I'm on top of things, you busy droppin' names
On file, no physics can stop the flame
Think otherwise, we can drop some change
Let's do it...La música de Harry Fraud
You havin' fun 
If your nigga find out, he gon' be upset 
Put the top down 
When it get cold, let it up, yeah 
We goin' up, yeah

And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough
Big joint that I fill
New lights on the grill
Gold D's on the wheels
Roll with me need skills
I can tell you how it feel
Diamond chain for a pill
Buy the waves for a mil
Ain't even tryna flex
Some of them niggas want the trophy
I want mind and respect
Rapping these verses
Breaking these purses when it's time to collect
Don't even buy just one, we get 'em in sets
Ain't talkin' clothes, I'm talking the ice on her neck
I give you a start and make you work for the rest
Make you a boss, have you signing them checks
Checkin' the books and make sure my papers correct
Look, I done turned you to a threat
You havin' fun 
If your nigga find out, he gon' be upset 
Put the top down 
When it get cold, let it up, yeah 
You're goin' up, yeah 
All these girls, they with us, yeah 
And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough
Letting 'em up
Who knew that after years of hard work, the truth would be us
Two girls in the back, let our seats up
Cell phones off, so they can't reach us
I got an extra one, bitch, keep up
Put the kush in the joint, call it secret stuff
How you a boss and you rollin' in the cheapest one?
Me and my squad do our job, that's keepin' the bleachers filled up
They know way better than to steal from us
They work, so if we take a loss then shit we still get up
They wonder what's in my garage, if I'm gon' switch it up
I don't pull nothing, I make y'all go get some different work
We leave up out here and make all the bitches disappear
You havin' fun 
If your nigga find out, he gon' be upset 
Put the top down 
When it get cold, let it up, yeah 
We goin' up, yeah 
All these girls, they with us, yeah 
And we don't never stop, 'cause we never get enough, yeah
Get enough, get enough
Get enough, get enoughFuck with a nigga that be stacking all the time
Just from rapping all them lines
Dont plan on falling back I dont relax Im on my grind
Got that tatted on my mind, money it is
I'm like butter when it come to my bread
I'm on top of it
Swagger on 1-0-0
Where I'm from Im an icon and a hero

My grind like the niggas with them thangs in the riddle
Spit hot water over cocaine instrumentals
And call it crack
They leave standing have em crawling back

And I dont brag so evidentley I been told that
You niggas so wack
Im so ahead of myself shit I could go back
Still wouldn't be fucking with
So all that hating shit is nothing to me
Im eating right yea my lifes like a fucking movie

And I kill beats - that's probly why they think hip hop's dead cause I spit hot lead
Feel like I just got fed, so I'm nowhere near comfortable
Even though they tell me can't no one here fuck with you

I been hot now the shots I'ma call that
Flow cray, some say I was born mad
And I came feet first nigga this a rebirth

To get paid like the 15th and the 1st
Stuck to my grind and my thing and it worked

It's another one of those...
Y'all niggas know
412, Wiz Khalifa
Yeah
I'm so incredible. wait
With no metal to waste
I flow great, and that'll level ya face
And I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a faggot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right, game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from the city of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me, got a smile on my face
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood, slums came up out that
Rap game about that, to gain pay without crack
See I'm a youngin' with too much on my plate
To let some small change half a youngin' dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sales
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, their worries ain't jail
With no regards for life cause their livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me, I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' mothafuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for myself
And I'm too hot to take the backseat or the shelf
So I'm here, for some reason though, they hate it to death
The love's gone, only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not to be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!
Yeah
It's ya boy Wiz, man
Prince of the City of Steel, you already know, man
It's history in the making what we doing right here
Fuckers can hate it if you want to, just sit back and laugh, smoke and get money on y'all niggas, you already know
Ain't nan' nigga gon' stop my grind
Work too hard to get here, you feel me
Let's do it!
Where I'm from, it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see-through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps, and out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like a time watch
And I'm gonna be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there, I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hoping heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes, young with every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody done took Greg's life
Son reached, deceased
No time to blink or think twice, damn
Wonder when it's gonna be my time to meet death
I'm stressed, need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see what's mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones, and leave that spine
You see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now, ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose, they say something's wrong with young
Your time's up, I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!
Yeah, y'all muhfuckas better play close attention to what's going on, man, that's what it is
Rostrum Records

Thanks for that doe, nigga, I needed that

We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Damn, who knew?
All the planes we flew, good things we been through
That I'd be standin' right here talkin' to you
'Bout another path, I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But somethin' told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days, hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place, uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love'll never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line'll never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side
And now you gon' be wit' me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you againLet me talk to you, uh
Remember back when nigga rolled up blunts instead of papers, wasn't too many haters
Just a couple fools I had problems with
And if I seen 'em, it was a while before I got 'em but at least I copped 'em
Sunk in my seat, rolling up with some wild ones
Putting niggas on, we the ones that you got your style from
I was focused on letting the money pile up
Sending it back yo, this pack ain't loud enough
Hopped in my whip quick then turned the volume up
Niggas who talk shit to me, that's childish bruh
Instead of hating just upgrade your status
Came from nothing, we ain't taking pacing backwards, only thing that matters
We all ran from police, most of us ain't get captured
Money under the mattress, roll this joint, I'ma tax it
You wasn't there, you don't know what a classic is
Just roll one up, try your best to imagine this
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
Floating down the street, no cops on the scene
Everyone chilling in peace, everyone getting their piece
Every father kissing their babies 'fore they go to sleep
Ain't no one caring if it's expensive shit or if it's cheap
Everybody fresh so it don't matter who the cleanest
You could start off small, later turn into a genius
I ain't just talking, say it to you 'cause I seen it
Niggas keeping it real, they don't do it 'less they mean it
Feel like I really ain't from this world then my car ain't neither
Told her she 'bout to fall off if that broad can't keep up
Get so high phone turning it off so them calls can't receive 'em
Every year I'm setting my goals and make sure I achieve 'em
Boy I'm here for a reason
Gon' be going all year, you just had a good season
I work to be that nigga dog, don't just happen to be him
Blowing that weed when I pull up, they get happy to see him
Just relax, roll up, and chief one
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine that
Just imagine, just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Imagine that, imagine that, imagine that, imagine thatNiggas don't want no problems
Easily will just solve em
So stop your mouth I'm talking
And start your feet and walking
I sit down in this motherfucker
Burn a pound in this motherfucker
Shake the ground off this motherfucker
With concrete beats, Mobbing these streets
My whole team getting me all in this deep, so lets get it popping
First kid to act silly, first kid he dropping
Its too late there's no way that you could really stop him
And blood bath I put the nail in the coffin, I'm availing with bosses
Niggas down with Uzi's
I ain't tripping, I'm whipping
Getting a lift from a pigeon
See with us there's a difference, you'd be simping I'm pimping
You just play a position, I'm just the bricks in the kitchen
And my  I'm the sickest just living
Fuck it life of deceased, I'm a beast fresh off the leash
Its too late to run if you scared
So take a glass and put a blunt in the air
You see I'm tired of playing with y'all
In case if you didn't know by now
Can't stoop we all act a fool
There's no use to try to calm us down
It's too late
I'm the motherfucking champion, I can't do it
Then it can't be done, your times up should have 
And now back the meanest broad, chickens know that I'm picky
Pockets full of dope, eyes a little low from the sticky
Had a toe I'd be ticky, fitted 10's I'm tims
Even jeans with some dickeys, cuz my cheques make my slicky
And mommy's all over the kid, didn't walk me before but now that everybody know who he is
You wonder how bitch
Ye I'm rap's fourth some Child
Been waiting for my chance to the tip top
So hats off to this prince of hip hop
I speak flame so tell lames to kick rocks
They do the same they keep the same their wig pops
Biotch
Now the rooms all full and we all packed In
Somebody might get their jaw cracked in
Cuz for your jaw jacking
I'm trying to find a little something to slide with
Jumping or ride with
But niggas keep hating cuz they chick keep smirking
If this cat keep looking I'ma hurt me a person
But I'm chill see I only let the team work em
Stomp a nigga out til the feet start hurting
You ain't nothing but a vexed up clown
With a style that'll get shut down
It's too late to try catch up now
I'm on my A game, Morgan in the fast lane
Cruising up the past lane, fucked up since the cash game
So for you jokers I'm a bad thang
Fake eyes ye I'm like a snake eyes in the crack gameTaylor made money gang
Chorus:
And my swag so official
Super fresh
And my swag so official
And my swag so official
Swag swag so official
And my swag so official
Swag swag so official
Verse 1:
The world turns
The Kush burns

More paper than a bookworm
So look learn

A blunt and a pretty face
Then I'm straight like a good perm
And her swag so official
Taylor made money gang
I'm the general
And all my weed strong like Kimbo Slice
Your money is the only thing I do twice
I'm in the fast lane
Yellow chain blue lights
And you gonna need shades
They say I'm too bright
I'm shitting on the game
So bring through wipes
And you can clean up
And try to be us
I'm sure you niggas is ballin that's what they all say
But me plus getting money

My seats parquet
Bitch from the Caribbean
She say por que

And I ain't even pressed
Got you feelin under-dressed
Any time you find him in the building
I'm a threat
Got some Gucci Chuck Tay's
You ain't seen yet
Yellow ice so I may seem fresh
But if you did what I'm doin
Nigga you'd be feeling spoiled rotten
In my city I've got pull
So don't tug
Or get drugged through the mud probably
Like my weed rolled
My steak done properly
I put my team on
Now we own property
And my swag so official
No magazine so my cash not an issue
Tell the ref to throw a flag
Blow the whistle
Cuz your styles out of date
That's a foul on the play
And your words don't hurt him
Because I'm flying out the way
What you make a month I probably spent today
Pyewm Usually I make a weed song
 So it goes on weed song

Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYeah bitch, we're high, we're drunk. as fuck. there’s no police fuck man. the day is great. today is large..
I’ve been hustling like everyday
Doin' time on my grind trynna make a pay
Hey I’m still postin’ on the same block
The same hoodn still duckin' from the same cops
I try hard but the life that I live man ain't all it's seemin'
Sometimes I pray to God I’m dreamin’
But I ain’t try to get out but I can’t damn
Verse 1 
Ay, yo im Stuck in a situation; hustlin’ to get this paper
Less of a dyin' breed they say that the hood’s in danger
Thats why im in the streets from dawn to dusk. if they could the government would drop a bomb on us
How you supposed to dream big when you’re stuck in a nightmare. stay strapped cuz around here they dont fight fair
Paranoid gotta watch for the cops. cuz they sure dont got abomb playin rocks in the socks gotta probably pretend to tell'em you just a plea.They try to hit you wit six but you will only do three there’s no justice when theyre lockin up just us
The label us as thugs gangstas and hustlas hittin me wit possession now im under arrest. and the reason why i smoke is to deal with the stress. the only things gonna change is what i been wishin: life over hustlin',stuck in the system
Chorus}
Verse 2 
Well, if there’s hell here it is my home oh so known its where the drug dealers get it in. tryin to make a livin, but i need to make a killin. ya pocket pissin, the projects is a vision
Babies born into hustlas, they the cousins of the customers
The police always f*ck with us but what the f*ck you want from us
You wanna see us suffering the drugs are just the cover up
They always tear us down the moment we think we comin up. if only I can make a couple bucks
To get my grandmother up and out the hood and get her that house she always wanted out in the woods
My intentions are good, though they treat me as the bad guy
Just another black guy tryin to get his stacks high.just another pull over I’m pretty sure its that guy
Not the life I wanted but the life I live
Musics my only way out tell'em bout it wiz
Verse 3 
I’ve been .. vision
The way I’m living ..but the same time in prison ..
‘cause I’m seeing that they need something
Now who am I not to supply to get this money I’m not a dummy
I know this is a vicious cycle .. stronger with the bottom line
..survival that’s why I try to be the bets man that I can
I’m not looking for every man woman to understand
Listen this is my struggle
Why they see so many niggas lock the way
..pretty box .. i said ..is coming, but while I live people .. for nothing
I’m smoking guns .. I’ma just do it not talking ..
Watch my movements because the proof is always in ..Nigga I smoke good everyday
I probably live the life that you wish you could everyday
You probably think I had it good, had it made
But nigg Im from the burg I was in the hood everyday
But now Im hopping offa Jets
These people cutting me checks
And I say people cause Im rich
And rich people show me respect 
This come from Atrium, hes from Collette
These diamonds I got on, they are baguettes
On DBS so all of em see me, used to just be that dude on the
Net
Now Im all on your TV, butler ask what I wanna get, Bentley
Or Lamborghini?
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all in Waikiki
Just came home and made 200 grand blew it all with Luigi

Thats why all the people that you know try their hardest to
Be me

You probably think I had it good got it made

Listening to my favorite song, leaning in my ride chokin'
Tell my dog to hit this weed, feel like I'mma pass out
Thought I had exclusive trees, until he pulled his bag out
Had bout a half ounce, some shit I've never seen in life
Said that once he grabbed it, smelled so bad he had to bag it twice
I told him roll that shit up, this weed I had to light
These clowns somewhere in the clouds, me I'm a satellite
I roll them very nice, with smoke coming out the end like a muffler
Got game from the Hustla, never said I'm gon' quit
I can't get enough of good weed in my lungs, plus I'm sharin' I ain't cuffin'
My eyes wide shut, I'm just staring saying nothing
I flick ashes, got big staus, so I don't need a dime, I got big baggage, bitch
Yeah I blow it by the zip, anywhere I go it's on the road on every trip
Ask my Nini, love her grandson but she know that I'm a trip
Got my habit from Ms. Peachy smoking roaches getting lit
Now I fill my blunts with so much weed they say "that all ain't gon' fit"
On some highly grown shit, with a Hollywood bitch
Got the sweetest purple kush in a precisely rolled spliff
High as John in Pulp Fic' on the way to see Marcellus
Girl I'm in another world, and Chevy got another twirl
For those who don't know he got that roll game
And I ain't gon' lie, he the reason why I got my roll game
I feel like I'm soul plane, I smoked the whole thang, pound or oz
Kush fiend, purple master OGIm off a few shots of patron right now since nigga's wanna be putting  too much alcohol in the Bombay and shit...
Plus we ain't got no McQueen

Bottles up she in love with a don
Used to smoke bad weed in a wood
Now she put her KK in a Raw
Bust down Cartier on my arm

Used to be a young nigga shooting hoops
Now the people calling me the new Snoop
Speaking of Snoop real life thats my OG

Come to my crib smell the weed at the door
Hustler hard real G in my pores
It's a game to you while to me it's a sport
Gettin' paid since I came off the porch
Niggas fake so it ain't no remorse
Treat the bank like a obstacle course
Runnin' through account money need more
Use my brain so I don't need force
Love to drive fast so my car need horses
Cameros, Ferraris, Porsches
The bitch that I'm with, she gorgeous
To lift my money up need a forklift
Don't even hit me up, you ain't important
Fingerprint where my door is, kk got me out in orbit
She ain't mine, that's your bitch
Niggas askin what the score is
That mean they losin, I'm up with my alarm I don't never snooze
You ain't walkin in my shoes
And if I say do it then my niggas say do it too
And if I roll up then my niggas roll up too
Pourin shots at the party cause you don't know what we been through
Ever since I was young went to ball nigga no hoop
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
We ain't dangerous, we ain't dangerous, no
There's just no changing us, no changing us, no
Drop the top in the rain, we gon' fuck it up
Earned everything I own, got the gold touch
Love the game, miss my old life so much
But I wouldn't trade it, ain't in no rush
Learned niggas gon hate, so it's no trust
For the k spent nine weeks on the bus
It ain't just me dog, it's more of us
I don't do it for the fame, do it for the love
She can't live without me, say it's like a drug
We ain't spendin' money on it if it's out the budget
Stay to myself keep my business out the public
You ain't talkin' money dog I ain't with the subject
The real wanna see me win, fake niggas upset
You been pullin' all them stunts, ain't get a buzz yet
Young Khalifa he the GOAT, he that nigga, nuff said
Anytime I get a plate, make sure everyones fed

I used to rock braids with the hat to the back
Used to hit the road, take trips for the pack
Used to sag my pants, act hard when I rapped
'Cause pixburgh niggas don't take no slack
Used to have to sell weed for lunch everyday
Used to duck shots at the park just to play
Used to have to make sure my mom knew I was safe
Used to tell lies to my pops, sad to say
Now I'm 32 and I see things different
'S'all about love, it ain't all about the image
Say they down for you, when it's hot they dippin'
Police come around, put that out, they trippin'
Ridin' 'round the city, fo' deep, roof missin'
Hardest in the city, we the ones they mention
Gotta get this money cause I gotta pay rent
And if it don't make dollars then it don't make sense then
Wanna get paid then you gotta have vision
Ridin' with a bad yellow bitch, no simpson
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
A young stoners dream
Stash cheese, peas while I sip McQueen
My niggas the real thing, no player I own the team
And if you in my car, you smokin' trees
If you gang, then you gang, ain't no in between
Keep it G, ain't no time for no sympathy
Seen it all so I value the simple things
I'on flex, couple chains, couple simple rings
Go to dinner, we don't order what the menu brings
That's some boss shit you seen in a movie
Everywhere I go I'm seen with a doobie
Niggas cool but they really don't move me
Snatch girls, you might think I'm a bully
Imma need me a two piece
No lie, that's truthfully
When it's all said and done, it's either you or me
Learned how to ball, no hoopin' league
Top down, no roof for me
You hear the crowd, how they root for me
Here's a pound, roll a few for me
I kick 'em out, I'm exclusive please
This is my house, Imma need you to leave
They don't know the difference
From a nigga keepin' it real and straight trippin'
I hop in my whip on them thangs, I'm straight dippin'
You want me to put you on game, just pay attention
I'm never slippin'
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangster
So, so, so gangsterSet, where haven't we been yet

Few Rosays, now you drunk saying boy "why you in my face and you only want one thing?"
You wasting your time fucking lames
Only 2 things poppin, thats Jet Set and The Gang
Eating sushi, few groupies, new clothes and left over room keys

So I take her to Mars

Amazed on how it's so easily roll
Hate niggas wanna police their hoes
We came to party, we grown

Never let 'em stop ya dough, gotta learn to love the hate
Make ya moves, I've been on the grind since an early teen

You smell the kush on my clothes
A real boss never folds or show the cards that he holds
I'm with my squad getting stoned
Or with your broad getting dome
A couple cars, couple homes off of the bars I composed
Speaking of composure, I keep it and I keep my team closer
Niggas need to keep their mouths shut, closure
If we don't eat then what's the outcome? Vultures
A pound of weed, you'll never see me without one
Always lowkey, you hardly see me in town
But if you do I'm trying to smoke a zip if you down
We came up together but we different somehow
Think I figured it out
They don't do shit, lil niggas just running their mouth
How do I say this shit without hating?
You built your crib on weak foundation
And forgot that you gotta live in that house
Paid in full like Money Mitch, got a brick to sell
Lot hated the progress, I still wish them well
That lil nigga from Compton pray for a wishing well
Now I'm menaging with SZA, drinking white zinfandel
And  but never kiss and tell
Crap table in Vegas more than a Chippendales
I hear 'em plotting, nowadays I never get compelled
Fuck your couch, I'm Rick James like it's a skit, Chappelle
Beating on the table, I'm grindin' like it's Clipse for real
I want gas rather pump, taking trips to Shell
Getting good brain, yeah that noggin could've went to Yale
Keep it silent when we beefing but that clip'll yell
Shipping KK overseas til they strip the mail
Ride Clinton presidential, could've cripped with Bill
Or get that Scott from Gil
If you know what I mean, yeahYou told me that I'm everything you could ever need
Them niggas slow but when it comes to me I'm up to speed
And you can't wait to tell your girlfriends you found 
Yeah, I'm respectful, with the swagger on some hood shit
Skinny nigga, but you heard I got some good
Damn, you always run around, saying I'm 
But I don't want you to get used to having me around
See, I'll be in and out of town
And Lord knows I see you
When I see you, if I see you
Shorty, I'm a busy man
And I do what I can
And even though we might have done it once
The second time's not a guarantee
Nah, bitch
So every time you hold me
Hold me like this is the last time
Every time you kiss me
Kiss me like you'll never see me again
Every time you touch me
Touch me like this is the last time
Promise that you'll love me
Love me like you'll never see me again

In a brand new country but I'm leaving in the morning
And the pack just flown in
If you don't inhale you ain't really getting stoned then
See I can roll, but I put it in a cone
Big long, put it in a bong
Used to smoke one, now it take three to get me in the zone
Take joints to the dome

Out in the street they call it murder
Yo!
This where the blocks are known
Rocks get rolled
Up and down the cops patrol
So they play the back block
Plus the names are not to know
Not to mention niggas out here snitching so they got to go
Heavy with the rock and snow but I don't play the block with blow
Usually in the lab with a pad blowing tropical
Working on changing the game and making lots of dough
Put my hustle down
Throw my muscle round
You act food the wolves will come and hunt you down
Prick, we them bird guys where they let them birds fly
Pop, now everything you seeing's from a birds-eye
You niggas aren't hot I see that you're creeping
I'm an alarm clock to niggas that's sleeping
Call me an all-star
You cuffing broads I'm with your freak on the weekend
This your wife, I'm just getting my skeet in
He's too Swayze
But you should recognize
I ain't standing next to guys
Any nigga think he on my level will be left to die
Got a mean team but you ain't even seen the best of mine

Always watch my moves, be careful not to oversell it
You ain't got no ho's like you been rockin' ho repellent
What's my next move? There ain't no tellin'

Eatin' fruit, drinkin' water, thats like every day
She with mе 'cause she was tryna find a bettеr way
Might let you get a taste
Out all night, we ain't coming yeah

Say she wanna be a part of it
Every day I go my hardest
Don't get outta line, I play my part
Nigga, play it smart
Look, I was ballin' by myself so I don't owe you niggas
Knew what I had, because I made it, ain't gotta show you niggas
Found out you jealous of what I got, so I can't fuck with that
Put it on my life man, these my brothers, I can't turn my back
These my dogs, this my backup
And we so used to getting this money, running these racks up
Rich niggas don't complain

OG Hash Oil
Roll a joint, roll another one
When it's all said and done
I'll be at the top bitch
Cause I hustle a lot
Them cars, we pulling 'em off the lot
Don't even test drive it before I cop
Just boarded a yacht
We're at the craps table in Vegas
The dealer saying how he admiring my watch
I'm placing my wager
Don't even care about how much paper I blow
Cause I been getting this money and stay on
A couple things that I know
I'm blowing that stink by the O
My weed so strong I swear to god you would think it's cologne
I go anywhere in the world and just make it my home
Staying at the highest level but I didn't make it alone
Now that my money right them suckers keep thinking I'm wrong
But I'm just switching lanes, foot off the brake and I'm gone
If you ain't talking money homie, you can't get a call
Cause this a muthafuckin life that you can't live at all
I'm getting high while I drive, I ain't thinking of y'all...
I just wanna ride in my ride with my top down
And smoke weed with my niggas
Still rolling weed on my XXL
Only difference is that's me on the cover
Once in a while call my little sister and tell her I love her
Cause shit can get crazy in this industry
Most of your friends become your enemies
That's why I stay down with the ones that's still with me
The niggas who started and they down to ride to the end with me
Make sure the positive energy keep flowing
All the weed keep rolling
And all of us keep getting high, the sky
We gonna keep from falling
Niggas keep hating, but baby I'mma keep ballin'
A lot of y'all turned fakers, you found out what I make
Now I'm buying a steak
Going on private island vacations
Flying on private planes
I'm cool with the pilot, he let me roll something
Put on a movie, let my girl watch it
At the dealer, high, look at that Ferrari option
Just an everyday life, when you young and bossin..
I Love You Baby ;)Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Hunny say she love herself so mesmerized
Could tell that she smoke I see it in her eyes
Rollin up weed that’s my everyday
My ’69 drop ain't got no ashtray
I smile a lot, but baby girl I do not play
Aiyyo, my man Phife Diggy, he got something to say
I like 'em brown, yellow, Puerto Rican or Haitian
Name is Phife Dawg from the Zulu Nation
Told you in the jam that we can get down
Now let's knock the boots like the group H-Town
You got BBD all on your bedroom wall
But I'm above the rim and this is how I ball
A gritty little something on the New York street
This is how I represent over this here beat
Talking 'bout you
Yo, I smoked you out
I let hit with the bong, and blow the whole thing out
She like me cause my weed come  from another state
Pullin kush out by the pound girl it wasn't a 8th
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Stretch out your legs, and get comfortable
Roll that mary jane, smell it through the wall
Careful how you smoke, it's very strong
Stronger than thai, stronger than cologne
Take you to the club and you buy me drinks
Now I wanna pound of kush that really stinks
Keep some marijuana and I'll be your boy
Original rude boy, never am I coy
You can be a shorty in my ill convoy
Not to come across as a thug or a hood
But hon, you got the goods, like Madelyne Woods
By the way, my name's Malik
The Five-Foot Freak
Let's say we get together by the end of the week
She simply said, "No", labelled me a ho
I said, "How you figure?" "My friends told me so"
I hate when silly groupies wanna run they yap
Word to God, hon, I don't get down like that
I'll have you weak in the knees that you could hardly speak
Or we could roll and puff a L and I can F you to sleep
Do our own thing yea we keep it unique
When I get over to your crib then we officially meet
If my mom don't approve, then I'll just elope
Let me save the little man from inside the boat
Let me hit it from the back, girl I won't catch a hernia
Bust off on your couch, now you got Seaman's Furniture
Chevy Woods, Jerm, and Ricky P
Loody, Motor, Lonny and my big man Breeze
They know Khalifa man is really soul on ice
The character is of men, not a computer lie
Shorty let me tell you about my only vice
It has to do with lots of chronic and it ain't nothin nice
Relax yourself girl, please settle down
Light one out for Phife DawgUm, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you
Wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend 
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Buses nigga too, had to charge it to the game
Always want to start em in the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You stop all the cameras than life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Never gets boring
And haters in your face you just ignore 'em
Don't know what they talking shit for
Seems niggas get there's you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborn
Seen all the bullsh-t and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
Then thoughts started getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
These scars show what your pain is
But was it all worth, it's just painless
Say you wanna be famous
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just startin' I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my life
But chances I don't 'em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase 'em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from x2

Made a way for all my niggas to get paid to say the least
Made it way up out my city and they can't even believe
Niggas saying shit on Twitter that they can't even delete

Smokin' weed & doin' what we want
We live our lives
And ain't no one gon' bring us down
Staying out, sleeping when we can
Cause we don't stop
Going hard, wake up in the morning
Do it all again!
Roll up the Marley, let's get it started
Life of a party!
Let's live for today, we might not be here tomorrow
And they say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, mooore
Every time I hear the music
I go crazy
Floating there you take me away
Higher we've ever been before
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Take me to the clouds
Every time I hit the club
I take my money, I spend it all
Standing on the couch just showing love
Don't give a damn
Don't give a fuck
Float me and take me away
High up in the clouds, never coming down
Somewhere out the space, never on the ground
Always turning up, never turning down
Another hundred grands
As soon as I turn around
Take me up to where I wanna be
Tired as fuck, but we don't wanna sleep
Mary Jane and them paper planes
Pouring shots, you better take this drink
And they say I'm TOO WILD
They said I'm TOO FUN
They say it's TOO MUCH
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, mooore
They say I'm too wild
They said I'm too fun
They say it's too much
But too much ain't nothin' at all!
Cause we just want more, moore
We just want more, moooreIt's ya boy Mr. Easy Rider

I'm so fly I'm in the air, I'm like a young superhero
Wanna ride with the kid? Everything tatted
From my neck to my hands, wanna star then you got it
Gotta charm full of stones, a belt full of phones
Pockets glowing out with money, gibson linen in my home
Yeah
However far away
I will always love you
However long I stay
I will always love you
I be out of state pimping, different cities going hard
Bottles getting ordered, when you see me and my squad
Rolling weed up in cigars, you smoking that garbage
If you seen what's in my blunt, you wouldn't even wanna spark it
I'm smoking that ?, I'm high all day
Little mommy got a body I can slide in all ways
That's why I want to blaze with ya 
You ain't gotta worry bout a thing you with young KhalifaSee this a movement with this music you just tunin' in 
Units we maneuvering, and you niggas ain't due to win 
I'm with some all stars, god we superb
Fly with the words and good for stayin' high off the herb
Minus the herbs, my city's filled with live mother fuckers 
Where- niggas stack they paper, and you'll die if you touch it
I'm with guys that'll pump shit, and leave you dead
The Feds love how I paint a picture, seem so clear
Shit I'll make your face see through queer, I'm on top of my game
And treat these rappers like prey, I'm on top of the chain 
I got the heat cuz, heavy in these streets cause
I had a street buzz before I had peach fuzz 
You niggas oughta know, I'm chillin' but my squad'll blow
A youngin' with a harder flow will probably get him larger dough 
Zonin' blowin' tropical, ownin' me's impossible
I'm movin' on to larger scale, you workin' with a garbage flow
 
Niggas know, but they hate, so they act, like they don't
If you think, you gonn' try, I'm right here, what you want?
We can go, hood for hood, block for block, town for town
Niggas know, and that's it, and that's how, it goes down
And Y'all know

You dudes losin' the game, state troops move for the cane
You get knocked for this shit
You start talkin' and shit

He see you holdin' them chips, see you rollin' them whips

And you can send whoever you want, he won't stop me

Hungry so we need a plate, takin' yours to feed the face
Makin' noise, Wiz Khalifa slayin' the streets

HangoverDfY’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through
That's why I do me, cos really
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through
That's why I do me, cos really
First off, I'm a Pittsburgh veteran
Stay true to the game, nobody better than
In it for a minute, I ain't just here to set a trend
Rap slow, quick, flow sick, need medicine
Hard to get ahead and prevail, keep my head and be well
When these cops want me dead or in jail
That's why I'm moving at a fast pace, leaving you in last place
If you was brought up broke, all you know is the cash taste
You see I grind for mine, that's what you get from me
I work hard dawg, cause ain't shit for free
So youu can stand out, waiting for a hand out
Me, I'mma go get it, no win or go figure
I got a hot rhyme, stop mine? No, nigga
In the hood where the good kids turned coke flippers
Yeah, the block when there's hot summers, cold winters
Real beginners, killers hoping that the Lord forgive us
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through
That's why I do me, cos really
Y’all know, someone try to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when I see you
Cowards ain't real, you niggas see through
That's why I do me, cos really
See this is more than what you used to, you dudes
Prolly won't admit I'm the truth when I'm through the roof, who
Want it with the youngin, I’m comin' at one-a same kind
Hit the ground runnin', I'm gunnin' to take the game
President putting drugs in the hood that set the trap, man
With the laws seeking, it's hard being a black man
No pop, so they flow rocks to the crack fans
I seen it all too soon, you just a rap fan
And had to earn chips, all that i'm concerned with
Learn quick, school everyday but don't learn shit
Most the teachers think I be a nigga turned stiff
I'm a wordsmith, next to nothing that you heard, prick
Yeah I'm the Burgh's prince, because i'm a sicko with the words spit
Pittsburgh been through all the Burgh's pits
Fuck what u heard it’s, enough to make a nigga turn flips
Sometimes I see why niggas turn bricks
Cause in the Burgs, shit's all about survival here
Niggas grind to get rich, most die trying here
So I'mma spit till I'm considered a pioneer
You might be hot but Khalifa bringing the fire here!
Y’all know, someone tryin to hate us so i breeze through
Ain't no conversation when i see you
Yeah, the written be real
And I hail from the ill gritty City of Steel
Let's do it!

Oh, I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me 
We in love, we get to the paper
And if another one choose you don't trip
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch 
You ain't gotta stop, go hard, don't quit
Chillin' at the crib, when you out, you that bitch
Used to be skinny, now you gettin' thick
Used to want a boyfriend, now you want dick
You a bad lil bitch
Tryna rack up, tryna get rich
Tryna get money for a new Birkin
Tryna secure the trip for your girlfriend
Tryna lock down the D like a permit
Other girls try to hit, you determined
When the bitches come around, you make 'еm nervous
Make them othеr niggas pay for your service
Me?
I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it 
She wouldn't know what to do without me 
We in love, we get to the paper 
And if another one choose you don't trip 
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch 
I'ma show her what these racks do
Gettin' top in my homeboy's bathroom
She got all that ass on her when she pass through
Good brain, she the smartest in the classroom
She gon' bust it for a nigga, I'ma throw them ones
I'ma need a replay, baby, not just once
Told her, we just getting started, and the nights still young
We gon' need more shots 'til we both get drunk
Look, I'm a fool with it
You paid the doctor for it, what you gon' do with it?
Its brand new to me, I don't care who hit it
No kids, sorry, I can't let loose in it
You be cuffin' on a bitch, I let her choose, nigga
I'm on top, my block is off
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me 
We in love, we get to the paper 
And if another one choose, you don't trip 
Thats how I know you a down ass bitch
He thought he was rich 'til I made him richer
He thought he was really winnin' 'til he met a winner
My nigga in the summer ain't my nigga in the winter
Spend that cash on a nigga if you really fuckin' with it
Its just me and mine we countin' this money all day
We so in line, don't matter what nobody say
And I'll flip a brick quick instead of talkin' shit
With the shit, slap a bitch if she too up in my mix
On my nigga, all up on his dick, bitch, get a grip
I heard you thirsty for the tea, bitch, I know you wanna sip
Want a sip
I'm on top, my block is off 
Soon as you walk up to me, I'ma make her count it
She wouldn't know what to do without me 
We in love, we get to the paper
And if another one choose, you don't trip 
Thats how I know you a down ass bitchBack better than ever
Ask me what I’m doing, I’ve been stacking, autographing
Smoking tree with your girlfriend if she let us
Making sure my bags packed for any weather
Tighten up, your team starting to let up
Assembly need to get it together
I remember there was days I wasn’t able to change clothes
Now I never wear the same clothes
Same goes for my bad bitch, rich and her accent thick
But her ass ain't, she’ll carry my last name
Still a step I’ll never miss, I’m on this cash chase
Ballin’ off the glass change
Jordan, me and my gang running the game
You niggas just tryna find what the score is
I can hear that money callin’
Ain't in the position you’re in, can’t ignore it
I’m all in
And they saying that we changed
Homie, they don’t know as much as they think they know
And you know I love to stay with you
But I gotta go, baby I hear that paper callin’
Another day, another plane
Baby girl, I hear that paper calling
I’m going out the door as soon as that paper callSomething 'bout the way you move
I can't keep my eyes off you, yeah
Something 'bout the things you do
Fill me up with gratitude
I love you just the way you are
And I don't really, don't really see your flaws
Baby, you're a work of art
And you don't even know you are
Whatever you do
Don't change what you do 
It's all about you 
Whatever you do, whatever you do, don't change you 
No matter how they try to flip the script on you
Stay exactly the way you are, don't change you 
And even when the world rejеcts and judges you 
Whatever you do, whatеver you do, don't change you 
Okay, never breakin' down always gon' hang around
When I'm at work, you the one I'm thinkin' 'bout
Think he got one better, tell him, "Bring her out"
Tongue out, show 'em what that middle finger 'bout
Make you hit a high note just like you a singer
If they ever doubted, turn them to believers
Got 'em bringing out awards for all your achievements
Seen the number one spot, you wanted to be it
I could keep a secret, we don't gotta tell
Always need you with me, never by myself
You ain't gotta shop around, leave 'em on the shelf
You the only one, I don't need nobody else
This ain't game 'cause you heard that before
If they playin', we gon' even the score
When they walk past, they can hear us through the door
We make it hard to ignore 
Whatever you do 
Don't change what you do 
It's all about you 
Whatever you do, whatever you do, don't change you Just the wind in my hair from the top 'cause I got it down
Booking flights for myself, it's just me when I'm out of town
And that my heart breaks everytime I see your face
Wish I could make you smile this time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time, I ain't skipping over it this time
I ain't missing out, I'ma get mine
Looking back like "Damn, it was just time"
This time, I won't be feeling nothing, I'll be just fine
Take the perfect shot, I ain't gon'' misfire
This time, everything is aligned if you just being definеd
Just the wind in my hair from the top 'cause I got it down
Booking flights for mysеlf, it's just me when I'm out of town
And that my heart breaks everytime I see your face
Wish I could make you smile this time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
This time around, this time around
And around we go
You ain't with me unless we both got a pound to blow
Before you met me, wasn't even around the smoke
Now you be rolling it up and blowing it down for sure
You say it's been a minute
You love it when I'm in it
You never wanna finish
You say it's been a minute
You love it when I'm in it
You never wanna finish
Don't play, you want the business
Hearts been broken
Truths been spoken
Peaceful thinking
Minds been opened
Hold you in my arms
Keep you here with me
Don't wanna let you down
So I can make you smile this time around, this time around
Time around, this time around
Time around, this time aroundDoubt me, doubt me, doubt me, doubt me
Diamonds pressing all up on my chest, mhm
Fuck with me, you fuckin' with the best, mhm
No sleep, I don't get no rest, mhm
Lot of ink covering my flesh, mhm
Stay out in the west but I run my city
Shorty got a friend, they can both come with me
We gon' roll up, pour a drink, get tipsy
Rolling up a J screaming "R.I.P. Nipsey"
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twentiеs at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twentiеs at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Grind everyday, I don't get no break
I be up early trying to get this cake
Brought enough weed so we all get baked
Brought enough gin so we all get straight
Always on time, I don't call in late
Niggas mad, look at all this hate
Big bud, you don't call this shape
Wizzle Man, what you call him? Great
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, doubt me
Even when they doubt, when they doubt me, I'll be on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
Twenties at the bottom, hundreds on top
When they doubt me, doubt me
When they doubt me, I'll be on top
When they doubt me, doubt me
When they doubt me, I'll be on topYeah
It's another one of those...
Y'all niggas know
412, Wiz Khalifa
Yeah
I'm so incredible, wait, with no metal to waste
I flow great, and that'll level ya face
And I'll still let a nigga have it
You talk greasy but you still a faggot
I front on cowards cause you niggas backwards
I got my money right, game on top
And it's been said that I'm the key to put this game on lock
I'm from the city of the triflin' hoods
But when you see me, got a smile on my face
Nothin' sweet, it's just that life is good
Yea, I dodged the hood, slums came up out that
Rap game about that, to gain pay without crack
See I'm a youngin' with too much on my plate
To let some small change half a youngin' dumped in a cage
I seen niggas make sales
Niggas get knocked and make bail
And take lives, their worries ain't jail
With no regards for life cause their livin' ain't well
Who gotta make it to heaven cause they livin' in hell
But me, I don't do much just keep to myself
And stop these cock-suckin' mothafuckas seekin' my wealth
I was told the world's cold but I see for myself
And I'm too hot to take the backseat or the shelf
So I'm here, for some reason though, they hate it to death
The love's gone, only hatred is left
Only achin' and stress
A king not to be mistaken for less
And this here is for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!
Yeah
It's ya boy Wiz, man
Prince of the City of Steel, you already know, man
It's history in the making what we doing right here
Fuckers can hate it if you want to, just sit back and laugh, smoke and get money on y'all niggas, you already know
Ain't nan' nigga gon' stop my grind
Work too hard to get here, you feel me
Let's do it!
Where I'm from, it's kinda hard to trust
Cause the hate's from most of your own people
They're fake and they're all see-through
Hate to see a nigga when he's stackin' his bucks
Rather him be down in the dumps, and out on his luck
But I'll be damned if my grind stop
My mind tickin' like a time watch
And I'm gonna be spittin' 'till the time's not
Presently there, I touch minds everywhere
And I'll ride hoping heaven is near
See the pain in your eyes, young with every stare
I seek peace, but these streets will never be fair
Cause somebody done took Greg's life
Son reached, deceased
No time to blink or think twice, damn
Wonder when it's gonna be my time to meet death
I'm stressed, need to ease my mind
And unless one of y'all try to see what's mine
Then I'll eat through your flesh, bones, and leave that spine
You see I did the right thing
I stayed up out the gun and knife game
I knew about the pain it might bring
And we all got problems
I chose to smoke blunts just to drown 'em
The top, but I rose from the bottom
And I'm here now, ain't no body harming young
My screw's loose, they say something's wrong with young
Your time's up, I'm just warning young
Cause this here's for the taking, this is history in the making, yeah!
Yeah, y'all muhfuckas better play close attention to what's going on, man, that's what it is
Rostrum Records
What up Benjy! Yeah
Thanks for that doe, nigga, I needed that
What up Chad!
ID Management, ID Labs, E. Dan, Hub, BLAH!
What up Pittsburgh!
412
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Uh
I'm tryna have the wrist all glitted up
Whip all kitted up
Niggas say Cam change, Wiz couldn't give a fuck
Spit it like my last song, one life, live it up
Niggas see Cam's change, kids couldn't get a buck
So please don't approach me man
Like this a free show, cause you don't know me fam
And please don't extend your hands like you know we fam
And please don't pretend like we homies, scram
Where was all this love at when I was only Cam?
When I was tryna sell y'all my only jam?
I don't keep friends, when we only fam
And take falls, I'll never, I will only stand
I'ma make this all riches, is what I told E then
If you don't know me now, then how you know me then?
And I hope y'all loving the kid, but if not, it's
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
I'm tryna have the strip all whipped out
Crib all pimped out
Chicks smiling in my face, tongues all licked out
Flat on the front side, back all sticking out
Waiting for that one time a rap nigga dig her out
But you gon' have to slow up love
Tryna skee cause she think I'ma blow up cuz
All she thinking is me getting her nails done, and her hair done
Ma, I'm not the one
I don't need no chick plotting all my chips
No birds tryna fly with me on my trips
If I am with a Miss, she a down ass chick
So take a sec, just chill and get off my tip
I'm just tryna get rich of these tracks I get
And you tryna get rich off the scratch I get
And you chicks think it's all about bread, but it's not, it's..
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
]
Cause I want to tell you, that there's no point in hating anybody
Because to the extent that you tear down another, you tear down yourself
We have to understand that
I'm tryna have the city on lockdown
Fam off the block now
Money coming fast, more cash than the cops now
Would harass, but they can't really not now
Used to laugh, but your man's really hot now
I used to rap for the kids in class
Told em I would use rap just to get my cash
And I was only worried about how to get my math
And told my teachers and the staff they can kiss my ass
Cause I can't find a interest in my book
So I stayed to myself in every class I took
Supposed to be doing work, but I made my hooks
Cause I get motivation everywhere I look
And I show no regret for any chance I took
But I learn from mistakes just like I should
So if you dudes ain't paid your dues, for you fools it's...
Never too late, too late to stop-stop
Never too late, too late to stop-stopIf you a rat or you a snitch
You shouldn't listen to this
If you ain't talking Pittsburgh
If you ain't mention the prince
I'm sick with the spit
You pissed I get chips for this shit
This for my homies that be OT whip full of bricks
I'm on another level, dudes gotta catch up to my ride
I'm ahead of my time
I'm a threat to you guys, why?
I'm still a student, yet I'm fluent with my rhymes
Still that best of that good shit, professional hood shit
Bill Gates cake, I won't settle for hood rich
I'm fresh 'cus we don't sound like that other bullshit
My team hustle, no days off
And weigh so much salt? that you might have to take a snow day off
You ain't coming close to mine, if the cops bring a snitch about you
Me on my worst day is what you pricks amount to
Talk slick like the life we can't get about you
And have dirt on you like I have some shit about you
See Wiz Khalifa's like a teacher I could show you to
A spliff of reefer got me somewhere high up in the mountains
You claim to be S-T-A-R-S
But like your under 21 you can't fuck with my bars
Ask about me the streets think I'm the youngest in charge
Pimp too, leave the club with a truck full of broads
And if it's on then I'm crushing them all
You niggas prolly right, when you say that I ain't fucking with' cha' 'y'all, dog
I'm on a paper chase, moving unit state to state
So I let the haters hate, got about a cake to make
Money on the mind, moving at a greater pace
Hungry on the grind and I ain't eating off a paper plate
I need the finer things, came up on the rhyming game
Now they listening, take his picture in them designer frames
And they come with success some niggas gotta hate
I see you playin with me, it's different, it's not a game
I'm moving heavy in the trenches
Best flow, back dow 
When I knock any nigga senseless
I don't do much, smoke about a blunt or two or three
Gonna take more than a few bars to get through to meHear em talking, money make a hater madder than a bitch
Got my check up, now you know I get more cash than a bitch
Got a pocket full of paper and a bad yellow bitch
Ass fatter than a bitch
My car faster than a bitch
What you saying, make em madder than a bitch
What you saying, get more cash than a bitch
What you saying, got a bad yellow bitch
Ass fatter than a bitch, my car go faster than a bitch A hunnid billion dollars, that's the conversation
Nigga I got more whips than a dominatrix
Pretty bitch jump on my dick, lemme drive ya crazy
And you heard that my paper thicker than the yellow pages
Press that button lose the top, make it disappear
Its so lonely at the top, but I love it here
Pass that cream bitch I'm higher than Apollo 13
On that purple martini and a ounce of blue dream
So much money, make the counter blow a fuse
Live in the fast lane and fuck all the rules
I'm living on the edge, fuck a hater, fuck the feds
If I buy more ice, I might need to buy a sled Smoking loud, drinking hen, man I'm higher than a bitch
Lick harder than a bitch
Wanna stick it in a bitch
Ferragamo louis shit
All designer in this bitch
I got gold on my teeth and neck, I'm shining as a bitch
Bitch love to see this shit, niggas mad than a bitch
Throw a cop in the parking lot, just shot him bout a bitch
I ain't tripping bout you man, I'm on dead presidents
All my niggas killas and they scared of the penitent-ions
Money always make a broke nigga mad, make him envy
Never bowing down to a bitch, it ain't amendment
Lamborghini cost a ticket and I'm tryna rob that bitch
Pat your running up the check, we ain't tryna hit that shit You wanna say something about the pimp?
Gimme his address bitch I'ma come to his house
If they can feel that, then they can feel whats really going on down here right now mane
I'm glad we got an outlet where we can air these bitch ass niggas out
Know what Im talking about? I can go broke any minute, still making 4 million in an hour
Closing deals with the cartel on my speakerphone in the shower
My bitch want that sour
You niggas is cowards, get the fuck off of my lawn
I'm cutting the grass with them choppas
Bullets is sounding like do-do-do-do hitting niggas and flowers
I don't fly jets, I buy jets
I'm from the low rise, high ground, projects
Fuck you and your street cash, little ass pub check
You sign niggas, I sign niggas, I buy the label
I'm in the Soho House in the library, eating sushi with Cung Le
Getting throwed from your politician, this ho wanna elect me
Still a hood nigga tryna fuck everything
Life in the villa, getting zarilla, nigga
Think of my scrilla
Keeping my wolves on deck like Michael on Thrilla412
I wanna do something a little different
Just to let y'all niggas know you can't fuck with me
Don't try this man, you are not me
Young Wiz
And if you fuck with me, grow
Used to just be a young'n spit-spittin' shit
Now I'm grown up in the game and get-gettin' it
Some of my old friends I can't kick it with
You a little slow, I'll show you what big business is
I be with those who own they own businesses
Blowin' big knots in spots where all the bitches is
I'm a star, don't talk to all the bitches-es
Give 'em time, they run to me like a finish line
Hatin' ass nigga actin' like a friend of mine
Get your day cut short like it's winter time
And I'm in the gr-grind 'til the end of time
The Young Beast, I'mma eat when it's dinner time
And my cig-cigarillo fill-filled with pine
Shit locked, but you still denyin'
That I'm the best that did, and the best that's do-doin' it
Prince of the city, I'm showin' and pro-provin' it
I'm on track, you cats are lo-losin' it
Go head, come at Wiz and look stupider
They said reach for the stars, I hit Jupiter
And now I'm workin' on my next galaxy
Never be another Young Khalifa after me
.25, you ain't even half of me
I work hard, dawg, no I don't relax a day
Could eat all y'all, but I don't like the aftertaste
What you niggas know about blowin' halfs of ray
In the lab gettin' 3 songs smashed a day
Got money up front, call it cash today
Got 3 bank accounts puttin' cash away
I do me to the fullest like Castaway
Throw a beat on and let a blunt ash away
I laugh today, and make y'all cry later
If the young boy reppin' the 'Burgh then why hate him
But I ain't worried cause my stacks gettin' bigger
If you ain't heard around, bitch I'm that ni-nigga
See me ridin' round window cracked, lit Swisher
Can't talk currency, I can't get wit ya
Who got it fucked up? Y'all convinced 'em
The hate in the equation just a small addition
My name Wiz Khalifa, but just call me mister...

Yo, is it only for folks who smoke weed or can people who don't smoke weed order too?

Oh, that's the bomb
Thank you, man
Ayy, I appreciate you, have a good one
Yes sir, you tooI'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'

You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
Oh man
Used to be the young one, now I turned to a grown man
Always gotta put on for my soldiers, fallen
Gotta run to it when I hear that money callin' 
Stand up
Can't be a lil' ass kid 'bout shit no more, gotta man up
It ain't about you at the end of the day, you got things you gotta handle
When they ask me why I go so hard, I blame that on where I came from
Pittsburgh, when it come to niggas I'm the realest version
Smoke good, man it's KK, you should see in person
Niggas hate when you come up, and this shit disturbin'
So much in my bank account, made a nigga nervous
Like, "What I'm gon' do with all that?"
Go hard and never fall back, tryna maintain
Focused on havin' good habits, if it work once, do the same thing
Pave the way for the people comin' up after me, to take the same lane
Been the same way since I came in the game, ain't a nigga ain't changed, mane
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'
I've worked too hard for me to not go on
You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
Gotta build and destroy
Gotta know what to avoid
Gotta hustle 'til it's gone
Gotta go 'til your feet can't no more
Gotta always stay strong
Gotta last real long, don't gotta live up to the expectations
Just gotta prove 'em wrong
If anytime they don't understand, it's somethin' you done show
How the ground really gone? How the whole dawn it'll be right there for him
On a rooftop, smokin' KK out a bong
With my real niggas that I started with, know one day they'd be on
Run away, niggas was strugglin'
Every day hustlin', now we got bank accounts goin' through customs in
They just be showin' us love
I could afford a dub
But I've learn to roll with the punches, if you wanna throw 'em, I cover up
Know that I got it, I don't need no confirmation
I smoke, ain't no ventilation
My money keep calculatin'
It's out there, then I'ma chase it
No question if I can make it
I'm feelin' like I'm the greatest
When you are real, one can never break you, it ain't 'bout all the mills that you put in the safe
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from
But I won't forget where I'm goin'
I've worked too hard for me to not go on
You don't know what it's like where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
I did what I had, I've my mistakes
My foot's on the gas and I won't hit the breaks
Win some and then some, I do what it takes
But I won't forget where I'm from
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
You know I didn't alone
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong
I'm not forgettin' where I'm comin' from 
But I won't forget where I'm goin' 
I've worked too hard for me to not go on 
You don't know what it's like where I'm from 
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh 
You know I didn't alone 
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh 
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong 
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh 
You know I didn't alone 
Oh, oh, ooh woah, oh 
Before you're right you gotta do it wrong Ya'll ready know
When I walk the fuck back
You can't act like
That ain't the flyest thing you've ever seen in your whole entire motherfucking sorry ass life
Can't say I'm not the freshest nigga that you've ever seen
I keep a couple grand - nothin less in my jeans
That's prolly why your bitch keep ringin' phone
And when I pull up she can't leave me alone
Lil homie I grind - No sleep
I'm good in the hood errybody know me
I got my trunk on blast
Hit me when I roll through
Stunt'n like a young nigga supposed to
Stunt'n like I'm supposed to
Riding with my hat cocked
Smokin' something good - 3 blunts and I'm smacked out
City on smash, game on padlock
26 inch rims, chrome on a matchbox
6 bad hoes man I can't choose 1
3 cell phones I just can't use 1
You see how often I spit
You just off bread hun
This the shit they can’t do young
Talk fly if you look ‘em in the air
Too young, you wonder were I got these Gucci parachute from
A lot of ya’ll mad
To me it’s just funny
I see why ya’ll hatin man the hoes just love me
And you know I’m gettin’ shhh
Fuck it I ain’t gotta say it
The tab taken care of nigga I ain’t gotta pay it
Yea, I’m all day with it, year round
I bet if you was here now
Got a fat knot, blunt rolled up
Me I ride clean
Neck froze up
Bad bitch on the side
My niggas all rich
Foreign whips what they drive
Yea, I smell like Gucci and big money too
See them guys with me? they gettin’ money too
Ride 22′s and got heat so
If a nigga try me you a big prob you runnin’ into
I smoke a lot need blunt or 2
At a time whole pounds I be runnin’ through
Yea, I got a dime bitch coming through
Cause I pimp like I’m supoosed to
Wonder how I get it like this, I could show you
Butter soft leather in the whip when I roll through
This year I’m a get shit cleared
Take a look at this kid hereIncom, incom, incom, incom, incompatible, 
It don't matter though 
Cause someone's bound to hear my cry 
Speak out if you do 
You're not easy to find. 
They say I'm on some shit, but I'm just workin hard
If you ain't on your job, then we can't get along
I'm smokin everyday, my money getting long N niggas gon hate
That's why I made this song
Shorty blowin up my phone, she say that she in love
No matter how much I give her, she say it ain't enough
Hold up it's not a game, or nothing to play with
You see the ice and lights on my spaceship?
Yeah, I'm out here livin, nigga famous in my songs
My paper too right, I can't do wrong
You think too small, I see the big picture
N I fuck wit real niggas, so I can't do yall
Too gone, I be reppin Taylor Gang, who yall?
N that talkin you doin can't do harm
Cuz I'm on, nothing left you can lie bout, but it only took once for me to find out
Pussy nigga we're...
Chours 
She say I'm on some shit, cuz I don't be at home
She called her daddy down, but I be on the road
Gotta get this money, so I gotta do these shows
Text me every day, but I don't even call or respond
Got the nerve to say I don't do you wrong
Look at my picture every time you hear my song
I tell you all the time, I get it together
Shoulda listened to ya girls, you can do better
I'm gone when you need me, busy when you're alone
It's hard to believe me, when I'm in the studio
Groupie hoes on a nigga, follow anywhere he go          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.

Watching for them undercovers
Lost a lil' piece of my heart when I lost my older brother
Gotta take care of my mother
Gotta show these niggas that my father's son ain't the one to fuck with
Taking chances and loving it
All the niggas that I started with, that's the ones I'm running with

Snake niggas runnin' north with the mouth
Quick to  the cops
And end up
Getting clapped and then chopped
I'm hazed up
All black in the 
More stacks than a knot
A dime piece with spectacular top
The deep texts keep snapping the 
But my niggas stay low
Clock big though, cops  get no info
And I'm surrounded by the rules and the breakers
Hustlers
Movers and shakers
 to the face quick
And me, I'm the same pimp
Hittin' your main chick
Switchin' the lane quick
I'm bit, but but the whip 
Hit the stoo, grab some shit I could roll
And it's off to the boof
It's real rap

Alive nigga from the 4-1-2s

I'm son of one of y'all niggas
Whatever you want

And I believe in god, but I live non-religious

Yeah, yeah, the wolves on a hunt for you
On some fly  shit
Quick, but the  you
Yeah, yeah, the team 'bout stackin' man
Pittsburgh, middle east, steel city 
Pistolvania be the state, you can call it Pakistan
When the young niggas deal with more weight than the average man
The best in my class, I'm the next to both
Even if you put me in yours, I'll be the best of both
And I'm the hardest in this city boo, next to both
GOV, what it is?
J, this is what it isWiz Khalifa
You’ve been lost with them rookies
Young Khalifa on this pro shit
So sick of standin still I could get you in motion
Trips out in the sand
Rollin swishers by the ocean
Toastin, private seats on the cloud and we ghostin
Used to play the low

Startin to get approached and your
Girlfriends gettin nosey
Still you hold me down
Hold me down ain’t ‘fraid to show it

We can kick it out in orbit
Or get done with this
Flip somewhere and record it
Says she got a man
But her man she gettin bored with
Love me cause I grind

The rest, you don't deal with them
I travel the world, three-hundred and sixty degrees
These hoes get adrenaline
They come to my crib see all the TV's
On the walls in the room that I'm living in
Why I got all these women friends?
Cause I'm spending Benjamins
I hope y'all don't break up
Cause if y'all don't make up
Then I'll be the nigga to get revenge
No, I ain't basic, she diggin' my style
Loving the way that I'm living so wild
Loving the way that I'm putting it down
Loving the way that I'm making her smile
Like had no really good dick in a minute, that's making her wild
And I'm the nigga that's with it
I'll start it and finish it
I'm with a broad that be tryna be innocent
I roll a joint she could probably hit it
Y'all will go broke in a matter of minutes
Ain't about the love, it's about the digits
See all this money in front of me?
Young nigga gotta get it
Taylor GangLa música de Harry Fraud
Drinkin' out some 
Fuckin' orange juice
It ain't no time for games
She got a whole lotta clothes at my place
Switch up your mind frame
No fallin' off, keep your head in the game
Now you got finer taste
Drinkin' that  as we watchin' the waves
We never partin' ways
You with me forever, no this ain't no phase
Hop in my rag top Chevy
Them aces and deuces and tres
Don't hesitate with my paper
She bring it through every occasion
Don't gotta tell the girl shit
Go out and get it, they do it by naturе
If she see one outside
Thеn she gon' bring me a new money maker
Lotta dips
But none like my bottom bitch
Do what she got to just to get it
And she proud of it
It's time to ride she gon' be right there beside me
Lame nigga ain't convinced
Lost his bitch, ain't seen her since
Hangin' out that whip when I come through 
Ridin' down that strip 
I pay attention on how to win 
Money I gotta get 
All my niggas stay one hudnred, they'll never change up 
Gotta drive , so I get too lit 
Real player shit
Too player, no keys, we gotta push to start
Try stayin' lowkey, but they know who we are
Star, lost connection with the bitch that I met at the bar
Fuck it, miss one next ten choose who gon' set the bar
I can stay anywhere I wanna stay 
You can say, anything you wanna say 
Make sure where you at, it's just not in my way 
If you work this hard then you can come and play 
'Cause I'm focused 
We noticed 
We run it 
See us when we ride through
Hangin' out that whip when I come through 
Ridin' down that strip 
I pay attention on how to win 
Money I gotta get 
All my niggas stay one hudnred, they'll never change up 
Gotta drive , so I get too lit 
Real player shit
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh-oh, oh-oh
As if it wasn't already easy enough 
There you have it 
Young legend 
And still legend 
I came a long way from that block with Sledgren
Down the streets with my big brother Chevy Woods
When a lotta niggas wouldn't even come to the hood 
Stayed solid when others fold 
That means we still got the same principles, morals and same code
Even though we all got kids and we a little bit older
I know  smilin' like a mug when he look down to see us
Lookin' at how we hustle heavy, and repped our Taylor Gang
'Til we made it out of our circumstances
Now there ain't no lookin' back, not even if we wanted to
Only movin' forward
Constant pressure bein' applied with the understandin' that this a legacy we leavin' behind
Lotta bumps on the road but shit, I ain't perfect
If you love me, you love me for who I am
Not who you want me to be
No one said the journey was gon' be easy
But they did say it'll be worth it
So I'ma enjoy every minute of it
With the people I consider very important, huh
That's VIP, oh yeah
So instead of countin' wins, we countin' blessings
Trustin' in God to show me the correct path instead of stressin'
Fool, only L I'm takin' is a lesson
Big Pimpin'Oh, it's hardly a secret
You ain't gon stop tryna get where you going until you reach it
Always had them bars back in the day
When the same ones running up on you wasn't speaking
Look at all your achievements
You work hard so it'd be kinda hard not to believe that
You party every weekend 
Fuck em all who act like they ain't see it then
All them nights on the plane
Losses a nigga took, had to charge it to the game
Always wanted stardom and the fame
Learn to out smart em
And now it ain't no stopping the champagne from poppin'
The draws from droppin'
Us seeing muscle cars and coppin' em
Started off just a little less popular
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras, live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you are
Never gets boring
And haters in your face, you just ignore em
Don't know what they talking shit for
See niggas get theirs, you just tryna get yours
Therefore, you left all the people you care for
Hopped on a plane and got airborne
Seen all the bullshit comin' and fell for it
But it's all good now
Cause the same ones that talk shit telling everyone you made it
Then you start seein' hoes you dated
And thoughts start getting jaded
Now your life's sort of different ain't it
Feel your scars knowin what your pain is
But what's it all worth if it's painless?
Say you wanna be famous
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you
Are are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Who you are
Always knew I was this good
But never knew I'd be this good
Them niggas just starting, I've been doing it
Hear em talk but they ain't living my life
In the dark tryna get in my light
But chances I don't get em, dodge twice
Spendin' grands for hoes, this is the high life
And for the camera's posing this the high life
Bottles raising for my niggas not here
I pour out a couple sips
Blew em on the beach, I smoke for you on my trips
Them days I was younger I knew this life was the shit
But never like this
It's so amazing, we ain't gotta duck shots
We just pour and chase em
Ain't worry bout it, cause they gon hate
Know where I'm going, look where I came from
Now you got a new place
You drive a new car
You smile for the cameras live life like a superstar
Don't care what they say
You reach for the stars
Got everything you always dreamed or thought about
And everyone knows who you
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are, are
Are, are, are, are, are, are, are

We doing the brighter side of things we overachieve

Might not leave with everything, but we for sure get a piece
Fix it up, put it on the streets
If I ain't in my 6-4, then my Benz creep
Up and down the street
Run to the money, can't nothin' else get me on my feet
We ain't even gotta watch for police
It's legal now, they allow us to grow trees
My hotel suite describe the definition of chic
Tryin' not to ash on the sheets
Got a balcony we won't see
30 mil' a year, still tryna be lowkey
And that's just me, not even to mention my OG
Get money 'fore we dip, then we proceed
It's funny how niggas get

With us, your girl hella talkative 'round rich niggas
Hustle is all I know, spend it and get some more
I'm stayin' on the go, hopin' it don't get slow
I'm on the paper route with my folk
Ain't part of this game, a joke
Wrap it up like a brick of coke
Call a play like a give-and-go
Ballin' for real, toss an alley oop off the pick and roll
Rollin' hundred spokes gold, my Rolex frozen
Have you ever seen a quarter of a million dollars rollin'?
Bein' drivin' like it's stolen, by a stoned stoner
One of the originals who showed you fools how to turn the internet rhymes into residuals
I put away a whole lot of loot and stayed true, that's what we do
Make it easy to choose, so guess what?
You wonderin' why she gettin' all dressed up
You in the house, messed up, all stressed, for what?
Hustle is the only thing gon' keep your lights on, fuck love
Money is the mission, it's skrilla over bitches
Standin' in the way, then fuck him and whoever with him
Pull up on her and she make a decision to get in

For what it's worth, I'ma get it done for the money
Bad bitch with a accent
Askin' for her IG, she just wanna know where the cash is
Where she from you can't imagine
At home, she got some bad kids
You ain't my sons, you my grandkids
Outlandish, caught you red-handed
Stealin' styles, that's standard
But what happen when you get abandoned?
That mean I'ma leave a lot of niggas stranded
Fired up, they wanna know what the strain is
Roll another one
Always knew I'd be the man when I was comin' up
The game made a nigga toughen up
Now all the girls wanna come with us
I don't need to know her number
If it's on, then it's on, meet me deeply undercover
We don't text or call each other
I give my all or nothing
Let you do all the cuffing
Doobies, I'ma roll a hundred, I done brought enough in
When I handle my biz, ain't no interruption
I just let my money talk, it ain't no discussion
The way that shorty give me head, she get a concussion
The best thing that you could do is don't make an assumption
The flow's so dope, cops come in, you flush it
Man, my watch bustin'
I'ma always take my time, I don't ever rush shit
Goin' for fourth down while you niggas puntin'
I just throw a couple rounds, I don't do the lovin'
Not to mention fussin'
Don't be callin' up my phone sayin' all that fuck shit
Got McQueen, couple gold bottles at the function
Say I'm lookin' like a boss, but it's really nothin'
I just came from customs
Got your bitch crushin'
See me and she blushin'
She just left her husband
Let you do all the cuffing
Doobies, I'ma roll a hundred, I done brought enough in
When I handle my biz, ain't no interruption
I just let my money talk, it ain't no discussion
The way that shorty give me head, she get a concussion
The best thing that you could do is don't make an assumption
The flow's so dope, cops come in, you flush itI would never sell myself short, I'm too cocky
Niggas got a problem with that, then you stop me
I think dudes is mad cuz you not me
So you get a pen and a pad and you copy
But at the same time
Man you could never get away with the same rhymes
So you could take mines
You fellas can't shine
I take time great lines from a great mind, was under wraps
But now youngins back, Pittsburgh's front and back
Hip hop's Maurice Green the way I'm running tracks
Man who could fuck with that, fam nobody
Got damn so hot, he got fans all on him oc
I said it before, I'll say it again
I'm playing to win, I punch lines grazing the chin
And then, the rhyme ends with a knockout blow
So you could call this a knockout flow
Come fuck with me
I'm a soldier
Cruising on the left like I told ya
Camouflage faces look colder
Make the wrong move and I'll fold up, whoa
I'm a soldier
Wiz been the best brush your shoulders
Hustling now so when I'm older
All my children will grin free from sin
And the poison that makes us the men
I'm a soldier
By all means necessary I protect the family
And lyrically, test to me you'll be next to bury
My brainstorms alone enough to force your worry
Yours is just a flurry
Fame short as February
You ain't ill, you just acting sick
This ain't no motherfucking action flick
Cuz if you actually hit
There's no more time given to tick
You like movies I'll give you a clip
And that's it nigga
Lights out game over
I'm sick and all about bank roll and large amounts can't hold him
Got the rap game sewn up
And anybody acting like they got fame
Pop and watch they whole frame fold up
Man I done got far
Besides the fact that I got bars
An attitude like a rock star
And if you got war keep it to your lonesome
And I ain't never claimed to be a killer but I own some
I came back around
And anyone who couldn't stand me I sat em down
Go head and ask around
A skinny nigga, 6'3" with a massive sound
Fiending to back em down
See what will happen now
I'm only one man, but I came to change things
Still tryna maintain, new player same game
I'm like Leatherface, working with that chain thing
I don't rock bells, I ain't L son my name rings
I'm a soldier, stand tall screw face
I thought I told ya, fatigues on and boots laced
My crews breaking large sinning and lord willing
My talents will reach all women and God's children
You ain't hot, you should level yourself
Lick a shot, put an end to your health
But I ain't doing that
I rather murder all these heads on the shelf
Man I'm hotter than the devil himself
And that's real niggaTalk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Talk to me, I talk back
Let's talk money, I talk that
Yeah! It's Young
Wiz Khalifa man
412, Pittsburgh, Pistolvania and all that
Uh-huh
But right now we gon' talk money
So talk to me
Ya kno? Yeahhh!
If she wanna talk to me, I'mma talk back
Said she love my music and she think I'm all that
Told me I be on her mind like a fitted ball cap
Love the way I blow money, and get it all back
Cup full of that Patron, swisher like a ball bat
Skinny lil nigga but my pockets all fat
And I'm lookin for a dime, or better yet a dub
So if that pussy good go on and show a nigga love
Yeah, I'm posted in the club and there's freaks errywhere
Bottle after bottle, good weed up in the air
I see a bad bitch look at me when she stare
So I'mma go and say a couple things in her ear
I tell her I'm the man, and that I run the town
You think about it, I could change your life right now
And if your nigga trip, then best believe it's goin down
If shit get outta line, there ain't no need to go around
Just come and...
Ay, ay
Grippin on this honey while I'm puffin my reefer
Youngin talk money, get a homie bilingual
If she lookin like a hungry ho that's how I treat her
No I don't need her, go on off the meter
I don't chase hoes, chase cheese like the cheetah
You be all polite, sayin please when you meet her
I don't even greet her, just look her in the face
Pull her to the side, let her give my blunt a taste
Ask her what she drank, a little this, alotta that
Forget about a shot cause we got bottles in the back
Shawty, swallow some of that, and get low
And move that thing around like a certified pro
Cigarillo full of 'dro, so what you wan' do?
Your girls know the biz, you can bring your friends too
And you can do you, cause they gon' do me
I'd rather do y'all, I'm down for all three
Just come and...The Angel Is Mine Til' I'm Gone

Okay

Niggas down to pay for it, so you get just what you want
Make 'em fly you out to games, make 'em take you out to lunch
If the nigga don't pay, he can look but don't touch
You be textin' all the time, like you miss me so much
I ain't seen you in a minute, think it’s time to pay up
Say you don’t get off 'til 4AM, I stay up
I ain’t waitin' for that pussy, bitch that purse gettin' took
Who say wе got enough time?

I'm just here for a good time, baby not a long time
I don't wanna make you mine
It's been a little minute since you been up at the crib
And you need a nigga help, say you tryna get some bread
If you talkin' to a nigga, I'ma tell you how it is
If you suck a nigga dick, you might as well get rich
Might as well make a nigga pay for it when he click
Might as well get us both paid and bring another dip
Four, five bitches in the section, you don't trip
'Cause they all gotta pay breakin' bitches for they tips
Who say we got enough time?

I don't wanna make you mine
Who say we got enough time?

I don't wanna make you mineIntro:
Shake’n bake
Nigga ain’t doin’ nothing, just sittin’ here and swaggin
It’s easy though
It’s easy to not give a fuck
Verse 1:
Fresh outta first class
Fresh outta herb nap
My outfit straight outta fur
So fresh to death
My car from overseas
The steering wheel on the other side
I’m givin’ it
All I got is smokin’ what’s left
So much money on weed
So much smoke in my chest
I take the lessons I learned
And put ’em all in my flesh
Tatted, got a strong weed habit
Going hard, could have sworn you niggas had it
Buying champaign with the tabins
We order more drinks, bring the cabs in
Rip up jeans, call it fashion
A lot of cash and a lot of gras
You niggas broke, you ain’t gotta pass
Chanel bags and I’m proud of tags
Spendin’ stash, you ain’t gotta stack
Young and rich, don’t know how to act
As the wheels keep spinnin’ and my joint keep burning
And my team keep winnin’
Chorus:
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold up
Verse 2:
Thinking ’bout some shit, that rap taught me
Sittin’ in a whip, that rap bought me
Look at all the things, that I’m affording
My nigga mean I’m ballin’ like a sports team
You doin’ some shit, you think is flossin’
I was doing that back, when I was fourteen
Gettin’ it, buying the most, flippin’ it
Sixteen, time to pay rent in this bitch
I wasn’t even thinking of making millions
I was just thinking smokin’ and chillin’
And trying to pay the bills
Try get my mom out of this building
And I got my mom out of this building
I never took a hand out
Matter fact I put my hand in
Now everything you see is planned by me
Boss of my own shit, TAYLOR GANG E.N.T
Nothing but that cali strong
Gettin’ blown by the pound, bitch TNT
Chorus:
Roll up, whats the hold up
Roll up, whats the hold upI'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled
I'm blowin' every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
Concentrated, everyday I'm faded
Tree's prepared and properly cultivated
I nursed 'em, sprayed down, no chemicals
Just me and my buddy, ya hear me now
Never treat ya wrong, to each his own
Snoop and Wiz the new Cheech and Chong
We up in smoke, making street schemes
Smoking sticky green, having sweet dreams
Break it down, put it in the zig zag
And pull the top back and let the ass drag
Hit the switch, quickest way to get a bitch
Executive branch, get a whiff of this
Black car, sack a dank
High school nigga what the fuck you think
I'm passing all my classes with flying colors
And everyday I'm high as a muthafucker
I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled
I'm blowin' every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
Sun roof open, smoking while I'm rolling
My bitches only notice it if it's potent
Bottle of Perignon, we can go kick it by the ocean
Get in between your legs
Join roaches and ashes all in your bed
You calling her babe, she calling me instead
'Cause I put that game all in her hair
She saw the crib, she know that I'm balling
When he ain't have nothing he used to stall 'em
Now I with the boss dogg, all the bad hoes want him
And my pockets on swole, I'm talking Rick Ross big
And now when we shop we don't care what the cost is
Rolling up good, smoking that bomb shit
Blow a whole OZ, nigga that's boss shit
Now she all fuck her man, rubber bands in my pocket
Getting money, going hard for my profit
Bad bitch keep the joint stuffed like stockings
Young nigga getting bread, why knock it
I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled
I'm blowin' every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good that
We welcome you to the high school
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
We welcome you to high school
We do just like we like to
We cordially invite you
Now roll up get high to it
Get high to it yeah
I'm smoking everywhere I go
I always gotta keep one rolled
I'm blowin' every gram I own
Don't gotta understand, they know
I smoke that, fire that, good that good thatChorus - 
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no 
Verse 1 - 
You niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', all your talkin' is cheap
And my veins is concrete, I'm the heart of this street
Your squadron is weak, I creep with a five-star class
We beef, your block will look like a five-car-crash
Ya know, that you can tell it great, Wiz gettin' hella cake
Keep a chick to freak it with, I'll let you niggas LTH
That's lovin' these hoes, I'm pumpin' these flows
Cuz' I hate these rap niggas, but I'm lovin' the dough
Got a problem, we can solve it, man it's nothin' to show
If I ain't rappin', I'm relaxin' somewhere puffin' an O
I'm with a bad one on the back block, cruisin' through the scene
And I know your man as me, but Wiz Khalifa spittin' crack rock
Niggas out her rattin' man,  taking snapshots
That's why I hit the lab, get the cash like a jackpot
You niggas mad cuz' the pad look like a stash spot
And niggas gettin' money over here, and your ass not
Chorus - 
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin' 
Verse 2 - 
Yo, if a hater trip, go ahead and blaze his shit
Even young kids say Young Wiz is their fa-vo-rite
Khalifa knock it out the park, franchise made it sick
Leavin' niggas in the dark, greedy and i'm takin' chips
And as far as these broads and this green
I got a dollar full of dimes, and a pocket full of G's
You can take it any way, and that's probably what I mean
Long as the , and the dutchie's full'a weed
See I ain't hard to please, ease when your squadron leave
You don't want the goonies in the riddle, let a cartridge squeeze
You niggas think you low, but i see you guys pop up
Make your team divide like a piece of pie
Why? Cuz' i keep it fly, fresh when I'm creepin' by
Got a mean team, but for me, I'm a peaceful guy
But don't get out of line, cuz' for them dollar signs
The full clip, will make a nigga's thoughts sit out his mind
Chorus - 
If it's on and poppin', go ahead and move somethin'
And if a hater trip, go ahead and do somethin'
If it's on your chest, go ahead and prove somethin'
If not, stop frontin', you niggas ain't hurtin' nothin', no Mhm
Yessir!
I say yessir!
I just copped a chain that I like
I just got some brain at the light
I don't even exchange if I don't like it
I go off the brain, I don't write
I've flown too many planes in my life
I need a bad bitch, not a wife
I need that plastic when I swipe
I need a million dollars, not advice
Call me, I hit, never call her twice
Call me the kid, my flow very nice
New car, new crib, watch look like a bucket full of ice
Fuck it, I'm just livin' life
All my niggas trained to go, but we don't wanna fight
Never coppin' when I land, we bring it on the flight
Said he got a mil', I said "I'll be there by tonight"
And I'm a boss, so I never pay the full price
Silver shadow
I leave these niggas in the dust, they wish they could be us
Glowing shadow
These fake niggas I don't trust 'cause they see me out
Shining brightly
In the air, in the air
For all to see
And we ain't goin' nowhere, we gon' be right here
Big shadow, don't battle
But if I did, a nigga get dismantled
Up shit's creek, no paddle
Shit get deep, you shallow
Switch classrooms, need bad hoes
I can roll a paper plane with my eyes closed
Don't get rest, always on post
I'm sleepless, Seattle
Blowin' Cali kush, blue flannel
With a bad bitch, no manners
Yeah, she look good, can't stand her
Young rich nigga, don't matter
I'm the one, get the two or three after
You my sons, that's what I do with these bastards
I roll the kush up 'cause I need laughter
My life a movie, no actors
Silver shadow
I leave these niggas in the dust, they wish they could be us
Glowing shadow
These fake niggas I don't trust 'cause they see me out
Shining brightly
In the air, in the air
For all to see
And we ain't goin' nowhere, we gon' be right hereI’ve been all around the world
Rolling weed up, getting stoned
Got a whole pound of smoke
Only need a different strong
Bought a big ass whip like Indiana Jones
Let my niggas down but let it clap
Met her in my section, took her to my home
Now she fuckin with the gang
Thinkin that’s a loss for them
Niggas savin hoes like Indiana Jones
But this rack, she gon make it clap
Yea, my neck filled with rare stones
Yea, I’m getting head like headphones
Red meat, red wine, bad red bone
Probably just gave me some knowledge
I give her 10 grand for one pair of clothes probably
She call me
Tellin me she home alone with no colleague
So tired of monotony
Anything new that you try to go copy
Scars on my body
Lovely and gnarly
Love rolling weed, love to fuck, like to party
Maaan, niggas ain’t what they call themselves
Damn, ain’t turned so they draw themselves
You tell me you hot, man I tell you to stop it
In fact I’mma tell you what’s poppin
I just bought a jet and I got her, she drop…daamn
Boy she the man
Young boy, tattoos to his chin but you and your friends
I got the juice and the jam
Got shit from Japan
Grab shit from the pan
Stick to the brand
Flight in yo back if shit hit the fan
I’ve been all around the world
Rolling weed up, getting stoned
Got a whole pound of smoke
Only need a different strong
Bought a big ass whip like Indiana Jones
Let my niggas down but let it clap
Met her in my section, took her to my home
Now she fuckin with the gang

Niggas savin hoes like Indiana Jones

Gotta go so hard, shine in the dark cause your future’s brighter man

Goin on the road, doin shows, or gettin duckies wit em
Ive been smokin in my pictures since Myspace. You niggas extracurricular, bitch I fly straight. 
Some niggas try that shit for nothin, but I just tell them to do what they do
So many niggas went down the wrong road, so homie you can too
Just give me weed in my joint, and I ain't need it for nothin, homie Im straight. 
The same way I came into the game, If Im ever goin, then I am goin the same way
All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin with no other drug. 
Nigga like me be smokin while Im rappin. And my homie smoke like I smoke, so we both just make it happen. NIggas say they be smokin, they be actin. Cause you ain't yet really smoked unless you smoke one with the captain. High as fuck, choked up in my cabin. Got some OG from a vana it was rolled up in a napkin
So we Taylored, all my niggas smoke papers. Never smokin that bullshit, with the fucked up names or them flavors
I remember puttin weed in videos, niggas thought I was insane

All I need is Mary Mary Mary I ain't fuckin with no other drug. I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love

Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
I buy time in Switzerland

I shook hands with Royalty
I make songs that monarchs know
Ti Ti Ti La So fa?
Mi Mi Mi Ra Do?
Call me Aloe Blacc cause I Need That Dollar yo
Ha ha
Hic-hic-hiccup
Blame it on the liquor
I came through like a stick up
Now I'm ballin' like a kick up
I be cutting off these bitches like an episode of Nip Tuck
And yes I am the best man, I'm so sorry bout the mix up
Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a flight
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone
But I won't be gone for too long
In Amsterdam, and Milan
Just came off Aussie tour
You've never seen this before?
I'm the one like 2 plus 3
M-M-M-Minus four
Fe-fe-fe-fi-fo-fum
Everytime I can stalk
Yeh, yeh, I'm honest I landed in a rocket
With a crown inside my watch and silver B sign on my bonnet
You don't need a thermometer to tell you who's the hottest
Ip dip do muthaf-cker you are not it
Come out and play, pour out another bottle
Lets do it all today and worry bout it all tomorrow
I do it for the thrill
You know I love the rush
And once you get me going I can never get enough
I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love

Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
I'm in it, i'm in it to the finish

Got some friends that play in football
And Some friends that play in cricket
And a mistress that is fine
Like a fu*king parking ticket
Ha-ha

I grew tired of the same, then one night
Packed my things, told the one I love
I'll be back one day
Through the fight, through the pain
Booked a flight, took a plane
Told her not to cry
I'll be back one day
Been dreaming this since I was young
So baby girl I'll be going til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone 
Til I'm gone Everyday I try to escape the realities of this world
So I tell a disc jockey "press play" while I press up on a girl
In a mist that I smoke in the air
The reflection of lights that glare
She'll be out of control like a hydroplane in plain sight I might have to stare
And that's power steering, a power trip will see my appearance
Pile of hundreds all on a prowl like vampires in the darkest dungeon
Speakers bumpin', drinks is pouring
We in the house, we paid the mortgage, tyrannosaurus
That's real big, pop my color, pop that lid
Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up 
We'll do this till the sun come up 
Smoke like this till the sun come up 
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again
Some people stay home and sleep, me I go out at night
All seven days of the week, I live the party life
I got my dogs with me, you can bring some of your friends
We going hard till the sun come up and do it again
I got a drink in my hand they playing my favourite song
This girl that's dancing on me ain't' got no panties on
And she gonna come back to my hotel, don't tell
Anyone about us, I'm here to party all night
Flashin' lights, model types, vixen show me much love
Put the bottles on that ice, drink like we supposed to
Fire burning, ears is turning, all I see is energy
So eventually we'll do this till the sun come up 
We'll do this till the sun come up 
Smoke like this till the sun come up 
We'll do this till the moon is dropping day break watching
Then do it again
Come to my section 
And down some of this liquor

Gon be some things I don't remember
So take some camera phone pictures

Then do it againDespierto en la mañana, agarrar mis árboles y llegar a ella
Joven negro, hago mi propia cosa así que yo lo haga
Si quieres saber nada acerca de mí, que soy 'combate mi papel
A la mierda puta, cuanto mi anillo de iPhone que te veo más tarde
Me subo en el Chevy, agarrar mis llaves y entonces estoy bomba
Lo primero, Si se trata de 'combate que el queso, entonces estoy en ello
Yo estar amontonándose, no tengo tiempo para odiar a los negratas
Baja que la copia de seguridad, que mantenga limpia y ver algunos Daytons
Crucero por la calle, escucha mi coche antes de que sea procedente
Cogida la policía, ventanas abajo, yo estoy fumando algo
Y mi perra mala, ella va a  'montar Si mierda obtener una locura
Matones enmascarados arriba, que va a 'deslizar tratas de jugar
Puesto que un joven negro, que mantiene el paquete en la tele

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Negratas jóvenes y ricos, fuman marihuana cuando quieren
Cuando me toque abajo, tener ese paquete, jodido conmigo

Dejarla fumar hierba, beber champán, consumir drogas conmigo
Vamos fuera de la ciudad, cena en TAO, hacemos clubes conmigo
Lo que los negratas piensa, conseguido banco de Y más filas
Fumar marihuana con algunas perras en el club que no beben
Hablando combate que reciben dinero, consiguieron gustos caros
Así que lo puse en la boca y envió las dos cosas en su camino
Voy a estar allí por una noche, no me importa un carajo si me quedo
Pasamos un par de cien mil en un par de días
El humo de una libra en mi suite y luego llegar a una placa
Perra se acercó a mi casa y tuvimos una estancia confortable
Ella sensación de que mi coche, sintiendo mi cadena
Ella piensa que soy una estrella, me siento la misma
La llevo en el extranjero, cojo loca

That's the wrong time to fuck with a nigga like that, man
Hold on, baby, let me get my phone
Hold up, I gotta call a new bitch

She like "Naw, you leave me, imma lose it"
I'm like "Bitch, you just love me 'cause my music"
She like "Naw, I fuck witchu since way back
I can't even believe you would say that"
I'm like "Girl, you know what it is, you know the biz"
She like "Naw, they don't come as real as this"
She rolled the weed up, cook and cleaned the crib
Soon as we leave the club, I be in her ribs
She's like "Think you ever meet a better bitch?"
I fucked her one more time and got in a win
I can't even lie, that shit was great

Vibing in hereOzay... Wiz... Roll up ladies and gentleman... Spitta
You think you got the bond cause I rolled you a joint?
I smoke with all mine, baby girl whats your point?
Don't front
You in the back of a long line
Trying to get in cause only members inside
Trees get twisted up like fingers and gang signs
Purple kushes broke my fall
I fell from a grape vine
Super high, from the free throw line
I'm Drexler status, glide, ducking espionage
Many jelous eyes scrutinize the rise
But the jets in the house like the curtains and the blinds
It hurts to see me shine that's why they frowning all the time
In they internet videos digital see befores
Angry orangutan I'm arranging my sneakers
I'm the action on the court
You the gum stuck to the bleachers
I think I'm Paul Pierce, I think I'm Rondo
High off the headband you dying on that hydro
Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
I thought of this fresh off a bong rip
My bitch next to me, getting undressed for me
Running bath water playing her favorite songs while I get another one lit
Don't usually smoke at all but you say tonight you'll take a hit that's understood
From the smell and by what I payed, you know its good
Them niggas with me, they from the hood
Now we throw parties in the sky, I'm on the 42nd floor now thats super high
Champagne, more paper planes than you could fly
Them young niggas fail soon as they try
When the paparazzi flash
I be countin all this cash
Plotin a million and how to build a mountain out of hash, come on...
All these cars, all these stars, all around me 
Put your eyes... to the sky, that's where you'll find meee 
Cuz we are... we are... super hiiiigh
Ooh yeah, ooh yeah
Rozay!!
I'm gettin money no Illuminati
My pain never went in vein it's all over my body
Hit the spliff in my Mr. Bugatti
Kick it with my little homies I'm Mr. Miyagi
I gotta buy my niggas each a pound
Tweakin up,??, pass the reefer around
Spittin only lethal rounds, speakers beatin down
Not talkin much as when I say my niggas eatin now
Promoter gave me 40 thou, I think we even now
Pina colada papers, smoke the garden of eden now
Taylor gang is what we bleed about, jet setters in places you only read about
And now everywhere I go
It's so strong they ask me where I get my smoke
Bitches don't gotta guess they know
I keep one rolled up, we can do what ever you want
Smokin pina colada papers baby girl we don't fuck with the blunts... unless I'm with the boss
If your lookin for me you could find me in the Guiness book
Only fly bitches ride with the boss take a look, I'm super fly...
I'm super high, you get yours, I'm getting mine
Super hiiiigh... super hiiiigh
Ay yo waitress, I need another bottle of that Rozay, I need another bottle of that Rozay

Should I stay or should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah
Should I stay or Should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no

Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio
I wanna call my girlfriend, but she's all mad
Everything was good then, now she's all bad
I hit your phone up, you never call back
Would I be wrong if I took everything I bought back
Me and you against the world girl, I thought that
I'd be able to see them signs, no contract
So high off of life, will make a hater catch a contact
But now I treat her like I'm jumping out a plane and fall back
Yeah, cause I can only dream of what we had
Try to work, but seems we go wrong
Sometimes I pray to God, you take me back
Then run and tell the homies I've moved on
But soon as I get my head right
You gon' think I'm stuck and I'm just frontin', no headlights
Put you in the club and bought you stuff you never wear twice
Now the thrill is gone and the decisions in the air like, Damn
Should I stay or Should I leave
Don't know which way to go
My mind is saying yes, my heart keeps saying no
Can't find the words to explain, you always take it wrong
Call up the station, tell them play it on the radio woah woah
Play it on your radio woah woah
Play it on the radio woah woahI got the city on lock man, 
I don't think I'm this crazy
It's how the people treat me you know,

Actually made a name in this hatin' ass city
That's why at every show you see me Pittsburgh Diddy
Hoppin' on the road I bring Pittsburgh with me
My Pittsburgh tat match my Pittsburgh fitted
I'm so oh so Pittsburgh if you don't get it

5 alarm blaze flame can't be put out
Addicted to getting paid change can't be without
Niggas try to switch into my lane then spin out
It's all me from here outThe minute I wake up I gotta get high
The homies we found us a way to get by
Lets call us some bitches and have a good time
A lot of bottles of Vodka as we forget time
Lets clean up the Chevy so we can ride by
Quick piece of pussy call it a drive by
I'ma slide by sippin on that high life
And my slippers jack triple where my five light
As a all-star I made so many highlights
Touchdown field goal this my night
She the wild type ready for the wild night
Are you the buy type, hangin at the bar type
I hope you are 'cause that mean a player all right
Smokin like a Taylor so the paper is all white
Tryna to land a plane baby are you really gain
Back to the future me and Wiz got this thing sayin'

Tryna tell me 'bout the smell I know
But I stay red form all that smoke
The weeds with me everywhere I go

And ya'll can roll, woah woah woah woah woah woah woah oh oh oh
And ya'll can roll
I got yo girl diggin all in my ash tray
Dickin her down for the few past days
She asked the name of my sneakers, are they designer?
Shawty green as the reefer even the grinder
Fuckin like it's a porn in my recliner
Lookin straight in the eyes, they show vagina
She's a lair but damn she does it well
We on fire imagine what it'll sell
All my homies are people that I admire
Small click of real niggas smokin that fire
Holdin' my dick until the day that I expire
We and Wiz in the benz gettin' higher
I'm in the right pair of Nike Airs
From gravel to marble I travel light years
I'm like chyea I'ma chill right chea
Like the Mack 11 on me nigga no fear
Skateboard aboard to Panamerica
I make more abroad than in America
Waitin' for the day Bob rose from the dead
In hd as I take an ounce to the headNigga what time it is, time to go get some money and fuck these hoes
I'm stackin' up and hussling fa-sho
Changin' the game when I came in the door
Niggas was lame so I came with the dope
Doin' some things that you ain't seen before
Remember them days when I slept on the floor
Now we hit the hotel and we get the whole floor
Walk in the bank smell the dank on my clothes
Makin' more change than you think I'm supposed to
Been round the world but I still be out local
One of the best and I'm just being vocal
Clean up good like soap do
Make you feel good like soul food
Them fuck niggas they old news
Got a old car with new shoes
Niggas don't test cause I give em the blues
I'm in love with my music, try to boss up don't get comfortable too
Blowin' kush where my roof is, bad bitch where my room is
I'm high where the moon is, we winnin' not losin'
Whatever you do just
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
I needed it I bought it and worked hard for it
But won't forget the days when I couldn't afford it
Just put me in the game, I ain't gone ever forfeit
My son in private school, I gotta pay the mortgage
Them niggas talkin' shit, to me that ain't important
I'm ridin' foreign whips, that means them things imported
You on the internet, this shit you say recorded
You hangin' round them snitches, that mean you can't report it
I'm tryna fall asleep, soon as my plane get boarded
Them niggas can't hate, the police can't get warrants
I'm buyin' real estate, that mean my bank enormous
My diamonds real yours fake, that mean you can't ignore it
I need a bigger plate, make sure my steak is on it
That KK got you buzzed, it make you think of hornets
Ferrari's, Porsche's, all these horses
You dreamin, we livin', the sky is the limit
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' me
Don't stop ever lovin' meGood one Richard
There you go Richard

You thought you was right, life taught you a lesson
So what you do when you got your word?
You make 'em respect it

Whenever you wrong, you try to correct it
So what you do?
When you down and out, you count up your blessings
So what you do?
When you fuck around with feelings, don't catch 'em
So what you do?
If this one ain't right move, on to the next one
So what you do?
If you get the chance, you gon' be the best one
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin'

Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin'

I'm way too cool for these haters, way too high for my neighbors
I'm way too hard on my job, I do it now and not later
Way too cool for these niggas, I got too many flavors
Way too wide on my mind, not smoke too many papers
Way too out of the country, do anything I want
Way too out of control, pull up anywhere and stunt
I'm way too smooth for the police, now they act like they don't know me
It's way too clean to be stolen, Cartier and not the Rollie
I'm way too real to be fake, too much love to feel hate
You way too tired to work, I get tired of waitin'
I'm way too tall to ever think about doin' it small
I'm way too into myself to even be fuckin' with y'all
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
Countin' up all of these checks, smokin' weed is my profession 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
Countin' up all of these checks, livin' life is a blessin' 
I'm way too young to be stressin', way too young to be stressin' 
Ye-ah
It's your driver Mr. Eazy Wider
Picking you up in a brand spanking new Doober
Brought to you by the Doober app
Make sure you hit code 4/20 for 50% percent off
And a pack of Khalifa cones for the ride y'all
You can smoke in this car
As long you rate your Doober driver before you leave
And leave a tip too, bomb weed only
Don't smoke no blunts in my Doober
And see the joints, dabs, or bong rips, for the long tripsIt's grow season my feet in no reason
To hate on I'm sorta like treason
Speak napalm the bomb I got heat shit
It's no secret I'm so frequentAnd they say all I rap about is bitches and champagne
You would too if every night you seen the same thing
Money wall to wall, young famous nigga, spend it all
When you die you can't take it with ya
Bottle of Rose if I'm drinking with ya
Cause most niggas is broke their bank is injured
And bitches gonna ride with who they think's a winner
And I'll be smiling encase they take a picture
Uh, I'm smoking weed drinking liquor make a hundred
Off a show spend it all on my niggas
When I go shopping I told 'em pick one
'Cause they was with me when nobody seen a vision
Always about my business don't play the cards
I talked to the niggas who dealed them, uh
Royal flush, now look up them niggas and baby girl you see us, yeah
I'm gonna spend it all 
Why wait for another day 
I'ma take all this money I own 
And blow it all away 
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all 
Why wait for another day 
I'ma take all this money I own 
And blow it all away 
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone
All kinda of hoes in my car
They wanna feel that maximum speed
Never had an absence of weed
Tired of being at the bar, everything Louie V
Plus the most exclusive tree in my jar
Making my bank, spending it all
And that expensive shit you paid for, she had it on
She taking it off
Most of these niggas just talk ain't caking at all
Back in the day money was short, I'm making it taller
You know what I mean, some say it's a problem
Blowings my greens, not saving my collards
No N.B.A. they say I'm a baller
Live for today, stunt like my father
I'm gonna spend it all 
Why wait for another day 
I'ma take all this money I own 
And blow it all away 
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I'm gonna spend it all 
Why wait for another day 
I'ma take all this money I own 
And blow it all away 
'Cause I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
No I can't take it when I'm goneYea, you already know

Made a split second decision
Executed with precision

Old cuddly ass niggas go to hidin' they woman
Thinkin' I'mma walk up to 'em, but I don't do it
Baby girl know the big shit from the manure
I could help you shine like a jeweler
Candy paint make an old whip newerIntro
Late night, leave the crib, just for that
Uh, I roll me a doobie, I watch me a movie
Thats what a real nigga do
Adidas slides on, I ain't paying all that money for no Gucci shit
For real
Verse 1
Uh, I roll me a doobie, I watch me a movie
Shorty get choosy, I told her to moon me
I’m right where the pool be, her mouth get drooly
Now you can't school me, I rap with my foolies
My diamonds like kool-aid, we down and your crew ain't
Been grindin for 2 days, sometimes I don’t do sleep
She tell me its too late, she said she don't do face
Count nothing but blue face, all white on my shoelace
Some niggas say they real, but really they fake tho
Don't do what they say bro, that's just how the game go
Ain't worried bout no bitch, I'm stacking a bankroll
Some niggas they hate though, I'm doing my thing though
Some niggas'll talk shit, but ain’t how I’m living my life
Stay making them highlights, cause my nigga you don't die twice
I rap with my day ones, got a problem then say something
I don’t wait till my day come, want a million then make one
?, ain't no pay cut
My bitch bad soon as she wake up, ain't no makeup
Living the life when I was younger, I only dreamed of
Now when I pull up, got my shirt off, I keep it gangster
Now all my niggas riding with me, and rolling dank up
I keep a bad bitch with me, a money maker
And with you fuck with her, she a heartbreaker
And if she got a bad friend, we all neighborsRing around the rosey
Pocket fulla OZ's
Watchin' for the police
AP or the Rollie?
Got a boyfriend, now she act like she don't know me
I ain't really trippin' 'cause the money is the mission
Lookin' in the mirror, I can see the competion
I'ma always keep it real, niggas fake and that's the difference
Stayin' outta prison
Got a couple pretty girls takin' turns kissing
Don't want her at my crib, told her "Stay up out my mentions"
You can see the money from a distance
Teach her how to roll kush and handle business
Blow it by the pound, you niggas still pinching
Makaveli bands and my diamonds end friendships
Ain't a million dollars? I can't show interest
When I'm round you niggas, I can feel the tension
The shit I'm smokin' strong enough to start a engine
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice 
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice 
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night 
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll
When I gotta go then I gotta go
Mayweather diamonds on
Say she never tried a bong
And she love all my songs
Crazy, said "I got her goin'"
Rappin', handle business like I'm Jay-Z but my name ain't Shawn
I got hella talent, I ain't gotta flaunt
Smokin' wit' a bitch that's bad and blonde, tell her "Tag along"
So many diamonds in it, can't tell if the time is wrong
They tell you "Young Khalifa the GOAT", you been well informed
No, I never took the easy road, I weathered the storm
Few rings, six chains and a hoodie on
Khalifa man, gettin' money, they know what he on
Hating on another nigga, somethin' I ain't never doing
Instead of holding on to game shit, I'd rather show 'em
How to hustle, how to grow
How to stack that money up and get mo'
How to be in the public but stay low, it takes patience, move slow
And don't forget what you do it for
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice 
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice 
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night 
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll
When I gotta go then I gotta go
Girl, I'm a gangster, I can't tell you twice 
If you believe me, girl, that would be nice 
I could fuck you but I can't stay the night 
I'm on a roll, when I'm on a roll 
When I gotta go, girl, I gotta go It’s the champagne pourin’
Big joint rollin’
Bombay sippin’
No blunt smoking
Bad bitch gettin’
Thick and she got some friends with her
I take ‘em out pourin’ shots of liquor
Drinkin’ out the bottle, smiling in all my pictures
The marijuana loud so them hoes follow like twitter
Nigga, you know everything Taylored
Don’t rush to the bar fool, if you ain't got no paper
That’s the rules, high as fuck, sloppy drunk when I’m passing through
Rollin’ doobies up, ya hoe who we pass ‘em to
Hit the club spend this money up, roll another one, drink, act a fool
Thats what I have to do
See after drinking champagne all night
Never worry `bout a damn thing, y’all might
Homie I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
So let me take one shot to the brain
And I order three more shots
I’m going in, ayy
I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
I’m on my level 
Spent a couple dollars on my engine
Motor roaring when I back out the garage
Gin got me drunk as fuck stumbling out the bar
Plus I’m struggling tryna find the keys to my car
Cause I be going hard, roll the camera
Life just like a movie, I’m the star
Wish you was in my position
You too broke to play the part
Of course I keep some bad women with me in the back
Sippin’ Rose with some hash twistin’
All about a dollar, my team in the cash gettin’
Straight out the burb, we drinking we smash niggas
So when I say I’m balling, that don’t mean that I’m playing mate
All my diamonds talkin’, you can see what they sayin’ mayne
In the middle of the night, early in the mornin’
From the streets to the sheets with some freaks, I ain't yawnin’
I’m wide awake, we ain't eatin’, we ain't sleepin’
These bitches so high man, we ain't even speakin’
We just freakin’
You rollin’ with short dog baby
She was high on that pill so I fucked yo lady
Come to my house I give ‘em everything they want
I might not dot it, but I give to ya women
Cocaine, mushrooms, ecstasy, GHB, marijuana
She can suck it if she wanna
I got tequila, Ciroc and two freaky friends
And this a Wednesday night, this ain't the weekend

Man I swear I’m on my level
Man I’m sloppy drunk

I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? 
Now we
Leaving all my problems at the door
Pouring up, soon as you think it’s enough they bringin’ more
Hanging onto what niggas told me “get your paper up”
You work hard for what you got, they could never take it from you
All you need is a little patience, let me demonstrate
All my niggas in the game, we talkin’ ‘cause we been through it
Rolling weed in raw papers, taking shots, gin got me faded
If I get back to your spot, won’t know how I made it
 
I had so much champagne up in the club
And ain’t come up here tonight looking for love
I’mma leave all my problems out on the floor
I’mma drink so much that I can’t make it home
So would you take me home? 
Now weI am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same
Every time I try to get my life to get to someone it seems
What you are doing try to ruin my hopes and my dreams
Bless your way and always go get away
Keep some grams in my pants never hit a day
Am I wrong am I right
Do I care living life
On my own papa's home what am I feeling like
Musician premonition what you call it
Do your thing with . Back upon it
Recollect and reflect on how I used to be, I am probably the same way cuz
Cause im gon keep it G secretly you all are backing with me
So we expecting to get their photo come back stage and hit my ..
Cool individual I am never too good .. is from hood
Never from Hollywood
Chorus
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the same
Growing up I don't know as much
I was too busy chasing money and all the stuff till I was old enough
Getting every dollar before so they could know it's us
Every party we are showing up bagging full of never too long nigga
Matter of fact you can have it the one in rotation my motivation is savage
.. and nigga think they are but they ain't no comparing
And they are not doing no harm but I think there is no comparing
I keep making deposits and no way no interference
I am your broadcast I just .. just smell .. when I go past
.. I am kind of hot but you should know that
Chorus
Am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably never change
I am not trying to be right try to be wrong
I just try to make it on my own
I said I do a lot of things but I probably be the sameWhen the lights go off and it all fall down

My team succeed through anything
Whole boxes of raw papers get used and abused
In the presence of G's, they get confused
Out of town, blowin' on jet fuel
My hoes throwin' up the set
We don't tolerate no disrespect
Lames get checked
Everything tatted to my neck
She don't fuck with me cause I break bread
Better fake dead
Smoke you out, say she can't feel her legs
Could go to the club, but we just get stoned instead
My only motivation is the bread
Gotta do what you gotta do
Move how a boss move
Always been the man with the plan
Have a joint lighter in my hand
She rollin' Instagram
Gotta get that paper, though
Get that paper, though
That's why we keep them papers rolled
Keep them papers rolled

See I’ve been going on and on for ever
Them haters probably wonder when I’m gone stop, never!
Most of it’s been good but I’ve seen some bad weather
And niggas watching now, wouldn’t even give me an umbrella
But I ain't tripping, I made a million on my own
May come to your surprise but I pictured it all along
When I was 16, finna get put out my home
Now the man making money, my nigga, my money growing
And I can do what I what, went form being hated on
To niggas try to go down the same road I made it on
Ain't no love lost but ain't no love shown
So now when niggas call I just don’t pick up the phone
I’m breaking down the weed, put it in the bong
Blow a hundred racks, put it in the song
Party every weekend, hardly ever home
Don’t see me face to face so you have to talk about me when I gone
Stay away from the fake or phoney 
Niggas who can’t support their own
So keep pay me from the crowd
Everybody wants to be the star of the show-ow-owww
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The show-ow-owww 
The drinks poured up, weed’s rolled up
And all my jewelery ice to piece froze up
I only like to see the hoes who keep their nose up
Have any nigga in the World but she chose us
I remember them same hoes ain't even notice us
Get you to buy us a drink than its over cuz
We back around the time that she sober’d up
Shit ain't been the same since the limosuine showed up
The best moments of my life
Never filled this much plastic off of Polo in my life
Rarely gon to see, smoking with ya wife
Plus anything you want I can afford to buy it twice
It’s the way we know, wake up in the morn’
Like “where did all my paper go”
Grow some more weed and get medicated
Everyday is a holiday so we celebratedIt's say yeah
One night in town
My niggas round
Throwin money
Them bitches hit the ground
Then bring it back up
She bringin backup
Put em in that black truck

I do it broad day
All day
Smokin on that bomb hay
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up and chicken just chillLook, look
I make everyday my best day, I press play
It's my prerogative like Bobby Brown from back in the day
We Taylor like the chucks from back in the day for basketball play
I'm player, I got 7 basketball booties 24 hours a day
7 is a god number, 7 means strength
But it took you 7 days to find out you weak as a bitch
I'm wide open like the open ocean, keep your mind focused
I got so high one day that I thought Monday was Saturday
I'm so Taylored I talk like  like NFL on Sunday
My  infinite like  jump in it
Sponsored by Reebok so you know there's a bump
In it
But I'm an artist, never starving, paint to carving
I got my eyes on the prize  like some 
I'm so cool, whipping through 
Tuki Carter's my name brand but I ain't happened over name brands
Don't stop it, I flex it, I cop it
It's Taylor Gang over everything like '02
It's Tuki  I don't know you, owe you
Pull up stoned, my niggas at the pull up zone
Pulled out the cars, niggas pull out their phones
I'm tryna hit, baby first give me dome
We make the best of our time alone
What we do next, nobody know
Get my check then I gotta go
I'm in a new city, new state
Bout my money so I can't be too late
Roll a joint, take it to the face
I'm with a chick, don't even know her race
Question my gang, I say "We going places"
Don't have to play cause they know our faces
I got credit, nigga dead that shit
And I ain't worried bout the paper cause I get that shit
And ain't no point in looking back cause I'm ahead of you pricks
I'm getting cheddar and my whips is better and my bitch a ten
You ain't throwing up the gang then we don't comprehend
If we ain't come up from the mud then you not my friend
Either you got a pound of weed or you got some gin
I get it poppin' soon as the show's over, them draws dropping
They don't got to ask around, they just know I'm hot
I'm wheeling dirt bikes or somewhere smoking pot
Tripping on how close you got and got a culture shotYeah
And if you can't smoke weed to it, I don't wanna listen to it
 As the world keeps spinning
Keep turning these girls to women
Keep driving these cars and keep fucking these stars, I guess that's the world we live in
Young niggas with executive decisions
Turn on the TV and see us winning
They wanna be me, I just wanna be free
Never heard 'em talk cheap, fuck a bad bitch to sleep
Take Tequila shots in the AM
Give you a play by play on how to get this paper
I gettin' big, changed the gate code on my neighbours
Catching plays in the studio for days
Baby girl, come through, hook me up a plate
I've been grinding and my niggas on the same page
Walking up and gettin' to it
Trees grinded and pressed
Not a role model but I speak my mind
Doing more than what you're thinking
In the studio, blowin' O's, but our minds on the future tho'
Brainwash a couple bitches, bring 'em to the show
Take 'em to the crib, let you hit a switch, it ain't 'bout shit
Talk it up, then live it out
Smell the aroma when I park the car and get up out
And go the way you niggas drove
I get a bitch I barely know
Get her home
Don't want mamosas, she want Tequila shots in the AM

Go girl, it's your birthday

Yeaa!
It's Young Khalifa man
Oh-kayyy
I got a bottle in my hand right now
And man I'm so high a nigga can't come down
Lotta niggas hatin but the gang stay close
So much money that she caint say no

On and on until all the weed's gone and I see the Rosé stop pourin
And my diamonds look bonkers
Made her say "aah" like I was a real monster
Darlin
Bet another bottle'll quench your thirst
When I was broke I never got to them bitches first
Now either them hoes put me on they wishlist
Or treat me like I'm they dentist

Open wide, I know you're thirsty
Say ahh
Ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh ahh
Say ahh

        Uh
Both hands on the wheel
Shades on, you know it's real
Me and my bitch smoke and kill
We at the top, so we know the deal
My niggas got no chill
And we don't pop no pills
We just get money
Ain't tellin' on myself cause one of these niggas will
Pillow talking with me as your topic
These niggas funny than a muhfucker
Remember days I was broke
Then I seen it all come together
Good clothes for the bad weather
Good dope in my lungs
Surprisingly, this is what they wanted for me
It's room in the safe, so we ain't done
I'm talkin' 'bout gangster-gangster
Real gangster shit, gang-gang, nigga
Gang over everything, we been doin' this shit
Fuck wrong with you lil' niggas?
Ain't shit changed, it's the motherfucking gang
Don't get gang banged on, and we rollin' up them planes
Taylor!
Gettin' checks in my sleep
Livin' my dreams, so I'm wide awake
Feel bad for the nigga Meek
I stay out of trouble in my hideaway
Might drive the foreign ride today
Might tell my driver he could drive
Started small, now we smokin' out the turkey bag
You a  turkey, these is hunting grounds
I'm the reason your son's serving pounds
She say my voice get her moist
We turn boys to men
Now we mentor you little boys
Treat the foreign whip like a toy
Or I'm pullin' up in my six-fo'
Rags to riches, killin' these niggas
Throwin' the body bags in ditches
I thought I told you niggas, the gang ain't gon' stop
It don't matter what y'all niggas do
It don't matter what y'all niggas say
It don't matter how much y'all niggas copy our style
We the originators of this shit
It's the motherfucking gang
And if you forgot, we here to remind y'all niggas
Fuck wrong with y'all niggas, huh?
You bitch! Pittsburgh, Taylor Gang, Young Khalifa
Fuck you, and your stupid ass rules
Young bitch
Young ass nigga, hahahaChea

Gotta show em just what you got
Put them numbers up when they doubting
Though we had enough we survived it
And we keep on piling
Verse 1 :
R Dash been a lion from the start
Ima king among kings
My back was all on the ropes
Broke outta that cage
Envisioned what I became
Now it’s looking like a zoo here with all of these GOATS
But you know how it go
Some people always hate low key
But I’m the type to never let it weigh on me
She told me she was tryna Medicate, oh wee!
Paging Dr Greenthumb, need that insane OG
Yeah I been on my grind
They told me I’m delusional, I was outta my mind
But I must’ve been a genius
My insanity plea, I’m free
Cuz dawg, I don’t believe you, I believed in me
And now we all just
Smoking on that la la la
As the money pile up
And we bout to go loco
Cuz I finally free my mind
Hook :
So
Never let em count you out
Never let em break u you down
Never giving up, keep fighting
And we keep on piling
Gotta show em just what you got
Put them numbers up when they doubting
Though we had enough we survived it
And we keep on piling
Verse 2 :
I been on since the Cherry Kush shit
Bought the pie and that cookie on a LA trip
Back when the purp used to be 48
Im in the cut papered up but im still holding weight
Jealousy and the Pink Rozay , I got the price back up Ima need more cake
Around here they say I’m the one
Touch down Tuscon Ima move me a ton
Ice cubes on my left hand
Yeah that Snowman wax got me feeling like a dead man
Smoked out, me Dogg and Redman
Get a brand new phone when the bread slam
Im still waiting on the postman
Sell a box, then I go and grab me some more land
It’s Big Bern with the R-Mean
I pulled up with a trunk full of bags and they all clean
Hook :
So
Never let em count you out
Never let em break u you down
Never giving up, keep fighting
And we keep on piling
Gotta show em just what you got
Put them numbers up when they doubting

Verse 3 
Three kings in the kingdom
R-Mean, Bernzel, here with Greenthumb
In the grow room looking for another queen
Mother Mary in my paper living out a Cali dream
Windows rolled up in the Smokebox
What you gon’ do when the doors locked
R-Mean start smoking up the Insane
Berner got a new strain
Bout to put it in the chain
Smoke everywhere, just one cough
Put you on another level
You don’t wanna turn it off
You just want another bang, one will never be enough
Cookies , Greenthumb, you’ll never see enough
Ton by ton never undone
Looking at a unsung hero, you among one
Only one outcome , running this takeover
We about to flip the game with the makeover
Break over
Hook :
So
Never let em count you out
Never let em break u you down
Never giving up, keep fighting
And we keep on piling
Gotta show em just what you got
Put them numbers up when they doubting
Though we had enough we survived it
And we keep on pilingIt's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Why'd you have to leave soon?
Why'd you have to go?
Why'd you have to leave me
When I needed you the most?
Cause I don't know really how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
WHOOOoooooo...!
Damn, who knew
All the planes we flew
Good things we been through
That I'd be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place
How do I breathe without you? I'm feeling so cold
I'll be right here for you 'till the day you're home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again 
We've come a long way 
From where we began 
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again 
When I see you again
OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!
OOOOOOOOOoooooohhhh!!!
WHOOOOOooooo...! 
First, you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turned to a friendship
A friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached
So remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through
You were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
We all change, we all grown 
A new ring, Uhh! 
Remember me when I'm gone 
When I see you agaaa-ain 
Uh! Yeah! Again, Yeah! 
Yeah, Yeah, Uh! When I see you again 
Yeah, yeah! See you again! 
Yeah! Yeah, yeah! Ah-ah 
Uh-huh, yeah! When I see you again 
We'll tell you...
Yeah, we came a long way...
... I'll see you again

One night in town

She bringin backup
Put em in that black truck
So many hoes they lapped up
My niggas leanin
Diddy boppin
Let's get it poppin
I said let's get it poppin
Just look at how she drop it
Lil mama a certified pro
She need her own show
Slide on down that pole and grind slow
Hell no I ain't countin my dough
I came to blow it all
And get some brains trynna find miss know it all
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up and chicken just chill
In the back of the club
With a stack full a dubs
Drop it low like a pro
Bring it back that's what's up
All my dogs up in here
Plus there's hoes everywhere
Niggas stunt like you don't care
Throw that money in the air and say yeah 
Throw that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah 
Throw that money in one hand and say yeah
Throw that money in the air and say yeah 
I'm high and drunk doin my same dance
They call it pocahontas doin that rain dance
Talkin dough I got it so make it rain man
Cause tha flow retarded sorta like that rain man
Borderline insane man
Look at all these dames damn
When a nigga gettin money
And I'm a changed man
You smell that haze scent
Know my gameplan
Trynna get it smackin
I ain't with dat gameplan
Lil momma work for every dollar she drop it low
Pop it slow stop and go
Lots of smoke we keep em rollin up
Shorty mad she came with you
She wanna roll with us
And say yeah
And say yeah
And say yeah
I said listen here
I do it broad day
All day
Smokin on that bomb hay
And I got my cup filled you see how them bucks peel
Young pimp see how grab me up and chicken just chillThey're saying it’s 'bout time some real niggas made it
And when I go outside, they're saying I’m famous
And some don’t understand but listen close and you’ll find out
I’m running through them grams, you'll smell the kush when I ride out
I’m moving at top speed, my engine is foreign
I travel across seas where women are gorgeous
And niggas know it’s us, we make it tough to mistake it
Just let me roll one up and when it’s stuffed up, I'ma blaze it
Then we off to the races
Yelling, "Suck a dick or die hoe"
See your main bitch is my side hoe
Smoking top shelf on the top floor
I’m a boss bitch, I take my time and get it pronto
You probably fucking around
Doing some shit I ain't got time for 
Fuck you and your whole anatomy bitch
My new crib look like an academy bitch
It’s Finally Famous the faculty bitch
Killin’ these niggas, no casualties
Money and weed is a real nigga salary
Man, these rappers sound like me
And honestly that shit is so flattering bitch
 They want me to slip up and fall
Crash, burn, but I just keep pissing them off 
I got movies to make  I got women to call 
I got deals on the table, I can’t be dealing with y’all, nigga
Rather crash parties and burn money 
And if you pick the ashes up, you still can’t earn from me 
Bottom line is I never wait in line bitch
And I’m rolling King Kush, I’m your Royal HighnessPull up they know it's me
Smokin' organically
Look like your majesty
Car fast as can be
Roll one pass it to me
Pipe down nigga let's get faded
Droppin' ass on the seat
You need cash to compete
Pretty face in the mirror
Pretty ass on the seat
NIggas say they want smoke
They come askin' for me
Plus they see me with Berner, they know the class of my weed 
Say you wanna get high, get too high and pass on the weed
Owners say we can smoke but too much they'll ask us to leave
Must not know it was that pack 
Must not know we spend them racks 
Must not know we gettin' it back 
Number OG in my sack 
Roller coastin', always floatin', capillaries open
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I get up early then I roll
Grind and roll, grind and roll
Burn it down like thunder hoe
Smellin' like a nigga grow
Any state I'm blowin' smoke
On the bus and in the shows
With yo bitch and with my hoes
Blow my ganja through they nose
G shit, cool shit, peace shit I am on
Take a bitch, make a bitch get my weed and I'm gone
Niggas burnin' down my phone
I ain't the weed man
Smoke a ounce in one night
We smoke weed man
 my name
Take a bitch smoke out
No shame
Take a friend to smoke out
I ain't playin'
I ain't playin'
I ain't playin'
Smellin' like a pound of herb
Bitches gettin' on my nerves
Rollin' up some more of this herb
In the airport and smacked
Smellin' like that pack
In the front end, not the back
First class bitch
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like the pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack
I'm smellin' like a pack

        So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, uh huh
So what I keep ‘em rolled up
Saggin’ my pants not caring what I show
Keep it real with my niggas
Keep it player for the hoes
And look clean don't it?
Washed it the other day, watch how you lean on it
Give me some 501's jeans on and roll joints bigger than King Kong’s fingers
And smoke them hoes down ’till they stingers
You a class clown and if I skip for the day I’m with you bitch smokin’ grade A
You know what? It’s like I’m seventeen again
Peach fuzz on my face
Lookin’, on the case
Tryna find a hella taste
Oh My God, I’m on the chase
Chevy, its gettin’ kinda heavy, relevant, sellin’ it
Dippin’ away, time keep slippin’ away
Zip in the safe, flippin’ for pay
Tippin’ like I’m drippin’ in paint
Up front four blunts, like “Khalifa put the weed in a J”
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Uh, and now I don't even care
'Cause me and my team in here
There's gon' be some weed in the air
Tell 'em Mac
Blowin' everywhere we goin'
And now ya knowin'
When I step right up
Get my lighter so I can light up
That's how it should be done
Soon as you thinkin' you're down
Find how to turn things around
Now things are looking up
From the ground up
Pound up
It's Taylor Gang
So turn my sound up
And mount up
And do my thang
Now I'm chillin'
Fresh outta class feelin'
Like I'm on my own
And I could probably own a building
Got my own car
No job, no children
Had this science project
Me and Mac killed it
T-H-C
M-A-C
D-E-V
H-D-3
High as me
This is us
We gon' fuss
And we gon' fight
And we gon' roll
And live our life
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and free
Yea, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So we just, roll one, smoke one
When you live like this you’re supposed to party
Roll one, smoke one, and we all just having fun
So what we get drunk
So what we smoke weed
We’re just having fun
We don’t care who sees
So what we go out
That’s how it's supposed to be
Living young and wild and freeIt's been a long day without you, my friend

Let's get to the basics, let's get to the basics 
I'm rollin' a J up, I'm lovin' the fragrance 
I'm hardly on time 'cause my mind is where space is 
But I always on grind 'cause that's how my fam raised me 
Think I got problems, say that I'm crazy 
Love marijuana, smoke on the daily 
Smoke with my mama, roll one for my lady 
Blow the whole pound now, came up from an eighty 
I'm lettin' the top down, and countin' them faces 
I'm blowin' the smoke out, exhalin' the vapors 
I'm smokin' in public, they stare in amazement 
I'm lightin' that bomb up, it's takin' me places 
Ooh, ooh
We don't put it on in the crib if it ain't fire
Ooh, ooh
Won't even pull up to the club in it if it ain't fire

When I ride by
I want you to see what I see
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shit's very clear, ugh
: Wiz Khalifa
Pass me a joint, guarantee I'mma hit it
Come to that life, I don't talk it, I live it
I got a old school ass car you can sit in
I got a crib that you probably can't get in
I got a pound, we can grind it and twist it
I been at work on the grind for a minute
Smokin' that loud and still mindin' my business
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Countin' my benjis
Puttin' it all in the bank but don't really mind if I spend it
Can't take it? don't cross the line when you finish
When you stay all on your grind you can get it
When we be fuckin' I'm climbin' up in it
She fuck with me because I got the vision
Haters be talkin', don't mind 'em, don't listen
Duckin' them shots, that's divine intervention
I be so high, try me, come visit
You make a choice, hope you like the decision
Come to my crib, we can spark and get lifted
Go off the smoke just like I'm a magician
Ain't fuck with me? Then she prolly was trippin'
Lightin' 'em up just like the electricians
Get to this money, get high my intentions
Roll me one up that's as loud as the engine
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together we stick to the mission
Sparkin' that weed up without no permission
She fuck with me because I got the vision
I fuck with her, when I'm talkin', she listen
When we together we stick to the mission
Rollin' that weed up without no permission
:
Oh, oh, money come and money go
And stay the same no
Oh, oh, money come and money go
And stay the same noHigher than you ever been in yo motherfuckin life nigga
Without even tryin
Uh, the game got a grip, never slip
Could tell by the way I got my hands on it
Started at the bottom but now my money's so motherfuckin
Tall I could stand on it
Ain't just happened homie, I planned on it
You think you better? Don't just talk bout it, put some grands on it
Sleep in Cali, woke up in France
Harlem, took the life I live
Chose to talk bout it now my fans on it
Now it's Dior all on my pants homie, don't know where I'm goin
My schedule full so I can't call it
So much weed, you see all them grams fallin
Rollin so much up that my fingers startin to cramp on me
Hear you talkin bout what I am
On top of that shit you sayin you gotta say rich as
Fuck when you mention us
I get a hold of the bummest and I twist it up
Them Cadillac's in Atlanta front just to pick us up
Oh please, won't you put me at ease?
I'm chilling inside
My feelings tied
How will I know this is real?
Usually I end up
Foolishly I end up
Give it all the love I own
Then to my dismantle, to you
Was just another day
You weren't even fun
Same shit
Hell, I woke up to the jump
Cartoons and cereal
A coup with 0 miles and oatmeal interior
These chicks digging my style, I'm sensei in the superior
To whatever you doin right now
And whatever you plan to get into
I'm just clackin my mouth
On the road to these riches
These hoes waving and flading
But I don't pay em no attention
I'm all about my empire
We just tryin to get bigger
We want the plan inside us
These snakes tryna get with us
They lookin for the co-sign
But a real nigga don't give a fuck
I'm too busy getting high
You can hitch a ride on another truck
Now excuse me as I kiss the sky
Peace signs to baby girl before she try to kiss me blah
She miss me like the sun in her eyes
Can't catch a butterfly
Kush castles in the sky
The only hason is when I smash and go she wanna cry
I get dressed, she wonder where I'm going or why
Can't deal with that
So don't choose
I can't stand to be hurt again
If you flow it's just today
Then smoke and walk away
But please don't tease
Oh please, won't you put me at ease?
Oh please
Won't you set me at ease?
Please
Oh please
Please, won't you put me at ease?
Won't you set me at ease?
Please
Oh please
Won't you set me at ease?
Please
Oh please
If you feel it's just a day
Then smile and walk awayYea round we them niggas
You seasonal, temporary livin
You’re wannabe, done in a minute son
You are not a finit
Bitches could tell the difference, they know better than to smoke with ya
Back up a lit, bitch you’ll get the whole picture
So much sicker than them niggas
I’m coughin, they just got hiccups
KC lights, roll bars on my Chevy pickup
Offroad style, leaf kid heavy do this burned stone
Pative, get it done
When the time is crunched like situps
To the challenge I rise, Lamborghini doors
85 corn ties, never seen a real road
From the show, round flow to my seven comp the raj
Got a storage cross town when lights seven mo rise
Touchin side, that Grand Theft Auto life
Rollin up in my safe house, I’m lookin down
Done it by my design
Refusing to compromise
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyes
They sayin shit changed ‘cause shit change
Not just the horses in my motor, but the car’s for me to show up
I’m a boss and my whole team fly private, black cars
When we roll up – quarter pounds
When we blow up – hit the ground runnin
My watch new cause a nigga sound bove it
And your girlfriend leaving you cause she just wanna be around something
Like playin X-Box and wearin weed socks, beatin round stuntin
Orderin thousand dollar room service, rollin weed up out of onion
Uh I got atmade but I ain’t make it on my own
Oh what about a Pittsburg nigga?
I’m gonna buy a LA home
Rollin up papers, turning down favors
All these fake cushions, I got my own flavor
Hold me down in KKN, that brand new bread
Got to make to make that brand new crib
Need a whip to match that brand new car
Thinkin maybe Maybach, brand new insides
Everything black, young ass nigga, blowin OG in the back
Last time you heard from me I was rollin butup
Lookin dope in my brand new clothes
Eyes closed like someone told them to shut up
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyes
These hazel eyesI bought a whole O to smoke
I'm riding high
My niggas with me, they down to ride
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right
Money from the floor, way up to the sky
Now they want to know, and they wonder why
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
And I'm killing them, it's homicide
I'm killing them, it's homicide
I got my change up, they looking like they surprised
Got niggas hating on me hard because my paper right
But I'm killing them, it's homicide
I'm killing them, it's homicide
I got my wings when I was young so I tend to fly
I put my chain on, they saying it's homicide
I'm killing them
First forty eight, first forty eight
Took out fifty racks and blew the first forty eight
I ain't worried about spending bread because I got more to make
Soon as they see that Maserati they gone surely hate
Hundred for a show, can you afford a date?
And that's just one show, imagine what my tour gone make
Police ran up on my tour bus
But hey my niggas, more money, more problems, more lawyers on the case
Niggas was at the Grammys
I was at the crib working
Heard they little diss, but I'm just being the big person
Never been trained, still my aim near perfect
Everything I spits murder, bow
With black on black cars coming through
Presidential shit, tints on the whip
So dark can't see who riding in that bitch
Suits and ties no questions why
Somebody get a box ready for these guys
No four door, had the coupe that ride
That eagle right here if you want to feel fly
No games though, no names spoke
This crack right here, cocaine flow
I don't know what you doing but I'm paid bro
Yeah I pitch that .9 like Pedro
Stuck in the car with my nigga I'm ready to ride
We on our way to the top, watch that paper rise
Keep telling everybody what you going to do
Middle finger like fuck what you going through
All I know is that money that I'm going to
And them gang gang boys want to bone you

T-A-Y-L-O-R G-A-N-G GangI'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear

Party and chillin and fast livin how im suppose too
Not the choices given, I chose too
Leave the club with a couple of hoes who
Love to smoke trees, rolling it e-z widers
Paper maintain a low speed, now should I proceed
Come from a city where niggas ain't got a lot
But got it locked, so I be low key
Money, hoes, clothes is all a nigga knows
Don't bring enough I blow it by the O
I hit the road, cause shit is exactly how it seems
Why cat's been sleeping on me I been livin out my dream
The marijuana is loud but my sorroundings are soreem
I'm laughin and smoking hoping my camera catch the scene
Fresh up out the plane, flick another paper
Shorty wanna ride with me as bad as I wanna taker her
Put you in demand bitches taking flicks with the planes
And send them to their friends
Weed the grind mine on a million, and we over the building
I'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder, mine on a million

And I'm livin like a balla Loc

Did we just become best friends with these hoes
On a boat well, probably so but we don't love them no
Only can cake causes my heart to palpitate darling
Clean that money keep this dirty ball revolving
No pausing, I get too high to have downtime
No matter what your watch say nigga it's my time

You sound like a sucka, tune ya out
As i'm tuning up my Chevelle, this weekend imma pull it out
Lay some rubber down, slanging rocks everywhere, people mad as a mothafucka
But he jet connected, so they know they can't touch em
Airborn from here on, been sworn in
Fat pockets, cause I took chance even when they were slim
I'm in the air all I want is the money and I see it so clear
Weed in my grinder, mine on a million
Taylor gang on the planes, you know we over the building
If they ask me how fly, imma tell ya
If you reconize game, I should be looking familiar
