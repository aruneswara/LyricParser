Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say I've loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
So, look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next
I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next 
I'm so fuckin'—
Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching, and for that, I say
Thank you, next 
Thank you, next

I'm so fuckin' grateful for my ex

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I'll be thanking my dad
'Cause she grew from the drama
Only wanna do it once, real bad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love 
Got so much patience 
And I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found 
Ain't no need for searching
And for that, I say

But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot 
Sorry that I think I'm not enough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish 
But after all this damage, I can’t help it 
But what you can trust is I need your touch
I’ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I’m a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be neededIt's like you got superpowers
Turn my minutes into hours
You got more than 20/20, babe
Made of glass, the way you see through me
You know me better than I do
Can't seem to keep nothing from you
How you touch my soul from the outside
Permeate my ego and my pride
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I'm gеtting used to receiving
Still gеtting good at not leaving
I'ma love you even though I'm scared 
Learnin' to be grateful for myself 
You love my lips 'cause they say the
Things we've always been afraid of
I can feel it startin' to subside
Learnin' to believe in what is mine
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me 
The way that you trust me 
Ooh, 'cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I couldn't believe it or see it for myself
Know I be impatient
But now I'm out here, fallin', fallin'
Frozen, slowly thawing, got me right
I won't keep you waitin', waitin'
All my baggage fadin' safely 
And if my eyes deceive me
Won't let them stray too far away
I wanna love me 
The way that you love me 
Ooh, for all of my pretty and all of my ugly too
I'd love to see me from your point of view
I wanna trust me, ooh 
The way that you trust me, baby 
'Cause nobody ever loved me like you do
I'd love to see me from your point of view 
YeahI know you hear me when I cry
I try to hold it in at night
While you're sleeping next to me
But it's your arms that I need this time 
Look at the cards that we've been dealt
If you were anybody else
Probably wouldn't last a day
Every tear's a rain parade from hell 
Baby, you do it so well
You've been so understanding, you've been so good
And I'm puttin' you through more than one ever should
And I'm hating myself 'cause you don't want to
Admit that it hurts you
I know that it breaks your heart when I cry again
Over him, mmh

'Stead of ghostin' him
We'll get through this, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage
But I love you, we'll get past this, I'm a girl with
A whole lot of baggage, oh yeah
Though I wish he were here instead
Don't want that living in your head
He just comes to visit me
When I'm dreaming every now and then 
And after all that we been through 
There's so much to look forward to
What was done and what was said
Leave it all here in this bed with you 
Baby, you do it so well

Hey, ayy, oh yeah…Here's the thing: you’re in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head, that you are trying to but cannot fix. Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself. I love you, this has gone on way too long. Enough is enough. I'm two blocks away, I’m coming over.​
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative

I know you're able, willin’ and able
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head

Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin’ from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren’t
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can’t hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you
Thought you were somebody else, you

When I was asleep 
You're such a dream to me, mmm, woah
And it was on a day like this, yeah
If you can believe, if you can believe 
Mmm, you're such a dream to me
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Boy, you're such a dream
If you can believe, babe
Boy, you're such a dream to me
"Excuse me, um, I love you"
I know that's not the way to start a conversation, trouble
I watch them other girls when they come and bug you
But I felt like I knew you, so I just wanted to hug you
Plus you don't know your way around
You can stop your playing now
All your worries, lay 'em down, shh, don't say it loud
Is this real, baby?
You're like: "I love you—who starts a conversation like that?" Nobody, but I do
But you are not a picture, I can't cut you up and hide you
I'll get you out my mind, mhm, or try to
But I just want to stand and yell
I will never dare to tell
Think I heard some wedding bells, shh, keep it to yourself
Is this real? 
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up
Don't wanna wake up, oh no
Wake up, wake up, wake up
'Cause you're such a dream
If you can believe
You're such a dream to me, mmm, boy
I could buy you anything, but I cannot buy you
Before your boy gets smart, I would never try to
You know I'm thinking to myself, "What happened? Why you?"
But when I see you in my dreams, psh, I know
You know how to treat it, you know how to eat it
You know how to beat it 
The Good Housekeeping Seal
I don't just wanna touch you
I'm tryna turn two single people into a couple
What's your next month like? Tell me what you're up to
We can leave right now, boy, you don't need a duffel
What about La Perla? Let Vickie keep her secret
Boy, it ain't no secret if I know you're gonna peep it, oh
Before you speak, don't move
'Cause I don't wanna wake up
Wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
Wake up, wake up, wake up, wa-wake up
'Cause you're such a dream 
If you can believe, you're such a dream to me
To me, mmm, boy, to me, mmm, yeahThis is one small step for woman
One giant leap for woman-kind
I'd rather be alone tonight
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Really don’t wanna be in your arms tonight
I'll just use my covers to stay warm tonight
Think I'm better off here all alone tonight
Ain’t no checkin' on when I get home tonight
Just makin' sure I'm good on my own tonight
Even though there isn't nothin' wrong tonight
Yeah, I'm just sayin', baby
I can’t really miss you if I’m with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It’s like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I’ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Bottom line
Usually, I would love it if you stayed the night
I just think I'm on another page tonight
It ain't nothing wrong with saying I need me time
Usually, I would orbit around you
But gravity seems to be the only thing that's pulling me
You'll be my rise and shine soon as them stars align, mmm
Baby, I can't really miss you if I'm with you
And when I miss you, it'll change the way I kiss you
Baby, you know time apart is beneficial
It's like I'm the universe and you be N-A-S-A
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
Give you the whole world, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need
You know I'm a star; space, I'ma need space
I'ma need space, I'ma, I'ma need space 
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
You don't wanna leave me, but I'm tryna self-discover
Keep me in your orbit and you know you'll drag me under
I'd rather be alone tonight 
You can say "I love you" through the phone tonight
Ah, hmm-mmmI'm a motherfuckin' train wreck
I don't wanna be too much
But I don't wanna miss your touch
And you don't seem to give a fuck
I don't wanna keep you waiting
But I do just what I have to do
And I might not be the one for you
But you ain't allowed to have no boo
'Cause I know we be so complicated
But we be so smitten, it's crazy
I can't have what I want, but neither can you
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
Even though you ain't mine, I promise the way we fight
Make me honestly feel like we just in love 
'Cause, baby, when push comes to shove 
Damn, baby, I'm a train wreck, too 
I lose my mind when it comes to you
I take time with the ones I choose
And I don't want a smile if it ain't from you, yeah
I know we be so complicated
Lovin' you sometimes drive me crazy
'Cause I can't have what I want and neither can you 
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to touch nobody else 
Baby, we ain't gotta tell nobody
I wanna kiss you , don't wanna miss you 
But I can't be with you 'cause I got issues 
Yeah, on the surface, seem like it's easy
Careful with words, but it's still hard to read me
Stress high when the trust low 
Bad vibes, where'd the fun go? 
Try to open up and love more 
Try to open up and love more
If you were my boyfriend
And you were my girlfriend
I prolly wouldn't see nobody else
But I can't guarantee that by myself
You ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend 
But you don't want me to see nobody else 
And I don't want you to see nobody
But you ain't my boyfriend 
And I ain't your girlfriend

Taking control of this kind of moment

Completely focused, my mind is open

Skin to skin, oh my God

Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin'
Like introducing us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste, the flavor, 'cause I'm a taker, 'cause I'm a giver
It's only nature, I live for danger
All that you got
Skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy 
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you

You close your eyes and you're screamin' 
Play with your mind for no reason
I know you love how I tease it 
You know that I'm playin', so don't be mistaken
You already know what I'm thinkin', boy
Oh, why'd you have to be so cute?

Just say goodnight and go
Ohh, ohh, ohh

Ohh, ohh, ohh

One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
We'd be good, we'd be great together
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, woah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go

I keep giving people blank stares 
I'm so different when you're not there 
It's like something out of Shakespeare
Because I'm really not here when you're not there
I've tried to fight our energy
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I go back to you, back to you, back to you
Back to you, back to you, back to you
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time
Just when I get on a new wave 
Boy, you look at me and I slip outta my lace
They keep calling me a head-case
'Cause I can't make a good case why we can't change
I've tried to fight our energy 
But every time I think I'm free 
You get high and call on the regular
I get weak and fall like a teenager
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me  back to you?
I get drunk, pretend that I'm over it
Self-destruct, show up like an idiot
Why, oh why does God keep bringing me back to you?
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you every time 
I go back to you, back to you, back to you 
Back to you, back to you, back to you

I got one more problem with you girl, hey!
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
Tell me, tell me, baby, why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it

Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
Head in the clouds
Got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya

Smart money bettin' I'll be better off without you
In no time I'll be forgettin' all about you
You sayin' that you know, but I really, really doubt you
Understand my life is easy when I ain't around you
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
No half-steppin', either you want it or you just playin'
I'm listenin' to you knowin' I can't believe what you sayin'
There's a million you's baby boo, so don't be dumb

The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain

When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time

Give it to me, to me
Oh, he give it to me every dayThe sun is setting and you're right here by my side
And the movie is playing, but we won't be watching tonight
Every look , every touch 
Makes me wanna give you my heart
I be crushin' on you, baby
Stay right where you are, 'cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
I kiss his fingertips as I'm wishing he's all mine
He's giving me Elvis with some James Dean in his eyes
Puts his lips  on my neck 
Makes me wanna give him my body
I be fallin' for you, baby, and I just can't stop, 'cause
I never knew, I never knew
You could hold moonlight in your hands
'Til the night I held you
You are my moonlight, moonlight
You're my moonlight, moonlight
He's so bossy, he makes me dance
Tryna sit in the back of his whip and just cancel my plans
Sweet like candy, but he's such a man
He knows just what it does when he’s holding me tight
And he calls me "moonlight" tooWhen raindrops fell down from the sky
The day you left me, an angel cried
Oh, she cried
An angel cried, she criedWill I ever love the same way again? 
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? 
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? 
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it 
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? 
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head 
Tryna be here from this bed 
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby 
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? 
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully 
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again 
Baby, baby 
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?
I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need

When finding love is a battle
But daylight is so close
So don't you worry 'bout a thing
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
That every little thing is gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
In slow motion
Can't seem to get where we're going
But the hard times are golden
'Cause they all lead to better days
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
Baby, don't you know?
All of them tears gon' come and go
Baby, you just gotta make up your mind

Baby, you just gotta make up your mind
We decide it
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright 
We're gonna be alright
We're gonna be alright, ayI'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
Huh-huh, baby
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, hey
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough 
So close to being in love 
If I would have known that you wanted me
The way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each other's arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was 
But almost is never enough
Huh-huh, baby 
You know, you know, baby
Almost, is never enough, baby
You know, heyOh, yeah
Wake up in my bed, I just wanna have a good day 
Think it in my head, then it happens how it should, ayy
Twelve o'clock, I got a team meeting, then a meditation at like 1:30
Then I ride to the studio listening to some shit I wrote 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Looking at my phone, but I'm tryna disconnect it 
Read a fuckin' book, I be tryna stay connected 
Say it's tricky at the top, gotta keep a slim ego for a thick wallet
Losing friends left and right, but I just send 'em love and light 
Good karma, my aesthetic 
Keep my conscience clear, that's why I'm so magnetic
Manifest it , I finessed it 
Take my pen and write some love letters to Heaven
Just like magic, just like magic
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it 
Just like magic, I'm attractive
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it
I don't wanna waste your time on some dumb shit
Password to your phone, you can miss me with that shit
Redesign your brain, we gon' make some new habits
Just like magic , just like magic
Just like magic , just like magic 
Middle finger to my thumb and then I snap it
Just like magic , I'm attractive 
I get everything I want 'cause I attract it 
Mmm, mmm 
Mmm-oh, yeah
Mmm, yeah, mmmThis bitch gon' make me...
You got me all up in my feels, in all kind of ways
I be tryna wait, but, lately, I just wanna keep it real 
No more playin' safe, let's take it all the way
I'm just sayin'
I just wanna make time for ya 
Swear it's just right for ya
Like this pussy designed for ya 
Ten outta five on ya
Know I would sign on the line for ya 
Bet I look nice on you 
Open my mind for ya 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for?
Don't wanna wait on it

Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get 
Tonight, I wanna get 
Promise I'ma give it to you like you never had it
I do it so good, it's gon' be hard to break the habit
You're like a whole constellation 
Swimming like you on vacation 
Promise I'm still gonna love you when you wake up in the AM
I just wanna make time for ya
Swear it's just right for ya
Like this pussy designed for ya
Ten outta five on ya
Know I would sign on the line for ya
Bet I look nice on you 
Open my mind for ya 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for?

What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Boy, you know the vibes, I don't waste no time
Take what's on your mind, make it real life
Get all the homies to bounce
Switch from the bed to the couch
And get to know how I'm feelin' inside
So much conversation, words so sweet
Been so well-behaved, but, boy, I'm weak
Yeah, my body's gotta say something to you
That's one way to tell I speak the truth
Don't wanna wait on it 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty
What you waitin' for? 
What you waitin' for? 
Don't wanna wait on it
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
Tonight, I wanna get nasty 
YeahHow soon do we forget how we felt
Dealing with emotions that never left
Playing with the hand that we were dealt in this game
Maybe I'm the sinner and you're the saint
Gotta stop pretending what we ain't
Why we pointing fingers anyway when we're the same?
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind? 
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
]
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on , mm, hold on, eh 
I guess time's wasting
Tick-tocking, lip locking
How can we keep the feelings fresh?
How do we zip lock it?
Wear your heart up on your sleeve
So watch out for pickpockets
I guess to go the distance we might need to pit stop it
Hold up, I know love can be a beach with no shore
I done count to ten, lost my temper and went back to four
I know sometimes it's hard to realize I'm the man that you need
I had a dream we branched out, started a family tree, huh
And I feel like that everything we do is overdue
You asked why I love your mom so much, 'cause she's a older you
I wish that you were happy
I guess that's the one thing I should be providing
Ain't no number twos
We both ones of ones, and we the oddest couple
Only humans, 'cept you, you a goddess
Only lying to you when I lie you down, just being honest
When you start as friends, it's hard to say you're never going back
If I'm not the one, then I'm the best mistake you ever had
Break up, make up
Total waste of time
Can we please make up our minds and stop acting like we’re blind?
'Cause if the water dries up and the moon stops shining
Stars fall, and the world goes blind
Boy, you know I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
'Cause you're the best mistake I've ever made
But we hold on, mm, hold on
There's no pot of gold in the rainbows we chase
But we hold on, mm, hold on, eh
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for you
You, you, you, you
I'll be savin' my love for you, for youMu-Mu-Mu-Murda
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna turn me on
Tell me why I get this feeling
That you really wanna make me yours, ah
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Baby, tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
I could call bullshit out from a mile away 
You want me if you can keep comin' back for me
Might have to curve you if you just can't talk straight 
Say what you mean 'cause you might get it
'Cause I see you tryin', subliminally tryin'
To see if I'm gon' be the one that's in your arms
I admit it's exciting, parts of me kinda like it
But before I lead you on
Tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive?
What's your motive?
What's your motive? 
You treat me like gold, baby
Now you wanna spoil me
Did you want a trophy or you wanna sport me, baby?
Want me on your neck 'cause you wanted respect
'Cause you fightin' some war, baby
Well, I had to bring the fists out, had to put a wall up
But don't trust phonies, baby 
You gotta tell me, what's your motive, baby?
'Cause you got your candy  on your arm 
No need to sugarcoat a lie 
Say what you want, I needed a real bonafide G 
Can you promise me you'll bring it all tonight? 
'Cause I need you to be wise
Tell me everything that's on your mind, come on
Baby, tell me what's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
So tell me, what's your motive? 
What's your motive? 
What's your motive? Tale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh
Hey
Yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh
Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah
Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah 
Beauty and... 
Beauty and the BeastIf you want it, take it
I should've said it before
Tried to hide it, fake it
I can't pretend anymore
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
You were better, deeper
I was under your spell, yeah
Like a deadly fever, yeah, babe
On the highway to hell, yeah
I only wanna die alive
Never by the hands of a broken heart
I don't wanna hear you lie tonight
Now that I've become who I really am
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
No more, baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Thought of your body, I came alive
It was lethal, it was fatal
In my dreams, it felt so right
But I woke up every time
Ooh, baby
This is the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before 
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no more
This is  the part when I say I don't want ya
I'm stronger than I've been before
This is the part when I break free
'Cause I can't resist it no moreI cried enough tears to see my own reflection in them
And then it was clear
I can't deny I really miss it
To think that I was wrong
I guess you don't know what you got 'til it's gone
Pain is just a consequence of love
I'm saying sorry for the sake of us
He wasn't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that he's gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
'Cause you are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
I know you're not far, but I still can't handle all the distance
You're traveling with my heart
I hope this is a temporary feeling
'Cause it's too much to bear without you
And I know "sorry" ain't the cure
If I cross your mind, just know I'm yours
'Cause what we got is worth fighting for
'Cause you are
You weren't my everything 'til we were nothing
And it's taking me a lot to say
Now that you're gone, my heart is missing something
So it's time I push my pride away
You are, you are
You are my everything
You are, you are
You are my everything
Ooh, hmm, ha, yeah
You are, you are, you are, ooh
You are, you are, you are
My everythingMy presence sweet and my aura bright
Diamonds good for my appetite
Guess it fuckin' just clicked one night
All them demons helped me see shit differently
So don't be sad for me
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up 
I vibrate high and my circle lit
We ain't really with drugs and shit
Love the game so I ain't nevеr miss
Keep opinions muted for the hell of it
'Causе I like my shit 
How you been spending your time? 
How you be using your tongue? 
You be so worried 'bout mine 
Can't even get yourself none
You know you sound so dumb 
You know you sound so dumb 
So maybe you should shut up, mmm
Yeah, maybe you should shut up
Said if only you would shut up 
Yeah, that's right, you should shut up Ooh, I know you're probably thinkin' what's the use
I promise it's the little things that you do
That make me wanna give it all to you
You know I do, baby
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
Been a minute since I had something so sweet
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Why would I double back or do the same thing twice?
A question, something that I can't deny
Leavе my baggage at the door, I'll claim you mine
All minе
You soothe me
You hold it down with every word you speak, oh babe
Baby
It's been a minute since I had something so sweet
Mmm, oh hey
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language

That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night
Baby, pardon my French, but could you speak in tongues?
Never lost in translation 'cause you know what I want, boy
Treat it just like Givenchy , it's expensive to taste
Ain't no need to remind ya, it's AG in your face
If you're gonna keep speaking my love language
You can talk your shit all night
You the medication when I'm feeling anxious
That's the kind of shit I like
Teach me how to love you
I'm unlearning what ain't right
I want you to keep speaking my love language
Baby, talk your shit all night

To run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there
Come run your hands through my hair
Ooh, baby, so don't you be scared
So come run your hands through my hair
It's been way long overdue

Spend my dimes and spend my time
To keep it real, sometimes it's tracks
But I don't care, mmm
So run your hands through my hair
Baby, 'cause that's why it's there

Come run your hands through my hair
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-ohThere is somethin' between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin' ’til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed
I can't believe that you are here, I can't believe it's happening
What are the odds that you'd appear?
The universe so vast to me
Seven billion is on the Earth
Could've been anywhere, but you're here with me
Should I play Lotto? What's it worth?
I must be on, so clear to me
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you
There is somethin’ between us, I can see it right now
Your magnetic demeanor, that’s something can't be found
I thought that I was dreamin’ 'til my love came around
Now I just come on over, show you how we get down
Shawty, you can get blazed
Look at you, love, you are the same
You have a light you cannot hide
Yes, you may have a different face
But your soul is the same inside
I don't care who is listening
'Cause they be making fun of this on TV
They wouldn’t laugh if they were inside my past life
With you and they were me
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go, oh
Never let you, never let you go, yeah

Don't think that it cannot happen, 'cause it can
Shawty, you can get blazed
Sleep if you want, and wake up in love again
Shawty, you can get blazed
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you
Once I have you, I will never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let you, never let you go
Never let youI love the taste of you in the morning
Keep me warm and
Nothin' else, nothin' more important
Makes me wanna believe in love 
I love the thought of us in the evening
Crave the feeling
The way you feel, somethin' 'bout it's healing
I'm praying we don't fuck this up 
Others that I've had had to impress me before
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? 
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious?
Maybe if I'm lucky, you might stay the afternoon
If you gotta work, just promise me you'll come back soon
Maybe you should pack a suitcase too 
I love the thought of you never leavin' 
Days repeatin'
Gettin' steps up on the treadmill while you sleepin'
Never thought I'd believe in love again
Others that I've had had to impress me before 
But I knew you were the real thing
When you walked through the door
I didn't think that I would have to spell it out
Don't put the bands, put the bands on me
Oh, my love, oh, my love is free
Ain't no price on my loyalty
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? 
Hard to think when I'm under you
Tell you all of my dirty truths
No shit, got me right where you want me, baby
Could I be more obvious? Ooh-ooh, hey
Put your hands up 
So put your hands up  
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe
Okay, this, this, this one for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you? 
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need 
I know what you like 
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright 
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there
I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe, yeah 
And I get butterflies just thinking
About you, boy, you're on my mind 
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in your eyes and I lose all track of time 
You know what I need 
I know what you like 
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright 
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
You should know I'm never gonna change
I'm always gonna stay
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there 
I'll always be right there 
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement? 
If my Benz turned back to public transportation 
Would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting 
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary 
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don't mind a drive-thru
That's why I got you
And I'll never let you go 
You should know  I'm never gonna change 
I'm always gonna stay  
You call for me, I'm right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You're so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I'm gonna stay right there 
I'll always be right there 
You got it  
I'll always be right there   
 
I'll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe  
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
You got it, you got it, babe 
Got it, babeAh, hey, yeah

But I know you love how I whip it
You can only stay mad for a minute
So come here and give me some kisses
You know I'm very delicious
You know I'm very impatient
Might change my mind, so don't keep me waiting
I just wonder, baby, if you're gonna stay
Even if, one day, I lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy

So, boy, let me know if you ready

You know you be on some bullshit 
Act so possessive and crazy 
But I know that's just 'causе you love me
And you ain't scared to show mе your ugly
And maybe that's just how it's supposed to be
I'm the release, you the dopamine
And you wonder, baby, if I'm gonna stay
Even if one day, you lose it and go crazy
I know this shit kinda heavy 
Just wanna ask you directly

How we get here so damn fast?
Only you can tell me that
Baby, 'cause you know I'm coming back
You're making me forget my past
Never thought I’d feel like that again
I came to peace with my path
Now you got me off track
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind
Mmm
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
Let your guard down, girl
You know we came too far now, girl 
It's timе for you to play your part now
You know we hit that jewelry storе and we gon' ball out
Ups and downs, we had some fallouts 
Put some ice on you, girl, let it thaw out 
Girl, you're mine, it's safe to say
At the end of the day
I've never been this scared before
Feelings I just can't ignore
Don't know if I should fight or fly
But I don't mind  
Mmm 
Tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said 
Is it real this time or is it in my head? 
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away, my baby
Every time you feel some way, feel a way
Never let me run away, run away
Girl, you got me tripping, falling, with no safety net
Boy, it must be something that you said 
Is it real this time or is it in my head?
Got me tripping, falling, with no safety net 
Oh hey
Ah yeahOh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever ask you where you've been
And I don't feel the need to know who you're with
I can't even think straight
But I can tell that you were just with her
And I'll still be a fool
I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart is all I want
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit of your heart
Just a little bit is all I'm asking for
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
I don't ever tell you how I really feel
'Cause I can't find the words to say what I mean
And nothing's ever easy, that's what they say

But I'll still be a fool
'Cause I'm a fool for you
Just a little bit of your heart

Where the hell are you
Oh, when I need you?
I could still hear your voice
I ain't got no choice
'Cause I'm here all alone
I know I can't wait 'til you get home
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you
Got these thoughts in my head
Ain't no way to forget
Got me losing my breath
Nobody got me the way that you did
Had my eyes rolling back
Had me arching my back
Now you love me so good
I wish you would hurry up and come back
Oh, I don't have you here with me
But at least I have the memory
I try to make it through the night
But I can't control my mind
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
Baby, I don't want no one, no one else
So hurry, 'cause I need some, need some, need some help
And I've been waiting patient, patiently
'Cause I don't have you here with, here with, here with me
But at least I have the memory
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm just thinkin' 'bout you 
I'm thinkin' 'bout you, I'm thinkin' 'bout youLa, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la
I've never been so caught up
Still so into us
I never thought I'd be here
Should've turned to dust
Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
I used to be cautious
A little too reckless
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road

Ooh, let's be honest, baby
This is so unusual
Ooh, I'm not tempted, baby
Even if they're beautiful
It used to be easy
For someone to steal me
Now all my emotions
Are all 'cause of you, boy
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
Not even sometimes, babe
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
Why it never worked, but it's going to now
You don't know, you don't know, you don't know
What it does to me when I feel you around
Is it love? Is it lust? Is it fear?
But it's hard to breathe when you're touching me there
Hard to breathe when you're kissing me there
Hard to breathe when you're not here
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes
I ain't even think of letting go
I ain't ever thought of going nowhere
I don't even see it down the road
'Cause we're collectin' moments
Tattoos on my mind
I ain't even think of leaving sometimes

I looked in my rear view mirror and
It seemed to make a lot more sense
Than what I see ahead of us, ahead of us, yeah
Uh, I'm ready to make that turn
Before we both crash and burn
'Cause that could be the death of us, the death of us
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
Hey, what happened to the butterflies?
Guess they encountered that stop sign
And my heart is at a yellow light, a yellow light
Hey, right when I think that we've found it 
Well, that's when we start turnin' around 
You're sayin' "Baby, don't worry"
But we're still goin' the wrong way
Baby, you know how to drive in rain
And you decided not to make a change
Stuck in the same old lane
Goin' the wrong way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?
They say only fools fall in love
Well, they must've been talkin' about us
And sometimes I feel like I've been here before
I could be wrong, but I know I'm right
We're gon' be lost if we continue to fight
Honey, I know that we can find our way home
I feel like my heart is stuck in bumper-to-bumper traffic
I'm under pressure 'cause I can't have you the way that I want
Let's just go back to the way it was
When we were on Honeymoon Avenue
Honeymoon Avenue, my baby
Coastin' like crazy
Can we get back to the way it was?

Is it love when you cry, and cry and cry?
So when you walk out that door
Don't you come back no more

And as much as I want you to stay
You're a dangerous love

Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Feeling Christmas all around
And I'm trying to play it cool
But it's hard to focus when I see him walking 'cross the room
"Let It Snow" is blasting out
But I won't get it in the mood
I'm avoiding every mistletoe until I know it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
I've been down this road before
Fell in love on Christmas night
But on New Year's Day, I woke up and he wasn't by my side
Now I need someone to hold
Be my fire in the cold
But it's hard to tell if this is just a fling or if it's
True love that he thinks of
So next Christmas I'm not all alone, boy
Santa, tell me if you're really there
Don't make me fall in love again if he won't be here next year
Santa, tell me if he really cares
'Cause I can't give it all away if he won't be here next year
Oh, I wanna have him beside me, like oh-woo-oh

This year I've got to be smart

Even though this sun is blasting
We can be wherever if we visualize
Hey, yo
I wanna pretend we're at the North Pole
Turning the heat into an ice cold holiday
Made just for me and my baby
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby's in town and we're gonna do some winter things, heyWhat do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re so indecisive of what I'm sayin'
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complainin'
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right 
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night 
First you're up, then you’re down, and then between 
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're runnin' outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise, but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preachin'
Had me from the start, don't let this end
First you wanna go to the left, then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, makin' love all night 
First you're up, then you’re down, and then between 
Oh, I really wanna know
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean? 
Oh, what do you mean? 
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean? 
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
Oh, oh 
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey, yeah 
When you don't want me to move , but you tell me to go
What do you mean? 
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?Center of attention once again
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
Then they try to tell me who I am
They don't understand
They don't understand, no
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking but there's just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
The same arguments time and time again
And you watch them all happen
But they don't understand, no
Thinking you're the reason that it ends
And he won't be back again
But they don't understand, no
You want a perfect picture to believe in?
Then you can't be looking for me then
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
You don't know me
The girl you see in photographs is only a part of the one I am
Don't judge me
'Cause that's not reality
And all I can be is in love with who I'm becoming
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, you don't know me
I don't need to live by your rules 
Until you've walked a mile in my shoes 
And I know, I know, I know you don't like it
You don't, you don't, you don't know where I've been
It's my life, so truth be told
I see you thinking, but there is just one thing, dear
You think you know, but you don't have no idea
Think you know me, but there's more to see, my love
My loveOh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Here we go
I could write a song with my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'd find out that my heart was battered
Real hard 
It's so hard 
Real hard 
It's that hard 
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna grab your lover's hand
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I wanna see you rock to the piano, the piano, oh
I could write a song by my new piano
I could sing about how love is a losing battle
Not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
It's not hard 
And I could sing about Cupid and his shooting arrow
In the end, you'll find out that my heart was battered

So hard 
Real hard 
It's that hard 
But I'd rather make a song they can play on the radio
That makes you wanna dance
Don't it make you wanna dance?

I'd rather tell you about how I'm feeling, boy
And how I'm doing things my way
If I got my piano, then I'm gon' be okay, baby
So hold up and take it through the night
And you should follow through to make it alright
Now grab each others' hands, get ‘em up
I want to see you rock to the piano, the piano

It's not hard

It's not hardWelcome to this Christmas
Only comes one time a year, don't miss this
I just wanna welcome you to Christmas
Let me sneak into your speakers, listen
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"
I'll be singing, "Oh, oh, oh, oh"It's The Rascals!
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?
Hold up, wait
Before you go, just stay
And talk to me for a little
Baby, won't you loosen up just a little, eh?
See, what you don’t understand
Is falling in love wasn’t part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I’ll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing
Nothing but lovin' you
Nothing but lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my time
I’m lovin' your loving
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby

You don’t gotta question if I’m really loving your lovin'
I’m lovin', I’m lovin' you, baby
Boy, you got all my, all my
Hold up, wait
Shut up and kiss me, babe
I just wanna get a little taste
I just wanna get a little taste before you go
See, what you don’t understand
Is falling in love wasn’t part of my plan
Started with a crush, now I call you my man
Doubt that I’ll ever fall in love, ever fall in love again
'Cause you give me chills every time we chill
I spend all of my days doing, doing
Nothing but lovin' you

Boy, you got all my, all my
Time and my trust
Don't mess this up
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' in love
You got me fallin' so hard
Boy, you change the way I breathe
When you put your lips on me
I adore you
So let me make it clear to you, that boy, you’re all I need
My baby
Nothing but lovin' you

Boy, you got all my time

Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?
Baby, don’t you know you’ve got all my love, all my love?I really can't stay, but baby it's cold outside
I got to go away, but baby it's cold outside
This evening has been—, been hoping that you'd drop in
So very nice, I'll hold your hands, they're just like ice
My mama will start to worry, beautiful, what's your hurry?
My daddy will be pacing the floor, listen to the fireplace roar
Really I better scurry, beautiful, please don't hurry
Maybe just half a drink more, put some records on while I pour
The neighbors might think, baby, it's bad out there
Say, what's in this drink? No cabs to be had out there
I wish I knew how, your eyes are like star light
To break this spell, I'll take your hat, your hair looks swell
I ought to say: "No, no, no, sir," mind if I move in a bit closer?
At least I'm going to say I tried, what's the sense of hurting my pride?
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside
I simply must go, baby, it's cold outside
The answer is no, baby, it's cold outside
The welcome has been—, how lovely that you dropped in
So nice and warm, look out the window and see the storm
My sister will be suspicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
My brother will be there at the door, waves upon a tropical shore
My maiden aunt's mind is vicious, gosh, your lips look delicious
Maybe just a cigarette more, never such a blizzard before
Gotta get home, but baby, you'll freeze out there
Say, lend me your coat, get on your knees right there
You've really been grand, I thrill when you touch my hand
But don't you see, how can you do this thing to me?
There's bound to be talk tomorrow, think of my life long sorrow
At least there'll be plenty implied, if you caught pneumonia and died
I really can't stay, baby, don't hold out
Baby, it's cold outside
I like that oneI'm so into you, I can barely breathe
And all I wanna do is to fall in deep
But close ain't close enough 'til we cross the line, hey, yeah
So name a game to play, and I'll roll the dice, hey
Oh baby, look what you started
The temperature's rising in here
Is this gonna happen?
Been waiting and waiting for you to make a move
Before I make a move
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you-
Baby, this a microphone checkup
What you getting into when you get up?
When I wake up early, I'ma text ya
Heard you got a man
Baby, I could do it better
And it really ain't the plan
I just want you to remember
How it was, how it is, how it could be
You could pull me in, you could push me
Or we can go for a ride, you the sky
Looking up, you a high
You ain't never gotta lie
Cause it's more than just pussy
For the night, everything's alright
When you lay down, I'ma hit the lights
And what's a life if you don't got me?
Give you what you want, what you need
Hit me up when you're feeling blue
And I'll tell how I'm feeling too, so you know
I just want to get into you
Right here in the living room
Let's go
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
Tell me what you came here for
'Cause I can't, I can't wait no more
I'm on the edge with no control
And I need, I need you to know
You to know, oh
So baby, come light me up and maybe I'll let you on it
A little bit dangerous, but baby, that's how I want it
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you
Got everyone watchin' us, so baby, let's keep it secret
A little bit scandalous, but baby, don’t let them see it
A little less conversation and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into you, oh yeah
So come light me up
So come light me up, my baby
A little dangerous
A little dangerous, my baby
A little less conversation, and a little more touch my body
'Cause I'm so into you, into you, into youBaby loves, I'm tryna to talk to you
There's a boy and I don't quite know what to do
Good things come to those who wait
But patience ain't my thing
The way he holds me shows me he's the one
For sure the one
Think I'd rather wait for him, forever
Instead of having him, just for now
At night, just when I look up at the moon
I wonder if he's lookin' at it too
And I don't know what to doI'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas
Wanna show you in so many ways
365 days
I'll give you all my presents, boy
I'm for you, not just on Christmas
Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah
Ah
I'll love you till I die, boy
Every day of my life
I celebrate you, baby
I adore you, not just on Christmas
Baby, whether rain or shine
Naughty or nice
I'm by your side
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ah
AhI hate that I remember
I wish I could forget what you did last December
You left my heart a mess
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah 
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Thought we belong together
At least that's what you said
I should have known better
You broke my heart again
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special

You broke my heart with no warning
Boy, you blew it
How could you do it, do it?
Oh, yeah
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
Last Christmas, I gave you my heart
But the very next day you gave it away
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
This is our last, last Christmas
You broke my heart

You broke my heart
This year to save me from tears, I'll give it to someone special
I hate that I remember

... Close to the light, yeah
Didn’t get to say goodbye to you
But I feel like I never ...I told you once, "Get out my life
I don't need ya, I'll be alright"
But some things are better left unsaid
To tell the truth, it hit me hard
A broken heart is all I have now
But some things are better left unsaid
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
I could tell a lie
Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaid
And I swore that I would never say
"I miss you more every day"
But some things are better left unsaid
Are better left unsaid, said, said
Oh, I'm gonna say things like "Shut up and kiss me"
Oh, tonight I'm gonna lose some things
Don't play me, just kiss me
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
Don't play me, just kiss me
Oh, tonight I'll say things
Don't play me, just kiss me, babe
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up
If you wanna party, put your hands up
Put your hands up, put your hands up

Blame tonight
Too many drinks
So many reasons that some things are better left unsaidI want you 
I want you 
You know what I want
I know what you don't
I should be the one you love on
Boy, you got my mind playing truth or dare
Daring me kiss you right here
But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show
I-woah-woah-woah
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me, and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?
'Cause we both know what could go down if we got too close
Oh, boy if we get too close
Oh, I-I'm down if we get too close
Remember that girl that you used to date?
She with my ex-boyfriend, that's great
So, what would you do?
What would you say if I said I loved you that way?
But we've been friends so long
And it seems so wrong
And everyone can see you're perfect for me
But I just can't let it show, oh
I've been thinking about you
Boy, it's killing me and I got to let you know
Baby, tell me, do you feel it like I do?

Oh, I want you, oh, I want you, oh, I want youDear Santa, it's me, Ariana
I know it's been awhile but I really need your help this year
Let me make this clear
See I, I really love him and it's been kinda tough
Cause he's only in town for the holidays
Tomorrow he's flying away, away from me
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish
This year can you...
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California
Dear Santa, what happened to the plan we had?
I checked the news and it said it'd be a sunny day
Make it go away
See I, I really need him to stay for a couple more days
Can't you make his five o'clock flight delay?
Won't you find a way?
I don't need another gift, I just have one wish, oh yeah
This year can you...
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in California
I know I'm asking for the impossible, but I believe in miracles
I need my baby right here with me, so please, please
Just make it snow in California? I'll even settle for rain
Don't want him to go tomorrow morning
Give me something to make him stay
Wrapped in his arms by the fireplace will be the perfect gift
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow in CaliforniaSo what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
So what we gon' do?
So what you gon' do?
You said you'd never forget her
And she said she could change your life
It happened on the day you met her
A love at first sight made you blind
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?
Yeah nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it
No one, no one
No-no-nobody does it better
Don't throw your heart out in a letter
Cause I already read your mind
You know you missed out on forever
And settled for a waste of time
But I warned you she wasn't who she claimed to be
And no one could love you like me
Cause nobody does it better
I know you're sittin' at home cryin' cause you miss me
Nobody does it better
You must be out of your mind, boy, what was you thinkin'?

No-no-nobody does it better
No-no-nobody does it betterRiding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
Summer days with my honey
Worried 'bout not a thing
Back in the day when things were easier than a breeze
Who knew that kiss was the last one?
I never thought we would change
Baby, I'm missing you
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated, but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want you
Memories last forever, so how could I just forget?
Made everything from nothing 'cause time was all we spent
Oh, we shoulda been forever but we fell apart
Might have separated but you took my heart
Always knew I wasn't really over us
Sometimes I catch myself
Riding 'round in my Cadillac
Thinking 'bout the day that I first saw you
Nothing compares to what we had, and baby that won't change
I want you, babe
I still want you, baby
I still want youGot a job, got a crib, got a mind of my own, honey

Way up high
There's a land that I've heard of
Once in a lullaby
Somewhere over the rainbow
Skies are blue
And the dreams that you dare to dream
Really do come true
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Oh, somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I?
Someday I'll wish upon a star
And wake up where the clouds are far behind me, oh
Where troubles melt like lemon drops
Way above the chimney tops
That's where you'll find me
Somewhere over the rainbow
Bluebirds fly, hmm
Birds fly over the rainbow
Why, then oh why, can't I?
If happy little bluebirds fly
Beyond the rainbow
Why, oh why, can't I?Tell me why are you only good to me
When I'm bad to you?
Why are you only?
Stopped thinking like a victim
Climbed out the bodybag
Now I'm on the attack
Caught you dreamingLet me see you put your hearts up, yeah
Let me see you put your hearts up, yeah
If we give a little bit of love maybe we can change the world
You think you're so small like you're itty-bitty
Just one match in the lights of the city
Walking up to strangers on the side of the street, like
A quarter in a cup will get the up on their feet, like
You think you're never gonna make your mark
Sit back and watch the world while it falls apart, like
Out of sight, out of mind, like
Like it's just a waste of time, like, like, like
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world

If we give a little love maybe we can change the world
Wishing on a shooting star in the sky
We can do anything if we try
Can't resurrect Ghandi, resurrect King
But if put our heads together we can do anything
Like, you don't have to be a billionaire
You don't have to have much to show to show much care
Like give a wink, give a kiss
Like give a little happiness, like, like, like
Hey yeah yeah yeah yeah
Hey yeah yeah
If we give a little love maybe we can change the world

(Hoo-ah, Hoo-ah, Hoo-ah
Hoo-ah, Hoo-ah, Hoo-ah)When I meet the Wizard
Once I prove my worth
And when I meet the Wizard
What I've waited for since, since birth
And with all his Wizard wisdom
By my looks, he won't be blinded
Do you think the Wizard is dumb?
Or, like Munchkins, so small-minded? No
He'll say to me, "I see who you truly are
A girl on whom I can rely"
And that's how we'll begin
The Wizard and I
Once I'm with the Wizard
My whole life will change
Cause once you're with the Wizard
No one thinks you're strange
No father is not proud of you
No sister acts ashamed
And all of Oz has to love you
When by the Wizard, you're acclaimed
And this gift or this curse I have inside
Maybe at last, I'll know why
When we are hand in hand
The Wizard and I
One day, he'll say to me
"Elphaba, a girl who is so superior
Shouldn't a girl who's so good inside
Have a matching exterior?
And since folks here to an absurd degree
Seem fixated on your verdigris
Would it be alright by you
If I de-greenify you?"
And though of course, that's not important to me
"All right, why not?" I'll reply
Oh, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and I
Yes, what a pair we'll be, The Wizard and...
Unlimited
My future is unlimited
And I've just had a vision
Almost like a prophecy, I know
It sounds truly crazy
And true, the vision's hazy
But I swear, someday there'll be
A celebration throughout Oz
That's all to do with me
And I'll stand there with the Wizard
Feeling things I've never felt
And though I'd never show it
I'd be so happy, I could melt
And so it will be for the rest of my life
And I'll want nothing else 'til I die
Held in such high esteem
When people see me, they will scream
For half of Oz's favorite team, oh
The Wizard and IJamie is over and Jamie is gone
Jamie's decided it's time to move on
Jamie has new dreams he's building upon
And I'm still hurting
Jamie arrived at the end of the line
Jamie's convinced that the problems are mine
Jamie is probably feeling just fine
And I'm still hurting
What about lies, Jamie?
What about things
That you swore to be true?
What about you, Jamie?
What about you?
Jamie is sure something wonderful died
Jamie decides it's his right to decide
Jamie's got secrets he doesn't confide
And I'm still hurting
Go and hide and run away
Runaway, run and find something better
Go and ride the sun away
Runaway like it's simple
Like it's right
Give me a day, Jamie
Bring back the lies
Hang them back on the wall
Maybe I'd see
How you could be
So certain that we
Had no chance at all
Jamie is over and where can I turn?
Covered with scars I did nothing to earn
Maybe there's somewhere a lesson to learn
But that wouldn't change the fact
That wouldn't speed the time
Once the foundation's cracked
And I'm still hurtingIt's time for us to all give something
All around the world this time of year
As a matter of fact it, won't cost you nothing
It's in your heart, you got it right there, you got it right there
The truth is your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it
'Cause when I look around, there's enough for everyone 
If you spend a little time, look deep inside
Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas
All we need is love 
Love is all we need 
Love underneath the tree, love is everything
All we need is love 
Love is all we need 
Let your heart believe that love is everything 
We'll give it all 'cause it's the season
Spreading lots of joy and lots of cheer
If you need a cost, if you need a reason, oh yeah
It's the gift that just won't disappear, won't disappear
The truth is your heart is the biggest gift you can give anyone
I know we can do it
'Cause when I look around there's enough for everyone 
If you spend a little time, look deep inside
Search your heart and I'm sure you'll find
That the best gift you could give this Christmas
All we need is love 
Love is all we need 
Love underneath the tree, love is everything 
All we need is love 
Love is all we need 
Let your heart believe that love is everything 
Love who you love, no one can judge
Follow your heart and don't give up
'Cause that's what this day's about
So grab 'em close and hold them in
And don't let go, 'cause Christmas is here

Sober, when you come closer
Boy I know I know you've been trying to quit
But you let it show
Boy we're kissing now
Baby when I'm with you
I'm wastedHercules
Hercules
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Person of the week in every Greek opinion poll
What a pro
Herc could stop a show
Point him at a monster and you're talking S.R.O
He was a no one
Now he's a honcho
Here was a kid with his act down pat
From zero to hero in no time flat
Zero to hero, just like that
When he smiled, the girls went wild with 
And they slapped his face on every vase, on every "vahse"
From appearance fees and royalties
Our Herc had cash to burn
Now nouveau riche and famous
He could tell you
What's a Grecian urn?
Say amen, there he goes again
Sweet and undefeated and an awesome 10 for 10
Folks lined up just to watch him flex
And this perfect package
Packed a pair of pretty pecs
Hercie, he comes, he sees, he conquers
Honey, the crowds were going bonkers
He showed the moxie brains and spunk
From zero to hero, major hunk
Zero to hero and who'da thunk?
Who put the glad in gladiator?
Whose daring deeds are great theatre?
Is he bold?
Is he sweet?
My favorite flavor!
Hercules, Hercules
Hercules, Hercules
Her-, her-
Bless my soul
Herc was on a roll
Undefeated
Riding high, 
Not conceited
He was a no one
Now he's a honcho
He hit the heights at breakneck speed
From zero to hero
Herc is a hero
Now he's a hero
Yes, indeedMhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Mhmm, uh-huh, yeah yeah, alright
Say you love me as much as I love you, yeah
Would you hurt me, baby?
Could you do that to me, yeah?
Would you lie to me, baby?
Cause the truth hurts so much more
Would you do the things that drive me crazy?
Leave my heart still at the door?
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
Yeah, yeah
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy
]
You know, this ain't the first time this has happened to me
This lovesick thing
I like serious relationships, and uh...
A girl like me don't stay single for long
'Cuz everytime a boyfriend and I break-up
My world is crushed and I'm all alone
The love bug comes right back up and bites me...
And I'm back
Oh, if there is a reason to call me a fool
Cause I love too hard
Are there any rules, baby?
If this is a lesson
Baby, teach me to behave
Just tell me what I gotta do
Just to stay right next to you
Oh, I can't help it, I'm just selfish
There's no way that I could share you
That would break my heart to pieces
Honestly the truth is
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Yeah, yeah
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Ooh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy
Basically I’m saying here
I can’t live without my baby
Loving you is so damn easy for me yeah
Ain’t no need for contemplating
Promise you won’t keep me waiting
Tell me baby I’m all that you need
If I could just die in your arms
I wouldn't mind
Cause everytime you touch me
I just die in your arms
Oh, it feels so right
So, baby, baby, please don't stop boy
If I could die
I wouldn't mind
Ay, ay, oooh

Wooh, no no no no no no
Oooh
If I could just die
Oooh
Baby please don't go boy
No no no no no noI feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream...
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied
I'm in love, I'm alive
Intoxicated, flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning, when I rise
You are the first thing, on my mind
And in the middle of the night
I feel your heartbeat next to mine
If feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You got me feeling highIf I'm honest, I wasn’t devastated
But you could've held my hands through this, baby
Let my mind run underneath warm jets
I run my hands through what's left
But we’re getting older, baby
Don't have much longer, baby
Why am I preaching?
To this choir, to this atheist?
Just like mine, versions of these belong to you
After a while, they're keeping me close to you
They long to be close to youI was a liar, I gave into the fire
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest
Feel like a failure 'cause I know that I failed you
I should've done you better
'Cause you don't want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know
She gives you everything but boy, I couldn't give it to you
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
Sans toi, plus rien ne brille, plus aucun rêve ne me tient debout
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I'll let you go
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
Tout seul je dérive
Si de ta peau tu me prives
Les minutes sont des années
Quand le cœur se laisse aller
Viens, on recommence
On s'accorde une deuxième chance
Rattrapons le temps gâché
Arrêtons de nous cacher
Mon amour, mon amour, mon amour
J'pourrais changer d'avis mais tu resteras mon seul amour
And I know, and I know, and I know
That you got everything, but I got nothing here without you, baby
Oui, attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme 
Attends-moi
Sans toi, je suis sans vie, sans idéaux
Je sais qu'on ne peut jamais remonter le temps
Pourquoi ne pas s'apprendre à s'aimer au présent ?
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme
I know I should've fought it
At least I'm being honest, yeah...
But stay with me a minute
I swear I'll make it worth it, yeah
'Cause I don't wanna be without you 
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home 
One more time 
I promise after that, I'll let you go 
Baby, I don't care if you got her in your heart, babe
All I really care is you wake up in my arms, oh!
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home, yeah 
Attends-moi
Si tu t'enfuis, je suis juste un fantôme" ft. J Balvin]
I love the way you make me feel
I love it, I love it
Tú eres todo para mí
Te amo, I love it
Yo no soy perro, soy canino
Solo trátame con cariño
Este amor es como el vino
Entre más viejo pues más fino
Aunque a tu madre no le gusten mis tatuajes
Dile que soy yo quien te saca lo salvaje
You give me that kind of somethin'
Want it all the time, need it every day
On a scale of one to ten I'm at a hundred
Never get enough, I can’t stay away
If you want, I got it, I got it every day
You can get whatever you need from me
Stay by your side, I’ll never leave ya
And I ain’t goin' nowhere 'cause you’re a keeper
So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it 
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it 
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me 
I love the way 
I love the way 
Baby, no sé vivir 
Ooh, no sé vivir, the way I love you 
Oh, estoy loca, no, no, no, no puedo
Ya dejarte de pensar
Y tú me llevas hasta el cielo 
Con tu modo de hablar
Dame un beso, mi amor, y acaríciame
Llévame al cielo, enamórame
Baby, yo quiero 
No te vayas, escucha lo que digo
So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it 
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it 
And I don't care who sees it, babe
I don't want to hide the way
I feel when you're next to me 
I love the way 
I love the way 
Baby, no sé vivir 
Ooh, no sé vivir, no sé vivir, no 
Yo soy diferente, no sigo al resto de la gente
No sé si estoy bien loco o si soy inteligente
Solo que con tu amor es más que suficiente
Y por ti viajaría todo el continente
Baby, ven aquí por favor
Sabes que aquí estoy yo
Ven y no pierdas tiempo
J Balvin, man
So don’t you worry, te necesito
I, I got a bad boy, just admit it 
You got my heart, don’t know how you did it

No sé vivir, the way I love you Lyrics From Snippets
We stay up all night, fuck a jet lag
You bring your fine ass and overnight bag
Add up the numbers or get behind that
Play and rewind that, listen, you'll find that
I want that 69 without Tekashi
And I want your body and I make it obvious
Wake up the neighbours, we got an audience
They hear us clapping, but we not applauding
At six o'clock with no crushing
Then it gets seven o'clock and he want it
Then it hit eight o'clock, you said, "Fuck it"
Forget your girl, pretend that I'm her
You make the cat purr, you make my back hurt, ayy
Making that squirt, a rain, a shower, it's sprayin'
Now that's perfect, baby, we don't sleep enough
But I'ma keep you up, if you can keep it up 
Can you stay up all night? 
Fuck me 'til thе daylight ..."raindrops "

The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
Don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
Ohh yeah
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war you'll always win
Even when I'm right
Cause you feed me fables from your hands
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lie
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run but I don't wanna ever leave
Till these walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's all right because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's all right because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
Oh, I love the way you lieDo you love me? 
Do you love me? 
Oh, do you love me? 
Now that I can dance
Watch me now! Drop
I can mash potato
I can do the twist
Now tell me, baby
Do you like it like this?
Ariana, and your boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you something, baby
I think I love you
Born to party, born to rock
Big bad, baby, we're on top, uh
Rolling in the cadi
Hilowitz making hits like grandaddy
Bust a move, get in the groove
Baby girl, I'm into you
Show me what you can do
I got you, boom
You're feeling some new
Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love, but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk is cheap
Save your cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy, better take a chance
On a great date, you can hold my hand
But nothing more
Baby boy, I need to know
Do you love me? 
Do you love me, baby? 
Oh, do you love me ? 
Now that I can dance
Watch me now!
Drop
I can mash potato
And I can do the twist
Now tell me, baby
Do you like it like this
Ariana and my boy Sky Blu
I gotta tell you, baby
I think I love you!
Got the money, got the cash
On the dance floor, I'm Michael Jackson
Time for some action, here we go
Sky Blu in the stereo
Turn it up, hurry up
She doing it Grande, that's what's up
Her plus me, you can add it up
Oh, you'll never get enough of that
Tell me if it's meant to be
I'd give my love, but it ain't for free
So watch it now, talk is cheap
Save your cash, spend time with me
Say dance, dance, young romance
You bad boy better take a chance
On a great date you can hold my hand
But nothing more
Baby boy, I need to know
Do you love me? 
Do you love me? 
Oh, do you love me, boy? 
Now that I can dance
Watch me now
You broke my heart 'cause I couldn't dance
You didn't even want me around
But now I'm back to let you know
I can really shuffle 'em down, yeah !

Breakfast at Tiffany's and bottles of bubbles
Girls with tattoos who like getting in trouble
Lashes and diamonds, ATM machines
Buy myself all of my favorite things 
Been through some bad shit, I should be a sad bitch
Who woulda thought it'd turn me to a savage?
Rather be tied up with calls and not strings, sing
 Yuh

You like my hair? Gee, thanks, just bought it
I see it, I like it, I want it, I got it, sing
 Woo, woo, woo, woo
 Gee, thanks, just bought it

Bought matching diamonds for six of my bitches

Whoever said money can't solve your problems, what?
They say, "Which one?" I say 
Happiness is the same price as red-bottom, just kidding

 Just for  the closet
Both his and hers, I want it, I got it, sing
 Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
 Ooh yeah, yeah
I see it, baby, yeah

The way it be settin' the tone for me
I don't mean to brag, but I be like, "Put it in the bag," yeah
When you see them racks, they stacked up
Shoot, go from the store to the booth
Make it all back in one loop, gimme the loot
Never mind, I got the juice
Nothing but net when we shoot
Look at my neck, look at my jet
Ain't got enough money to pay me respect
Ain't no budget when I'm on the set

HiI heard you got time on your hands
You been messy, makin' double plans
Make sure before you hit send
Might wanna read that again
Everytime you do this, understand
You're tryna get familiar
With somebody I knew first
But she already know her worth
Everything is all deserved
They already know the truth
Send the screenshots and the proof
You don't even have to choose
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
So please, boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side
I know you know we know 'bout you
Sorry, we ain't what you're normally used to
Prolly think you're comin' closer to me
Don't you think that she'd pick you over me
Boy, please
I got some advice
Next time you'll think twice
Bad bitch by my side
Always down to ride
We will let this left, you get sex the best
'Fore you come 'round mine
Boy, make up your mind
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
So please, boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side 
Told me hit him after eight o' clock
Told me you'd pick me up at 5
But let me guess, y'all went to ask the neighbors
Reservation at the Chateau
You should pull up on me instead
That would really fuck with his head
And he really think that this shit's okay
Won't get away with another thing
Ooh-oh, girl, this gon' be some shit
Ooh-oh,  girl, we'd love to see it
Ooh-oh, won't get away with another thing
Ooh-oh, so, why don't you lay in this bed tonight?
'Cause she, boy, that bitch is mine
So please, boy, don't waste no time
Real one on my side
Wow, that's just crazyI don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for 
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, babyStep up, the two of us, nobody knows us
Get in the car like, "Skrrt"
Staying up all night, order me pad thai
Then we gon' sleep, ’til noon
So, me with no makeup, you in the bathtub
Bubbles and bubbly, ooh, ooh
This is a pleasure, feel like we never act this regular
Click, click, click and post
Drip-drip-dripped in gold
Quick, quick, quick, let's go
Kiss me and take off your clothes
Imagine a world like that
Imagine a world like that
We go like up 'til I’m 'sleep on your chest
Love how my face fits so good in your neck
Why can't you imagine a world like that?
Imagine a world
Raindrops on roses and whiskers on kittens
Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so-oh-oh-ooh

I'll be thanking my dad, 'cause he's really awesome
Only wanna do it once, real bad, gon' make that last
God forbid something happens, least this song is a smash 
I've got so much love, got so much patience
I've learned from the pain 
I turned out amazing 
Say I've loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
'Cause look what I've found

And I don't disagree, no, I don't see the harm
They say, "You crazy, just leave him, he'll suffocate you"
But I wanna be in your arms
They say, "No, don't pick up the phone, let them think there's nobody home"
But I'm under your spell
'Cause when you call my heart starts to roll
I always want more
It's my heaven, my hell
We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
I know I'm gonna regret it
When you said, "Baby, I just want you to lay me down and we'll fuck the pain away"
'Cause skin on skin, I feel nothing but the burning of desire
And that's just foreplay
We're heading deep
Inside lives a voice, a voice, so quiet
But I can't hear that voice when your heart beats next to mine
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
I can't quit you
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it
Yeah, I'm gonna regret it

Share my life
Take me for what I am
Cause I'll never change
My colors for you
Take my love
I'll never ask for too much
Just all that you are
And everything that you do
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you, you, you
You see through
Right to the heart of me
You break down my walls
With the strength of your love, mmm
I never knew
Love like I've known it with you
Will a memory survive
One I can hold on to?
I don't really need to look
Very much further
I don't want to have to go
Where you don't follow
I will hold it back again
This passion inside
I can't run from myself
There's nowhere to hide
Your love I'll remember forever
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
Don't make me close one more door
I don't want to hurt anymore
Stay in my arms if you dare
Or must I imagine you there
Don't walk away from me
No, don't walk away from me
Don't you dare walk away from me
I have nothing, nothing, nothing
If I don't have you, you

Last night was crazy and today it's setting in
Did you really mean it, and could you say it again?
Oh-oh, even if you just say it over the phone
Love makes me crazy, restless, dumb and paranoid 
But I'll take a chance on us
And hope you don't destroy my heart
Just give me one guarantee
I'm the only girl you see
Whatcha you say, boy?

You're my only shorty
You're my only shorty
I'm telling you the truth
Girl, it's only you

You're my only, you're my only, you're my only

Every day and night you've got an open invitation, 
As long as I'm your one and only destination
Fly with me
I'll be your fantasy, 
You're in demand, but baby, baby, so am I
But if you're weak and try to sneak
I'll have to tell you "bye, bye"
I'm a put you on the spot
Am I your only girl or not?
What you say, boy?

See, yeah, back in the day, I was trapped in a daze
Trying to run game, but I've actually changed 
When I see you passing, the passionate flames
Simple interaction is all that I crave 
I don't need to bring in all the attention 
Girl, I need you, your love and affection
Oh yeah, baby girl, did I mention?

You're my only shorty

La Vie en roseChestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos
Everybody knows
A turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly-y
And so I'm offering this simple phra-ay-ay-ase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said, many times, many ways
Merry Christmas to you
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although its been said many times, many ways

Merry Christmas to youIt's Iggy Iggs
Soy J Balvin, man
One less, one less problem
Hey baby, even though I hate ya, I wanna love ya
And even though I can't forgive ya, I really want to
Tell me, tell me, baby
Why can't you leave me?
'Cause even though I shouldn't want it, I gotta have it
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya
I got one less, one less problem
I know you're never gonna wake up
I gotta give up
I know I shouldn't ever call back or let you come back
Every time you touch me and say you love me
I get a little bit breathless, I shouldn't want it
Head in the clouds, got no weight on my shoulders
I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya
Ahora estoy mejor sin ti, sí
I got one less problem without ya

Y ahora vienes a rogarme, ¿qué?
Iggy Iggy, too biggie to be here stressin'
I'm thinkin' I love the thought of you more than I love your presence
And the best thing now is probably for you to exit
I let you go, let you back, I finally learned my lesson
¿Recuerdas cómo de mi tu te reías?
Ahora me buscas en la calle todo el día
Recuerdas cómo a mí me maldecías?
Y ahora viajo en Jet privado con las mías

I should be wiser, and realize that I've got
One less problem without ya

I heard a couple of bad things when you were with me
I used to think it was gossip I shouldn't believe, my bae
And I was going around thinking you were my baby 
Boy, you were taking the sugar from every lady 
Oh, it went on and on and on
Yeah, it went on for way too long
Oh, baby

It's all about what you do with it

It's all about what you do with it
How does someone so sexy be so damn repulsive, baby?
It ain't about what you got
It's all about what you do with it
All of my ladies will hit me up saying 
You better open your eyes, girl
Your boy's been playing 
Oh yeah
And even though on the outside, you're looking so tasty 
Well baby boy, on the inside you're nothing but shady
Na na na na na na

YeahEasy come, easy go
That's just how you live, oh
Take, take, take it all but you never give
Should've known you was trouble from the first kiss
Had your eyes wide open
Why were they open?
I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, you did
To give me all your love is all I ever ask, cause
What you don't understand is I'd
Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Black, black, black and blue
Beat me 'til I'm numb
Tell the devil I said "hey" when you get back to where you're from
Mad boy, bad boy, that's just what you are
Yeah, you'll smile in my face and rip the brakes out my car
I gave you all I had, you tossed it in the trash
You tossed it in the trash, yes, you did
To give me all your love is all I'd ever ask, cause
What you don't understand is I'd
Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet straight through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
If my body was on fire
Ooh, you'd watch me burn down in flames
You said you loved me, you're a liar
Cause you never, ever, ever did, baby
But darlin', I'd still
Catch a grenade for ya
I'd throw my hand on a blade for ya
I'd jump in front of a train for ya
You know I'd do anything for ya
Ohh, I would go through all this pain
Take a bullet through my brain
Yes, I would die for you baby
But you won't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
You wouldn't do the same
Oh, you wouldn't do the same
Oh, no, no, noIf there's a prize for rotten judgement
I guess I've already won that
No man is worth the aggravation
That's ancient history; been there, done that
Who d'you think you're kiddin'?
He's the earth and heaven to ya
Try to keep it hidden
Honey, we can see right through ya 
Girl, you can't conceal it
We know how you feel
And who you're thinking of
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
It's too cliché
I won't say I'm in love
I thought my heart had learned its lesson
It feels so good when you start out
My head is screaming "Get a grip, girl
Unless you're dying to cry your heart out"
You keep on denying
Who you are and how you're feeling
Baby, we're not buying
Hon, we saw you hit the ceiling
Face it like a grown-up
When you gonna own up
That you got, got, got it bad?
No chance, no way
I won't say it, no, no
This scene won't play
I won't say I'm in love
You're way off base, I won't say it
Get off my case, I won't say it
Ohhh...
At least out loud
I won't say I'm in loveLondon

And this album is for sophisticated consumers of art
Three and a half hours
What I was going to say is
Goodbye for now, the show's over, bye
Thought I'd end up with Sean
But he wasn't a match
Wrote some songs about Ricky
Now I listen and laugh
Even almost got married
And for Pete, I'm so thankful
Wish I could say, "Thank you" to Malcolm
'Cause he was an angel
One taught me love
One taught me patience
And one taught me pain
Now, I'm so amazing
Say, loved and I've lost
But that's not what I see
Look what I got
Look what you taught me
And for that, I say

Spend more time with my friends
I ain't worried 'bout nothin'
Plus, I met someone else
We havin' better discussions
I know they say I move on too fast
But this one gon' last
'Cause her name is Ari
And I'm so good with that 
She taught me love 
She taught me patience 
How she handles pain 
That shit's amazing 
Said, loved and I've lost 
But that's not what I see 
Look what I've found 
No need for searching, and for that, I say
 Thank you, next

One day I'll walk down the aisle
Holding hands with my mama
I wanna shout my mom and dad who are both here tonight
Everybody make some noise for my mom and dad
Gon' make that shit last
God forbid something happens
Least this song is a smash 
I've got so much  Love

I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around
You'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere
That you can find me
On this train to Paris going nowhere
Draw the bridge behind me
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
'Cause tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh yeah, when you're, when you're gone
Oh yeah, yeah, when you're gone
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground
It's getting cold, cold
Safe from time, we'll be forever young
Never old, old
See upon a ball of fire out in space
Zooming up behind me
All the wondering on your face
Was there inside me
Don't be gone too long
'Cause you won't be there to love me
When you're gone
Don't be gone too long
Tell me who's gonna love me
When you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're, when you're gone
Oh, oh, when you're gone
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Is it really over?
Bring it back to me, bring it back to me
Don't be gone too long

ZLyrics From Snippet
Oh darlin', I’ve been working too much
I’ve been thinking bout your touch
T-Turn it on and hit me up
And I want ya...
Oh darlin', I've been in and out of town
I've been missin' you around
Won't you come and see me now
Oh darlin', I've been missing...
Wanna kiss you... miss you, gotta keep upI was there in the rain
Crying again
You said that you changed,
But you're just the same
Now don't make it worse
By trying to lie
I saw you kiss her
With my own eyes
Don't worry
I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
Boy you know you better be gone
Boy don't look so confused
Remember the truth
Now when I met you
You had nothing at all
I guess with true love
What mine is your's
And maybe it was
But it's not anymore
Don't worry I'm not angry
I'm way past that already
These are the last tears you'll see
So don't you
Don't you worry about me
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
So we believed the one that loved
Would have to hurt and lie
So we don't make the same mistakes
The problem isn't mine
I know what to do, boy
To get over you
I'm gonna send you away
But I'm not ready so
Just get out of my face
Stop standing in my way
I'm going out to say what?
I'm ready
I'm gonna get out my suitcase and
Get out of this place and
I'm going somewhere and
Get you out of my hair
I'm gonna have fun
Baby be so gone
And when I get back
You know you better be gone
You better be gone
You better be gone
You better be goneOh yeah

Come on girls
Do you believe in love?
Cause I got something to say about it
And it goes something like this
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
You don't need diamond rings
Or eighteen karat gold
Fancy cars that go very fast
You know they never last, no no
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come down
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Long stem roses are the way to your heart
But he needs to start with your head
Satin sheets are very romantic
What happens when you're not there?
You deserve the best in life
So if the time isn't right, then move on
Second best is never enough
You'll do much better, baby, on your own
Don't go for second best, baby
Put your love to the test
You know, you know, you've got to
Make him express how he feels
And maybe then you'll know your love is real
Express yourself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey, hey, hey, hey
So if you want it right now, make him show you how
Express what he's got, oh baby, ready or not
And when you're gone he might regret it
Think about the love he once had
Try to carry on, but he just won't get it
He'll be back on his knees
To express himself
You've got to make him express himself
Hey hey
What you need is a big strong hand
To lift you to your higher ground
Make you feel like a queen on a throne
Make him love you till you can't come downYou, you love it how I move you
Love it how I touch you, my one
When all is said and done

And I feel it after midnight
Feelin' that you can't fight, my one

Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need

Put it all together, baby, we could be alright 
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Hey, I really love you, I really love you, oh
And I'll never let you go
 Know
 I'm never gonna change
 I'm always gonna stay
 I'm right there
 Ooh
 And you care, babyHere's the thing
You're in love with a version of a person that you've created in your head
That you are trying to but cannot fix
Uh, the only person you can fix is yourself
I love you, this has gone on way too long
Enough is enough
I'm two blocks away, I'm coming over
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seein' what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Fallin', fallin', but I never thought you'd leave me
Fallin', fallin', needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't buddin'
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
Maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you 
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you
Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, youSaid, oh baby

But I don't care, yeah  Let's go
 With your girlfriend
 'Cause I'm bored
Girlfriend, baby
With your girlfriend, baby
Ooh yeah, yeah
With your girlfriendI thought that I was a hopeless romantic
I thought that I was a hopeless romantic
I really thought that I'd be like my grandparents
I thought that I was a hopeless romanticJust for now, just for now, just for now
Just for now, just for now, just for now
How did you know? It's what I always wanted
Could never have too many of these
Will you quit kicking me under the table
I'm trying, will somebody make her shut up about it?
Can we settle down please?
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
Bite tongue, deep breaths
Count to ten, nod your head
I think something is burning
Now you've ruined the whole thing
Muffle the smoke alarm
Whoever put on this music had better quick, sharp, remove it
Pour me another. Oh, don't wag your finger at me
It's that time of year
Leave all our hopelessnesses aside
Tears stop right here
I know we've all had a bumpy ride
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of here
Get me out of...

London, let me hear y'all make some noise
 WooSo the news is out about Sam & Cat. I felt it wasn’t my place to make any sort of announcement so I kept quiet until now. I want to thank Nickelodeon for making a childhood dream of mine come true, for being a family to me, for being so accommodating and supportive of my multitasking with my music career, and for of course introducing me to many of my fans however many years ago. I want to thank Dan Schneider for allowing me to play such a special, beautiful character who I hid behind for so long. What I mean by that is when I was younger, people loved Cat so much I used to pretend to be more like her. It took me a long time to be brave enough to separate myself and show people how different we actually are…. I think that’s honestly because I admire her so much. Her appreciation for life and everybody she encounters. Her passion and genuine excitement for the little things that most people dread like school projects and work. She always saw negative obstacles as opportunities to make things good
I will always hold Cat near and dear to my heart and appreciate her help in my personal growth from teenager to adult. I know she seems like a simple, daft character  but she played such a huge part in my life I just wanted to express my appreciation for her and share some of the things I love most about her. I think a lot of people could take a page out of her book…… she wouldn’t judge anybody by their appearance…. she believed the best in people…. she wasn’t afraid of anything or anybody…. she never let people’s judgements hold her back from doing what she wanted, acting how she wanted, dressing how she wanted wanted, dying her hair however she wanted… she never held back her enthusiasm or joy for fear of appearing some sort of way or for fear of jinxing the good that is real 
One of my favorite things about Cat was that she never lost her sense of wonder. As we grow up we become more and more jaded and fearful of how we come across. We hold back a little more, protect ourselves a little more and although Cat goes through the same ridicule as anybody else does growing up, she never changed or lost her childlike wonder. To me that’s the bravest, most special thing about her. She actually reminds me a lot of Frankie in that way
So I know a lot of people will think this is a lot for some ‘dumb’ kids show character . . . . but to me she is actually a lot smarter, stronger and braver than all the rest of us
Hopefully we’ll find out one day if Cat & Robbie ever got married. If I had any say in the story from here on out I’d make sure they were happily married with sweet, eccentric, Jewish, artificially red headed babies. Cat would constantly find herself reminding Aunt Sam to leave the butter sock and other dangerous weapons out of the house. They’d live down the street from Jade and Beck, also happily married with purple and black haired, pale, grungy, beautiful, goth babies. :)
Thank you to the cast and crew who I spent almost every day with for a good 4 or 5 years. Thanks for lighting us beautifully, shooting us beautifully, making the most incredible props, yelling at us when we were running late to set, keeping us on track and most of all for making it such a positive work environment. The guys behind the scenes couldn’t have been more pleasant or hard working and I appreciate them for that so much. I can’t imagine that there is a more pleasant or professional crew in Hollywood
Thank you from the bottom of my heart to a true friend of mine, Dan Schneider. I will never take these memories or lessons learned for granted
Lastly, thank you to my fans who have been with me since all of this started… you are the most loyal, dedicated and continuously loving supporters I could ever imagine. We’ve been through so much and you are still here… and we’ve got a long way to go. :) Thank you for believing in me, accepting me and loving me. I love you foreverAcross the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now

And for you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms and holding my heart

Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright

Mao, let's goI'd like to say we gave it a try
I'd like to blame it all on life
Maybe we just weren't right
But that's a lie, that's a lie
And we can deny it as much as we want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is, everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough
So close to being in love
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was
But almost is never enough
If I could change the world overnight
There'd be no such thing as goodbye
You'd be standing right where you were
And we'd get the chance we deserve, oh
Try to deny it as much as you want
But in time our feelings will show
'Cause sooner or later we'll wonder why we gave up
The truth is everyone knows
Almost, almost is never enough 
So close to being in love 
If I would have known that you wanted me the way I wanted you
Then maybe we wouldn't be two worlds apart
But right here in each others arms
And we almost, we almost knew what love was 
But almost is never enoughI was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should’ve done you better
'Cause you don’t want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don’t deserve it
I know I don’t deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I’ll swear I’ll make it worth it
Can’t you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you

Just keep breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', sing
Breathin' and breathin'
And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin', oh
Sometimes it's hard to find
Find my way up into the clouds
Tune it out, they can be so loud
You remind me of a time
When things weren't so complicated
All I need is to see your face
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'
I know that all this shit's fabricated, ooh
Time goes by and I can't control my mind
Don't know what else to try, but you tell me every time

Okay, this, this, this for my number one girl who got the top spot title
Spent a hour in the bathroom, walked out looking like a model
God, doing what you do, got me right there with Apollo on the moon
Who needs genies in a bottle, girl, if they already got you?
Boy, you make me feel so lucky
Finally the stars align
Never has it been so easy to be in love
And to give you this heart of mine
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How could this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really love you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there
You got it, you got it, babe
You got it, you got it, baby
And I get butterflies, just thinking
About you boy, you’re on my mind
Sometimes I catch myself daydreaming
Lost in in your eyes and I lose all track of time
You know what I need
I know what you like
Put it all together, baby, we could be alright
How can this be wrong when it feels so right?
Yeah, I really need you
I really love you, oh
And I’ll never let you go
You should know I’m never gonna change
I’m always gonna stay
You call for me, I’m right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right there
Now, if all fell through, would you catch me before the pavement?
If my Benz turned back to Public Transportation, would you still be at home for me with the candles waiting
And get my mind back adjacent to the place of a young visionary?
A player too, you know I have some girls missionary
My black book and numbers thicker than the dictionary and Bible
I got it recycled
I love and I like you
Five course meals, even though you don’t mind a drive-thru
That’s why I got you
And I’ll never let you go, I got you
You should know I’m never gonna change 
I’m always gonna stay 
You call for me, I’m right there 
Right there 
'Cause you listen and you care
You’re so different
No one compares
And if you never change, I’m gonna stay right there
I’ll always be right thereEnnuí mon amí
I know the problem look colossal
But if you can see me
How bad can things be?
What do you do
When the barrel that carries you
Suddenly harries you
Stick together
What do you do when the bolt in the wood parts
Turn into no good parts
Stick together
Stay, stay sag an droop an drag
An rivets wear an tearsome
But we can still repair some
Now you try
My oh my
What should you do when you stuck on the drain
You should sing this refrain, stick together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy
Now we pour a square
There there
Where?
There
What should you do when your favorite comes
Needing repairs
Sing together
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushing fingy
Spiffy riffy, fix in jiffy
Make mistakes
For heavens sakes
We all commit the past friends
Let's fix that  nose friend
And a whole lot of doing
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Easy peasy bottle squeezy
Dingy dingy brushy flingy
Easy peasy bottle squeezy...

And your lack of love leaves me paranoid
Oh, oh, and now, how the hell am I supposed to win
When you wear me out and you spread me thin
Oh, oh
It’s like you’re only here to help yourself
Or only keep me sweet to build your wealth
Unfortunate for you, my eyes see clear
And then the second it goes wrong
And darling, you’ll be packed up and be gone
Is it time I just let go?
Cause I can’t do this on my own
Cause it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And all I ever did was love
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right
And I was never good enough
And it ain’t right, no it ain’t right

Started strong without a care
And as time went on you left me bare

I jumped overboard
I would have finished last
So I, I’m shoving you down
There’s nothing I need
When you’re around

I can't promise you how I'll react
But all I can say is at least I'll wait for you
Lately, I've been on a roller coaster
Tryna get a hold of my emotions
But all that I know is I need you close
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
Said, I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so 
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot 
So, sorry that I think I'm not enough 
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish 
After all this damage, I can't help it 
But what you can trust is I need your touch
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard

Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Love it when we make up 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Energy and attitude don't really coincide
Stayin' mad all day so we can let it out tonight
Bring you to the bed where we can really make it right
Sorry-in-a-box so when it pops 
Said I love it when we make 
So promise me that when you kiss my lips, you'll make it stick
That's the way to shut me up after an argument
No eyeliner on, but looking at you is the fix

Go 'head, ruin my makeup 
Love it when we 
Go 'head, ruin my makeup

Go ahead, ruin my makeup, let's go
 YuhOh woah, hey, yeah
Looking in your eyes makes me wonder how
I got so much time with you and there's more around
I know all the competition that's after you
But I get to thinking, is this too good to be true?
That we're living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, it's hard to believe
That the love you have inside is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't
As I'm laying down with you every night
It still gets to me that you remain by my side
I ain't saying that I'm not deserving of you
But I was dreaming bigger than I ever knew
I wished for living in a fairy tale, no malice, and no lies
Baby, ooh, hard to believe, bae
That the love you have is on-, is only mine
That's how I know
I can't be your only one
No, I can't be your only one
'Cause you look twice as good as anyone I ever met
And your love is three times better
How could anyone forget?
No, I can't, baby

Love baby, real love, love, baby we've found

Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

And oh, I gotta keep, keep on breathin'
Just keep breathin' and breathin' and breathin' and breathin'

All I need is to see your face
Feel my blood runnin', swear the sky's fallin'

Yeah
Painted a picture, I thought I knew you well
I got a habit of seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, I said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel
My imagination's too creative
They see demon, I see angel, angel , angel
Without the halo, wingless angel
Falling, falling, but I never thought you'd leave me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
I thought you were the one
But it was all in my head
It was all in my head 
Yeah, look at you , boy, I invented you
Your Gucci tennis shoes, runnin' from your issues
Cardio good for the heart 
I figured we could work it out, hmm
Painted a picture; I thought I drew you well
I had a vision, seeing what isn't there
Caught in the moment, tangled up in your sheets
When you broke my heart, said you only wanted half of me
My imagination's too creative
They see Cain and I see Abel , Abel , Abel
I know you're able, willin' and able
Falling, falling, but I thought that you would need me
Falling, falling, needed something to believe in, oh
Hmm, I thought that you were the one
But it was all in my—
Painted a picture
Wanted you to grow, but, boy, you wasn't budding
Everything you are made you everything you aren't
I saw your potential without seein' credentials
So maybe that's the issue 
Said maybe that's the issue, ah
Can't hold that shit against you, ah
Guess I did it to myself, yeah
Thought you were somebody else, you
Thought you were somebody else, you 
Thought you were somebody else, you
YeahYou can feel it, feel it
They say my system is overloaded
I'm too much in my head, did you notice? Yeah, yeah
My body's here on Earth, but I'm floatin'
Disconnected, so sometimes, I feel frozen and alone
This is for everybody
Baby, you gotta take care of your body 
Ain't no time to deny it, that is why we talking about it
Yeah, we talking about it
To deal with it, don't try to get by it
Ain't no time to deny it
So we 
Want you to get better 
My life is so controlled by the what-ifs
Is there anybody else whose mind does this? Oh woah, yeah
Is there such a ladder to get above this?
Maybe I should ground myself where the mud is
Before I'm gone
Ooh baby, yeah 
Oh yeah, come on 
Ooh yeah 
Say yeah 
You can work your way to the top
New York, put one hand up, come on
Just know that there’s up and downs and there's drops
Actually, put the little lights on your phones, come on
Unfollow fear and just say "You are blocked"
 Yuh
Just know there is so much room at the top
 Shee
Oh, oh, oh
Here's one thing you can trust 
It take you and me to make us 
One of those days you had enough 
I'll be there 
'Cause if it ain't one thing, it's another 
When you need someone to pull you out the bubble 
I'll be right there just to hug you 
I'll be there 
Where are you? Are you home? 
Call me right on the phone 
I'll be there, there
I don't care who is gone 
You shouldn't be alone 
I'll be there , there
You can work your way to the topI was a liar
I gave in to the fire
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Feel like a failure
'Cause I know that I failed you
I should’ve done you better
'Cause you don’t want a liar
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
Baby, I don’t care if you got her in your heart
All I really care is you wake up in my arms
One last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
I don’t deserve it
I know I don’t deserve it
But stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it
Can’t you forgive me?
At least just temporarily
I know that this is my fault
I should have been more careful
And I know, and I know, and I know she gives you everything
But boy, I couldn’t give it to you
And I know, and I know, and I know that you got everything
But I got nothing here without you, baby
So one last time
I need to be the one who takes you home
One more time
I promise after that, I’ll let you go
I know I should’ve fought it
At least I’m being honest
Please stay with me a minute
I swear I’ll make it worth it, yeahNow you finally tell me how you feel
Guess your words just came a little too late
All the drama, boy, it's overkill
Don't be mad at me 'cause you've been replaced
Know your place, sing
But if you woulda manned up
Put your hand up, stand up
Tell me how you really felt
Then maybe it'd be different
If you spoke, I would've listened
But now, I'm with somebody else
And he loves me too much for me to mess this up
And it sucks to be all in your head
Wondering where this thing could go, boy
What we could have been
If you would've shown your way back then, yeah
Boy, you gotta 
Boy, you shoulda 
But you didn’t know, so
Now you'll never know, you'll never know
Said, boy, you could've told me, told me
Boy, you could've let me know
Boy, you could've been there for me
Now you'll never know, you'll never know, yeah'Cause if you want to keep me

Mmmhmm, like "I before E, except after C"
And why two plus two makes four
Now, now, now I'm gonna teach you all about love, boy
Sit yourself down, take a seat

But without the roots of love every day, boy
Your education ain't complete
Te-te-te-teacher's gonna show you how to get an "A" 
Spell "me" and "you" and add the two
Listen to me, baby, that's all you gotta do

That's how easy love can be
That's how easy love can be
Sing a simple melody

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon boy
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it, shake it, baby
Shake it shake it, baby
1, 2, 3, baby

Do-re-mi, baby
That's how easy love can be

It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
One of these days
You'll miss your train and come stay with me
We'll have drinks and talk about things
And any excuse to stay awake with you
And you'd sleep here, I'd sleep there
But then the heating may be down again
We'd be good, we'd be great together
Why'd you have to be so cute?
It's impossible to ignore you, ah
Why must you make me laugh so much?
It's bad enough we get along so well
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
Just say goodnight and go
Oh, oh, oh
I know how you want it, baby, just like this
Know you're thinkin' 'bout it, baby, just one kiss
While you're lookin' at 'em, baby, read my lips
I know what you want, but you can't have this
Wanna say goodnight
Honey, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Baby, say goodnight and go
Wanna say goodnight
Say goodnight and go

Don't need permission
Made my decision to test my limits
'Cause it's my business, God as my witness
Start what I finished
Don't need no hold up
Taking control of this kind of moment
I'm locked and loaded
Completely focused, my mind is open
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout
Nothing to prove and
I'm bulletproof and
Know what I'm doing
The way we're movin' like introducing
Us to a new thing
I wanna savor, save it for later
The taste of flavor, 'cause I'm a taker
'Cause I'm a giver, it's only nature
I live for danger
All that you got, skin to skin, oh my God
Don't ya stop, boy
Somethin' 'bout you makes me feel like a dangerous woman
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
Makes me wanna do things that I shouldn't
Somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout, somethin' 'bout you
