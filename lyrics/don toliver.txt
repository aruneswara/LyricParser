Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I havеn't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?
Am I overzealous? But I know the feeling, and I'm never wrong

But when I wake up alone, 'lone, 'lone
I just break out my phone, phone, phone
Thinkin' I could make this many songs 'bout a lady
When I haven't met her, but she on me heavy, on my cerebellum
If I say I love her, am I wrong? Am I crazy?

That's way too reckless , I'd get too jealous
Could she be from the East or overseas? 
I learned my lesson, I'm way too Western
Could she be my favorite ethnicity? 
I'm just undressing all of the sections of my thoughts 
Thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' too hard
Thinkin' too hard, ha, but I really wanna know

Blunt lit in my face 
Diamonds in my teeth
Pick, um, the VVS
She ain't really got no meaning, uh
In a fast car, I'm speeding, uh
And I can't wait for no red light 
If I'm chasing this green 
I need more M's than B's 
Sheck and Don on a different time and payment
All my cars from Europe, his car from Avis
Every day I wake up, new whips hit the pavement
I had to watch my living, I don't know no limits at all, all, all
I get a lil' impatient 
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist 
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit

And oh, and that is over
You will be in love
And oh, and that is over
You will be in love
Can’t tell me where I done been
You bet your stuff, but your conscience been
I left all my weight back at my town, ever since
I never looked back home, but all that time that I spent
I’m taking it back, I wanna live it again
But in the back of mind, this shit was hard as it get
And know the Young Donny can’t waste time
Can't be mad for two bits for your face tat
I can feel your vibrations like that FaceTime
And you both stand in my way, you know I’m taking mine
I went to close when, 'cause when I ride them A's
Just like it’s training day, thank god I made the way
I got the drugs laying out on a rainy day
Your texts emotional, we 'bout drop top anyway
Oh, and that is over
And you will be in love
I done popped a couple pills, got the young boys trippin’ 
Whipped a Cadillac like a nigga steady whippin’
Rolls Royce, like I’m shy, got two bitches in the kitchen
1962 and I got gold prints on it
1942 I got a bad bitch rollin'
Riding down the street, we about to make a moment
Straight low G, got all over the codeine
I hear them talking, but they ain’t coming closer
My brims talk but know my whip, but I roll it like
My Benz' rollin' up, all her friends know what’s up
We VIP so we just walk right into the club
All of this money got me chasing dreams
I think that I can go out again soon as I see
I never been the kind to let someone hold me down
You'd probably think I’d never make it, just look at me now
I done popped a couple pills, got the young boys trippin’ 
Whipped a Cadillac like a nigga steady whippin’
Rolls Royce, like I'm  got two bitches in the kitchen—Updated: November 10th, 2020

We ain't bound to fall, yeah, yeah, yeahLet me tell you about a story about somethin' never told
Tried to take my brother's life, he was twenty-two years old
Woke up to gunshot, I skipped the duck and roll
I grabbed my burner 
Then went straight up out the door
I saw my brother on the ground but I knew he wasn't gone 
I saw blood all on the ground but I knew he wasn't gone 
He's strong, young man strong
You gotta be strong, be strong
Do I know you? No, I don't
I can't put trust in your hands 
I got money, I got bitches, I put trust in my bands 
Me and bro went up to stay, we caught some whips in our bag
Comin' fast down thе highway  I patrol on her ass
I ain't trippin' on these bitchеs, I ain't trip 
She can come but she know I play with them chickens 
Niggas pussy, never have me in their mentions 
I'm out of space, I'm in a whole 'nother dimension 
So farewell, hoe
You wishin' well, hoe 
I made sacrifices, I will never speak and tell though 
They want me in a hellhole 
I ain't goin', hell no 
I feel like I'm JJ, with my nigga, rock the shell  
I done pushed the rock but I swerve people's elbow 
No face, case 'cause I'm OJ with the  
Trappin' out the , boy I'm chasin' all the pesos
I miss my ole lady, daddy sent her back to Mexico 
Let me tell you about a story about somethin' never told
Tried to take my brother's life, he was twenty-two years old
Woke up to gunshot, I skipped the duck and roll
I grabbed my burner 
Then went straight up out the door

I saw blood all on the ground but I knew he wasn't gone 
He's strong, young man strong

Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin'-Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist 
I am-I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
I-I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride 
Dumpin' ashes on your thigh 
You might be ready-ready for surprise, oh
I get a lil' impatient 
Who-Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin'-Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist 
I am-I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
I'm in my spaceship-spaceship , getting that facelift-facelift 
LA daytrip, I'm eating them rib tips-rib tips
Call up the ref, I'm balling, pouring it, so we're falling
Twenty-five hundred for the cardigan, Saint Laurent, my dawgs in
I get a little impatient
Who-Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist
I am-I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
It's the new age flex, hoppin' out of the jet
Spend a ticket on Rolex, plus the ice on your neck
Bust it down and collect, send that money through text
You can hit me-hit me on my phone, you can call me direct
I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride
Dumpin' ashes on your thigh 
You might be ready-ready for surprise, oh
Yeah, hotbox my SUV , nobody can breathe 
I ain't never fear a thing
Yeah, hotbox my SUV , nobody can breathe 
I ain't never fear a thing
Yeah, hotbox my SUV , nobody can breathe 
I ain't never fear a thing , baby, in your dreams 
Sheck Wes, fear don't sleep 
Air Force 1s-Air Force 1s, no crease 
Someone arrest-Someone arrest my jeans 
Blunt lit-Blunt lit in my face 
Diamonds in my teeth
Pick, um, the VVS
She ain't really got no meaning, uh
In a fast car, I'm speeding, uh
And I can't-I can't wait for no red light 
If I'm-If I'm chasing this green 
I need more M's than B's 
Sheck and Don on a different time and payment
All my cars from Europe, his car from Avis
Every day I wake up, new whips hit the pavement
I had to watch my living, I don't know no limits at all, all, all
I get a lil' impatient 
Who steady copped the keys to my spaceship?
Sellin' all Alicia Keys, she on my playlist 
I am not receiving, you know I don't take shit
I, I, I spilled lean all in my ride 
Lean all in my ride
Lean all in my ride
