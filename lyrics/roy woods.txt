I hope you know it' alright, I don't mind
Shawty, show me your thighs, don't be shy, baby
Don’t ride, I’ll lotion you down
Or would you rather oil me?
It’s smoother when you ride
Fall in my arms girl wake up to me
Let's sleep with no clothes again
Am I talking through you as you're starin' through me
What's with all our lies again?
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
Put me to sleep with your voice, babe
Don't leave me with the choice, babe
Oh please, I don't need no extra love off of you
You can't run outta love
There is nothin' that's too much
Can you take me real far? Take me the whole way, baby
Grab my hands, don't lose faith, I have so much in you
I know when to give you space
'Cause I know, know, know that I mess up
Got you feelin' like you're 'bout throw a left hook
I throw my hook into your sea while it's floodin' my bed
They have done so much to me, but can't throw off my head
I'm so sorry that you didn't see the love I have
Oh well, guess we're better off
Only the thoughts confuse all the months
Know I was late showin' up to prom, but I show you later
Surprise in a box
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
But this time I wanna know why, I can't sleep without you to my right
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much
I'm sorry for so much, I'm sorry for so much

Went ghost, now you calling me Casper
Could it be, that it's not serious to me
I stay with these
Cause it hurt me way more to leave
Cutting ties after hot sex in the bathroom
Now that we're over I won't look at you
Feelings in my stomach like it's high school
I know there are other niggas looking at you
But you can't diss me on my set
You cuss me 'bout my text
Said it received, but not read
20 minutes later a paragraph or two
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
I was only tryin' to love you
Love you
I was only tryin' to love you

Falling in love with women, I don't know what I see in 'em
More times I be lonely so I don't know what I be feeling
Gotta do more, say less, how I'm living
Don't talk no more cause I know what you doing
Got mans to the side but you say you're alone
Money on sight now your eyes on gold
Can't take your ass shopping, tripping on Jimmy Choo's
Yeah, said you gonna stay over for the night, but you got me waiting
Barely said a thing, got me here alone without conversation, yeah

While we're turned up at La Vie
I'm the quarterback, watch her get back as I throw my D
I got molly, I got weed, off that lean and Hennessy
"I wanna go home" if you're not built for this
Then there's the exit, my G
When I was on stage bitches laughed at me
Seven years later all their sisters listen to me
Now they catch feelings
Don't you dare make noise up in my building now 
Who you gonna talk to when I'm flying out?
Faded and gone, and I'm smoking the strong
You know what I want I'm hitting that good good
All that she want is that good wood
Though I know that you like it in your belly you feel
Feel like you should hit this
Tell us this money is love
Go to the watch and you know how these females all go
This not the time to act tough

I would not have known it, more than dollars when I show it
Don't you ever try my lady, I pull up faster than police
You're getting drunk, I can notice
Our side was the focus for the scene but don't look like it

There's much problems in my ends
Bands, run 'em in my hands
All this white-white all up in our hands
You see me fightin' demons in my head
Let niggas know I'm throwin' hands first
She only call me when she want the work
First class ticket in the Birkin
Young nigga take care of these birds
Young nigga get rid of the work
Young nigga get rich off a bird
Young nigga got lesson to learn
Young nigga, go make what you earn, uh
Bitch, I'm a hunnid percent
Split up the bag like a motherfuckin' bagel
Lil' bitch, I live like a king
All of these Perkys is boostin' my ego
Them demons, they pull up on sight
Your bitch sneak out of the house every night
And like a lil' virgin, my circle be tight
Got two bad bitches, Shakira and J.LoMom can't pay the bills, that's what he take for
Auntie smoke that shit, that's what he slang for
She just needs a man, what she prays for
My demons in the can need it paid in full
They say your hair is power, so my braids long
We kill ourselves while they make us pay for it
They divide and separate, make us slave for it
Free game to the youth, that's what I'm here for
So hard, but he still made it out of B-More
So hard, but he still made it out of Georgia
So hard, but he still made it out of Chi-Town
So hard, but we still made it out of my town
Oh, oh
And you know I'm always for that street shit
Thanks for tellin' me I'll never be shit
They don't care 'cause they don't know 'bout street shit
And when I die make sure you tell em' I ain't quit
When I die, let them know what we did 
When I die, when I die
When I die, let them know what we did
Know what we did
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Let 'em know what we did, did
But you always gotta have it always
Don't matter who say, don't matter who say
I left my city, feel like I just split ways
Said I won't be back for a while, should've seen her face
What can I say? I can't even leave LA
Oh, why they let the people down for? 
We paying for our death and our downfall
All of them secrets they didn't want you know
Oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah, oh woah
And you know I'm always for that street shit
Thanks for tellin' me I'll never be shit
They don't care 'cause they don't know 'bout street shit
And when I die make sure you tell em' I ain't quit
When I die, let them know what we did 
When I die, when I dieTracklist:

Said she miss me for so long
Before they got down, it was never like this
Not in the city, that's how I do it
All the baddie’s still fine, and the bodies all thick
I don't know what I'mma do with 'em
She know that she bad but she hit it on the low
You let 'em mistreat you
Who would’ve known that me and her get along
Now you know what the beast do
I'mma tell you one time, in my room, take off your thong
Now that you’ve reached the six side
She ain't tryna bust a dab, not try me on the low
She keep calling me over

I've been goin' through it from the- 
Hahaha, Nick, you're stupid 
I've been goin' through it from the git
I've been flyin' private on the jet
Fifty bands, spend the check on my wrist
If I grab your ho, find her on my bed
Said she wanna come and fly with me
I know it'll make your girlfriend go insane 
Ridin' in a Rari, not a Range 
The lifestyle in Dubai must be insane 
And my pocket got a lotto on my wrist
All this money making got me feeling breathless
Bitch you know I drip, I spend a lot on clothes
Hit a dapper then I need a DJ 
I don't want no conversation when I'm back, rose
He don't love me, he complainin' when I have you locked in
No captions, if you move I'll come on
Said she wanna come and fly with me
I know it'll make your girlfriend go insane 
Ridin' in a Rari not a Range 
The lifestyle in Dubai must be insane 
I've been goin' through it from the git
I've been flyin' private on the jet
Fifty bands, spend the check on my wrist
If I grab your ho, find her on my bed
I got all these niggas hittin' licks
But I told you, fuck around, it'll make you hop the fence 
 
I got my soldiers and diamonds while walking 
My nigga in and out the chop, he with the gang
You didn't expect me to make it out the gang
I got twenty bitches running 'round my office
Shawty drink tequila while feeling naucious 
I don't want no problems, I just want the profit
So much politics, it got me moving cautious
I've been goin' through it from the git
I've been flyin' private on the jet
Fifty bands, spend the check on my wrist
If I grab your ho, find her on my bed
Said she wanna come and fly with me
I know it'll make your girlfriend go insane 
Ridin' in a Rari, not a Range 
The lifestyle in Dubai must be insane All of your love's one kiss away
