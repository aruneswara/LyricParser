One, one, one, one, one
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I 
One: Don't pick up the phone 
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone 
Two: Don't let him in 
You'll have to kick him out again

I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
You're gettin' over himIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Scared to be lonely
Eh, eh, scared to be lonelyIf you don't wanna see me
Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Don't start now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up , don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Don't start caring about me now 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away 
Up, up
Don't come out, out, out
Don't show up, up, up
Walk away, walk away, ohYou call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye

Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

아직 너를
못 떠나고 뭘 하고 있는 건지

Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby

But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home 
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Oh no , I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?Falling into you, baby

I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in our eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby

I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitating3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper, but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout youIt's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
I'm sure if there's something that I can't find the words to say
I know that there will be a man around to save the day
And that was sarcasm, in case you needed it mansplained
I should've stuck to ballet 
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
If you're offended by this song
You're clearly doing something wrong
If you're offended by this song
Then you're probably saying
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
When will we stop saying things
'Cause they're all listening?
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be
Boys will be, boys will be boys
But girls will be womenIn the beginning, God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that He might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Don't matter what's written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun starts rising
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?Over and over
Waves of frightening feelings
Floating, weightless, I'm willing
My will keeps bending and breaking, honey
Hold me, trust me
Let me ride in your love all night, babe
Hold me, touch me
I wanna die in your love all night, babe
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Oh, now everything's vivid, vivid
Torture tempted with pleasure
I'm reckless, tangled, suspended
You want it all, nothing's wasted, woman
Hold me, trust me
You know you can hide in my arms all night now
Hold me, trust me
I'm gonna ride in your love all night
I'm
Lost in your light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby 
Let's get lost in the light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Midnight, your eyes
Bitter wine, conversations
You and me, some money, babe
I don't need a paycheck 
One taste and I'm hooked on it
Don't lie, I know you want it
I'm addicted to your light
Lost in your light, baby
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, baby 
I wanna stay right here all night, baby
Let's get lost in the light, babyYeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to 
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when you're going down, I get so up 
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other 
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist 
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please , come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad 
We drive each other mad 
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
Yeah, we don't know how to talk 
But damn, we know how to fuck
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad 
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head 
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please , come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed 
It's bad 
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bedFuture
You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game

I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house 
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out

You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste
I know you're dying trying to figure me out

I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

I can't believe, I can't believe
I'm not afraid anymore
Goddamn, you got me in love again

Again Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check? 
Peut-être qu'avec du temps, ça partira
Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtant, je ne m'y vois pas
Comme un médicament, moi, je suis rien sans toi
Et je sais quе j'essaie, que jе perds du temps dans tes bras
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?

La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit 
Mon cœur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix

But I never wanna fall again, ah

Pero contigo es todo o na'

You're deep in the water, yeah, you're drownin' us
You question my love like it's not enough

You got me working up an appetite-tite
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice

You got me, you got me losin' all my coolFatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
My heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last danceI'm young for tonight, it's all under my control
I won't hesitate, it's my turn to make that call
I just want a touch, I ain't here for love no more
Okay, yeah
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Some people do, but some, they just like to talk, okay
Some shoot the breeze, but some like to leave a mark, okay
Some need the light, and some people like the dark
Okay, yeah
I won't stop, nah, no
Guess what?
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Ride a golden light
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
I'll dance if I want to
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gimme release, keep the drugs
Gimme relief, keep the love
Just gimme a piece of that, one piece of that
Give it to me, don't judge
Just give it to me, no heart
No second degree tonight, run free tonight
I'll dance if I want to
Ah-ooh
My body, my body, my body 
Yeah 
My body, my body, my body
Eh la, eh la, it's my body
Gonna dance if I want to, want to
Gonna dance if I want to, want to Maybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes 
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight

Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
Now we know what's in the wild
Used to think that this love was Heaven sent
How did we get lost? Can't get back again
Tell me, is there light on the outside?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Used to walk around your apartment
Nothing but a smile on me
But tonight I'm so self conscious
Isn't it so clear to see?
Nothing's ever perfect in Paradise
Don't know what it's worth 'til you pay the price
When you bite your tongue does it draw blood?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it’s hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
This Garden of Eden?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me, honey?
I have cried for you, and I'll ride for you
I would die for you, but would you do that for me?
Tell the truth, what you wanna do
Is it me and you?
Are you with me?
So are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Are we leaving this Garden of Eden?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
This garden of Eden
Remember when we swam in the ocean?
Now we know what's deep inside
Remember when we ran in the open?
So are we leaving?
Are we leaving?
Now I know what I know
But it's hard to find the meaning
Where do we go?
'Cause we don't believe in this Garden of Eden
This garden of EdenI was five, and he was six
We rode on horses made of sticks
He wore black and I wore white
He would always win the fight
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
Seasons came and changed the time
When I grew up, I called him mine
He would always laugh and say
"Remember when we used to play"
Bang bang
I shot you down
Bang bang
You hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
I used to shoot you down
Music played and people sang
Just for me the church bells rang
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Now he's gone, I don't know why
And 'til this day, I sometimes cry
He didn't even say goodbye
He didn't take the time to lie
Bang bang
He shot me down
Bang bang
I hit the ground
Bang bang
That awful sound
Bang bang
My baby shot me down
Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
My baby shot me downKnow you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care

Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeahUp and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Why are you blamin' me for all your insecurities?
I never did anything, but you closed the door
Slammed shut on me
Somethin' a little bit bitter that should've been sweet
I won't compete
You're like a king with a crown lookin' down
Hopin' I won't eat
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Remember what it felt like to start the climb
I'm just like you
Maybe you'll better with time and we'll leave it behind
There's room for two
You should've never done somethin' like that to someone
You can't undo
Thought you were under the radar
But under the chaos, I see through
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
I'm hopin' one day you will change
See, everyone ain't the same
We're more than machines
You saw a spark where there wasn't a flame
And you barely remember my name
Do you feel complete?
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for you
Up and down, it all comes back around
Push and shove, do you feel better now?
Knock, knock, knock, you'll come tumblin' down
Karma's got a kiss for youAll of these highs
And all of these lows
Don't keep me company
I've been breathing you in
And drinking you down
You're the only remedy
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Losing my mind
Dreaming I'll find
Another kind of love
But this blood in my veins
And the thought of your taste
No, I can't give it up
So look at my face
I'm not running away
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Say you're gonna hold my head up
Say you're gonna break my fall
Say you're gonna stay forever
Baby, this is all I want
Swear I'm gonna hold your head up
Swear I'm gonna break your fall
Swear we're gonna last forever
Baby, this is all I want
'Cause all my bones
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your love
Oh, my lungs
Are begging me to beg for you
Begging me to beg for your loveYou don't have to be so cautious if you practise what you preach
Counting up the stacks on the counter, a fucking disease
Don't ask me to be righteous if you practise what you teach
Counting all your blessings the second you're down on your knees
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high
Keep my head under the water, pride buried in my chest
Not counting all the minutes, the seconds, not holdin' my breath
Now sinking from the surface, swimming in my lungs
Losing all my vision, religion, I'm holding my tongue
So why, why
Don't we get a little high, high?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, high
Don't wanna pay attention to the writing on the wall
Painted with aggression, and dripping when you call
Not gonna learn my lesson, am I running out of time?
So, why, why, why?
Don't we get a little, get a little
Don't we get a little high
Get a little high, highLast night, my fantasies become oh-so-true
You said you wanted me as much as I want you
If I said it hadn't crossed my mind
Then, oh baby, I'd be lying
It just got complicated, I don't know what to do
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know
'Cause I really like that, that, that, when you go
And I know it's not real, but the way that I feel
I just need to know

It's time you started listening, don't think you can hear me
'Cause if you really wanna go right 'round
Time is tickin', we gotta leave now
Time is tickin', we gotta leave town tonight
Hey
Can I get it like that, that, that? Let me know

I'm levitating Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talking
Something deep down in my soul said, "cry girl"
When I saw you and that girl walking out
Ooh
I would rather, I would rather go blind, boy
Than to see you walk away from me child and all
I was just, I was just
I was just sitting here thinking
Of your kiss and your warm embrace
When the reflection in the glass that I held to my lips, now baby
Revealed these tears that are on my face, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind, boy
Than to see you walk away, walk away from me, yeah
And baby, and baby, I'd rather be blind now
Than to see you walk away from me
Something told me it was over
When I saw you and her talkingYou call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Well, boy, I don't give a...
Yeah
Talk every day, like we best friends
Every time we out on a date, we're engaged
I can smell the love in the air, it's a fragrance
If the restaurant ain't open, we gon' make it
Acting nonchalant, but I see through it so clear
Told her "What the hell you gon' do when I'm not here?"
Yeah, we having fun, but baby, we ain't 14
Know that this will probably fuck me up when I walked in
Talkin' bout a story like we don't got problems
But I know it too well, could you just be honest?
Wishing this a fairytale, I told her
Was here having good times but it ain't the right time
And now I don't want to lose this shit we got goin' on
I say we keep on it and what's next
I don't give a fuck
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Well, boy, I don't give a...
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuckWhat would you do?
What would you do if I handed you a drug that'd teach you something new?
What would you feel?
What would you feel if I took over the fake and made them all real?
What would you say?
What would you say if I told you it's actually gon' be a good day?
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
What do you need?
What do you need to show you there's better things to life than good weed?
What do you hear?
What do you hear?
What do you hear when I tell you I'm always near?
I made it pretty clear
What do you see?
What do you see when you find out the best things in life are all free?
You got a friend in me
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
Maybe need to let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Maybe it's because you're running low on gear
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And I'm still here
And I'm holding hard onto your hand
But it still feels
Like you're never gonna understand
One can drown alone, but we can swim together
Maybe all things happen for a reason
You just need to get over this dry season
But the only drug you need is believing
Maybe God does answer all your prayers
And let go of the fear
Of being let down from the people you keep near
Is it because you're running low on gear?
Maybe God does answer all your prayersYou, you turn gold to dust now
What was trust is lost now
What is all this darkness you have inside?
I just can't ignore it
From my heart, what's pouring
'Cause this hurt I can no longer hide

Baby, it's the last time
It's the last time I'm 'bout it, 'bout it

Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin, to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I’m all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms, ’cause
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees

‘Cause I’m free
To do what I want
Any old timeIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies?
Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Woo-hoo, woo-hoo, woo-hoo
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely
Even when we know it's wrong
Been somebody better for us all along
Tell me, how can we keep holding on?
Holding on tonight 'cause we're scared to be lonely

Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Okie dokie, alchy, keep it low-key like Thor, lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour, I'll ash my lucky
She just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Tonight, she yelling, "Fuck me"
Two weeks, she'll be yelling, "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, yeah, I know you still remember me
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
Cigarettes on cigarettes, cigarettes on cigarettes
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going gets well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Let me know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they shoulda never made it
Probably been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe up in that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
We're brain dead, take a tug and then pass, then pass
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted, yeah
I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted

That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, trop occupée pour t'écouter
Va trouver quelqu'un d'autre à saouler
Comme quoi je n'étais pas la seule à avoir le dos tourné
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges

Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't give a fuck
Je m'en fous de tes états d'âme
Viens pas faire un caprice, viens pas en faire un drame
Ravale tes mots doux, ils font partie du passé
Tu peux faire demi-tour, je ne reviendrai pas
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
I'll tell you why!
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up

Nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself
One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two, don't let him in
You have to kick him out again
Three, don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't getting over him

I've got new rules, I count 'em
I've gotta tell them to myself
I've got new rules, I count 'em

But my love, he never loves me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

One, don't pick up the phone
You know he's only calling 'cause he's drunk and alone

Play our worries away
You can be our savior

If I give a little more of me, would I lose myself completely?
Lose myself completely 
Now there's just one thing hangin' on my mind
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
Yeah, I need your love, but I need some time
Can I live my life if I give you mine?
If I give a little more of meWhat are we waiting for?
Are you in or out?
Finally, I can see what my heart needs now
I believe you and me
We can work somehow
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Hold my hand
Take a risk 'til it all falls down
Is it a sin to commit?
If so, help me now
What's a day without a kiss?
Can we live out loud?
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours 
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
 yours
 yours
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
Feel the rush when we touch
Electricity
Feel the heat, light me up
One hundred degrees
This is more than the crush
It was meant to be
All we ever do is night time lately
I've been waiting for a lifetime for too long
I've been waiting for the right time, baby
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours 
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours

Favorite drunken call
Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine
I wanna be yours 
I wanna be everything you ever dreamed of
I wanna be yours 
Are you lookin' at anybody else?
Because I wanna be yours
 yourY
 yourY
I wanna be yours
Hoo-ooh, ooh-ooh, oohI've been winning since I left you, left you
And you think you sick, now you about to get much sicker
Cause I'm looking in the mirror and that ass got thicker
Beggin' baby, hands is poppin', wrists with six plus figures
I've been there, I've been here, I just hustle low and pray
Got a lot up on my plate, taking meetings in L.A
Glowing up and blowing up, that's what I'm about to do
When it's all been happening since I left you
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
How it feel, how it feel, how it feel?
Sign off on our connection, and I sign onto a deal
Shoulda kept a hundred, man, you shoulda kept it real
Cause I realize you fake and you lost all your appeal
It don't hurt when I see you with her
You was always insecure and believed what you heard
Cause you've seen that all these niggas tryna see when it's they turn
But I don't need a cuddle buddy, I just cuddle with my fur
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me 
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuckYou call me all friendly

Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Et depuis quelque temps nos relations n’sont pas terribles
Pourtant, je te console comme on le voit dans les films
Comment tu veux qu’j’le prenne quand tu m’appelles "mon chéri"
Alors qu’il y a quelques minutes on était comme sur un ring ?
Et tu sais bien qu’j’aime pas qu’on se prenne la tête devant nos amis
Alors prends ta veste et rejoins-moi tout de suite derrière la son-mai
J’crois qu’il est temps qu'on récolte tout ce qu’on a semé
Depuis toutes ces années, on s’demandait où ça nous menait
Moi, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Et tu voudrais qu'on se lance
Ton amour, je m'en lave les mains et tu t'en mords les doigts
Oui, j'ai fait le tour de tous tes mensonges
Pas moyen que je replonge
Je veux te dire une dernière fois
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
Tu m'amuses, tu accuses
L'alcool, c'est ça ton excuse
Est-ce qu'il y a des filles que ça amuse ?
Mec, tu t'accroches, je raccroche
Même quand t'es loin, t'es tout proche
Le pardon est un don dont je ne me servirai pas
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up 
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck 
Je me fous de c'qu'elle te dit
Je me fous que ton cœur vrille
Boy, I don't give a fuck
J’espère que le temps te permettra de changer
J’ai tourné la page pour plus tomber
Mais qu'est-ce que t'as pas compris ?
Comment faut qu'j'te l'dise ?
Boy, I don't give a fuckThe more I love you, the more I rip you apart
That's what you said when we were arguing
I gave you so much love, I left none for myself
And you took it all away and threw it right back, right back
You told me I'm a liar 
You're acting like a fool
I'm allowed to hang out with my friends and without you
You're so in denial 
And I'm so over you 
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth
You're so full of that jealousy
It's running crazy through your body
Jealousy
It makes you wanna hurt somebody
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
You know it only makes you ugly
Jealousy
You won't let anybody touch me
It's killing me
But I won't let it, baby, I won't let it
I wanna love you, but you're so full of that jealousy
It's you and your ego that's fighting for the crown
Maybe that is just your insecurity
I gave you attention, left nothing for myself
And you threw it all away, and I said "Fuck that" 
Fuck that
You told me I'm a liar 
You're acting like a fool
The more you push my buttons, boy, the more I see the truth

You can't hear the silence up to this lung
You can't tie heartstrings when they're left undone
You can't go back when you've left too long
I tried to push us to the very end
I needed a lover more than a friend
But I hit the limit I didn't intend
And I just wanna make amends
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah

And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
In the darkness, I hear your voice
Memories of us I feel destroyed
My mind is playing tricks and I have no choice
Without you, my heart makes no noise
Wish that you would hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onto me now, yeah
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And now I'm staring at the emptiness that I've made
I put myself between a bullet and a heartbreak
And all I wanted was you but I shot love down, down, down
Down, down, down, down
All I needed was you
All I wanted was you
All I needed was you

So I do, I think of loosing you
And you're right by my side, huh
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true
And that's what I feel
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up
So baby don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever 
Find another lover, you'll see
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
I got a little Devil dancing in my mind
Playing tricks with my imagination
Ruining my night, well
I try to shake it off by looking in your eyes
All the voices in my head keep tryna
Tell me it's goodbye, uh
I'm not really thinking clear
Too good to be true and that's what I fear
Like what if you left me here
And I fill the floor with my sequin tears
Stuck getting in my brain
Something I do that I can't explain
We get lost creeping up
So baby don't you let go 
The thought of you with someone kills me
I'll be dancing with my heart broke
Such a sad disco, if it ain't me
And baby if you ever 
Find another lover, you'll see

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Out of my mind, out of my mind
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
Too many times, too many times
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Nowhere to turn, no way, nowhere to turn, no
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
I never learn, 
But my love , he doesn't love me
So I tell myself, I tell myself

Noise and tears
Death on the TV
And then there's you
Messed up, it's crazy
I can't concentrate
I just see your outline...
Mhmm
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Some prick at the party
All scripts and boasts
A dead eyed actress girl
And then there's you
Venus in Converse
You put a spell on me
And you're lockin' up the bathroom door for us
Back where we left off
Watch you take your dress off
I've been by myself remembering you
Your body hurts me
Loopin' 'round like CCTV
In all this bitterness, you stay so sweet
Such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey
It's such a cruel world
Hey, hey, hey
Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for days
Perfect disaster
Me and you
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
Uh, it's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
It's such a cruel world
Savin' all my love for you, girl
It's such a cruel world
Maybe I found somethin' good, girl
Uh-uh-uh-uh
Sunrise in Hollywood
We ain't slept for daysI've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Came here just to sing for Clara
Lookin' for the baddest diva
Hol' up, let me analyse her, body lookin' like a hypnotiser
Come let me try some, suttin' you can climb on
Oh, you're a shy one, who you tryna hide from?
Baby, jump in the black ride and put your friend in the white one
I'm a Benzo addict, pulled up in traffic
Me and my friends switched cars and it looked like magic
They never seen such a skinny man in a big puffer jacket
That's unfamiliar, I came lookin' like a bodybuilder
Out here's windy, yana, you're the one that I'm into, yana
Don't you wanna see the interior?
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some, oh hey
I've been rollin' on the freeway
I've been riding 85
I've been thinking way too much
And I'm way too gone to drive
I've got anger in my chest
I've got millions on my mind
And you didn't fit the picture
So I guess you weren't the vibe, hey
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try some
Did you see what I done?
Came in a black Benz, left in a white one
I'm just a hoodlum, I came with my bonsam
My gallies wanna try someSee, I gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I gotta be outta my head to be still with ya
See, I love you, but I don't like that
I leave, but then I come right back to you
So what is the point? I might as well sit here and roll me a joint
Or pour me a drink
So I can get wasted and don't have to think no more
Get high as a plane
'Cause sober, we drive each other insane
And we know if we don't, we gon' start fighting again
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Let's go
I've gotta be outta my head to deal with ya
And I've gotta be outta my head to be still with you
See, I love you but I don't like that
Keep leaving, coming right back to you
So I roll me swisher, pour me some liquor before we start to bicker
And calling each other out our names like bitches and n-
Arguing over all that small shit, keeps getting bigger
Corona out the kitchen
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drunk or we high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Boy, we only get along when we high, oh yeah
Boy, we only get along when we high
Either we smoking, oh
So either we smoke, drink, or we break up
Either we smoke, drink, or we break up
'Cause the only time we don't fight
Is when we drinking or high, oh why
Smoke, or we drink, or we break up
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat
Either we smoking, or we drinking, or we at each others throat

Thug love, thug love, thug loveI look in the mirror
All I see is nothing
I look out the window for some peace
But all I find is nothing
Then you take my hand, and suddenly I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
Then you take my hand and suddenly, I feel something
Side by side, lying next to you
I feel something
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bears
All I need is you to protect me 'til tomorrow
All I need is some comfort from my sorrow
All I need is you to hold me through my nightmares
I need you to keep me safe from lions, and tigers, and bearsIf you were standing on a corner with no money in your pants
And life fell apart, I'd hold out on my hand to you
The best and the worse things in life come free
But you can think of me as your best guarantee
It's true, I'm here for you
And if you just breathed your last breath
I'd give you my air 'til I had nothing left
I'd never let you go
If you were on the edge of a bridge
I'd push you to live
I'm your parachute, don't you ever forget
And if you get the chance to return the gift
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone
Like a child underneath the light, afraid of monsters in the night
I'll hold you 'til the dawn, 'til they're gone, no fight for you
I'd fight for you
When you're drowing in your tears and no one answers your prays
I'll be the boat to keep you afloat, my dear
And if you get the chance to return the gift
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someone
When you're alone in the darkest nights, I'm there for you
When you feel like you're about to cry, I'm there for you
I know you got so much strength inside
If I ask you would you save me tonight?
Promise me you'll save someone
If you can, if you can
Save someone
Understand, understand
Some have been chosen to wake up the broken
So promise you won't turn away
Oh, save someoneCaring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Common love isn't for us
We created something phenomenal

Why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
Will you protect me from the things that I want?
Will you be down and leave the second we're done?
I got one thing I want, I know that it's wrong
But I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda senseless
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, so I'll just help myself to you
Why's it so much better when we're not together?
Why's it-why's it feel so good when it's a bad-bad idea?
The taste of chaos on the tip of my tongue
I kinda like the crazy girl I've become
It's about time that I just have me some fun
'Cause I like to play with fire
I'll fuck you with no feelings left
Cruel intentions in my head
Hate it but I love the way I'm feelin' kinda reckless
I know that we had a past, I just want my power back

No, I can't help myself 
Haha
I don't know what makes me feel this way 
I don't care because I like it 
I don't know what makes me feel this way 
But I won't stop because I like it
It's a bad idea
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself

I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers?
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby, you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hellI see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Put your hands together and close your eyes
They say love is religion
They say love is religion

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again

Thank you so much!
I love you, we love you and we'll be back
My name is Dua Lipa, I love you, goodnightHave you got color in your cheeks?
Do you ever get the fear that you can't shift the type
That sticks around like summat in your teeth?
Are there some aces up your sleeve?
Have you no idea that you're in deep?
I've dreamt about you nearly every night this week
How many secrets can you keep?
'Cause there's this tune I found
That makes me think of you somehow
And I play it on repeat
Until I fall asleep
Spilling drinks on my settee
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
'Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it through
Crawling back to you
So have you got the guts?
Been wondering if your heart's still open
And if so, I wanna know what time it shuts
Simmer down and pucker up
I'm sorry to interrupt, it's just I'm constantly on the cusp
Of trying to kiss you
I don't know if you feel the same as I do
We could be together if you wanted to
Do I wanna know?
If this feeling flows both ways?
Sad to see you go
Was sorta hoping that you’d stay
Baby, we both know
That the nights were mainly made
For saying things that you can’t say tomorrow day
Crawling back to you
Ever thought of calling when you've had a few?
Cause I always do
Maybe I'm too busy being yours to fall for somebody new
Now I've thought it throughIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?Blame it on the night
One too many at the dark
Saw you called a thousand times
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Dancing ‘til I cry, took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let’s not talk about it, won’t talk about it
I’m waking up to messages
Don’t recognize the name
I’m wondering who the F it is
‘Cause I don’t know any James
Somebody next to me in my bed
Hold up, wait, this isn’t my bed
Telling myself never again, again
 I don’t know what happened to my friends
 Or where I been
 And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dark
Saw you called a thousand times
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Dancing ‘til I cry, took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let’s not talk about it, won’t talk about it

Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh, ooh
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
How am I in the club again?
Said I was staying in 
Having another heart to heart
With someone that I just met 
And the next thing that I know 
Is I wake up in my clothes 
And the voice inside my head 
Says never again, again
 I don’t know what happened to my friends
 Or where I been 
And I can’t tell you how this story ends
And I can’t pretend 
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dark
Saw you called a thousand times
Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Dancing ‘til I cry, took a hit and got too high
Started questioning my life
Let’s not talk about it, won’t talk about it

Can’t talk about it, won’t talk about it
Blame it on the night, blame the alcohol
Blame anyone you like, ‘cause I can’t be held responsible
Blame it on the night, blame the alcohol
Blame anyone you like, ‘cause I can’t be held responsible
Blame it on the night
One too many at the dark
Saw you called a thousand times

Nothin' is the way it was
People textin' exes sex pics
From the basement at their mom's
If you have human contact
Don't know what you'll contract
So your first date's always on Zoom 
You just wish you could just go out
Get a little naughty
Girl, you're drunk on FaceTime
WiFi's gettin' sloppy
There's no bars, there's no school
Poundin' claws in a kitty pool
Thirsty slides through DMs
Now you landed in their close friend's
No matter how you try to break through
It all feels like a waste of time
When you've gotten your face off Netflix
Hulu, HBO, and Prime
Now you're lookin' ready
Though, it's low-key scary
Check your drip and grab your Lysol 
If you're ever wanna see another person's body
If you zap on your forehead, you're a total hottie
Wear a mask, wash your hands
It's not like you have other plans
It's awkward, but it's cool
Following all these COVID rules 
One: Get in the zone, no more doing edibles at home alone
Two: Stalk their Instagram
Gotta background check if you wanna slam
Three: Up your waxin' game
No one's seen you naked since February
And if you hit it off, watch out if they start to cough
I got new rules for dating
Six feet apart, no mating
Masks can be irritating
No more procrastinating
These are the rules for dating
One: There's a new third base, that's when you get to see their lower face
Two:  Right before you touch, Purell until your hands get rough
Three: Just seal the deal, you better hope you lick 'em when you wake up in the morning
You're feelin' numb, it's you, your hand, and OnlyFans
We've got rules for dating
Safety is stimulating
It's your neighbors you're saving
You'll get that touch you're craving
Just follow these rules for datingMet a boy and he told me
That life gon' burn you out
You can go all four corners of the globe
Still, won’t know what you’re about
You got your issues, your tissues
You cry every night
I’m melodramatic
I guess he was right
Livin' out of that suitcase
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Another thing that he told me
"It’s gonna be a long, long daylight"
He’s the one I feel bad for
Don’t have a passion like mine
I’ll keep my issues, my tissues
Keep runnin' the lights
I may be impulsive but I do all right
Livin' out of my suitcase
He said "girl better get on your way
Keep chasing the dragon"
I guess he’s probably right
Keep chasing the dragon
That’s just how I’ll live my life
’Cause you know that, ooh
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
No matter what he said to me
I’m gonna be running free, ooh
I just wanna fly, you see
Ain’t nothing stopping me
Ooh
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
Keep chasing the dragon
Eh-eh-eh-eh-endlessly
’Cause you know that
Nothing bout me’s typical
I said "ooh"
You know I’ll be chasing the dragon

In my heart
I know we might be sharing time
I lost my mind, they sayYeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my—
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, hеad
We drive each othеr mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad

Don't you get fresh with me
Mmm
Woo, yeah

Who's that gigolo on the street
With his hands in his pockets and his crocodile feet?
Hanging off the curb, looking all disturbed
And the boys from home, they all came running
They were making noise, manhandling toys
There's the girls on the block with the nasty curls
Wearing padded bras, sucking beers through straws
Dropping down their drawers, where did you get yours?
Gigolo
Huh, sucka?
Gigolo, gigolo
Huh, sucka?
Gigolo
But damn, we know how to fu—I-It's your voo...
I-It's your voo...
I can't get away
Found a home in your heartbeat
I keep coming back again
There's a madness that surrounds me
And when you're a thousand miles away
I'm holding on for you
I get on my knees to pray
'Cause I've fallen under you
It's your voodoo
It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love?
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo
You're my heavy rain
You drench me off of nothing
For all you gotta say, at least can you mean something?
And when you're a thousand miles away, what am I supposed to do?
It's strange, 'cause your love stayed
I've fallen under you
It's your voodoo
 It's your voodoo
Is this what they call love?
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Voodoo, voodoo
Why won't you let me go?
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out
Why won't you let me go?
I'm under your control
Fighting to let you go
And I can't get out
It's your voodoo 
 It's your voodoo 
Is this what they call love? 
'Cause I can't get enough
Must be voodoo 
It's your voo...
Is this what they call love?
Must be voodooHe calls me the devil
I make him wanna sin
Every time I knock, he can't help but let me in
Must be homesick for the real
I'm the realest it gets
You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you that pleasure heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
You're my manna from heaven
We all gotta get fed
Can let me know I'm wanted
Can let me in your head
I'm not here to make you kneel
But it's praise that I'll get
You ain't gonna walk free boy
Not finished with you yet, no
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb
Cause we're hot like hell
Does it burn when I'm not there?
When you're by yourself
Am I the answer to your prayers
I'm giving you the pleasure of heaven
And I'll give it to you
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
When we go down right there
You make me feel right there
When you lay me down right there
We just make it right there
Cause you're looking so right there
Baby you should touch me right there
If you can take me right there
We can make it
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell
Hotter than hell

Hotter than hellLyrics from Snippet
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Don't you wear your own mouth?
Walking around and throwing shade
Caught up in your mind games
But did I think you'd ever change?
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
Choking on your smoke
Smashing on your mirrors
Gonna vacate the fake so I see clearer
Running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
And I tried, and I tried, and I tried
But it just doesn't feel right
Like a night, like a night, like a night
With a sunrise
I'm running out of ways to love you
I'm running out of ways to care
Imma hate it when I'm picking up you
I just don't wanna breathe the same air
You are looking two faced
You need another pair of shadesPart 1: Masseduction
Black saint, sinner lady
Playin' knock-off soul
A punk rock romantic
Slumped on the kitchen floor
Nuns in stress positions
Smokin' Marlboros
Lolita is weeping

While I'm laying on your chest
I can feel the emptiness
Like the sound of hope and dreams
All those tattoos on your skin
This commitment joining
Tell me are we meant to be
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no
Don't mistake my love for weakness
If you think I'd run around and 'round chasing you
Leave me hanging here like a fool, no
You can have it all, all
'Cause it's all or nothing, all or nothing
All or nothing
All or nothing
Loving you was like a pill
I stayed 'cause I liked the thrill
But now we're just wasting time 
I've been waiting weeks all night
You know that we're more than friends
We've been livin' in denial
Oh, we used to burn bright
But now I'm turning the lights off
You said you'd be mine
But I've been waiting a lifetime
Don't you beg me for forgiveness, oh no

Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you

So let me care for you

I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you
You know I wanna to let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
I feel electric, baby
So electric, baby
Wanna let you know, let you know
I think I'm ready, baby
I think I'm ready, now
Electricity
I'm flowing into youLet me take the night, I love real easy
And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out
Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me
Possibilities
I look like all you need
One
One
I look like all you need
I look like all you need
I just wanna feel your skin on mine
Feel your eyes do the exploring
Passion in the message when you smile
Take my time
Something in you lit up heaven in me
The feeling won't let me sleep
'Cause I'm lost in the way you move, the way you feel
One kiss is all it takes
Fallin' in love with me

I look like all you need
One kiss is all it takes

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
Rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
Rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I...

Gangsta boy got me so mean
Come, let’s get a little wilder
Let's wait till the dark gets lighter
Can you spark me up your last cigarette?
I promise you, you'll never forget
What feels to be living larger
Baby, party harder
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
I'll kiss all the ink on your neck
'Cause baby, I'm doing it, and you do it the best
Light up, let's get a little louder
Hold me for a little longer
I love it when you whisper in my ear
Tell me things I always wanna hear
You're the medicine, doctor
Skin on skin, softer
My heart’s never wanted anymore than you yet
When I see those tattoos all over your chest
I want nothing more than to wake in your bed
Next to you, next to you
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who's never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl
Let it all down, down, down, down
Let me say hi, hi, hi, hi
Never gonna ground, ground, ground
Never say goodbye, bye, bye, bye
Let me be your favourite problem
Let me be the one who’s never forgotten
Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girl

Let me be your bad girl, nothing but your bad girlWalking alone and the shores are longing
I miss your footprints next to mine
Sure as the waves on the sand are washing
Your rhythm keeps my heart in time
You, you found me
Made me into something new
Led me through the deepest water
I promise, love, to carry on for you
I, I'll carry on for you
Spoke to the wind on the open ocean
I wonder if you hear me too?
Wrapped in my arms with every moment
The memories that pull me through
You, you found me
Made me into something new
Led me through the deepest water
I promise, love, to carry on for you
You, to carry on for you, for you
You
I will carry on for you
You, you found me

Led me deep through the water, carry on for you
I'll carry on for youYour kiss, your touch, your hold
You know I want you all
The darkness in my soul
Tells me to let you go
And I
Need you tonight
But I'm blinded by lights
So I gotta learn to live without you
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
New York
Save me in your arms tonight
Cause I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy at home
I left my boy, I left my boy
She never sleeps at night
So nice you name her twice
Without you I'm alive
But my heart is cold as ice

I left my boy, I left my boy
I left my boy, I left my boy
I ran away from home
I ran to follow my deams
I ran away from he
Why would he do this to me?
I needed a way out
I needed to figure how
To keep get you here with me
Maybe you are my dream
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love
So please, New York
Mend my broken heart tonight
Cause I left the one I love

Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
아직 너를
못 떠나고 뭘 하고 있는 건지
언젠가는 다 끝날 걸
떠날 걸 알지만
고장 난 우릴
다시 고쳐 볼 수는 없을지
아무런 말도 넌 하지 마
마지막은 없어
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up

Future Nost—Hey, this is Dua Lipa and you're listening to Club Future Nostalgia
With The Blessed Madonna 
No matter what you do, I’m gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain’t used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain’t used to a female alpha 
You want a timeless song, I wanna change the game
Like modern architecture, John Lautner coming your way
I know you like this beat ’cause Jeff's been doin’ the damn thing
You wanna turn it up loud, Future Nostalgia is the name 
I know you're dying trying to figure me out
My name's on the tip of your tongue, keep running your mouth
You want the recipe, but can't handle my sound
My sound, my sound 
No matter what you do, I’m gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
No matter what you do, I'm gonna get it without ya 
I know you ain't used to a female alpha 
Can't be a rolling stone if you live in a glass house
You keep on talking that talk, one day, you're gonna blast out
You can't be bitter if I'm out here showing my face
You want what now looks like, let me give you a taste3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout youLyrics from snippet
When I put my hands in the air
Look, look, I move like this
When I put my love up back, forth, back
Look, look, I move like this
When I let my hips sink way, way, down
Look, look, I feel like this
When I flip my hair like up, down, to the middle
I'm a rockstar, just a little
Pay attention, grow up
I'm educatin' 
Looked down when I met your mother
True love one way or another
I feel let down just a little bit
One day we partied, we livin'
The next I'm down in my feelings
So hurt, my heart is a-bleeding
Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you love mе?
Why, why don't you love me?
Anymore, anymorе?
W-Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you love me?
Why, why don't you love me?
Anymore, anymore?

Ooh
I must have died and gone to Heaven
I've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've

Couldn't hold you long enough in my hands
Can't remember how I went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had
The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That fells like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I never meant for it to end this way 
I wish that I could say this face to face 
Holding on for hope your mind would change 
'Cause I want you back, I need you back to take this pain away  
The times you used to call me "Baby"
Driving in your old Mercedes
That fells like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
My only request, I wish you the best
But I can't get no sleep, I can't get no rest
My head is a mess, between "No" and "Yes"
Right now you're heavy on my mind
I don't wanna guess what you're thinking tonight
I want the facts, I don't want no more lies
I just wanna a chance to make it right
I just wanna a chance to make it right
If I had one chance to tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what you meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
If you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees, please
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuckIn the beginning
God created Heaven and Earth
For what it's worth, I think that he might've created you first
Just my opinion
Your body is the one paradise that I wanna fly to
Every day and every night
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
Don’t matter what’s written
We can start all over again, all over again
Oh, how can I get you all over my skin?
My deep intuition tells me that I'm doing you wrong
If I don't come home
Just say you forgive me and don't let me go
I've been sick and tired of running
Chasing all of the flashing lights
These late nights don't mean nothing
So I just wanna apologize
I'm sorry, so sorry
I'm sorry, yeah
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I’ve got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?
You know
I'll roar like a lion for you
You know I'll keep trying
'Til the sun stops rising
I need your love
And I'm dying for the rush
'Cause my heart ain't got enough
I need your touch
This is getting serious
Tell me that it's not the end of us
How can we go back to the beginning?
How can we go back to the beginning?
Without you, I've got no air to breathe in
How can we go back to the beginning?Check, one, two
What it is? What's happening?
Come on say something, here you go, put your—

This is Dua Lipa, thanks for tuning in
You've been listening in to Club Future Nostalgia, mwah
Club, welcome to the clubBoys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women 
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
Boys will be boys, but girls will be women
It's second nature to walk home before the sun goes down
And put your keys between your knuckles when there's boys around
Isn't it funny how we laugh it off to hide our fear
When there's nothing funny here? 
Sick intuition that they taught us, so we won't freak out
We hide our figures, doing anything to shut their mouths
We smile away to ease the tension so it don't go south
But there's nothing funny now 
When will we stop saying things?
'Cause they're all listening
No, the kids ain't alright
Oh, and they do what they see
'Cause it's all on TV
Oh, the kids ain't alright
Boys will be, boys will be 
Boys will be, boys will be boys 
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be 
Boys will be, boys will be boys 
But girls will be women 
Boys will be, boys will be 
Boys will be, boys will be boys 
But girls will be women
Boys will be, boys will be 
Boys will be, boys will be boys 
But girls will be women

Boys will be boys, but girls will be womenYou call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck about you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
See you tryna–
About you
See you tryna–
But I'm over you
But I'm over you
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back

Oh, you look so pretty

Put my mind at
-Lief, pretty
Put my mind at
Pretty

Somewhere in the middle, I
Think I lied a little, I
I said if we took it there, I wasn't gonna change
But that went out the window, yeah 
Hate it when you leave me unattended
'Cause I miss ya, and I need your love
When my mind is runnin' wild
Could you help me slow it down?
Put my mind at ease
Trickle down my spine
Oh, you look so pretty, please
Every single night, I need your hands on me
Sweet relief
Pretty please
Hey, what's up? It's Louie Vega from Masters at Work
You're listening to Club Future Nostalgia with Dua Lipa and The Blessed MadonnaOne, one, one, one, one...
Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart 
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I... 
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myselfIt was great at the very start
Hands on each other
Couldn't stand to be far apart
Closer the better
Now we're picking fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
Why we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Too much time, losing track of us
Where was the real?
Undefined, spiraling out of touch
Forgot how it feels
All the messed up fights and slamming doors
Magnifying all our flaws
And I wonder why, wonder what for
It's like we keep coming back for more
Is it just our bodies? Are we both losing our minds?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Do we need somebody just to feel like we're alright?
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?
Scared to be lonely
Is the only reason you're holding me tonight
'Cause we're scared to be lonely?You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me

I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want

So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuckI guess we're ready for the summer
I like us better when we're intertwined
The way you touch me got me losin' my senses 
Put your love with your lips on mine, on mine, on mine
You got me working up an appetite-tite
And the colour of the sky looking nice-o-nice
You know, you know, you know
Baby, I could see us in the real life
You know, you know you got
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
You got me, you got me losin' all my cool
Skintight
I'll show you heaven, there's nothing better
I'll give it to you all night
You know, you know, you know
Got me losin' all my cool
Yeah, you like the way I move
In control of what I do
And my love makes you brand new
Got me losin' all my cool
'Cause I'm burnin' up on you
In control of what I do
And I love the way you move
We'll get the heat and the thrill
Gives you more than any pill
Never runnin' out of juice
When it's only me and you
Hey, go

Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survivе you
I'm better on the othеr side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me

You're so intense, yeah you’re so intense
So, you just let me know what you're missing
Come take the pedestal
You'd be the reason why I keep slipping
But come home
You and I, we're one too many worlds apart

You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuckBefore you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly I can feel it
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Head on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Every time you're close, I get out of breath
Wondering, wondering, wondеring what will happen next
Is it my imagination? got my heart bеat racing
Fallin' in, fallin' in, fallin' in, feel it in my chest
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Head on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me baby, I turn red
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
And when you touch me baby, I turn redI'm sorry if I seem uninterested
Or I'm not listenin', or I'm indifferent
Truly I ain't got no business here
But since my friends are here, I just came to kick it
But really I would rather be at home all by myself
Not in this room with people who don't even care about my well-being
I don't dance, don't ask
I don't need a boyfriend
So you can go back
Please enjoy your party, I'll be here
Somewhere in the corner under clouds of marijuana
With this boy who's hollering I can hardly hear
Over this music I don't listen to, and I don't wanna get with you
So tell my friends that I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here
Excuse me if I seem a little unimpressed with this
An anti-social pessimist, but usually I don't mess with this
And I know you mean only the best
And your intentions aren't to bother me
But honestly I'd rather be somewhere with my people
We can kick it and just listen to some music with a message, like we usually do
And we'll discuss our big dreams
How we plan to take over the planet
So pardon my manners
I hope you'll understand that I'll be her
Not there in the kitchen with the girl who's always gossiping about her friends
So tell them I'll be here
Right next to the boy who's throwin' up 'cause he can't take what's in his cup no more
Oh, God, why am I here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Oh, I ask myself, what am I doin' here?
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
And I can't wait 'til we can break up outta here
Hours later, congregatin' next to the refrigerator
Some girl talkin' 'bout her haters, she ain't got none
How did it ever come to this?
I shoulda never come to this
So holla at me, I'll be in the car when you're done
I'm stand-offish
Don't want what you're offerin'
And I'm done talkin'
Awfully sad it had to be that way
So tell my people when they're ready that I'm ready
And I'm standin' at the TV with my beanie low
Yo, I'll be over here
Oh-oh-oh here, oh-oh-oh here
Ask myself, what am I doin' here?

The summer days melt, no kiss and no tell
‘Cause I just wanna, yeah, we just wanna
Ooh

A familiar feeling between us
Like we’ve been here before
‘Cause we can't control this familiar feeling between us
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it
Solo where nobody can chime in
We could let ‘em know whеn the time is right
Ooh

But for now let’s keep it secret
One day we could reminisce
When nobody knew about the way we kiss
And the way we touch
But for now let’s keep it secret
We don’t have to say that we’re lovers
Even though we’re touching each other
Can you keep it under the covers?
‘Cause I wanna keep it

You're locked into Club Future NostalgiaI never thought that I would find a way out
I never thought I'd hear my heart beat so loud
I can't believe there's something left in my chest anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
I used to think that I was made out of stone
I used to spend so many nights on my own
I never knew I had it in me to dance anymore
But goddamn, you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do
But goddamn, you got me in love again
You got me in love again
You got me in love again
Again
So many nights, my tears fell harder than rain
Scared I would take my broken heart to the grave
I'd rather die than have to live in a storm like before
But goddamn , you got me in love again
Show me that heaven's right here, baby
Touch me, so I know I'm not crazy
Never have I ever met somebody like you
Used to be afraid of love and what it might do

Losing all my intuition, tryna act like I don’t care
I’m so lost in all this madness
So I'm throwing up a flare
But you know, baby, I’m a problem
Tryna act like I'm not scared
Caught me in ways that I can't explain
You got me questioning all my faith
I’m so confused
Thought I could handle this tidal wave
Hit me so hard I got slipped away into you
Act of God, don’t know how it started
No bad flaws at all, but I can’t control it

‘Cause I know there is no cheating my fate
Act of God, ‘cause I can’t control it
Wait a minute, uh

Got me lifted 
Act of God

Set my soul on fire 
Could this be a revelation?
Tell me, is this what I need?
‘Cause all this divine intervention
I’m starting to believe
Is this all an accident, or is this by design?
I know I didn’t ask for it

Fireworks lit the sky, we're runnin' through a burnin’ field
Baby, just you and I
If I lost you 
And you lost me 
If I lost you 
And you lost me 
Oh yeah

You and me together, all I can see was you
It's cold in September but you take me back to June
Berlin summer, the memory of you
We're runnin' down the country road in 2018
It was only you and me, and nothin' in between 
And the trees are movin', in slow motion
Drunk and dancin'
If I lost you 
And you lost me 
If I lost you 
And you lost me 
Oh yeah

Talkin' in my sleep at night, makin' myself crazy
Wrote it down and read it out, hopin' it would save me
My love, he makes me feel like nobody else, nobody else
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I got new rules 
I got new rules, I count 'em
I count 'em,  I count 'em
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
You ain't getting over him
I got new rules, I count 'em
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love , he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him

Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't...
You're gettin' over himLook at us lookin' out, out the world through glass
While the hands on the clock spin around too fast
Gotta say I've had enough
Time to live at last
Eh-eh-eh-eh
Lose yourself for a night
Make your own mistakes
Speak the words on your mind
That you never say
What's a day without a risk?
Do it differently
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby
I wanna do more 
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more 
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
 More
 More
I wanna do more 
Finally I can see what my heart needs now
Hold my hand, dance with me, we can paint this town
What are we waiting for?
Time to live out loud 
If you're waiting for the right time, baby
You'll be waiting for a lifetime for too long
Got a feeling now's the right time, baby
I wanna do more 
I wanna do everything I've ever dreamed of
I wanna do more 
I ain't worried 'bout anybody else because
I wanna do more
 More

Oh, say you will be mine
Say you will be mine

Got stars in my eyes
And they don't fade when you come my way
I’m losing my mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
Mi-mi-mi-mind, mi-mi-mi-mind
I hallucinate when you call my nameKnow you're bad for me, but you know I am too
Me and you together, like a loved up bruise
I'll make you an offer that you can't refuse
Baby, you're okay
Baby, you're okay
No, you won't, won't go breaking my heart
You've seen that we got the same pain, same scar
Felt that when we got closer in the dark
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, I'm okay
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good
I guess we're misunderstood
So baby, please, don't hear what people say
'Cause I've heard things 'bout you too
Makes me know that I'm for you
Oh, no, I don't care what's been done here before me
I don't give a damn, just as long as you care
'Cause, baby, I've been bad, but the heavens forgave me
You don't need to ask 'cause I'm already there
Let's be bad together, baby, you and I
Let's be bad together, if only for a while
Let's be bad together, make the devil smile
Let's be bad together, let's be bad together, ooh yeah
Nothing could stop us, we got it all
The love, the passion, but most of all
We mess up, but run from the scene
But I throw my hands up, if you know what I mean
Ah, 'cause I'm not afraid to tell you when you're wrong
And I know that you miss me when I'm gone
We make a great team
With you, I'm badder than I've ever been
Baby, when
When you're far away, I promise you I'll be good

You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna' get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna' get to me 
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuckKiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
We haven't talked all morning
Bang my head, bang my head against the wall
I'm scared, I'm falling
Losing all, losing all my control
And I'm tired of talking
Feel myself saying the same old things
But this love's important
Don't wanna lose, don't wanna lose you this way
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
I've been drinking
Baby that's, baby that's why I'm feeling
So mistaken
All this love, all this love got me bad
Hallucinating
Everytime that you're next to me
I'm losing patience
So can we go, can we go all night long?
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Feel like we about to break up
I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I, I
Just wanna kiss and make up one last time
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Take the tension and
Just give a little love and affection
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
I hate the pressure
There wasn't any when I met you
So tell me, can we work this whole thing out?
Work this whole thing out
Kiss, kiss and make up
Touch me like you touch nobody
Put your hands all up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
How about we leave this party?
'Cause all I want is you up on me
Tired of hearing sorry
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss, kiss and make up
Kiss and make, kiss, kiss and make upNot my problem, not my problem
Call it what you want, but you're not my problem
Crying all the time, but you're not my problem

Putting me through hell 
OohI see the moon, I see the moon, I see the moon
Oh, when you're looking at the sun
Not a fool, I'm not a fool, not a fool
No, you're not fooling anyone
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run
Cause I could be the one
I could be the one
I could be the one
Cause I could be the one
I see in blue, I see in blue, I see in blue
Oh, when you see everything in red
There is nothing that I wouldn't do for you
Do for you, do for you
Oh, cause you got inside my head
Oh, but when you're gone
When you're gone, when you're gone
Oh baby, all the lights go out
Thinking, oh that, baby, I was wrong
I was wrong, I was wrong
Come back to me, baby, we can work this out
Oh baby, come on, let me get to know you
Just another chance so that I can show
That I won't let you down and run
No, I won't let you down and run

        Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survive you
I'm better on the other side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
If you wanna believe that anything could stop me
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me now
Walk away, you know how
Don't start caring about me now
Don't show up , don't come out 
Don't start caring about me now 
Walk away , you know how 
Don't start caring about me now

Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot denyFatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last danceYeah, let's get to the point here
You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
I dedicate this verse to
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah
You always let me down, boy
But when you're going down, I get so up
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
Yeah, we don't know how to talk
But damn, we know how to fu—
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad, bad
Messing with my head, head, head, head, head
We drive each other mad, mad, mad, mad, mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me, me, me, me, me
I know it's really bad, bad, bad, bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bed
It's bad
We drive each other mad
It might be kinda sad
But I think that's what makes us good in bedHey, is this thing on?
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Ah, ah-ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah
Call me a savage
When I'm shoutin' down that phone
You say I'm tragic
'Cause I'm picking fights alone
Over-dramatic
I swear this used to turn you on
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know
Call me romantic
Yeah, I do it all for love
You say it's plastic
'Cause you seen it all before
I know it's classic
But when the high became the lows
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that
Know I'm a lot but you got me now
Know that it's love when you stick around
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
I'm looking for tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ouble
Tro-o-o-o-o-o-o-ah
How do you stand it
When I drive you up the wall?
I know it's manic
But you're always break my fall
After the madness
Wе forget about it all
I scream and I shout and I let it all out
But I just want you to know that
Know I'm a lot but you got mе now
Know that it's love when you stick around
Tell me if you're with it, are you with it or not?

Oh-ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh-oohLyrics to snippet
You were for me right now, right now, right now
Ha-aahGive you electricity...
I cannot deny
Falling
Falling into you, baby
Even electricity can't compare to what I feel
When I'm with you
Ooh, baby
Giving up my ghost for you
And now I'm see-through
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
This love has, this love has...
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
This love has, this love has...
All I see is you, lately
Wide awake and in my dreams
I see your face so vividly
I don't know what I'd do
Ooh, baby
If you only saw a friend in me
I'd be bittersweet
You give me a feeling, feeling so strong
I know you've been treating, treating yourself wrong
So let me care for you
Ooh, baby
I'ma love you differently
I'll give you electricity
Give it to you
And even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you, you know
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
Give you electricity...
I cannot deny
Even if I could
I wouldn't turn on you
And I would stop the world for you and I
I wanna let you know, I'll never let this feeling go
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny
This love has, this love has...
This love has no ceiling, I cannot deny

        All along, it was a fever
A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, "If you dare, come a little closer"
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
'Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay
The reason I hold on
'Cause I need this hole gone
Funny, you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
It takes me all the way
I want you to stay, I want you to stay
I want you to stay, I want you to stayWhat would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
Got my head spinnin', no kiddin', I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be alright
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful, too
The world is beating you down, I'm around through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's underwater, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh
Give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me, I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I'm winning
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, ohCentre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
I would've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
I should've stayed at home
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh

I left him, it hurt bad
Letting go of what we had
But someone had to pull the trigger
Shoot love dead, it had to be me
So baby, pour me up, pour me up 
I can't live with this unless I'm drunk
One for the night, one for the road
I'm gonna drown myself in liquor to let go
One for the night, before they close
To sooth the darkness, all the darkness in my soul
One for the night

Charged guilty and light me up

After a few drinks, I start thinking about what we had
It gets complicated in my head
In my bed, in my 
And at the parties, nobody seems to care
It's like I'm not there
And I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
When I left ya, I left hidden treasure
'Causе now no one can measure its prеssure
And I don't know what to do
Do I come back with the pride that I have left?
'Cause I know you were the best
But I just want you to know
One, two
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
To get over you
Now I've come undone
And if I could turn back time, I'd choose you
I wish you were mine
I didn't know then, but now I do
That I still think about it, I still talk about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
I still talk about it, tried to forget about it
And there's not a thing I can do, there's not a thing I can do
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you, to get over you
To get over you          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been sleeping later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been digging deeper but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout youFatal, this attraction
Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Way too soon to feel so strong
Way too young to hurt so long
I'm hurtin'
Was it worth it?
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last danceI've got a fever
Got a fever
I've got a fever
Got a fever
Before you came around, I was doing just fine
Usually, usually, usually, I don't pay no mind
And when it came down, I was looking in your eyes
Suddenly, suddenly, suddenly, I can feel it inside
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now
'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Tell me what you wanna do right now
Tell me what you wanna do right now

'Cause I don't really wanna cool it down
Car dans mes yeux, ça se voit
La fièvre dans les yeux, oui, ça se voit
Mon cœur se serre, j'ai du feu dans la voix
I've got a fever, can you check?
Hand on my forehead, kiss my neck
And when you touch me, baby, I turn red
I've got a fever, so can you check?

Ça partira

Et pourtant, et pourtant, et pourtantHey
You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it all on the alcohol
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why, hey
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuck
About you
No, I don't give a damn
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why, sing
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't give a fuck
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Please, boy, I don't give a fuck
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't give a fuckI'm levitating
I'm levitating
If you wanna run away with me, I know a galaxy
And I can take you for a ride
I had a premonition that we fell into a rhythm
Where the music don't stop for life
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way I like
If you're feeling like you need a little bit of company
You met me at the perfect time
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dancе with me
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight
I need you all night, come on, dancе with me
I'm levitating
I'm levitating
All night, all night, all night
I'm levitating
I'm levitating
I believe that you're for me, I feel it in our energy
I see us written in the stars
We can go wherever, so let's do it now or never
Baby, nothing's ever, ever too far
Glitter in the sky, glitter in my eyes
Shining just the way we are
I feel like we're forever every time we get together
But whatever, let's get lost on Mars
You want me, I want you, baby
My sugarboo, I'm levitating
The Milky Way, we're renegading
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I got you, moonlight, you're my starlight

I need you all night, come on, dance with me
I'm levitatingI, I can't lie, I’m scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothin' at all, nothin’ at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doin' nothin' at all, watchin' it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
’Cause staying silent’s the same as dyin'
I won’t stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
It's a new life
Real fantasy, wishin' it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doin’ nothin' at all, watchin' it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is runnin', running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dyin'
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me

You probably still adore me
With my hands around your neck
Can you feel the warmth? Yeah
As my kiss goes down you like some sweet alcohol
Where I'm coming from, yeah
It's the darker side of me that makes you feel so numb

You love to disappoint me, don't ya?
You tell me what I want, but ain't no follow through
You don't follow through, no
But if you only knew me
The way you know my body, baby
Then I think maybe we could probably see this through
We could make it through, but
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each othеr mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Pleasе, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Ahh
Mmm
Hey, ah
I dedicate this verse to 
All that good pipe in the moonlight
In the long nights where we did everything but talk it through
That's what we do, yeah 
You always let me down, boy 
But when you're going down, I get so up 
Don't know if I can find someone who do me like you do
I've been thinking it'd be better
If we didn't know each other
Then you go and make me feel okay
Got me thinking it'd be better
If we didn't stay together
Then you put your hands up on my waist 
I know it's really bad
Messing with my head
We drive each other mad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Please, come take it out on me
I know it's really bad
But baby, that's what makes us good in bed
Ahh
That's what makes us good in bed
Hey, ahh

I can't get you out of my mind
It's like an addiction
I can't stop
I love you

Ah, ah, ahI don't know, don't know how it seems but
I ain't tryna take your freedom
I just wanna know where your heart's at

Got me wondering what happened
I see them pictures of you laughing
I don't wanna run out of time to
Tell you how I feel about you

But I don't wanna miss a thing
I'm not expecting anything
I'm just asking you to

To put nobody before you
Give you all of me 'til I die

You let me, let me, let mе love you
But only, only when you want to
It's good that we'rе both staying busy

Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary

If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't show up, don't come out
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Don't start caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me, caring about me
Caring about me now
Aren't you the guy who tried to
Hurt me with the word "goodbye"?
Though it took some time to survivе you
I'm better on the othеr side
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so
If you don't wanna see me dancing with somebody

        Hmm, hmm
I'm numb and I'm broken, my wounds are so close
And I'm trying to tie a knot where the bar is still open tonight, tonight
Put the cup to my lessons, I speak without thinking
And it'll all disappear if I just keep on drinking tonight, tonight
Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else
Open my eyes and the sky is in mourning
A part of me died, but a new day is turning in light, in light
Confusion and heartache, I'm back where I started
I'm back at thе bar once so dearly departеd last night, yeah
Why am I dealing with our pain?
The past won't go away
But a truth'd make it all change?
No, no
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til it feels alright, make me feel alive
So pour me a lie tonight
I've been living it up, living it up
'Til I lose my mind, at least I might feel something else

And I know that you'll still wanna see me
On the Sunday morning, music real loud
Let me love you while the moon is still out

Yeah, we might just end up crashin'
But I'm ready if it happens with you
Meet me out in Cali when I'm far away from family
And I need someone to hold onto
You're the only thing I know
And I don't wanna let this go
Close to you I feel, feel like I'm at home
Can't wait 'til we're alone
We were built to last
We were built like that
Baby, take my hand
Dive in this romance
We could burn and crash
We could take a chance
Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Like it's our last dance
Left my heart wide open
Fallin' in and out of focus
Pressure flowin' like a river in my head
Crying you ain't with me and it's floodin' the whole city
While my soul's burnin' like a cigarette
You're the only thing I know

Holdin' nothin' back
Like it's our last danceI've always been the one to say the first goodbye
Had to love and lose a hundred million times
Had to get it wrong to know just what I like
Now I'm falling
You say my name like I have never heard before
I'm indecisive, but, this time, I know for sure
I hope I'm not the only one that feels it all
Are you falling?
I would've stayed at home
I would've
Stayed at home
Break my heart

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time 
Yeah, you got me
Centre of attention
You know you can get whatever you want from me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby 
Break my heart
Break my heart

Break my heart 
Break my heart 
Break my heart 
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?

You know you can get whatever you want, want me
Whenever you want it, baby
It's you in my reflection
I'm afraid of all the things it could do to me
If I would've known it, baby
Break my heart
Break my heart
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?
One that could break my heart?
Oh no, I was doing better alone
But when you said, "Hello"
I knew that was the end of it all
I should've stayed at home
'Cause now there ain't no letting you go
Am I falling in love with the one that could break my heart?Did a full 180, crazy
Thinking 'bout the way I was
Did the heartbreak change me? Maybe
But look at where I ended up
I'm all good already
So moved on, it's scary
I'm not where you left me at all, so

Couldn't hold you long enough in my hands
Can't remember how I went from good to bad
Now I just reminisce, I just reminisce on everything we had
The times you used to call me baby
Driving in your own Mercedes
That fells like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to
Tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what
You meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I nеver meant for it to went this way
I wish that I could say this facе to face
Holding for hope your mind would change
'Cause I want you back, I need you back to take this pain away
The times you used to call me baby
Driving in your own Mercedes
That fells like a distant memory now
If I had one chance to
Tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what
You meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
My only request
I wish you the best
But I can't get no sleep, I can't get no rest
My head is a mess
Between no and yes
Right now you're heavy on my mind
I don't wanna guess what you're thinking tonight
I want the facts, I don't want no more lies
I just wanna a chance to make it right
I just wanna a chance to make it right
If I had one chance to
Tell you how I loved you
I'd be down on my knees
If I had one moment
Just to let you know what
You meant to me
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listen
I'm begging for forgiveness
If only you would listenI see the lights
Dancing, dancing in your eyes
So how do I begin to tell you now
That I can be the one to bring your angel out?
In this life of sin
I can be your muse, I can be your ally
I can be your moon, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven tonight
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
They say love is religion
There's a fire
Rising in my heart like a choir
I can hear them singing our favourite song
The one that played while I was layin' in your arms
Just let me stay in your arms 'cause
I can be your gold, I can be your delight
I can be feed your soul, I can be your sacrifice
I can be forever, little touch of Heaven for life
Put your hands together and close your eyes
Tell me you believe, get down on your knees
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me
I don't wanna preach, but I'm all that you need
They say love is religion, so say a prayer with me

3 A.M. and my neighbors hate me
Music blasting, shaking these walls
This time Mary Jane won't save me
I've been working later, I've been drinking stronger
I've been smoking deeper, but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
Like poison coursing through me
So clear my vision is blurred
The haze won't put my mind at ease
I've been working later, I've been breathing stronger
I've been smoking deeper, but the memories won't stop
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I want you all
Say it before you run out of time
I want you all
Say it before it's too late
I want you all
Say what I am feeling now
I want you all
Waiting is insane
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't stop thinking 'bout you
I can't get high, I can't get by, I can't get through
I can't stop thinking 'bout youI, I can't lie , I'm scared to open my eyes

You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em, ey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I keep pushin' forwards, but he keeps pullin' me backwards
Now I'm standin' back from it, I finally see the pattern
But my love, he doesn't love me, so I tell myself, 
I tell myself
I do, I do, I do
One: Don't pick up the phone
You know he's only callin' 'cause he's drunk and alone
Two: Don't let him in
You'll have to kick him out again
Three: Don't be his friend
You know you're gonna wake up in his bed in the morning
And if you're under him, you ain't gettin' over him
I got new rules, I count 'em, hey
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
I got new rules, I count 'em
I gotta tell them to myself
Practice makes perfect
I'm still tryna learn it by heart
Eat, sleep, and breathe it
Rehearse and repeat it, 'cause I

Alright, we're gonna need to sing this toegther
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't let him in, don't let him in
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Don't be his friend, don't be his friend
Don't, don't, don't, don't
Why? You're gettin' over him
That's right!I, I can't lie, I'm scared to open my eyes
'Cause what if I find nothing at all, nothing at all?
What is the point of my lips if they don't make noise? Oh
What is the point of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Real fantasy, wishing it was make-believe, oh
What is the reason of doing nothing at all, watching it fall?
The flicker burning, you know the time is running, running out
Only I see, oh, the diamonds, diamonds breaking down
I won't stay quiet, I won't stay quiet
'Cause staying silent's the same as dying
I won't stay quiet, the flicker's burning now
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
Tread heavily around me
Tread heavily around me
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
This is not a, this is not a swan, swan song
We just gotta, we just gotta hold on tonight
This is not a, this is not a swan song, swan song, swan dive
Yeah, it's a new life
It's a new lifeLyrics for this song haven't released, check back later when the lyrics release For sure

I wonder, when you go, if I stay on your mind
Two can play that game, but you win me every time
Everyone before you was a waste of time
Yeah, you got me
I would've stayed at home 'cause I You call me all friendly
Tellin' me how much you miss me
That's funny, I guess you've heard my songs
Well, I'm too busy for your business
Go find a girl who wants to listen
'Cause if you think I was born yesterday, you have got me wrong
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
I remember that weekend
When my best friend caught you creepin'
You blamed it
So, I made my decision
'Cause you made your bed, sleep in it
Play the victim and switch your position
I'm through, I'm done
So I cut you off
I don't need your love
'Cause I already cried enough
I've been done
I've been movin' on since we said goodbye
I cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't need your love
So stop tryna get to me
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't need your love
'Cause of you
You keep reminiscin' on when you were my man
But I'm over you
Now you're all in the past
You talk all that sweet talk, but I ain't comin' back
Cut you off
I don't need your love
So you can try all you want
Your time is up, I'll tell you why
I'll tell you why
You say you're sorry, but it's too late now
So save it, get gone, shut up
'Cause if you think I care about you now
Well, boy, I don't need your love
I see you tryna get to me
I see you beggin' on your knees
Boy, I don't need your love
So stop tryna get to me 
Tch, get up off your knees
'Cause, boy, I don't need your loveMaybe one day, I can see you
We can smile and wave, and it'll be okay
Maybe one day, it'll be cool
We could just be friends without the complications that it brings
When we start saying things
Yeah, I hurt you, and you hurt me
Yeah, we did some things that we can never take back
And we tried hard just to fix it
But we broke it more
And so, I guess some things are not meant to last
Is it too much to ask?
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold еach other, use each othеr, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
In a dark room
We don't have to see the light of truth between me and you
We can stay blind in the meantime
Let our bodies say what we can never seem to communicate
Even though it's too late
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
Just for tonight
Pretend that it's all alright 
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes 
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
No goodbyes
No goodbyes
No goodbyes, eh
Maybe one day, I'll see you
Just smile and wave and be okay
For tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
For tonight
Pretend that it's all alright
Why don't we hold each other, use each other, whisper pretty lies?
Just for tonight
Let's love like there's no goodbyes
