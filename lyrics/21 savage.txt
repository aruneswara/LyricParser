Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade, I got caught with a pistol
Sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade, started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade, I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward, nigga, 2016

How many times did you ride? 
How many niggas done died? 
How many times did you cheat? 
How many times did you lie? 
How many times did she leave? 
How many times did she cry? 
How many chances she done gave you fuckin around with these thots? 
Every day that I'm alive, I’ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain’t no way I'ma switch
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats
How much money you got? 
How many problems you got? 
How many people done doubted you? 
Left you out to rot? 
How many pray that you flop? 
How many lawyers you got?

Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? 
Getting they plays from machines? 
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem 
I never say anything , everybody got they thing 
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes 
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I’m aware
I been playing it back from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I’ll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It’s got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
’Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
How much money you got? 
How many problems you got? 
How many people done doubted you? 
Left you out to rot? 
How many pray that you flop?

Are things better or worse the second time around?
Can we really do anything more than once?October '92 when you pushed me out 
It was only right that I made a song about you 
Ain’t no tellin' where I'd be if I went without you 
Wish I woulda stayed in school, but I dropped out 
You taught me how to be strong, gotta give praise 
When the times got hard, you always made ways 
Even though I barely got the new Js 
You made sure the kid kept a temp fade 
And you kept my PlayStation with some new games 
And you buy me freezy cups with your loose change 
My daddy never was around, that nigga too lame 
I think that's why I quit school and started to shoot thangs 
My mama taught me how to tie my shoes 
My mama taught me how to cook my noodles 
Mama told me don't spend all my money with a jeweler
I bought some real estate plus I'm investin' in my shooters 
Had to write a letter to my ma dukes 
I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too 
You the only woman I'd give some vows to 
I’m still your baby even though I got a child, too 
I paid it off, ain’t no mortgage or no rent due 
Yes, she got a Range Rover and a Benz, too 
It's a hard job, but women raise men, too 
Ma, you never left my side and I thank you 
I seen you strugglin’, I think it left a scar 
I did some things when I was young that broke your heart 
I'm the one that stole the cookies out the jar 
I'm the one that went and stole the neighbor's car 
Times got hard, started sellin' hard 
Before I see you stressin', I'm gonna break the law 
I was sellin' weed, I never mowed the lawn 
Commit a burglary and take it to the pawn 
When I went to YDC you was there 
If I had a school hearing, you was there 
Back when you had the Ford minivan, let me drive to Citi Trends
Baggy-ass Girbauds and some Timberlands 
Me and my baby mama was beefin', you didn't give a damn 
You didn't never pick a side, told me, "Be a man" 
I'ma raise my kids, nothin' like my dad, I'm a better dad
You're the best mama I could ever have 
Had to write a letter to my ma dukes 
I know you proud of me, but I'm proud, too 
You the only woman I'd give some vows to 
I'm still your baby even though I got a child, too 
I paid it off, ain't no mortgage or no rent due 
Yes, she got a Range Rover and a Benz, too 
It's a hard job, but women raise men, too 
Ma, you never left my side and I thank you If Young Metro don't trust you I'm gon' shoot you

7.6, .223s
Who copped deuces? PleaseYeah, rest in peace to love
October 22nd, 1992
July 8th, 2009 
You will be missed forever 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
Woulda never went against you ever 
I even tried to make the grudge settle 
Yeah, I heard that you slept with a couple fellas 
Still treated you like a virgin because I know you better 
When she suck it, take my soul, she a whole devil 
Bought a Wagon then I covered it with rose petals 
She didn't think I was romantic 'cause I'm so ghetto
Got a Patek and a Birkin, it was fundamental
Then the situation took a U-turn 
Foundation crumbled and the roof burned 
I ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco
But I never, ever brought the dirt home 
Man, we both played each other, you was worse, though 
Always blamin' me because I did it first, though 
You started sleepin' with your phone in your purse, though
And you had that pussy nigga fragrance on your skirt, ho 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
I had your back, you put a knife in mine 
If you was finna lose your life, I woulda gave you mine 
I sit back and reminisce sometimes 
I used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine 
Can't believe what we came to 
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through 
Heard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do 
Got my first taste of love and I thank you 
Savage, never let another woman taint you 
Fallen victim to my feelings, something I can't do 
Get revenge on every bitch, even if it ain't you 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
Truly genuine love never really dies
But lust, infatuation, and unrevealed attraction are all things that over time rarely surviveFukk 12
A hundred a zip and I'm sippin' on drop
I hit for a hunnit' and I bought me a drop
I pulled up on her and panties just drop
Up 32 shots and you niggas gon' drop
Off with your top , give a fuck bout your block 1 2
High speed chasing, give a fuck bout the cops
When I see 12, put the dope in my sock
Niggas be rappin, I came up off rocks

They tried to betray me
I'm mad at myself cause I keep it real with all these niggas
Niggas actin like bitches, niggas all in they feelings
These niggas acting like women
Drowning in money, I'm swimmin'
These bitches acting like pigeons
I just want a couple million, I just want a couple million
And I'm still loyal to the gang
These other niggas man, they lame

Hit 'em all in the body, I just caught another body
Lord forgive me I'm sorry, I can't help it, I'm a street nigga
I had to get some money, I watched my momma struggle
I jumped off the porch, had to use my muscle
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face 
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith
I just nutted on her face
Brand new rollie with the face
No face, no case
Lord forgive me for my sins, I was struggling tryna win
I had to lose a lot of friends, nigga tryna chase them m's
Cooking up crack its illegal, riding with a Desert Eagle
I'm a felon, that's illegal, main bitch, she illegal
Hunnid pounds of Cali reefer, Call of duty heat seeker
Pull up on ya in a Regal, window down nigga creeping
Nigga rapping? I'm preachin', nigga we are not equal
In the trenches, niggas beefing, I remember not sleeping
Hit the club and get to squeezing, shoot it up for no reason
I was living like a demon, I was living like a demon
Now I lay me down to sleep, I pray the lord, my soul to keep
If I should die before I wake, I pray the lord my soul to take
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
They keep askin' why I got that sword in my face 
Lord forgive me, lord forgive me, lord
I just beat another case
I just went and bought a Wraith

Black Air Force 1s dancing with the devil 
His wifey trouble, thot was finna cut her, I pulled out a rubber
Opps tried to slide on my brother, had to up that cutter
When it's smoke, we huddle, so many shots, damn near shot each other
AR st-st-stutter, Draco brown, look like peanut butter
Don't play tic-tac-toe or tit-for-tat, nigga, this ain't that 
He was talking gangster on them tracks 'til I got him whacked

Y'all be smoking make-believe opps, we be smoking, facts

We don't shoot at houses, we hit brains, y'all lil' niggas lame
Fell in love with them chopper sounds, Waka Flocka Flame
Slidin'
Lookin' for the opps, they been hidin'
I grew up 'round drugs, sex, and violence
We turnt off they street, we heard sirens
Since a juvenile, I been wildin'
Chrome Heart jeans got me stylin'

While you was in college I was robbin' 
Everybody run to they car

Shoot him in the back like he Rick 
Playing freeze tag, niggas it

Lookin' for the opps, they been hidin'
I grew up 'round drugs, sex, and violence
We turnt off they street, we heard sirens
Since a juvenile, I been wildin'
Chrome Heart jeans got me stylin'
Said he wanted smoke, now he joggin'
While you was in college I was robbin' 
When your vision is crystal clear, they say it's razor-sharp
A focused mind is said to be like a knife, but the scalpel is wisdom
All one can do is accept that life is a double-edged sword
Stay on the edgeSo icy
Yeah
 'Fore I take a nap , ’fore I go to sleep 
Count a hunnid racks while I'm praying on my knees 
Choppa with the 50, wicker make the bitch breathe

So much money that the government think we do treason 
Policin', niggas pulling up to the precinct 
Anemic, diamonds walkin' through the mall, leanin' 
Me and the five like Kel and Kenan 
Shit was fucked up, we were stuck in Vienna 
Mastering my flow, this shit is sick, pneumonia 
My flow abnormal, put you in a coma 
A stick and stoner, money make me horny 
Pull up, stake banana cookie in the mornin' 
Money that we makin' ain't regular degular 
Roll up a Backwood and I been smoking on medical 
Matchin' with the jewerly, with the cars, etcetera 
We go to war, we pull up with the metal up 
Checks, more checks, more checks, check the schedule

Pulling my strings, strings, get my bungee up 
I don't wanna hit the bitch, let my buddy fuck 
Rollin' up the purple punch and it got a must 
Bases loaded, I'm the batter-up

Got on long sleeves, but I still bear arms
Rockin' Christian Dior, nigga, I'm in rare form
Savage ball like '97, '98 Jordan
Step back, shoot you in your face like I'm James Harden
When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?
Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?
I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though
Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold
I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro
Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though
I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro
This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on
Right hand on my Glock, left hand on her coochie
Cock the chop, hit your top, nigga, Bruce Lee
I'm the boogeyman, pussies can't spook me
Got your BM on my line talkin' 'bout, "Scoop me"
You know I got a soft spot for the hoochies
I don't talk to bitches, bitches talk the bullshit
I bought every pair of Amiris in the boutique
You know we want all the smoke, nigga, Lucy
I'll never fall off, I might take a break
You know either way it go, my family gon' be straight
Still in debt from all the losses that I had to take
When you out here tryna evolve, they gon' call you fake
I can't turn my back on the gang no matter what I make
I done took a lot of risks to make sure niggas ate
Superhero in my hood, I don't need a cape
I be lost sometimes, feelin' like I'm runnin' in place
When it's all said and done, who you gon' ride for?
Who you gon' slide for? Who you down to die for?
I gave her my heart, she was tellin' lies, though
Sleepin' with my guys, though, that shit turned my heart cold
I came from the bottom, I didn't have a dime, bro
Apartments with the blinds, bro, still got on my grind, though
I know my mama proud, everybody fine, bro
This shit took some time, bro, finally get my shine on
When all is said and done
We can only judge, punish, reward, enslave, and free ourselves
There will always be doubters and haters, but they only have the power you give them
Remain focused, move forward, and never lose faith in yourself
Until next time, stay in Savage Mode
Because anything else would be too damn civilized
PeaceA regular citizen who reports seeing a crime isn't a "snitch" or a "rat," the criminals were just sloppy
Snitches and rats are not the same thing, let me break it down to make sure y'all see what I mean
A "snitch" is someone minding other folks' business
To find information they can sell for a price or trade for some other form of compensation
A "rat" is a traitor, a conceiver, planner, or physical participator
He doesn't sell secrets for power or cash, he betrays the trust of his team or his family hoping to save his own cowardly ass
The difference is, at least a snitch is human, but a rat is a fuckin' rat, periodMetro in this bitch goin' brazy
Made it out the dirt, I was head first
A nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to serve
Couldn't go to work, school was the worst
Pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Lambo real fast, fell in love with cash
Fell in love with head, ayy, I fell in love with ass
Science, I was 'sleep, ayy, I fell in love with math
She was at the club, ayy, I made her take a bath
Ayy, I'm King Smoke, so I got a drum on the stick
Gang was in there, I can't put my tongue on that shit
He was talkin' crazy 'til that hollow hit his lip
Ayy, Big 4L, even the killers gettin' killed
All you see is Pateks and APs in my clique
Wе got all the bottles and the hookah in thе VIP
I might be a rapper, but it's thirty in this clip
Ayy, Zone 6, we get niggas buried 'round this bitch
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
My lil' niggas don't wanna trap, they wanna spin
Ayy, spin, fill the choppas up, then spin again
Free my dawg, he not ink, so why he in a pen'?
From Atlanta, not Vegas, but I still sin
Ayy, chain like a yo-yo, ride me like a pogo
She from out of D.C., when she fuck me, she play go-go
Used to sip lines, now a nigga sippin' Fours, though
Niggas rappin' gangsta, but they really hoes, though
Street niggas, streets don't talk, but you told, though
Rattail hangin' in the hood, boy, you bold bold
We ain't tryna hear 'bout all the bricks that you sold sold
They don't need a badge, but them niggas still the po-po
Focused on my bag, focused on my money
I done had some dark days, I done had some sunny
Niggas think they hot, I think niggas funny
Ayy, yellow baguette, VV-VVS's look like honey
All my diamonds pissed on, ayy, Andre Drummond
My playa won't even pull inside the 'partments 'cause they haunted
My dawg could've passed me the ball, but he punted
Got my turn, did a onside kick, that's how I'm comin'
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all

You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
A wise man knows not to have a lot of enemies
The friction of constant conflict is a distraction in life
And left unchecked can end up being what subtracts him from life
If possible, all enemies should be eliminatedStep on a nigga in my Air Force 1s
Step on a nigga in some fuckin' Jordan 1s
Step on a nigga with this dirty-ass gun
It was one late night, I was cruisin' the street
We ain't had nothing to do, so we was looking for beef
Got a Glock in my hand and a stick in the Jeep
Stomping niggas 'round town, but I grew up on the East
Roll the window down, seen elbows and feet
I was kickin' up smoke, you was copping a plea
Yeah, we turned him to zaza, now his face on a tee
I be smokin' on opps, roll 'em up by the P 
Chopper keep shakin', the beat keep breakin'

They can be years or even generations apart in age
And yet, somehow, find themselves on the exact same page
When these men join forces to put the focus of reaching the same goals, to attain the same outcomes, they are not two, but one
Instead of simply adding one's common attributes to another's, they somehow tend to multiply all attributes of both
Whether from St. Louis or East Atlanta
Whether from a savage land or a booming metropolis
Whether they are two or two billion, the greatest their numbers could ever become, is to truly become one

How many pray that you flop? 
How many lawyers you got? 
How many times you got shot? 
How many niggas you shot? 
How many times did you ride? 
How many niggas done died? 
How many times did you cheat? 
How many times did you lie? 
How many times did she leave? 
How many times did she cry? 
How many chances she done gave you fuckin around with these thots? 
Every day that I'm alive, I'ma ride with the stick
I'd rather be broke in jail than be dead and rich
Told my brothers take my breath if I turn to a snitch
But I'm 21 4L, ain't no way I'ma switch
Break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
I break it down, I break it down
Penitentiary chances just to make a couple bucks
My heart so cold I could put it in my cup
Gang vs. the world, me and my dawg, it was us
Then you went and wrote a statement, and that really fucked me up
My brother lost his life and it turned me to a beast
My brother got life and it turned me to the streets
I been through the storm and it turned me to a G
But the other side was sunny, I get paid to rap on beats
How much money you got? 
How many problems you got? 
How many people done doubted you? 
Left you out to rot? 
How many pray that you flop? 
How many lawyers you got? 
How many times you got shot?

Yeah, I just came from the A
I drove back home, six-hour drive, six-and-a-half
Before I left I stopped by to see my nigga 21 in the studio
He had two of his kids with him right in the studio, that's when I knew
You a stand up nigga, I love seein' shit like that
Question
How many faking they streams? 
Getting they plays from machines? 
I can see behind the smoke and mirrors
Niggas ain't really big as they seem 
I never say anything , everybody got they thing 
Some niggas make millions, other niggas make memes 
I'm on a money routine
I don't want smoke, I want cream
I don't want no more comparisons
This is a marathon and I'm aware
I been playing a bet from a lack of promotions
I never was one for the bragging and boasting
I guess I was hoping the music would speak for itself, but the people want everything else
Okay, no problem, I'll show up on everyone album
You know what the outcome will be
I'm batting a thousand
It's got to the point that these rappers don't even like rappin' with me
Fuck it 'cause my nigga 21 Savage just hit me
And told me he saved me a spot on a new record he got
He call it "a lot," I open my book and I jot
Pray for Tekashi, they want him to rot
I picture him inside a cell on a cot
'Flectin' on how he made it to the top
Wondering if it was worth it or not
I pray for Markelle 'cause they fucked up his shot
Just want you to know that you got it, my nigga
Though I never met you, I know that you special
And that the Lord blessed you, don't doubt it, my nigga
Dennis Smith, Jr., stay solid, my nigga
I'm on a tangent, not how I planned it
I had some fans that hopped and abandoned ship
When they thought that I wasn't gone pan out, I got a plan
They say that success is the greatest revenge, tell all your friends
Cole on a mission, cementin' the spot as the greatest that did it
Before it all ends, nigga
How much money you got? 
How many problems you got? 
How many people done doubted you? 
Left you out to rot? 
How many pray that you flop?

How many niggas done died? 
How many times did you cheat? 
How many times did you lie? 
How many times did she leave? 
How many times did she cry? 
How many chances she done gave you?
Fuck around with these thots 
Take a dive, put away my pride 
Shoot my shot, DMs, yeah, I slide 
She in front, but she used to be my side 
We take selfies now, I used to in her live 
Before the fame, plan B was robbin' banks 
Be a married man, right now I just can't 
All the love they gave me, knew that it was fake 
Mama love me so much, either way I'm straight 
I done seen so many handshakes turn to hate 
Seen so many BFs turn s-n-a-k 
Death before dishonor tatted on my face 
Way I run the check up, should've been with Chase 
Start at the bottom, the trenches, the gutters, so I had to go little harder 
Lights was out, the gas was off, so we had to boil up the water 
Been through some things, but I couldn't imagine my kids stuck at the border 
Flint still need water 
Niggas was innocent, couldn't get lawyers 
How much money you got? 
How many problems you got?

All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
My heart so cold, I’m sticking to the code
Fake niggas bend, real niggas don’t fold
I’m tricking J’s daily, selling sheetrock for blow
In my younger days nigga I was robbing stores
Still got it for the low
Judge give you the book, hang your ass without a rope
When you at the bottom seem like you ain’t got hope
And when you got kids nigga anything will go
Green dots at funerals, they got my head fucked up
Can’t digest these percocets, they got my chest fucked up
Pussy niggas shot me six times, my luck fucked up
Hundred band lick pussy nigga, now I’m fucked up

And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
Fast paper had me dropping out of school
Violating laws, breaking all the rules
Smoking marijuana, riding with them tools
Hanging ‘round hustlers, robbers, and fools
Hand to hand with strangers, watching from an angle
Praying for an angel, protection from danger
Cause I done seen plenty niggas died that had a banger
And I done seen them niggas’ partner ride out of anger
And never came back, about them greenbacks
Now have you seen that? These are obscene facts
And just because we paid, the stress don’t decay
Still thinking ‘bout them losses, winning never made ‘em fade
With Gs being dead and  on my mental
It hurt so bad that I can’t do the shit I didn’t do
To keep my niggas here with me, I swear that shit be killing me
I hope you niggas feelin’ me ‘cause I know that you hearing me
And just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok, no
Man just because we smile and play
That don’t mean that everything is going ok
My heart so cold, I can never fold
I’m on the paper chase man, fuck these hoes
I’m poppin’ pain pills, got my heart moving slow
All I know is hustle ‘cause I hate being broke
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit
These clothes ain’t shit, you know these hoes ain’t shit
And man this money ain’t shit, these cars ain’t shit

Come up with a plan, better huddle

When there's smoke, we pull our stickies and they call the PD 
Many men wanna kill me, dawg, I feel like 50 
I got small fries want my spot, tryna defeat me 
I got real model bitches tryna R&B me 
All that cap inside your raps, I ain't even play your CD 
Won't go back and forth on the internet, we put niggas on TV

This that Savage Mode II: Chopped Up Not Slopped Up
Made it out the dirt, I was head first
A nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to serve
Made it out the dirt, I was head first
A nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to, and I used to—
Made it out the dirt, I was head first
A nigga used to rob, ayy, and I used to serve
Couldn't, couldn't go to work, school was the worst
Pussy, pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Pussy tried to play me, ayy, put him on a shirt
Lambo real fast, fell in love with cash
Fell in love with head, ayy, I fell in love with ass
Science, sciеnce, I was 'sleep, ayy, I fell in love with math
Shе was, she was at the club, ayy, I made her take a bath
Ayy, I'm King Smoke, so I got a drum on the stick
Gang was in there, I can't put my tongue on that shit
He was talkin' crazy 'til that hollow hit his lip
Ayy, Big 4L, even the killers gettin' killed
All you see is Pateks and APs in my clique
We got all the bottles and the hookah in the VIP
I might, I might be a rapper, but it's thirty in this clip
Ayy, Zone 6, we get niggas buried 'round this bitch
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
Drac', Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
My lil' niggas don't wanna trap, they wanna spin
Ayy, spin, fill the choppas up, then spin again
Free my dawg, he not ink, so why he in a pen'?
From Atlanta, not Vegas, but I still sin
Ayy, chain like a yo-yo, ride me like a pogo
She from out of D.C., when she fuck me, she play go-go
Used to, used to sip lines, now a nigga sippin' Fours, though
Niggas rappin' gangsta, but they really hoes, though
Street niggas, streets don't talk, talk, but you told, though
Rattail hangin' in the hood, hood, boy, you bold bold
We ain't, we ain't tryna hear 'bout all the bricks that you sold sold
They don't need a badge, but them niggas still the po-po
Focused on my bag, focused on my money
I done had some dark days, I done had some sunny
Niggas think they hot, I think niggas funny
Ayy, yellow baguette, VV-VVS's look like honey
All my diamonds pissed on, ayy, Andre Drummond
My playa, my playa won't even pull inside the 'partments 'cause they haunted
My dawg, my dawg could've passed me the ball, but he punted
Got my turn, did a onside kick, that's how I'm comin'
Pitbull the way I walk, way I talk
Loose lips sink ships, yellow tape, white chalk
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Ain't no cap in my rap, ain't no flaw
You could tell it when I rap, ain't no cut, this shit raw
Cut him off if he talkin' to the law
I'm with Draco 'cause he quiet 'til he hit you in the jaw
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all
Multitask, use the pistol and the fork
Screamin', "No opp left behind," nigga, we gon' kill 'em all

Jiggalicious
I see you baby
Straight up
I came through and I show love, it was all good 
I got three sisters, two baby mamas, they all good 
I cut some friends off, I don't even talk to 'em 
Last year she had my heart, now I don't talk to her 
Summertime, sundress, she impressed, no
Yeah cut that lame off, now her skin glows
Swipe her nose, swipin' 'caine, you give me back my flows
And your boyfriend on the bench, he do not score
She call me all the time 
Even though you with her, shе still mine 
Ninety percent of my exes, are some nines 
The other ten percent, they some dimes 
She went through a divorce 
She didn't go to court 
Told her keep his money 
I buy her a Porsche 
Drinkin' with her friends 
Passin' the  I score 
Alone, I'm single 
Rockin' Lousi Vuitton 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
This ummertime she got on her sundress 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
By the way your skin glowin', I know you ain't stressed 
I bought her Valentino, now she fill refreshed 
That booty got some jiggalition, can I be honest? 
She remind me of the time, that I hit it best 
Don't nobody hit it better, she know that's a fact 
I just joined on her live, and it's lookin' fat 
Girl you fine and let a nigga slide in 
Took her out the Kia and I went and bought a Benz 
I've been peepin' how you movin' then I'm choosin' 
I'm a winner, baby, and your nigga losin' 
Your body look like bubblegum, I'm tryna chew it 
I'm a big Blood, baby be my ruby 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
This ummertime she got on her sundress 
Summertime she got on her sundress 
By the way your skin glowin', I know you ain't stressed 
I bought her Valentino, now she fill refreshed 
That booty got some jiggalition, can I be honest? 
She remind me of the time, that I hit it best Lyrics from Snippet

Just because it ain't happened yet, don't think that's it not 
Nipsey was solid, I know that he up there with Biggie and Pac
My choppa could tell you a story, I pray that you don't try to plot
Stayed a hundred, couple niggas changed
I ain't never went against the grain, I could never snort cocaine
I could never fuck a bitch behind my brother then try to turn her to my main
Clout chasin' got him in a wood box, can't believe he died for the fame
He'll risk it all for a name, I was comin' hard 'fore I came
I ain't know nothin' 'bout no Visa, I was in thе park with the gang
Moms be feelin' bad, I try to tell hеr she is not to blame
No social security, couldn't get a license, but I still didn't complain
I went and got it, I ain't ask for no handout
Lil' nigga, we are not the same
You know what I'm on, first girlfriend did me wrong
I swear to God that every girl after that, I was gon' do 'em wrong
Different bitch in my bed every night, but I still be feelin' alone
Matter fact I'm finna be with one, probably right after I finish this song
That's my dawg
He gon' ride off the leash
He gon', he gon' slide, she know I cheat 
She know I lie, I be geeked up, I be fried 
Sweep the room, we pull up with brooms 
Smokin' Girl Scout, you can smell the fumes 
Don't approach me 'bout your wifey if she choose 
Last scrub did—
You can smell the fumes 
Don't approach me 'bout your wifey if she choose 
You can smell the fumes 
Don't approach me 'bout your wifey if she choose 
Last scrub did that made the news 
Nigga keep talkin' that U.K. shit like I don't got AKs 
Like, 'cause I was born overseas, these motherfuckers ain't gon' spray-spray 
Pull up in your hood, nigga, 9-1-1, y'all better call mayday 
From Glenwood all the way to Martin Luther King, niggas know we don't play-play
Caught him down bad , broad daylight, I ain't need no mask 
Paid in full , all the opp hoes get shot in the ass
Strip a rap nigga if I ever get low on cash 
Middle school, I ain't go to class, I was hangin' in the hallway, I ain't have a pass 
High school, I ain't even go, I was hangin' in the colony tryna sell gas 
In a hotbox with Chevy, Lil Harold, and Rock, ready to crash 
Tried to break in the pawnshop on Candler Road, but the rod wouldn't smash 
Larry got, Larry got killed, couldn't believe this shit, man, the tears started falling' down fast 
Lick on, lick on McAfee, found a ho, split, but we really had came for the cash 
I'm prayin', I'm prayin' to Ogun there's much shit in the street and my past 
Told T, Told T-Tay that buddy was a fuck nigga, boom, he got on the stand 
200, 200K to the lawyer, lil' brother, gon' make sure you get out the cans 
That's my dawg 
He gon' ride  off the leash 
He gon' slide , she know I cheat 
She know I lie , I be geeked, geeked up, I be fried 
Sweep the room, we pull up with brooms

October 22nd, 1992
July 8th, 2009 
You will be missed forever 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My, my shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
Woulda, woulda never wеnt against you ever 
I evеn tried to make the grudge settle 
Yeah, I heard that you slept with a couple fellas 
Still treated you like a virgin 'cause I know you better 
When she suck it, take my soul, she a whole devil 
Bought a Wagon then I covered it with rose petals 
She didn't think I was romantic 'cause I'm so ghetto
Got a Patek and a Birkin, it was fundamental
Then the, then the situation took a U-turn 
Foundation crumbled and the roof burned 
I ain't perfect, I was slidin' like a earthworm, loco
But I never, ever brought the dirt home 
Man, we both played each other, you was worse, though 
Always blamin' me because I did it first, though 
You started sleepin' with your phone in your purse, purse, though
And you had that pussy nigga fragrance, fragrance on your skirt, ho 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Hard times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cry, cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on 
I had your back, you put a knife in mine 
If you was finna lose your life, I woulda gave you mine 
I sit back and reminisce sometimes 
I used to drink my syrup while you drank your wine 
Can't believe what we came to 
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through 
Heard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do 
Got my—
Can't believe what we came to 
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through 
Heard he put his hands on you, that's what lames do 
Can't believe what we came to 
You won't believe what the fame do
We ain't together, any problems, I still came through 
He put his, put his hands on you, that's what lames do 
Got my first taste of love and I thank you 
Savage, never let another woman taint you 
Fallen victim to my feelings, something I can't do 
Get revenge on every bitch, even if it ain't you 
Rest in peace to love, I gave up a long time ago 
Times, times, everybody left, I'm the one you counted on 
My shoulder took a lot of tears, woulda swore it was a fountain on 
I be cryin' on the inside and smilin' when the cameras on

Why these niggas cappin' so hard?
Why you got a 12 car garage?
Why you pullin' all these rappers' cards?
'Cause these niggas pussy and I'm hard
I turn that fuckin' soft into some hard
I grew up in the streets without no heart
I'm prayin' to my Glock and my carbon
I sit back and read like Cat in the Hat
21 Savage, the cat with the MAC
21 Savage not Boyz N The Hood
But I pull up on you, shoot your ass in the back

Pockets full of cheese, bitch I got racks
I'm a real street nigga, bitch
I am not one of these niggas bangin' on wax
Pussy niggas love sneak dissin'
'Til I pull up on 'em, slap 'em out with the fire
Wet your mama's house, wet your grandma's house
Keep shootin' until somebody die
So many shots the neighbor looked at the calendar
Thought it was Fourth of July
You was with your friends playin' Nintendo
I was playin' 'round with that fire
Seventh grade I got caught with a pistol, sent me to Panthersville
Eighth grade started playin' football
Then I was like fuck the field
Ninth grade I was knocking niggas out
Nigga like Holyfield
Fast forward nigga, 2016
And I'm screaming fuck a deal
Bad bitch with me, she so thick
I don't even need a pill
I listen to your raps, thought you was hard
You ain't even street for real
Niggas love sneak dissin' on Twitter
They don't want beef for real
And all these niggas play like they tough
'Til a nigga get killed
'Til a nigga get spilled, 'til your blood get spilled
I'ma at your favorite rapper, shoot him like I'm John Dill'
"I been with you since day one
Savage I ain't even hatin'"
So what's up with all that Instagram shit?
"Savage I was just playin'"
Y'all pussy niggas fakin'

Pull up on you, tie your kids up
Pistol whip you while your bitch naked

        Lyrics from Snippet
Maybach V12, big dawg status
Get your ass whacked, I got a homicide fetish
Come pick up your bitch, I put my hot dog in her relish
Your baby mama test me, she want hot dog in her belly
How these niggas still gang-gang and they tellin'?
All my shooters workin' at Eliantte, but they killin'
She'll point a finger, but in private, she be stealin'
Thirty models in the house, I gave 'em each a minute
Yeah, you know, it's thirty models in the house, really
They say, "Use your time wisely," so I gave each of 'em a minute
Know what I'm sayin'? They enjoyed it too
You know it's enough of me to go around, don't be stingy
I'm in a Rover with a shooter
Got a college girl and a cougar
I got thirty hollows in this Ruger
And my Glock give lessons, it's a tutor
I ain't with the jibber jab, give your ass the quickest jab
I'm the type to buy a Bentley, you the type to skip a tabTrappin' off a Motorola
AK on my fuckin' shoulder
Nigga make you do the hauler
Buddah blessed this beat
Put a TEC-9 on my necklace 
Goin' against the gang, that's a death wish 
And I hold the pot with my left wrist 
Nigga I ride or die, I won't dare snitch 
I got residue on my clothes and shit 
Y'all niggas actin' like hoes and shit 
Gangbangin', thirty hangin' with the bros and shit 
I might put the toilet paper on your nose and shit 
Y'all with the yap-yap

She got that stink walk, twistin' like she know it's fat 
She got three kids, all of 'em got different dad 
Suck me up in a Ferrari, I'ma do the dash 
We already killed the shooter, where his brothers at? 
She say she want a lollipop, where the suckers at? 
I'ma pass her to the gang, I ain't cuffin that 
*whistle*
Ooh, watch the drip, watch the drip, watch the drip

Every city I touch, I got hoes and shit 
Fuck around and smoke a couple O's and shit

Welcome to Bahamas, meet my plug on the island
Smoke a whole a pound of green crack, got me fucked up
Literally found 20 bands, bitch I lucked up
Niggas don't wanna see me win, and I know it
Why I get that check, grab that check, and I blow it?
Fucked his baby mama first night, she was starstruck
That shit that's on my hip gone wake you up, nigga Starbucks
She gone suck a real nigga long, she got lockjaw
That money coming, going back and forth like a seesaw
Made me spill my double cup, that shit had me T'd off
Bitch I'm from the six you run up on me, blow your knees off

Young nigga ride around, brazy with them yop sticks
Water splashing in' n out that pot, I got sea sick

Fuck the rap game, man I do this shit for slam dunk
Nigga call my phone for a zoe, what the fuck you want?
Made a whole lot of Fetty with my Trap Queen

I pull up with shooters in a black van
Swing through your hood like Tarzan
Woo, Woo, pull up, pull up, I got dirty in my cup
I'm sipping on that syrup, I'm sipping on that syrup
