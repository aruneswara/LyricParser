You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit

Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

With a stone-cold neck, yeah, I'm charming
All the pretty girls in the world
But I'm in this space with you

Heartache would stay with you
Fly great escapes with you

Don't walk away, or would you wait for me?
I go out to the bar, fuck hangin' with the stars
Don't even have a car, but you would wait for me

You took my feelings and just threw 'em out the window
Feel like it's too hard to fall in love again, no

On some nights like this, I just wanna text you, but for what?
You gon' say you want me, then go switch it up
Just gon' play with my emotions just because, no 
All them times I played the fool for you
Thinkin' we could put it back together, thought we had forever
You never see my point of view
Our connection is so severed, you don't show no effort
And I can't believe the lies that I went for
Thought you was mine, but you decided to be with him though

You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin'
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

I'm seeing right past you, but you seem well aware
Your body is here but your mind is somewhere else
So far gone and you think I can't tell
Can't tell that you are disconnected
You pulled away and I miss your presence
I always said to you
Baby you should be here, right here
Baby you should be here, right here
Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now

Head on your chest babe, but your heart is so quiet
We use to talk all night long, now we laying in silence

And hoped that love had a happy ending
Baby you should be here, right here

Don't know where you went but you're lost now
Don't know where you went but you're gone now
You should be here, right here yeahI can hear your laugh, it's ringing through the hallways
I can see your smile, it's what gets me through my hard days
And your words were supposed to get me
Through my heartache, before my heartbreak
There's an emptiness that only few ever feel
And I somehow missed the meaning of love that is real
And it compliments my scars that will never heal
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage
And if you weren't gonna guide me
Why bring me into the light?
Must have done something
To make you want to run and hide
Why oh why didn't you just live your life?
And every girl needs a mother
And damn it I needed you
Instead you duck for cover
And you ran from the truth
And like kids do, you waited around for proof
Maybe I didn't deserve you
Maybe I just couldn't cure you
They told me that I didn't hurt you
Why do I feel like I turned you?
Maybe I don't understand it
Tell me is this how you planned it?
Did you see us so stranded
Maybe I'm too much to manage
Maybe I didn't deserve you...Damn right, we take turns bein' grown

But lovin' every minute, yeah, every minute that we share

They know I ain't playin' 'bout you

For the first time in a long time

When you see him, know that that's all me right thereYou saw right through every last bit of me
I should've known it from your energy
We've got this synergy, your soul feels close
Like it remembers me—instilled in me
90 degrees in California, you put chills in me
Said it's something about my city, something about my city
Oakland girls so damn hood but we're so damn pretty
Sometimes the town just brings you down
But we feel no pity
Don't need no extra bodies, I got the connect with me
It's why you connect with me, it's why you can step with me
Why you can go hit the carpets
Go 'head and get dressed with me
Make me forget my ex and you onto the next with me
Love has everything to do, Bobby needs his creds Whitney
I always said I'd be the one to do it
I changed the way they lookin' at us women makin' music
Go put back on the crown, stop makin' us look so stupid
Not worried about these niggas
Unless it's you then I'm choosin'
Even if I chose I feel like you're the right decision
Yeah you got aspirations, you ain't fuckin' up the vision
I love that you're not worried 'bout any other niggas
Only longing for persistence, only want something consistent
Does it make you nervous I'm not afraid to say what I want?
Does it put fear into your heart that I know where I started?
Far from where I begun?
Cause I know every man has a fear
Of a strong-minded woman
But I say she's a keeper if she got it
On her own and keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'They sleeping, they sleeping
They sleeping, they sleeping on me
But I don’t waste my time
Tryna prove that I’m something to see
Oh I, the real ones they know
And the ones that do not, I don’t need
'Cause most see the vision and I give reasons to believe
That I’m honest, I’m honest, I’m telling no lies
When I say I’m up next, I’m not just for the ride
Never a point when I questioned my mind
Know what I’m doing, I planned for this time
Come up regardless, I’m coming regardless
I’m hungry, I’m starving, remaining a topic
Never an option, got your undivided whenever I’m plotting
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it 
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it 
I know that you hear this
And you gon' just know that I’m speaking to you
Shouldn’t have got so ahead of yourself
Now you’re losing your cool
I know that you know that I’m right
You admitted that I am the truth
But look you at you now, look at your face
Looking sad in the booth
Signed off a tape,  toured off a tape
Did it alone, and I ain't touched a plate
You was my nigga, we could have been great
You so far gone, got you thinking you're safe
All said and done, you lost my respect
All said and done, you’re the one I regret
Now you gon' watch from the crowd
Lookin' up like the rest
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal 
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I need you to promise me one thing
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
That you not gon' take it like that
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it 
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it 
Now I could never judge anyone I loved
Even if you lose sight of all the things I’ve done
I’m not who I once was, these days I’m all grown up
I fuck with me heavy, I’m all chose up
And I only did right by you
When you fucked her, I stood right by you
Prayin' for the girls that believe your news
Prayin' for myself 'cause I be all truth
I got good heart, good soul, good sex
No stress, what's next for me is best
Don’t you run your mouth 'cause in this song I say it best
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it 
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
Don’t take it personal, personal, personal
I know it hurts to know, hurts to know, hurts to know
I don’t want it 
Don’t need it Are you putting her on your thing?
Oh my god, I'm gonna
It's gonna be like TMZ Kehlani TMZ 
And then he's gonna be suing me for slander 
If this isn't love, why do I feel this way?
Why you got me so obsessed with you?
Why you got me wasting time laying next to you?
Why do you tell me, "Come over"
To watch you just stare at your phone?
Don't know why I expected you
To give me attention, affection and love
You're like a drug, never enough
Can't take your high, need a new plug
You got me bent, got me way too messed up
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
Why do I I feel this 
I'm in my feelings 
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
Why do I do this 
I'm in my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelings
Why you be doing me scandalous?
You just assume that I'm strong and can handle it
Why do you make me feel like I'm less than my worth
And it won't be for long, I ain't having it
You don't do the shit that you said would be done
You find it fun, to feel shit and run
Love like a gun, it leaves me stunned
Out on the floor and I just can't get up
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
Why do  I feel this 
I'm in my feelings 
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
Why do I do this 
I'm in my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelings
Oh, why, why do I, why do I feel this way?
Why am I still this way?
Why after all these times, you still play all these games?
Why after all these nights, I still give you all my days?
And I don't know why I'm even still here
Can't shake it off, I've been here for years on top of years
And I, I'm ready to, I'm ready to, be off of you
'Cause I admit, that baby, I, I just may be stuck on you
Why do I pick up my phone every time that you call?
Why do I I feel this 
I'm in my feelings 
Why do I let you give me half then give you my all?
Why do I do this 
I'm in my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelings
 Uh-uh  Uh-uh  Uh-uh 
In my feelingsNever did I think I'd want you
Always seen you 'round my way
Never had the strength to tell you
I kinda, sorta think you're great
Strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's better by themselves
Hate to know I made you crazy for myself
'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
'Cause baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?
Admiring you from a distance
Scared to go and make a move
Didn't wanna be distracting
You be all up in your groove
It's strange for me to wanna love someone
Who's raw all by themselves
I'd hate for you to search for someone else
'Cause I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling up on out your way
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape, I just wanna be an escape
Baby can we escape, escape, escape?
Oh, no, no, no, no, no, no, no, ayy
'Cause I've been staying low, holding back
Fighting the feelings that you've been giving
And I've been trying to put it all into words
But I can't so I'm singing
I don't want you thinking
That my love's in vain
Baby, I've been falling for you
But falling back up out your way
'Cause I can't let you lose yourself, looking for me
And I can't let you make me your, your everything
I just wanna be an escape
I just wanna be an escape
Baby, can we escape, escape, escape?Swimming with a Pisces every night
Ain't really that deep, but he deep inside
Head like a Scorpio
Shy like a Cancer, water all of them planets
He said, "I wanna undress you
I wanna impress you, but I ain't gon' press you
I wanna undo the things I said before"
Damn, I ain't been this wet in years
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
It's the way you drink it all like you're thirsty
Tie me up, pin me down, show no mercy 
Nibble on it, kissing it like a Hershey 
You could be the boss, I'll let you work me
I'll let you finish on the tat, it say tsunami
Bust down on your future baby mommy 
Uh, fuckin' in the whip, top off 
Do a quick dick drop off 
Guess your old bitch is all talk
I ain't never seen it on soft
God damn, I wanna undress you
I wanna impress you, but I ain't gon' stress you
I wanna undo the things I said before
Damn, I ain't been this wet in years
Water, water 
Water , water
Water , water 
Water , water
Water, water
Water, water
Water, water
Water, waterMy condolences to anyone who has ever lost me
And, to anyone who got lost in me
Or, to anyone who ever felt they took a loss with me
My apologies for the misunderstanding or the lack thereof
I'm sorry you missed the God in me
And I'm sorry you missed the light
I'm sorry you forgot the way I arose like the moon
Night after night with the burden to forgive
Eager to feed you everything
See, I'm a holy woman
I know what it's like to give life to a being without ever needing to press skin against one another
I've practiced how to hold my tongue long enough
I'm afraid I forgot to say goodbye
I'm afraid you're under the impression
That I was made to please you
I was under the impression you understood me better
The truth is, I'm a superwoman
And some days I'm an angry woman
And some days I'm a crazy woman
For still waiting, for still loving harder even if I'm aching
For still trusting that I'm still worth the most
For still searching for someone to understand me betterTo be honest, I think we spend so much time
Trying to find answers for things
And maybe it's just not meant to be answered
I think sometimes the best things
Are in the unplanned and the unknown
And sometimes when we balance back and we do it
We don't know how we did it, we just do it
It's something in us, whether that's our intuition
Whether that's the way we been raised
Whether that's down to even what we put in our bodies
Do you get it? So I think—I think that can remain a mystery
And I think that's okay for it to remain a mystery
Does that make sense?
Tryna forget all of the messages
Tryna forget all of the stressin'
'Cause damn it was 
Tryna forget all of the secondary
Feelings I had, man, it was fuckin' scary
Tryna get back to all my old ways
Tryna get back to all the hobbies
From my old days 
Tryna forget all the unnecessary
Thoughts from my head, man, it was pretty scary
At least I learned a thing or two about me and you
What we went through, it made me who I am 
I can feel again, won't be numb again 
At least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
I don't miss it much, but it made me who I am 
I can feel again, won't be dumb again 
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind that I can't get right
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind, my heart's on my side
You said yourself, you made me who I am
You told me that after you, I would never love again 
Oh you made sure that I would lose myself
So I wouldn’t see, I needed no one else
You tell me that I was worth a million smiles
And tell me that I was worth a million miles
And tryna make sure that I forget the times that
You made me think that I just couldn't shine, yeah
At least I learned a thing or two about me and  you
What we went through, it made me who I am 
I can feel again, won't be numb again 
At least I didn't mess it up, that was all your touch
I don't miss it much but it made me who I am 
I can feel again, won't be dumb again 
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind that I can't get right
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind, my heart's on my side
On my side, yeah
On my side, yeah
Gotta get a little piece of mind
Gotta make sure that it feels just right
Gotta make sure that I’ll make it last this time
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind that I can't get right
Said I'm tryna break off a piece of mind
A piece of mind, my heart's on my sideG-G-G-Good work, Charlie
You know they don't wanna see us together
But it don't matter, no, 'cause I got you
Anytime you're under the weather

On the east side, in the late night, in a disguise
You know I could pull up on you, keep you all night

They don't wanna see it happen—but we say, "Fuck it"Every time we drew our lines
They grew legs and walked themselves down the road
Boundaries is my middle name
I give respect where it's asked or it's shown
Something 'bout our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
Never want to complain, love you with your wings babe
These are your skies
But then there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it off in the waves
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away, stay away
Oh, if only you knew just how you taste
Oh, if only you'd seen you walk away
Oh I'd follow you into yesterday
Then miles away
And I pray for the love that we had underneath
When we both promised not to waste love arguing
I love you more than I ever could say
And something about our exchange
It's a fight to act like you weren't in mind, or mine
And I never want to complain
Love you with your wings babe
These are your skies, your skies
And there was the blood from your heart on my hands again
Though I swore I washed it out in the rain
And I wish I was sorry, damn I wish I was sorry
That I don't know how to stay away
And don't say you don't want no problems
Can't hear through what I say
Say you want it your way
Always has been your way when it comes to me
Gun play, use my heart against me always
We can't seem to hold space
No way

As she parts her curls into four sections
She says, "I don't look like them, I don't look like her"
"And I don't want what's on my head"
But baby girl don't be misled 
Young woman reading magazines
Thinking to herself, nobody looks like me
Oh I've got all these curves, all this nerve
Why can't I keep a man?
But baby girl if you love yourself you can
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
A woman like the sun should always stay bright
Little boy sitting in the bleachers
Staring at, at his dirty sneakers
Thinking my shoes don't shine
Money is tight, I would never get a date
But baby boy that's not what it takes
Young man, always at the center
Finding ways to make his arms look bigger
Saying, "You see those guys?"
"They get all the girls, I just want to be like them"
But baby boy, you're spreading yourself thin
Can't nobody love somebody
That do not love themselves
You are what you choose to be
It's not up to no one else
So be great, be kind
Don't let them dim your light
Cause a man like the sun should always stay bright
Yes, you are like the sun so always stay brightNext nigga to fuck with me, gon' be stuck with me with his stuck ass. Bitch. Watch, look. Hold up, l-l-look, no time. Okay?

Change the scene, the things are better now

You liked it when I used to leave a wound
And promise I would come and kiss it

Text you like, "Good morning"
It's been a day, we ain't spoken
All of me feels frozen
How could you let it go like that?
How come it always goes like that?
Wondering where I mess up at
To always go through it, always go through this
Why I gotta beg to be chosen
Over your vices, over your liquor?
Why I gotta ask for flowers?
I deserve roses, I deserve bigger
I know you're tryna change, but is it all worth the wait?
It hurts to stay just as much as it hurts to walk away
You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop
Man, that shit don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
Don't stop
No, no, no, it don't stop
And I'll still tell the world I'm in love with you
'Cause I ain't ashamed of shit
Got your name tatted on my wrist
Any bitch got a bone to pick, you know whose phone to hit
'Cause I'm still with all the actions and all that shit
You're still my love, you're still my heart, that's still my dick
Still wanna be Mrs. Jackson, still wanna be your co-captain
So don't lose a girl of your dreams
Waited five years to be on my team
Looked damn good fucking with me
Love how I'm always on twenty
How I keep it tight and cleanly
Fuck you in the truck when it's empty
And I throw it back when you miss me
And I pull up when you hit me
I'ma say it loud so you hear me 
You got demons, I got trauma
We both got triggers, I hate drama 
I'm embarrassed, I'm in shock
Here wide open, and that don't stop 
And I watch your demons cause me trauma
Now I'm triggered, all this drama
You're embarrassed and in shock
And we still in love and that shit don't stop

Just so I can drive them real fuckin' slow
I like my own company
Company, I don't need it
I'm not always cold
I'm just good on my own, so good on my own
I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already done everything I dream
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing

Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures
Then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments
Complements how I'm feeling, oh
I'm not always selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not in my bones
I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind

How am I to know what you do?
What if you slip up?
What if tequila grab your neck and say, "Don't bitch up"?
What if you wanna shoot your shot and load the clip up?
Are you scared to lose your queen and gain a bishop?
Do I got you way too open to be open?
Is the lens you see me through just way too focused?
What if you're curious and caught up in the moment?
Can you hold me down when I'm across the ocean?
Can you control it?
Do I got you way too open to be open?
Would you let it twist up all of your emotions?
What if you're curious and caught up in the moment?
Do I got you way too open to be 
If I'm in AOD
Tryna stay lowkey
Shawty so religious way she prayin' on me
But if I take her to the private
Let her be my pilot
How should I know what to do?
And what if I slip up?
What if tequila grabs my neck and say, "Don't bitch up"?
What if I wanna shoot my shot and load the clip up?
And if I do the same, will you go play the victim?
Or do you got me way too open to be open?
Is the lens I see you through just way too focused?
What if I'm curious and caught up in the moment?
Will I mess around when you're across the ocean?
Can I control it? Oh woah

Made it out the mud, and still, it's cleanly
Pull up where I'm from and they respect me
Made some room for you up in the front seat
Slidin', need one to confide in
Then we hear the sirens, grindin'
I knew it was all in you
When I saw your eyes, then I met your hands
Lay it on my thigh, you control the cruise
I make you crazy when nobody watchin'
I'm out your way and I proceed with caution
Don't do too much talkin', just lay down that action
Know you come off bold, but it's just your passion
Oh, you're passionate, baby
Passionate, baby
Passionate, baby
Passionate, baby
It's only your passion how you move by
You fallin' head over, right outta the sky
Fatal attraction, you lay down and die
Know how you get, I know how you do itYou have a way with words
Your silence is a curse
You always seem to break me down, down, down
My swollen heart you curve
Your comfort makes it worse
I don't want you around, 'round, 'round, 'round
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
I almost lost my mind, yeah
I left myself behind, yeah
I almost crashed and fell right from the sky
I took a chance on this, yeah
I took too big a risk, yeah
And now I’m left with pain to get me high
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
You had to break me, take me, to make me better
But I had to save me, baby, now or never
Cause how is the man of my dreams
Not a man of his words?
And how is the man for me
Just a man that makes me hurt?
It's time to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Need me to take my own
Take my own advice, take my own advice
Take, own, ooh, ooh

They know how it goes, know you got your pride
Just admit you hate being alone
Know you allowed to know
I'm sitting right beside your throne
 I'd ignored my friends, they ain't gon' make it all work
 But I just can't say that you know my worth
 End of the day, you're still my first
At the end of the day, I know your words

Funny how you made me feel that
Turn around and made me feel bad

But you can pick a player just so I can get my way 
And I think you do this 'cause you realise I won't wait 
I see right through every look in your eyes
I hear right through every fairytale lie
Won't say a word, but the stories you write

Same shit I felt for you
Then I fell for you, fell in life
It's embarrassing to tell the truth
But now it's to the point where my love is up for debate
And maybe it's too late to shake
I think love is shown, you think love is spoken
And we both comin' from the same place
For every song that I write is a note to self
Note to God, note to you
Don't count me out
Besides this and my daughter, I only got love for you
I've been suppressed, I ain't the best
Roll up the problems, smoke all the stress
We got way too much shit on the line
But you can't see, emotions got you blind
Past life aggression, life time lessons, carryin' a message
Real life angels, battlin' depression
Show me your love, show me your love 
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love 
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love 
Show me your love 
Show me your love, show me your love 
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love, show me your love 
Show me your love, show me your love
Show me your love 
Show me your love I need you here, my safe haven 
Rather go at it than not speak at all
How you made me feel, it was dangerous
Oh, you know
I would rather argue than me sleep alone
Rather call you out than no one call my phone
Hold my grudge instead of havin' none to hold, none to hold
Could you blame me for needing you?
You're the reason I got a weakness, oh, no
You drive me crazy, still that's my baby
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
I say it umpteen times
You think I'ma leave, but I'm never gonna jump sides
We been on a rough ride
Still ride shotty with a nigga through the long nights
And it's always two rights
Playin' games with our hands tied
Who else can I confide in?
Don't want a war, tryna win a fight in here, you got it
Blowin' my phone up
Hopin' you decide to just show up
Rather say it all to your face
I'd rather we act like grown ups
Sometimes, I block all your calls
You start hittin' my girls up
Talkin' 'bout, "Where's my baby?"
And that's when I soften up
Yeah, you know
I would rather argue than me sleep alone
Rather call you out than no one call my phone
Hold my grudge instead of havin' none to hold, none to hold
Could you blame me for needing you?
You're the reason I got a weakness, oh, no
You drive me crazy, still that's my baby
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
Can't get enough of you
Baby, it's somethin' that you do
You're the only one for me, only one for me, oh
Only one for me, only one for me, yeah
Only one for me, only one for me, ohAsk a woman when you are broken
You make a choice to stay down or go and
Find something to bring you back
To get you right, get you right on track
I was chosen, he found me in the perfect moment
Found my lows and made them high
Saw my storm and cleared my skies
I don't think I can deny
He makes me feel wanted
Like no one has before
He don't want nothing from me
But to know my love's for sure
Hate to be you watching him love me
I'd hate to be you watching him touch me
Now I am blessed to have what I need
Nothing compares, he is all I see
When I loved you I didn't love me
You were this dark cloud hanging above me
Got all my girls like, "Lani where'd you go?
You've begun to slip away into where, nobody knows"
I'm doing better
I brushed myself off, changed the weather
Like the Sun you are so warm, and for once I feel adored
Oh I could not ask for more
He makes me feel wanted
Like no one has before
He don't want nothing from me
But to know my love's for sure
Hate to be you watching him love me
I'd hate to be you watching him touch me
Now I am blessed to have what I need
Nothing compares, he is all I seePatience could've done us well
'Cause I could tell that all we lack was presence
And I would've fell, you could've helped
But here’s to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted
But all we knew is that we cared
Still all we painted was a moment
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
You’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away
Yeah
And I really wanna work this out 'cause I'm tired of fightin'
And I really hope you still want me the way I want you
And it really feels like this shit been on autopilot
And it's habitual to be the bitch I am, but not the chick you want
Residual damage left in place of what was beautiful
Excuses only work when what we've done is still excusable
You let the truth unfold
But still, cheers to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted
But all we knew is that we cared
Still all we painted was a moment
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
You’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away
You are a vision of perfection
In my eyes, I was caught up in a blessing
Didn't realize how it wasn't fair to compare
All the things I know that I've been through
As if you didn't have anything that you went through
I treated you like medicine, but I guess I wasn't listening
And you tried to explain that you had hurt and pain, too
But as long as I felt better, then it was all good
But we wasn't good, so convinced that things were understood
Meanwhile, I had baggage to unpack, and I just had to admit that
Still dealing with the battles, feeling so inadequate
And I know that I shoulda stayed
But at the time, it felt like I had to quit
And I know that you probably thinking
Just I ain't thinking 'bout myself
But you still playing in my head to this day talking 'bout, oh
]
You could've helped
But still, cheers to being honest
Neither of us knew what we wanted 
But all we knew is that we cared 
Still all we painted was a moment 
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
And when I walked away
I left footsteps in the mud so you could follow me
You’re so bad at holding water, slips right through your fingers
We'd both end up drowning, it would hit the ground
And then the path would wash away, wash away Don't let it go, let it go
Don't let it slip away
Every man wants a queen
Like Jada in her prime 1990's fine
Gotta match his fly like something from a dream, or movie script
When you kiss her lips, should feel something like this
All of a sudden music's playing in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Sparks will fly when lips first touch
All of these doubts get left in the dust
Heat of the moment so no room to judge, no room to judge
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
I always wondered 'bout why you let me go?
Why you let me walk, up on out that door?
We just went out for drinks
Then you took me home
Walked me to my porch
Where you turned me on
That night you told me that you heard it in the background
Not just any music talking Mr. Soul Child
Said you was scared to come fuck with me cause you see I'm chasing dreams
But that don't mean that I don't need no love
So tonight you should go and take a chance with her
She could be everything you wanted, everything you wanted boy
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get, don't let that get away, don't let that
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escape
Don't let that get away
Don't let that slip away
Don't let that love escapeI think I'm addicted to romance
Showing my whole hands
Laying my cards out flat
I say, wear my heart on my sleeve
If you fuckin' with me
Anything I'll ever take back
I think I should be single
For a while
It's getting a little wild
Know when to slow down
Probably best I'm single 
To get in my zone now
To stay in my zone, oh
Lord knows
My intentions are pure and my heart full of gold, oh
Lord knows
My intentions are pure, but my habits are cold
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, serial lover
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, need to recover
I got bodies I'ma take to the grave
I got girls I wanna give my last name
No regrets, don't got no shame 
Playin' no games, play my way
Only wake me up if you can take that shit
Understand you're entering at your own risk
I want those nights I won't forget
Nights I can't run back with people I won't miss
Oh why, Lord knows 
My intentions are pure and my heart full of gold
Oh, Lord knows
My intentions are pure, but my habits are cold
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, serial lover
Love hard, fuck harder
Serial lover, need to recover
I got bodies I'ma take to the grave
I got girls I wanna give my last name
No regrets, don't got no shame 
Playin' no games, play my wayRain is good for the soul
Crazy how I feel the most warm when it's cold
Drops hit the window and I drop down to the floor
I assume this is when I would miss you the most
I'm lying down
I've got this notepad where you laid your head
We use to go round and round
Making love in my bed
We were in so deep
We could barely tread
But now I found a way to heal myself instead
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive
We were in a weird place
Crazy how a person you love could just change
Now I am learning to realize we needed our space
I could never hurt you, we use to be great
And you use to say, what goes around comes around so fast
Now just look at the way
I'm moving on and you stuck in the past
I deserve a love that is gonna last
But until then I will just raise this glass
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel alive
I feel, I feel
Turn this song up if you feel alive
I feel, you feel
Let it all go cause right now's the time
Let go, live on
So you can be free, yeah free to fly
I know it's hard but it's worth it
And damn I feel alive
Baby, damn I feel alive
It's like something has to die
To help you realize—damn I feel aliveTorn between crying for help
And not lettin' them see me sweat
But it's certain shit I can't forget
I won't get over it easy, shit makes me queasy
I am making amends with myself
Forgiving me for loving you
I took a risk loving loudly, defended you proudly
Ignored all the signs, yeah, it's true
And the immature me wishes that I could make it known
That you should be left alone
Don't deserve words or thoughts from me
I can go heal on my own
And the immature me hopes the world sees just who you are, oh
A facade only gets you so far
And I'm bigger than you, so I can't meet you where you are
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelin's
You called me crazy, but it was my intuition
Used me for status, and the fame, and recognition
It's fuckin' crazy what they do for recognition
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
I'd say your name but I won't, uh
I got to give myself credit for loving as hard as I did
I helped you fight your addiction and change your whole life
Just to find myself played in the end
Ain't no regrets cause I'm proud that my heart was so pure
And I'm never ashamed of my love
Now I'm finding strength in the fact that you're nothing to me
And I know the things I am above
And the immature me wishes I could just run away 
To somewhere I still feel sane
'Cause truth is I've been fuckin' lost since that very day
And really I'm wishing that I could just catch a break 
It's been Hell every couple days 
And now, I'm here broken, expected to carry the weight
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition 
You played the hero but you really are the villain
There ain't a bone in me that wants to spare your feelings 
You called me crazy, but it was my intuition 
Used me for status and the fame and recognition 
It's fucking crazy what they do for recognition 
I'd say your name but you don't deserve recognition
I'd say your name but I won't, uh
That's just you 
I always land on my feet
Bounce back game clean and neat 
Wish I didn't check your text when you was drunk 'sleep
I've seen everything that I ain't wanna see
That I needed to see, that I needed to be
Hope you live happily ever after with the bitch , uh
Fly to France, wine and crackers, honeymoonin' with the bitch
Hope you fuck around and have the son you wanted with the bitch
Y'all might be soulmates after all of this, so
Out on the table your friends and your family, even your label
Everyone love me, damn, it's so shameful
I kept you stable, you should be grateful
I ain’t find out sooner that you was unfaithful
Damn, you so shameful
So fucking shameful
Damn, you're so, uh, fucking ungrateful, uhTake you back, who am I if I can't take the heat?
Take you back, let's be real, 'cause you've taken back me
This is hard, but I love you, we fuck up, that's just life
Take me back, I'll take you back, yeah
Young and in love, so we prone to mistakes
I ain't gon' front like I know what it takes
'Cause I fucked up, then you fucked up
Now it's fucked up, goddamn
Road a little bumpy and we just started drivin'
Love almost ended and we just started tryin'
Took a leap of faith, still fallin', fallin'
Tell me when it's supposed to start to feel like flying
Don't do me bad, don't prove me wrong
Don't tell me that you movin' on
I can't take another heartbreak 
Take you back, who am I if I can't take the heat?
Take you back, let's be real, 'cause you've taken back me

Take me back, I'll take you back, yeah
Take you back, why should I take you back? When

You the one that turned this out, and
I know you that young and you rich and you gettin' it
I'm too raw of a bitch to be movin' with dissonance
Nah, that's not my mission, yeah, that's why you trippin'
Distance hittin' different, it's not your kind of tension
But I, I, I, I, I love you, but I don't love ridin' this ride
You know it ain't right

Just go with the tide
I'll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide

So if you feeling down, no you not alone
And if you feeling all confused
No you are not on your own

You ain't my enemy yet
But you ain't a friend to me yet
Don't recognize you
You ain't a friend to me yet
Don't recognize you
You ain't a friend to me yet
Now I see the fear and the threats
I see that it's hard to connect
I see niggas calling the rain
But the first to complain when they sneakers get wet
I see that I'm on some new shit
I see that it's something you hate
But what is not growing is dead
If you can't understand get the fuck out my face
You want something from me that I'm just not offering
You wanna roll but you just not down for wandering
You got potential, you got that, got that
You gotta ride the wave, stop acting like that
Look, I ain't did shit to you yet
I ain't even shit on you yet
You ain't my enemy yet
But you ain't a friend to me yet
Don't recognize you

I can go on about days, days when I did it alone
Had to go from couch to couch
Now I am sleepin' on thrones
Time when my pockets was bare
Times when I just didn't eat
Times when my stomach was growling
My best friend and I went to sing on the street
I made a few dollars that day, I made 40 dollars the next
Now I hit the bank and I send out my auntie
A nice little deposit—a check
Now I'm hitting it on the road
They talking about I'm 'bout to blow
I use to get paid to hang up all the posters
But now I am packin' the show
Look, I ain't did shit to you yet
I ain't even shit on you yet
You ain't my enemy yet
But you ain't a friend to me yet
Don't recognize you
You ain't a friend to me yet
Don't recognize you
You ain't a friend to me yet
You ain't a friend to me yet 
You ain't my enemy yet
You ain't a friend to me yet I'm far from perfect, nothing even close
But that's what makes me beautiful, that's something you should know
I'm not looking for someone to tell me how to row my boat
So let me live and let me learn I promise we will grow
If you love me like you say you love me
You'll be a man, you'll grab my hand

Sometimes I come home and I'm sweaty from the day
And my hair's all in a messy bun cause I had to get it out my face
And I rather lace my sneakers up cause high heels ain't my thing
And I don't see a flaw in that, I never want to change
If you love me like you say
You'll be a man, you'll grab my hand
Take me as I am

Spice it up a little 
Yeah, you know the drill

And I miss it when you hit it like that, that, that
Ain't no cap, cap, cap
I make you mad, mad, mad
Why I gotta fuck you up to make you fuck like that?
Pickin' fights so you can put it down like that
Get in your bag like that, yeah
"I hate you" turns into
"I love you" in the bedroom
We fuck and make up like it’s Maybelline 
We do petty things
Then mess up the sheets, yeah
You be runnin’ back once we let it go
I already know 
Did it time before
We just fuck and make up like it's Maybelline 
We do petty things 
Then mess up the sheets
Can’t lie, the sex fire when you in your feels 
Spice it up a little 
Yeah, you know the drill I never said that I had it all figured it out
I never said, I never said that I live my days without doubt
I swear all I've ever done was be honest and stay modest
So this is a, sincere, unscripted
Unwritten for all that you've given, forgiving, I'm driven
I wanna be better than I was, better than I am
So I say
All I'm trying to say is I thank you, I thank you
All I'm trying to say is I thank you, I thank you
All I'm trying to say is I thank you
I never said that I was done with my growth
I never said, I never said that I was done doing the most
And I swear all I've ever done
Was stay honest, keep my promise
So here goes my real life, unscripted
Unwritten for all that you've given, forgiving, I'm driven
I wanna be better than I was, greater than I am
So I say
All I gotta say is I thank you, thank you
All I gotta say is I thank you, thank you
 Thank you for watching me walk across the stage
For walking me through my heart-breaks
Thanks for the love every step of the way
With no support, this wouldn't be as great
Thank you for making me stronger than most
For taking it beyond my coast
Thank you for raising your glass when I toast
All I gotta say is I thank you, thank you
All I gotta say is I thank you, thank you
All I gotta say is I thank you
All I gotta say, all I gotta say
Thank you, really...
All I gotta say is I thank youTypical story of an Oakland girl
Typical story heard around the world
Mama on her wave, daddy up above
After 14, I guess it made me tough
Used to roll up on the block on the east side
I crack enough 40's by the sea side
Lose a nigga every week to a drive by
Whole bookshelf of stories behind these eyes
I, I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound so damn common
I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound like I'm jawsin'
But when I say it's hard to open up to you
It's hard to get close to you
I want it with everything in me
To one day just say I'm in love with you
But I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, I'm not
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, hey
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, I'm not
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it 
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
All single mothers in my family
Don't know if you're really understanding me
Never seen a nigga be a real man
I never seen a nigga with a real plan
And I still never been to a wedding
And I just see my family stressing
All the sons who grow up with no daddies in every generation
Was all just raised on my granny but now
I, I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound so damn common
I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound like I'm jawsin'
But when I say it's hard to just side with you
It's hard to confide in you
I want it with everything in me
To one day just say that I ride with you
But I'm not used to it, I'm not use to it, I'm not
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, hey
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, I'm not
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it 
One day, one day, one day
One day, one day, one day
Sometimes I pop off 'cause it's all that I'm used to
Sometimes I pop one cause I have to
Sometimes I run from all my problems
Sometimes I make sure that I solve 'em
I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound so damn common
I don't mean, I don't mean for it to sound so damn common
But I'm not used to it
But I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, I am not 
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, hey 
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it, I am not 
I'm not used to it, I'm not used to it 
Yeah, yeah, one day, one day, one day, one day
Yeah, yeah, hey, yeah 'cause I'm not used to itWhen it comes to relationships, um
I truly feel like wholeness can come from brokenness
We can find love in the most strange places
Um, that we didn't expect
And I think that's the beauty in love
I think that's the beauty in connecting with other people
Through our hurt, through our growth
And through the struggle
Wasn't sure I'd be alright
Wasn't sure I'd be okay again
Didn't know how to take flight
Wings broken couldn't seem to bend
Somehow you came in like the wind
And picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I'm thinking that you should
Pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
Hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart 
Help me fly again
Always read all the fairytales
Always knew that it would come
Through the pain I convinced myself
"It's only magical for some"
Somehow you came and like a prince
And picked me up for good
And now I know what I have missed
I'm thinking that you should
Just pick up the pieces
Help me learn to stand
Lift me from the ground and use your hands
To hold me by the heart
Tell me I'll be whole again
And hold me by the heart
Tell me it will never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So baby, hold me by the heart 
Help me fly again
Help me learn to stand
 Use your hands
 Hey
Help me learn to stand
 Use your hands
Use your hands
 Hold me by the heart
Tell me it would never end
'Cause I've begun to think that
I was nothing short of broken
So hold me by the heart
Help me fly againTell me what I gotta do to make you fall in love

I still light up to get a little higher
To get out of my feelings
I'm still tore up, and I don't want to OD on you
I lost me when I found you
Dried me while I drowned you
I'm lowkey, too high to remind you
That I was your eyes from behind you, I got you
I ain't supposed to tell you I still love you
But I just gotta tell you I been hurting
And I can't keep these problems to myself, oh
I still pop one to feel a little better

But you bring it out of me, out of me cause—

I made you who you wasn't
We was candy crushin'
But this shit getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep for me
Getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep for me
This shit too deep
Too aggravated, too complicated
More, more, more, more complicated
Le-le-le-less communication
Less conversation, more confrontation
I'ma catch a case, no exoneration
I'ma go to jail, now I'm contemplating
I don't know what you see in me
I don't ever wanna be with you
I don't know why you pass for it
Wasting energy texting me
Text messages, threat messages
I don't wanna think less of you, no 
I just wanna see the best for you, yeah
But this shit getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep for me 
Getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep  for me
This shit too deep
Too many steps, too many levels
Too many laps, too many hurdles
You don't wanna get hurt by me
I don't wanna be a crutch for ya
Too insane, too irritated
Too insufficient, too inconsistent
You just wanna talk, I don't wanna listen
Now I wanna talk, you don't wanna listen
I don't ever wanna lose you again
You don't ever wanna see me again
Say that I'm done, leave you alone
Mark you, then call you again 
Again 
Not like this usually
But this shit's getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep for me
Getting too deep 
Too deep 
Too deep for me 
This shit too deepKnow we're scared of us, what this might become
Ain't no goin' back no more, no more
We're in the same bed, cannot lay awake
Let's fill up this space with us
Butterfly, yeah, yeah
You make me feel brand new
Oh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin' late
No longer lookin' for somethin'
Oh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin' late
No longer lookin' for somethin'
Oh, oh, oh
So you seem to think you're invisible
You're so far from silhouette
You tell on yourself between every word
And leave all this room for me
Butterfly, yeah
I miss feelin' for you
Oh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin' late
No longer lookin' for somethin'
Oh, I feel it comin', got a rush like I'm runnin' late
No longer lookin' for somethin'
You speak in dictionaries while fearing less than all will understand
Virgo moon, I'm so used to your dance
Tongue too swole to comprehend
I see you duck and dodge at every bend
Afraid to play your card, be forced to show your hand
I hope you take from this that it'll make you no less of a man
To break your walls and simply grab my hand
Love shouldn't be contraband
It shouldn't trample on your confidence
Shouldn't be seen as less than complimentsPhone rings
Grandpa: Princess, belated Valentine's day
Kehlani: Happy belated Valentine's day, what are you doing?
Grandpa: What am I doing? Where are you?
Kehlani: I'm in the studio
Grandpa: You're in the studio... New York? Studio LA? Studio Atlanta? Studio here?
Kehlani: Studio in LA
Grandpa: In LA? Princess when do I get to see you? You know you are my granddaughter. You are like my daughter. Come on now
Kehlani: I know
Grandpa: Don't  out to the curb. I know you're the star on top of stars and everybody every day has to remind me. Do you know who Kehlani is? Do you know who your granddaughter is? I know who she is and I know who she was
They say God gives his toughest battles to his strongest soldiers and what doesn't kill you makes you stronger. And as much as anyone can say how invincible I seem or how fearless I am or how brave I must be, I'm still human. And I've seen things and I've felt more pain than some will in their entire lives, all before the age of even being able to buy a fucking drink at a bar. But I have to be strong, not for myself but for a greater purpose, because I feel like my duty is far beyond me, you know? Beyond saving my family. It's for the world because somebody out there really needs to hear this. So to anybody who isn't here to see how far I've gone or how far I've yet to go. To family members that didn't make it or friends I lost along the way. Or maybe someone I gave my heart to that didn't know what to do with it. You should be hereIn my head every time I take a step it's on the clouds
Feeling like a whole lot of power and I don't need a crown
Cause you know the royals you never get to fall in love anyways
And if you couldn't tell I'm falling even more everyday
And every time you kiss me I hear a song
When you look at me it's like nothing's ever wrong
Maybe I'm bad for living in the fantasy
One where you're almost as in love with me
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Can you put those hands on my body and baby just feel me?
If I gave you the chance to hold my soul would you just feel me, see the real me?
Cause I love that if you do
I would owe all my happiness to you
If you couldn't tell baby my smile has been brand new, yeah
And every time you kiss me I hear a song
When you look at me it's like nothing's ever wrong
Maybe I'm bad for living in the fantasy
One where you're almost as in love with me
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, better than she can
I can love you, I can love you
I can love you, better than she can
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with you
Yeah yeah yeah yeah, baby baby
As I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, I am, with youUh-huh
Uh
Too much envy in the air
Jealousy over there, they energy hella weird
Gotta keep a distance 'cause them bitches slippin'
And when they do it every day, it turn to repetition
You will not catch me slippin', you will not catch me trippin'
'Cause my grandma go through summer with no air conditioning
So why the fuck would I let myself get in their position?
I try to tell 'em, "Get it right," but they don't never listen
So every time my bitches call about the same nigga, I answer it
As bad as I wanna cancel it, I gotta have her back
When she cryin' until she past the shit, huh
She always tryna get a glass to sip
I told her, "This is life, you just gotta wake up and grasp the shit," huh
Ain't got no time to make no accidents 'cause you gotta be passionate
If you want something, you gotta go after it
And that's gon' make you the baddest bitch 'cause ain't nobody hand you shit
Can't nobody hold me back no more, huh
Yeah, look, and can't nobody hold me back no more
I've been on the right track so far
Don't even be texting 'em back no more
'Cause my mind on my money
These niggas ain't where it's at no more
I got that much, boy
And you got too many boys in your crew
You niggas got a lot of growin' to do
And you the oldest, you gotta be there to mold 'em into
Something bigger, something better
Problem with these egos now is everybody's shootin' free throws now
Misery love company, don't ever let these niggas keep you down
Matter fact, don't let 'em see you down
'Cause if they see you down, they gon' try to get up
They gon' know that you stuck, exactly what they want
So even if you fuckin' up, you gotta put on that front
You gotta act like you're on top, even if your shit sunk
I know this what you wantYou used to call me on my cell phone

You look like you light candles and like the honest truth
You got that positive vibe, I'm tryna vibe with you
I ain't the type that shake before I pop, I ain't soda
I'm the type to ice your neck, a lil' diamond choker
I ain't the type to put you in that baby Range Rover

Ayy, I do you proper, have you singin' operas

And provide a shield for all of the crazy things that come with this game we play
All the shit that the people say is
They don't know how we live, they don't know how we love
You said it so well can't believe I was so dumb
But all I'm tryna say is I'm not crazy

You know ain't explaining all this love we making
They think that we're crazy but it's us
Cause this is how we do us baby
This is how we do us baby
Don't you hate it when they get to asking all them questions 'bout the way we rockin'
Like, we gotta have a separate title or something
Gotta be on TV like the idols or something
Cause baby boy this ain't no way that I could ever begin to explain
The way we love
The way we trust
The bond we have
It's just for us
Just for us
Telling me, yeah we're soul mates
I knew it ever since our very first date yeah
You the truth
I need the whole thing
But I won't risk putting this love at stake
For a simple explanation to a simple muthafucka
Who really don't know us
Really don't wanna
I mean it when I say it, that I only wanna love ya
That other shit is extra
Baby far above it now
I know sometimes I do a little much
I know sometimes you got a little problems with your trust
But that's love baby
That's us baby
You know ain't explaining all this love we making
They think that we're crazy but it's us
Cause this is how we do us baby
This is how we do us baby
You're the only one I want and I can never leave your side
You're always here down to ride
You're always here and that's why
I fu-u-u-uck with you
Said he fucking with me cause I'm down
He know every single lyric
He at every single show and
Baby that's why I'm in love with you
You know ain't explaining all this love we making
They think that we're crazy but it's us
Cause this is how we do us baby
This is how we do us babyA lot of ways to love you, teach me through your eyes
What is needed for you, needed in your life?
Don't wanna go shoppin', you want picnics in the park
Do you like mornings? Should we do it in the dark?
It's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak
I'll commit to learnin' if you, if you
You're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs
Please be patient with me, with you
Said I wanna be fluent in your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Never wanna get lost in translation
Never wanna be on two separate pages
Swear to me that you'll state facts
If you can take back, know I can take that
I been workin' at it, hoping that you'd notice
I been waitin', I just needed you to focus
Swear to me that you'll show me
Need you to coach me, then we can proceed
And still, it's all foreign to me, I don't speak what you speak
I'll commit to learnin' if you, if you
You're a sweet fantasy, singin' your ABCs
Please be patient with me, with you
Said I wanna be fluent in your love language 
Learnin' your love language 
I know I don't speak your language 
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language 
Learnin' your love language 
I know I don't speak your language 
But I wanna know more, baby
Said I wanna be fluent in your love language
Learnin' your love language
I know I don't speak your language
But I wanna know more, baby
Fluent in your love language 
Learnin' your love language 
I know I don't speak your language 
But I wanna know more, babyI wanna take my wig off
I wanna lay it on the nightstand
I wanna take my make-up off
I wanna rip these nails off my hands
And I might look like who did what and why
Up under all of this
But you came to spend the night
So you know that there was way more to me
And if you don't want me at my goodnight
Then you can’t have me at my morning glory
At my morning glory
And if you don't want me at my goodnight
Then it's gon’ be goodbye 
Gon' be goodbye
This ain't BK, you can't have it your way
The only thing you decide is your stay
Wit' me or the homies, caked up or lonely
Tonight or the morning, yeah
And I might look like oh me and oh my
Up under all of this
But you came to spend the night
So you know that there was way more to me
And if you don't want me at my goodnight 
Then you can't have me at my morning glory 
At my morning glory
And if you don't want me at my goodnight 
Then it’s gon’ be goodbye 
Gon' be goodbye 
Tell me, why should I be trippin’ on you
While I could be payin' dues?
I'm a fountain of youth, raised on Arie and Badu
I know I'm fine, don’t need a outer confirmation from a man
Who uses 2-in-1 and thinks he's a sensation
Don't need acrylics on the clock to hit the nail on the head
Don't need my inches down my back to throw it back in the bed
So, when you speak on me and say that "She ain't put together"
Don't forget to mention that I got my shit together
If you don't want me at my goodnight 
Then you can't have me at my morning glory 
At my morning glory
And if you don't want me at my goodnight 
Then it's gon' be goodbye 
Gon' be goodbye
Bye, bye-bye, bye-bye, bye, bye-bye, bye-bye

Welcome to the Bay, it's the land of the real
The home of the honest, the home of no chill
And we don't take no L's we just run up the bills
Leave a fuck nigga on these hills
Never seen a scraper on less than dubs
Never seen a hater with a section at the club
Young heartbreaker but the world show me love
Only after paper, gotta get it while I’m young
Steph Curry for the win, boy
And I'm Curry with the pimp, boy
Never miss a shot of a verse that’s a sin, boy
All across the board, yeah the Bay is on ten, boy
Gang goin' up, team goin' up
And this beat goin' up, streets goin' up
Ayy, gang goin' up, team goin' up
And this beat goin' up, streets goin' up
Man, they put me in the game, so I'ma play

From the place where they say it can’t be done
Make no mistake, I’m a champion
Champion, a champion, a champion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Champion, a champion, a champion 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah Yee!
The whole Bay is goin' up now
It's champagne in my cup now
Cause at the top it's just us now
They want a favor like what's up now
It's funny everybody gives a fuck now
Summer Jam, made 30 bands
And I'm still in a flannel, ripped jeans, and some dirty Vans
And I'll still hit the furly dance
They got faith in me same way they do in Steph Curry's hands
Now they think it's a fluke like we lucked up
No no, bitch you got me fucked up
Look, it's me and Baelani
I'm hella clean and I'm shining
Bitch, I was dipped when you saw me
You thirsty, you need Dasani
Now, why not us, then became a world champion
No one saw it coming, everybody said it can’t be done
Home of the hyphy ones, bruh I come from the land of them
Chill cause I hang with OGs, now they stampin' him
Eazy
Man, they put me in the game, so I'ma play
I'ma do it one time for the Bay
From the place where they say it can’t be done
Make no mistake, I’m a champion
Champion, a champion, a champion

Champion, a champion, a champion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yesssssss!
You already know, man
It’s your boy, Lil B 
Now everybody know about the Based God
But my name Lil B, MVP
All I do is splash like I'm Klay Thompson
Guns in the back, look how the Bay rockin' 
Came off the bench like Iguodala
Every time I shoot, the crowd get louder
Call me Draymond cause I'm 'bout green
Everyday I go dumb, you know what I mean 
RIP to The Jacka and Mac Dre 
Light up the weed when this song play 
Keep it positive but these suckas watchin'
I'll bust a nigga head if it's no option
I'll see you with the hands 'fore I use a gun
I'm a warrior, I don't gotta run
Dojo niggas do the one on one 
If you don't fight fair, I'ma play dirty
Cross a nigga fast like Steph Curry 
I got too much swag, I don't flick my wrist 
Do the cookin' dance when I fuck a bitch 
Count a couple grand when I hit a lick 
Everybody scream 'Lil B', bitch
Everybody scream 'Lil B', bitch!
Haters in the back, you can get whacked
Where I'm from? The Bay, you don't need a map
Man, they put me in the game, so I'ma play
I'ma do it one time for the Bay
From the place where they say it can’t be done
Make no mistake, I’m a champion
Champion, a champion, a champion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Champion, a champion, a champion
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahI already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should 
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back 
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won
Took the road less traveled
Yeah, I'm tired
But I'm so far from the ending
Every day I'm evolving
The world keep turning
And God keep giving
Oh Goddamn, fuck a handout
Unless I got my hands out
Then I still stand out
Damn yeah, I make them bands now
Bet I got plans now and I'm still—
Gracious in the way I move
And I treat it like I want it to
And I never got you comfortable always
And I'm thankful that I found my groove
And I'm humble, but I got the juice
I remain unstoppable always
I already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should 
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back 
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won
I'm nominated for a Grammy, AMAs, and BET Awards
Man, what an honor
Never dreamed I'd do all this before
But you can't put a worth up on my art
That's my story, that's my heart
That's my soul, fuck the fame
Keep the glory
'Cause I made it out a city that ain't pretty
And it's tricky when you wanna show me love
Because it's trendy, shit be iffy
If you love me when I'm up
It's cause you see when I'm down
And only God can hand rewards
Or even give someone a crown
Because the critics bleed like I bleed
They eat like I eat
I don't put you above me
Cause you gotta judge how I sing
Get to judge how I speak
Even judge how I breathe
Just two years ago
Yeah, you were sitting right in my seat
Starving hungry like me
So empathize beside me
Understand I'm highly favored
Fuck your favors—yeah, I got me
I already won
I got the keys to my hood
Mama say she good
Doing what I should 
I got the world on my back
City on the map
No time to kick back 
Stopped giving a damn about
When they tell me how I won't make it out
I already won
I already, I already won
I already won
I've already
I already won
I've already won
Already wo-uh-onI am not looking for someone to buy my loving
Don’t spend no money on me boy I don’t need nothing
And I hope you know
And don’t take it personal
When I say
That you’re acting cliche
Anyone can buy me anything
Any man can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey
Don’t be scared
Don’t be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I’m trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and true
Im not gonna model us after the couples on the websites
Acting like they’re in love for the fan's likes
Please
I just wanna know your soul
I’m just trying to discover your likes and your dislikes, your middle name, do you like starlight?
Baby, just let me explore you
And I'm not trying to hurt you
By not accepting the things you wanna do
I'm just trying to show you
That I’m in it with my heart
We could be dead broke as long as we're together
I'm not leaving you, no matter the weather
Cause I might be in love with you
Anyone can buy me anything
Any man can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey
Don’t be scared
Don’t be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I’m trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and trueIt's okay to not be okay
To dive in your pain
And it's alright to not be alright
To search for your light
And it's all good to not be all good
To feel like you shouldn't feel any better
You gotta lose you just a little
Lose your cool just a little
I won't judge you a little
Not even a little bit
I know you're fuckin' sick of it
I don't know nobody
Who thinks that they're somebody
24/7
24/7
I don't know nobody
Who smiles at everybody
24/7
24/7
It's the wave to not be the wave
To make all your mistakes
And it's the play to not know the play
To go where the wind takes you
It's all fine to not think you're fine
Or have the wish to feel any better
You gotta lose you just a little
Lose your cool just a little
I won't judge you a little
Not even a little bit
I know you're fuckin' sick of it
I don't know nobody
Who thinks that they're somebody
24/7
24/7, 24/7
I don't know nobody
Who smiles at everybody
24/7
24/7
I have my days when I am upside-down, topsy-turvy
I have my days when I am not myself
And I'm not worthy
I have my nights when I'm not anxious
To wake up and feel any better
I don't know nobody
Who thinks that they're somebody
24/7
24/7
I don't know nobody
Who smiles at everybody
24/7
24/7
I don't know nobody
Who thinks that they're somebody
24/7
24/7, 24/7
I don't know nobody
Who smiles at everybody
24/7
24/7See, this the best motherfucking pussy a nigga ever had in his motherfuckin' life

He say he the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I’mma drive it like it’s stolen
I’mma fix it like it’s broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they’re too busy making assumptions
Boy, you know all I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby
It’s the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It’s the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It’s the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way you are
You got my mind gone, trippin'
You know I love these women
But you make me feel different
Just had your love, still miss it though, still kiss it slow
Give me some more
She know I'm the king where I come from
She know she the queen, she the one one
But she got a nigga open
Make me feel like I was chosen
Oh, just when my heart had got frozen
She opened the door and she strolled in
She got the key and she closed it
She got with me and now I'm focused
Girl, you know
All I do
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my baby
It’s the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It’s the way you love, the way you fuck, the way

It's the way you, it's the way you are
This thing we got is crazy
Only thing I know is you’re my baby
Forever down, I am your lady
Always for sure, never a maybe
Never met someone who spoke my language
Baby girl I swear I'm tired of playin'

Show me your soul and I'll mold it 
Baby boy, you gotta be the dopest 
Gotta be to fuck with the coldest

Bounce back game good, why we talkin' practice?
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Pull up score when I want to
Best thing next to Heaven
They be tryna count me out though
I'm just countin', countin' blessins
A real woman 'bout her paper
Niggas don't know where I came from
Why I really really came up
You never could say I'm back in
All this shit I've been through and it made me more of an assassin
I kill 'em, I kill 'em, I kill 'em with compassion
And baby if they askin'
Tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em, tell 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Live for the challenge, only make me stronger
One more reason to turn up on 'em
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy
Do you think I'm crazy?
I spent over 80 on a watch and a bracelet
I'm like an alien, fuck a Mercedes
I came in a spaceship, don’t call me crazy
I was stuck in a basement with a pen and a paper
Lost the eraser, I made a mistake and I told you I hate ya
Everything I do, I do it cause I never had shit
A couple niggas tried to screw me over, had to learn how to use a ratchet
A couple bitches had me fucked up, had to learn how to be a savage
Had to learn not to fuck with her just because she was the baddest
These streets don't love no one, don't get caught up in traffic
I just wanna smoke one so can you roll up and pass it
I love Louis fabric, I just bought a jacket
20 something hundred more than your casket
I kill 'em with swagness, my bitch is the baddest
I go, I go, I go, I go crazy, crazy

Live for the challenge, only make me stronger

It's very personal to me
That you give it everything, yeah
Should I stay? Should I go?
Should I leave? I don't know, goddamn

It's all I do 
And honestly, I might go insane
'Cause when we break up

Pick you up at night, take a drive, shit, I'll feed you

Niggas get to bustin' when they see clip loaded
Not a bad person
Gotta hustle so I don't get

Look me in the eyes when we hop out of the Honda
Creepin' on the lawn like shadows, no pausing
He said baby are you ready
Don't be scared think deadly
Move fast like a jetski
When we rollin' in the paper
I swear that we gettin' married
Heart beatin'
Knees start to weakin'
We become dependent
Hittin' licks on every weekend
I wonder do you ever get tired of this

To accumulate the chedder
He leaned over and whispered gave me a kiss
Cause'
Baby I love you
You know know that I love you so much
That I'd do about anything for you
Even risk it all 
And I'm torn between my heart and mind
Trying to convince myself that this is right
For all we know it could be all last night
For all we know it could be our last time
Don't fucking move
Why the fuck are you in my fucking house
We pulled up to the second house on the left
Nerves as fuck
You could hear it in our breath
Anyways he touched my face so softly
And I knew it was time
For a split second
All I wanted to do was cry
Not out of fear
Just my heart screaming how wrong it all was
But it's survival of the fittest
Sometimes things are wrong in love
Mask on, hands clasped, prayers to the sky
God watch over us
Love, Kehlani and KlydeAlways got a different nigga though, bruh, like, we get it 
She always got a different nigga? 
Y'all got a problem with her always having a different nigga?
It just be so fast
It's-it's your business?
I don't got a, I don't got a problem with it
It's your business? It's your business? Is this your business?
I don't got, I don't got a problem with it, I'm just saying, though
It just be so fast
I mean she be—she make it our business by posting that shit everywhere
I mean
She should've never asked me about Halsey when she don't even talk to me 
Now it's everybody's business, this shit public business now
All I'm saying is, all I'm saying is
It's not even her business no more, it's all our business
So, so basically you saying she don't belong to these niggas
She belong to the streets?
To the streetsI will say I'm a believer in letting people be people
If you're humble or conceited, I'll still see you as an equal
I don't be taking offenses to how the devil be working
I know that God is my witness, fulfilling my purpose
I've been a real down to Mars chick, at the bar chick
I'll pick up your 3 A.M. call chick
Love and Basketball chick
I move your car chick
Late night trips to Target
I know what I bring, to the table, to the table
I know what I bring, to the table, to the table
I know I'm not no messiah, and I am far from a prophet
But if the earth set on fire, I think I know how to stop it
I'm not afraid of opinion, I know the devil be working
I just keep up with my focus and keep my nose in these verses
I've been a real down to earth chick, never surface
I pick a backpack over a purse chick
Never at ya service, here for your worstest
Ha, don't I sound perfect?
I know what I bring, to the table, to the table
I know what I bring, to the table, to the table
I try my best to be lovin' and give my all when it's needed
I make the most of my time, and try to learn all the teachings
Don't take my kindness for weakness
Steady dealing with madness
So I pick up my chalice, 'cause what's life without balance?
Too much shit on my mental, don't pretend like you get it
You would call me a medic, if you knew where my head is
Damn, if you knew where this led-ed, all my vices are deaded
If you know what I'm going through, why the fuck would you stress me?
Take me back to the basics
Understanding what's worth chasing
'Cause time is of the essence, get me out the matrix
I pick my battles and win
You can't relate where I've been
I don't say much, 'cause I don't need much in this world full of sin
Body and soul is detached, and my heart's got a patch
You can't drive without looking and then expect not to crash
But I know what gave me purpose
I'll take my title as king
And I'll take a seat at the table, because I know what I bring
Know what I bring...to the table
To the table...to the tableDo I have the sight
To face what I gotta see
Do I have this strength
To fight my insecurities
Can't hold my breath think I'm losing control
What's left in my ambitious is fading slow
Do I have the strength
To get where I need to go
Does anybody need me?
Does anybody feel me?
This ain't what I need
Wish I could be
A little bit braver
A little more sooner
A little more cooler
There's something in, something inside of me
Something in, something inside of me
Screaming over
Let me live out loud
Oh-woah
Let me live let me live
Afraid to be strong
And too strong to be afraid
Caught up in the days
Between staying and running away
Can't be a good girl and just do what I'm told
Can't let this pillow just swallow me, oh
Gotta go, find this train to carry this load
Does anybody need me?
Does anybody feel me?
Try to break free
Wish I could be
A little bit louder
A little more often
Can you keep me talkin'?
There's something in, something inside of me
Something in, something inside of me
Screaming over
Let me live out loud
Oh-woah
Let me live let me live
Something in, something inside of me
Something in, something inside of me
Screaming over
Let me live out loud
Oh-woah
Let me live let me live
Does anybody need me?
Does anybody feel me?
This ain't what I need
Wish I could be
A little bit braver
A little more sooner
A little more cooler
There's something in, something inside of me
Something in, something inside of me 
Screaming over
Let me live out loud 
Oh-woah
Let me live let me live
Something in, something inside of me 
Something in, something inside of me
Screaming over 
Let me live out loud 
Oh-woah
Let me live let me live
Oh, let me live let me liveI love that you're confident
Never wanna take nothing away from that
From that yeah
I love all your honesty
Just met you but probably could state the fact yeah
You know I'm looking for more, you know I'm searching for more than  the surface
You know I'm looking forward, you know I'm out of order
We're at this halfway point between what it is and what it seems
I'm all in if you're all in baby
We're at this halfway point between what we say and what we mean
I'm all in if you're all in baby
Don't want a come in the way of you and your day to day, I know that's your shit
I don't wanna take away or ever distract you bae from what your doing
But you know that I got goals and you know that I know my role, can't nothing stop me
And you know I hate control but I know you hate it more
We're at this halfway point between what it is and what it seems
I'm all in if you're all in baby
We're at this halfway point between what we say and what we mean
I'm all in if you're all in babyI don’t need no summertime love
I’m not looking for someone to pass the season
I don’t need just anyone
But you intrigue me for some reason
You seem oh-so real
And I don’t want to taste if I can't have it
I could show you how I feel
But I don’t need to pick up a new habit
After June on through July
Then you go back to wherever you came from
Don’t want to wipe no tears from my eyes
I mean why, when I could just save them?
Cause I swear that I am anti summer love
After the summer everything just gets weird 
We’ll grow apart and begin to stop talking
I'll never forget those nights at the pier
Oh the first time our lips got to locking
And I don’t want a love
That is only temporary
I can love with all my heart
But I can’t let it get that heavy
After June on through July
Then you go back to wherever you came from
Don’t want to wipe no tears from my eyes
I mean why, when I could just save them?
Cause I swear that I am anti summer loveIt's so easy to become caught up in your own life
Filled with all of your own problems, can't even sleep at night
Everyday it's like a new problem arrives
Need to ground yourself, can't afford to lose your mind
If you wanna know the secret, if you want the best advice
Come and take a listen
Fall in love with what you find
Go and tell your mama you love her, go and tell your mama you love her
Without her you could not love another, without her you could not love another
Go and tell your mama you love her
Everything she did in the past, you knew it already happened
No use to every time you see her you get to snappin'
She's constantly apologizing for the things that she has done
But what you must remember is those very first 9 months
Let me let you in on a secret, if you want all this advice
Come and take a listen, you fall in love with what you find
Go and tell your peoples you love em, go and tell your peoples you love em
And thank them cause without em you're nothing, and thank em cause without em you're nothing
Go and tell your mama you love her
Go and tell your daddy you love him
Now go and tell your brother you love em
Now go and tell your sister you love em
Now go and tell your cousins you love em
Now go and tell your homies you love em
Now go and tell your baby you love em
You tell em, you say baby I love youLately it's unclear what's weird and what's not

That everyone deserves to be happy
You can't swipe your card to fall in love
You can't go and return your feelings for someone
And I'll be here around this time when push comes to shove
Reminding you of things you should think of
Everybody loves something by Christmas

So if you feel you won't get what you wish for
Remember what you got you'll be alright
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
This is what it's all about
Why you staring at your phone surrounded by your friends?
You always say that you're alone
You don't have to pretend
Like you don't got somebody that tells you they love you every night
If you opened up your heart you'll see I was right
You ain't gotta be so hard, don't gotta be so cold
You gon' wish you spent this time  when you're old
Better act like you know that tomorrow's never guaranteed
Do it for yourself not even me
Now everybody loves something about Christmas
Don't let it be the wrong thing that  catch your eye
So if you feel you won't get what you wish for
Remember what you've got you'll be just fine
But time is now
To write your wrongs
Hold your head
Keep on keeping on
Remind yourself you are strong
Love don't costLyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!In the presence of struggle
Everyone has hope
But what if we run out?
There's no rich and no poor
No waves on the shore
All the trees burn down
We're ruining our own mother
Stomping her right to the ground
Then when we beg for forgiveness
We never walk the mile
I know you can hear me
Feel you all around
Just wish that you could answer
Or even make a sound

Do you hear me, you hear us?

And nobody cares to control it
We all know what's happening
Some people only play dumb
But I can't ignore it no more
I, I won't run
I know you can hear me
I feel you all around
I hope you will answer
While I'm praying on the ground
Hands together
Knees on the ground
Heads in the clouds, yeah
Praying out loud
Lost innocence cause

On some—
I've been way too good to you, you take me for granted 
You was my day one since back at Big B's house on Adams 
First day that we met, I flagged you down, I told you, "Hit my line"
Used to promise me you'd never switch on me like Gemini 
You think I'm a fool, ain't nobody stupid 
I see all the signs, I see all the clues
Yeah, sometimes I reminisce 'bout that shit when I'm bingin' 
Can't believe it's been a whole year, yeah, but...

Nights like thisOh babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wonderin' what you would say
Or would it be a big mistake?
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
Yeah
I ain't even callin' for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time
To give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out of the way
But it can't hurt to check up on an ex, not to flex
But to put the hurt to rest, put maturity to the test
So I'm callin' to say "Are you okay?" on your special day
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
If I called you on your birthday?
Would it be worth it?
Should I call you on your birthday?
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
But is it working?
Emotion aside
Ah
Am I makin' your day?All this love is in the air
And it doesn't feel so fair
That I'm way over here
You're so far over there
Na, na, na, na
Haven't been home in so long, so long so long
You're love is still this strong baby
Hope that we still have a bond
Hope that you've been holding on, holding on baby
Cause nobody, wants to be alone in December baby
And don't ya know
Nights feel colder in the winter baby
So can I come spend it with you?
Can I spend this Christmas with you?
Wanna spend it all on you
Wanna spend December with you
Cause nobody, wants to feel alone in December baby
So does a house feel like a home, like a home, even when I'm gone?
Does you're heart keep you up at night?
Do you have to dry your eyes?
Cause I would book a flight if I could
Walk there you know I would
From fall on to summer baby
Sit by the fire with you
Laugh till my face turns blue
You know what I'm saying is trueI need a gangsta
To love me better
Than all the others do
I'm fucked up, I'm black and blue
I'm built for all the abuse
I got secrets, that nobody knows
So don't let me, don't let me, don’t let me, don't let me go{Verse 1:}
Deep like a base, then you pop like a snare
Hot like fire, I can't help but stare
Wish I could control it but I think I've fallen in love
Caramel skin with lips of persuasion
So in tune with our conversation
It flows so naturally
It is so sweet
{Pre-Chorus:}
Cause you move with such groove and I like it
Swag through the roof I'm excited to
Get a little closer to you
And I can tell by your vibe that you like it
See it in your eyes that we are in tune
That's why I wrote this song for you
{Chorus:}
Oh me, oh my
You've fallen from the sky
Give me  that good, good
I want that good, good
Cause you're so uuoohh good to me
Your so damn fly
I need you in my life
Good good
I want that good, good
Cause you're so uuoohh good to me
{Verse 2:}
Got my heart open
It's split like the sea
Be my final wrap all over me
Hold me tight and don't let go
Take me to the next level
Be my Adam and I'll be your eve
You are my life and you're all that I need
Breath into me a new life
It feels so right
{Pre-Chorus:}
Cause you move with such groove and I like it
Swag through the roof I'm excited to
Get a little closer to you
And I can tell by your vibe that you like it
See it in your eyes that we are in tune
That's why I wrote this song for you
{Chorus:}
Oh me, oh my
You've fallen from the sky
Give me that good, good
I want that good, good
Cause you're so uuoohh good to me
Your so damn fly
I need you in my life
Good good
I want that good, good
Cause you're so uuoohh good to me
{Bridge:}
Hey baby
I love what you do
When its just me and you
Yeah, you got the sweetest touch
And I love the way you handle me with grace
Ooh you're just my type
{Chorus:}Full lyrics will be available upon release. Stay tuned!
*Snippet*
N*ggas suck and fuck but still
He gone cheat on you anyways
Gave you what you wanted
But I still feel like you never cared
Always had your back
But when I need you, you was never there
Damn...
Needed someone to believe in
So I took a look in the mirror
And became what I was looking forI know you want it
See you watching, can't ignore itI am not looking for someone to buy my loving
Don’t spend no money on me boy I don’t need nothing
And I hope you know
And don’t take it personal
When I say
That you’re acting cliche
Anyone can buy me anything
Any man can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey
Don’t be scared
Don’t be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I’m trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and true
Im not gonna model us after the couples on the websites
Acting like they’re in love for the fan's likes
Please
I just wanna know your soul
I’m just trying to discover your likes and your dislikes, your middle name, do you like starlight?
Baby, just let me explore you
And I'm not trying to hurt you
By not accepting the things you wanna do
I'm just trying to show you
That I’m in it with my heart
We could be dead broke as long as we're together
I'm not leaving you, no matter the weather
Cause I might be in love with you
Anyone can buy me anything
Any man can buy me
Any gold, some cars, a ring
Is it that bad of an idea to love for love instead of money
Forced to realize that there's nothing wrong with love like honey
Don’t be scared
Don’t be shy
Stop looking down at your wallet
I’m trying to see your eyes
Not one gift in this world could make me feel more than I already do
All I need is for your love to be raw and true

Everything you do shows me you know it
Behind it all you are the motive
Don't tell you enough, but baby I'll show it, show it
He say the king where he come from
Take a young queen just to know one
So, baby, I'ma drive it like it's stolen
I'ma fix it like it's broken
We could catch a flight out to London
Go to the mall, spend a lump sum
They could try to catch up to us
But they're too busy making assumptions
Boy, you know all I do 
Is stay up all night losing sleep over you
All I do
Is drive myself crazy thinkin' 'bout my
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It's the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It's the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way you
She said, "I ain't even make my bed up"
"Watch your step, you gon' wake my mama and dad up"
Pssh, girl, didn't I tell you at the damn club?
We gon' wake your neighbors
Turn your block club to my fan club
And that happen so fast
Damn, I'm glad I strapped up
Ask her when she finish, if she came
She said I lapped ya twice
Run it back for the dub, rematch
Flip the crib when we fuck, RE/MAX
It get hot than a mug, glass cup
You can ask her if I fuck, she gassed, huh
I gotta keep it a secret, I keep a key in my lower pocket
Inside a register below the lower octave
Dirty laundry in my closet, they be strung out on the street
Left to dry with drawers, sheets and no deposit
But I don't gotta worry, put my hand on your mouth
Put my hands in your mouth, girl
We got plans at my house, you know the way up
It's the way you walk, the way you talk, babe
It's the way you love, the way you fuck, the way
It's the way you are, you're a star, babe
It's the way you, it's the way youOh babe, oh babe
You've been on my mind
Just an old flame, old flame
I left you behind
But, oh, if it were any other day
Maybe you'd want me to stay away
I'm just wonderin' what you would say
Or would it be a big mistake?
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
Yeah
I ain't even callin' for no reconciliation
I just want to tap in and see how you been
I've waited for an adequate amount of time
To give us both some space
I think it's been good for us to stay up out of the way
But it can't hurt to check up on an ex, not to flex
But to put the hurt to rest, put maturity to the test
So I'm callin' to say "Are you okay?" on your special day
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
If I called you on your birthday?
Would it be worth it?
Should I call you on your birthday?
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Would you prefer it if I'd go ghost?
And let you go your own way
Can I call you on your birthday?
Just to make sure that you're okay
Got the number to your old phone
But is it working?
But is it working?

Best friends and lovers
Can't seem to draw the line between each other
What is defined means nothing to a brother
You just don't give a damn, that's why I think I love ya
It's not fair, how easy I melt when you play with my hair
I ain't going nowhere, it's not right
I can't sleep without you anymore at night time
Not in this lifetime
Love ain't never been so close, but so far away
Like your mind is telling you to just back off
And your heart says just stay
What's a love that doesn't keep you up all night and all day
If it's not too late, yeah, you realise it one day
I'm down for you, I'm down for you, oh

That won't treat you like I will

We've got this synergy, your soul feels close
Like it remembers me—instilled in me
90 degrees in California, you put chills in me
Said it's something about my city, something about my city
Oakland girls so damn hood but we're so damn pretty
Sometimes the town just brings you down
But we feel no pity
Don't need no extra bodies, I got the connect with me
It's why you connect with me, it's why you can step with me
Why you can go hit the carpets
Go 'head and get dressed with me
Make me forget my ex and you onto the next with me
Love has everything to do, Bobby needs his creds Whitney
I always said I'd be the one to do it
I changed the way they lookin' at us women makin' music
Go put back on the crown, stop makin' us look so stupid
Not worried about these niggas
Unless it's you then I'm choosin'
Even if I chose I feel like you're the right decision
Yeah, you got aspirations, you ain't fuckin' up the vision
I love that you're not worried 'bout any other niggas
Only longing for persistence, only want something consistent
Does it make you nervous, I'm not afraid to say what I want?
Does it put fear into your heart that I know where I started?
Far from where I begun?
'Cause I know every man has a fear
Of a strong-minded woman
But I say she's a keeper if she got it
On her own and keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'
If she can keep it all runnin'
Keeps it runnin'

Just so I can drive them real fuckin' slow
I like my own company
Company, I don't need it
I'm not always cold
I'm just good on my own, so good on my own
I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
If they come along, I won't think twice
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already got everything I need
The best things in life are already mine
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing with me
Yeah, I already done everything I dream
I'm good by myself, don't need no one else
Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thing
I make myself up
Just to dance in the mirror when I'm at home
I pose and take pictures
Then send them to people that I don't know
I like getting compliments
Complements how I'm feeling, oh woah
I'm not always selfish
Just bad at romance, it's not in my bones
I've always been told, one day, I'll find
Somebody who changes my mind
They come along, I won't think twice

Don't tell me that you got a good thing for me
'Cause I already got a good thingThere's always been those times when I needed a breather
When I might need a quick break from being the leader
Cause I’m just human, you gotta feel that
We're all just here to learn and everyday we are put up to bat
If you feeling down, no you ain't alone
And if you feeling all confused, no you are not on your own
Don’t stress, yeah we're too blessed
Someone once told me
Babe, when the tide gets high, you just get low
Hold your breath and take it slow
Yes I might get wet, I might get thrown
But I'll resurface all on my own
I'll be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
I'll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
With the tide, I'll be alright
With the tide, I'll be alright
Be alright
I’ll be doing fine
I’ll be doing fine
I always have those days when I feel unworthy
When I sit back and ask God why he chose me
Cause I'm just human, just like you are
We see the same ol’ sky, at night we see the same stars
So if you feeling down, no you not alone
And if you feeling all confused
No, you are not on your own
Don't trip, baby just live
Someone once told me
Babe, when the tide gets high, you just get low
Hold your breath and take it slow
Yes, I might get wet, I might get thrown
But I'll resurface all on my own
I'll be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
I’ll be alright, be alright
I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tide
With the tide, I'll be alright
With the tide, I'll be alright
Be alright
I'll be doing fine
I'll be doing fine

I'll be doing fine
Be alright, be alright
Just go with the tideThis shit's so good, should be illegal
Need round two, I need a sequel
Hit the backboard like a free throw
You next level, you a cheat code
In so deep, you hit my seafloor
Got me singing like Alicia
Got me using all your lingo
Tell your girlfriend that you single
Call me over 'cause I go hard
Sweet lil' bih, fuck like a pornstar
Next day, act just like your road dog
Bitches askin' how you know her
Head game stupid, baby loca
Too loud, callate la boca
Out this world, you supernova
Fuck that, I am coming over
Can I come over?
 Can I  stop by  to see you  tonight?
Can I stop by to see you? 
We both on fire, love the teamwork
Leave with juices on your t-shirt
Loud and clear, no need for reverb
Tell the Uber driver revert
Flip that bitch and make a u-turn
Sextape crazy, need the bloopers
Last so long, bae, you a trooper
Sniper gang, no Bradley Cooper
Hi, I'm Hell, it's nice to meet ya
Know you fuckin' with a demon
Do 'bout anything to please ya
Cum inside me, I'm a keeper
Want me to make you a senior?
Never been that hard to read ya
When we done, you say, "I need ya"
I done made you a believer
Can I come over?
 Can I  stop by  to see you  tonight?
Can I stop by to see you? 
If these walls could talk
They'd tell you don't pull out
Make me proud
Thug it out
Switched it up
Enough to tell me I'm your star
Let's get wild
Right here, right now
Can I come over? 
 Can I  stop by  to see you  tonight?
Can I stop by to see you? 
Can I-I-I-I
