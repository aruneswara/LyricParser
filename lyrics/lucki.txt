I had a vision, and the vision was a tunnel with a door
Like a funnel for precision 
Just a mission, no decision
Narrowing as it beckons me

More of a hike than a walk or a stroll
It's a stride through a hole in the wall in a crawl space

It's how I pass the packs, and those bundles of ‘em, like I'm Donovan
I'm in love with a number of thots and that's a problem
Hated math anyways, so them ain't gon' go solve, bruh
Three hundred xans in these ten deep joggers
No script so I'd rather be six feet deep if I don't dodge them
Four up in the wild one, fuck sprite I'm from Chicago
Plug on my line, interrupted by my mom though
Same damn speech, ever time like the inaugural
Keep my page private, make it hard for lotta follow
Tippin' on four fours wrapped in four vogues

I mean it's 'bout time we get paid, that xany balance my lows
She complain I'm always away
She like "where the fuck do you go?"
I'm like I be coolin' back, smokin' pack like vacation
Feel sorry for my homie, smoke them blacks on probation
Shout outs to my niggas like Mayweather with them cases
Shout out to my round, he got me leanin', feelin' faded
And overlap if you a minute slow
The lean promote my different flow
My bitch is always in my business, askin' how my meetings go

Uh...
You know I started off with nothing, made a business with my niggas
Helped me see the bread clearly, I made lenses out of figures
I just trap it, I just move it, I'm not looking for no time
Boy I lay low, I ain't no stand up, I could do without my spine
I do it on my own and make that magic happen faster
I be serving all them dummies, test 'em out, they get to crashing
Want a deal, well it can happen, I'm just dishing out them cards
You want this shit, go and take a hit, boy I could make you top the charts
Because I'm mixed with all these troubles
So I tug-of-war with my safety
But you couldn't pull me away for nothing
Because I love it
And this shit is all I think
And this mischief and shit go around
I swear to God it's like a ring
But I still love it
I love it, I love it
You couldn't pull me away for nothing
Because I love it
I love it, I love it
I'm a problem solving problem, serve 'em falling leaves in autumn
Might be added, still won't follow, cut them sharp as sleepy hollow
Yo...
I choose paper over pleasure, paper pressure pleasure me
I prove them pressures deal oppressed, I do 'em wrong as Pleasure P
And plenty clients trust in me, I don't know why, just want their pockets
Plenty dealers selling heat, I sell the most boy I'm Pat Riley
You wouldn't know why
And it's nothing, and I play my part and they buy it
And they do 'em, and wish they never started, blame TV
Cuz their influence, causing all this ruckus it ain't me
I ain't losing, cuz I can't lie, I love it
Because I'm mixed with all these troubles
So I tug-of-war with my safety
But you couldn't pull me away for nothing
Because I love it
And this shit is all I think
And this mischief and shit go around
I swear to God it's like a ring
But I still love it
I love it, I love it
You couldn't pull me away for nothing
Because I love it

Girl it ain't nothin' to meI'm better than all these niggas
Any nigga that you get, I'll out-bar him
And if I get the right space, I'll prolly out-star him
These just simple rap thoughts and half thoughts that I find
On my lab notes, math notes in class I waste time
On them assholes, anything I learn I just forget it
But what I know, in a few years I might regret it
The honor roll, a little more effort I might get it
My momma-ro put pressure on, bottom of ninth inning
And I'm a young nigga, living in the O who thought of that
Just get money, flash later, squad taught me that
When heat come, niggas turn soft, Bosh taught me that
So with that said, in my head, thought I should probably rap
But that's any negro thought, that's what any nigga think
Either ball, go to school, or rap, or parlay in the streets
When it call these niggas shooting crap, these dice be ways to cheat
When it call these niggas shooting crap, these dice be ways to cheat
I figure this rapping shit just to stop me
I love it more if it drop me
I'm wasting my time just watch me
I figure this rapping shit's just to stop me
I love it more if it drop me
I'm wasting my time just watch me
Uh, I'm wasting my time just watch me
Yeah, I'm wasting my time just watch me
I figure this rapping shit just to stop me
I love it more if it drop me
I'm wasting my time just watch me
Cause maybe drama just my thing or I should always just be high
Or get a shrink, but until then I'm just gon' always just be high
I mean they treat me like a king, but I honestly don't see why
I just be rapping 'bout them drugs, so they must always wan' be high
Like what the fuck, cause since people listen, that bring more pressure
Small shit I say even getting a little bigger
I guess they mad they not on that cheese, they tryna catch up

Brought the wrong bitch home with me
She might just stroke my ego enough to make me fall in love with her
Slug hitter, the best pitcher out the park, nigga
And my heart thinner not these hoes

Meditating, fake praying, the bible Dedication 2
Used to leaving 'fore these pills kick in

Fuck these hoes while I tuck the center for her, post'em
Way too wavy for your current situations bitch keep that on shore
Too wavy for these niggas keep on swimmin' hope they find shore
Put Juelz in her face, and she can’t feel her face no more

Been tryna get rich since I moved my first rock
'Cause ever since, I've been Patrick how I'm livin' under these rocks
And I've been near a lot, it's gettin' easy, gotta stop it
I've been stainin' drugs and doing 'em, forgettin' about the profit
I can stay out if I lock it, pickin' white as if it's cotton
Master said that I should pay for that it's TOL, I drop 'em, uh
Back down them old dusty roads
For that all American dream shit, I think I'm Dusty Rhodes
I give a few a bloody nose, and others do it for a rush
Some wear expensive clothes and others cop lookin' like bums
I don't judge 'em, they pay me and move, it's simple
Know nothing is smooth, I love for this soothin' mushroom
Without me all their days would be night, I show 'em
Connected like Skype, the plumber put fix in their pipe
Then I give 'em nothin' but trouble
I get 'em where they need second-hand, I'm like a shuttle
Never stick to the plan, I'm Peyton out of the huddle
Used all the pots and pans, I clean 'em before my mother, uh
Is trapping as hard as it gets?
These niggas say they trapping, naa they're the hostages
Cheat codes won’t get a motherfucker far as this

These days, nothing is sacred
Yo, yo, yo
Ay, yo, ay
These days, nothing is sacred
How come every day feel like a rerun?
They giving you favors for a reason
I’m really off Percs, they something to lean on
I’ma count regardless if you mean harm
These days, nothing is sacred
It’s me or you, it worry me daily
Just wipe your tears, it is what you make it
I’m on molly speed, I don’t know what brakes is
I keep her around just for my safety
These niggas wanna poison my baby
Can’t let go of my slime, that’s what made me
These days, nothing is sacred
These days, I’m getting lazy
These days is nothing with patience
These days, I’d rather not say shit
When you call me, just think about the past tense
Can’t give you all me cause niggas love to snatch shit
That was last year, you hopped on the pavement
I think past tense, I can’t forget your hatred
I’m a money getting addict, you believe what they be chatting
And I’m stuntin’ like my mommy…
I’m a money getting addict, you believe what they be chatting
And I’m stunting like my mommy, I be sinning like her daddy

And she just need me to take the fall for it
You should take your own advice and die out
Fuck them hoes it's nothing else to cry about
Four pills later it's nothing else to lie about
You should take your own advice and die out

I was drivin' real slow, and then that yopper hit
Nigga want something to live for, feel like we almost out of here, ayy
Supercharge quick, ayy, need a boss bitch, ayy
Don't just okay, ayy, really boss, bitch, ayy
We split that shit four ways, walked out with our pockets full
Still do boss shit, still do boss shit, ayy
Need a boss bitch, yeah, ooh, ayy
Still do boss shit, haha

They like "Lucki boy what happened? Body High was all depressed"
I be laughing and responding like "Just never pop a xan"
Baby girl I'm coolin' better not catch me on the stage
Either that, or piss me off and see the xan rage
Popped up out that xan cage, then I got that xan chain
So I gotta love it now, it's like Ye Roc-A-Feller chain

Met this lil' bitch in my dreams off the xan scared away
Solve my problems like a shrink, smart bitch I gotta say
Guess I'm a problem they know, still live under this halo
I fell in love one time, I hope she swallow drain-o
Watch me finesse, finagle
Whatever I made like clay though
I fell in love one time, I hope she swallow drain-o
It's like it's too many niggas, and not enough bitches
And niggas play they part, and that's how money come up missing
And then these niggas dying, and these t-shirts getting printed

I take Perc 10's 'cause them Xans tastin' sour
Muddy, pinky up, I'm in Berry's eating chowder
Pay me by the hour, ten bands two of those, I only smoke on sour
Exotic like them Europe hoes, Hi-Tech in my cuticles
Your hoe at my funeral, I'ma percy popper
Nothing I won't do for those, I been duckin' bullet holes
Wockhardt taste like Koolaid homie
Do you got a doctor? Nothing I won't do for yours
Talk to me proper, I'm into them ruder hoes
Can't be friends with stupid hoes
I might die, I do it though
Nothing ain't been through befo'
Talk to me, proper
Yo yo aye
Talk to me proper

Miss you, but please don't call, and don't go tiff or taff
Never givin' nobody my all, no more questions to ask
Remember when I said, "No flaws", still got to watch my back
That Trackhawk ain't no lie, he gettin' chased in a 'Cat
Never give a bitch my all, 'cause ain't no takin' it back

None of this fasho, but maybe she'll tease
A elegant hoe, she split everything
Irrelevant though, how much in my jeans
20k, boy this rap money is free
Touch da sauce, key I got just what you need
If i didn't sip, I would be so rich off lean
Free Lil folks, boy we need lil shorty free
Chin up fo, he didn't need the magazine
Silly ho, all this attention for me
Really though, you can see me in yo dreams
Too hot in them cars, but we look like a star
This X fast like a jet, next stop is Baguettes
Dash Boy i'm gon rep, but they do it theyself
She jealous of them, next with me to death
He spent a lil check, he sipping the rest
She want a baby, I let her watch Lex
Bro say i'ma fiend, but I really need Tech
My energy back, she wasn't ready for that
Too lost off them beans, where go all the lean?
Please find me a fo, I'll even take green
Non of this fasho, but maybe she'll tease
A elegant hoe, she split everything

Since you all that, i'll fuck you in a foreign, ayy
All these niggas hate, all these bitches fake
None are on my, uh, yo, uh, ayy, yo
All these niggas fake, all these bitches hate
None are on my level, it's just them and me, can't miss a beat
Dancing with the devil, I got venom fangs, diamond dreams
Told 'em this is not a race, pointless to compete with me
Little Barbie on my case, she say, "It's this lean or me"
Only know them by they face, told you this a dream to me
Act up boy, your secrets reek, sneak diss hit, you leave it be
Stomach hurting, missing percs, only can do three a week
Perc and molly, dirty poppy, I live like I'm every G
Suddenly got this need for speed, hope she keep it G with me
Codeine help me feel the weed, suddenly got this need for meAlright cool, damn. Fucking tweakin' man
What? Aw I forgot I was supposed to talk
Look this the master plan
This the way to get fucking money
And just get bitches forever...I guess

She fuck him right, she set him up

Talking cash, gold I mad live
Goofy hoes call mad dibs

To junkies I'm the People's Champ
Long as I keep the rocks man

She demanding me because I do whatever I want
Lowkey fans of me, remember your face I don't

Boy I love my city but they kill me at one of my shows
I was feeling pity until you hated me over a ho
Simple as it could be, start treating them like my hoes

She say, "Lucki it was simple"
I'm not, yo, ay, ay, ay
She say, "Lucki it was simple"
I’m not even going home
She say, "Lucki it was simple"
Why you never going home?
All these bitches in yo rear-view
All these feelings in my phone
Top floor view feel like a drone
Flawless human in the mirror, why the fuck am I alone
Say that money I am into
Just new money you find at home
RT Durango with the tints too, I don't feel that safe at home
Not tryna sell you what I've been through, this my heart all through a song
I need an I.D. for a rental, I guess I'm answering her phone
Call then tell me what I didn't do, when all that you 
See you playing with my mental, this bitch just don't like me strong
I'm not even going home
She say, "Lucki it was simple"
Now I'm never going home
All these bitches in yo rear-view
All these feelings in my phone
Top floor view feel like a drone
Flawless human in the mirror, why the fuck am I aloneI'm such a West Side nigga, they thinking I'm Death Row
They want a final destination I give em' a death row
What you want don't matter, you given a dead vote
Shadow  on his pockets cops come I'm deaf go, stack gold for me
Any nigga that ain't with the squad, on shawty low they know a nigga done, done it all
From west go 'head get sloppy like fights at a bar, and even niggas bite with hoes you ain't a man at all
And all these goofies be trippin' like Disney dogs and 
Can't let the soul catch you slippin', don't know who flashing the cameras
A couple teams got burners, they like sports in Atlanta
And you don't know who all real, it's kinda online chattin'
Money stay on the table like salt and peppa'
And there's no eye to eye, cuz niggas be sprayin' peppa'
If they get a nigga caught up, it's kinda like social network
In the dark the kids leave em' it's kinda like cartoon network
I'm on that west side, west side
Go, go west and come get it
I'm on that west side, west side
Come, go west and come get it
Grip her harder than Jimmy, then open the steamer
Me and Lucki low-key be schemin', west side grass is greener
The money move through the seas, and more bodies fall in the season
Niggas know that's where I'm from, know my walk is where you see it
I'm so mothafuckin' west side, yeah the best side, let's ride, all of my niggas been on that chastise
Come west if you don't believe me, go west if you know the hustle
Americans only  get that guap
Like seeing a ghost, 2Pac riding through Shottas
Living life through a roster, the options become a monster
Inconspicuous monsters, death row, welcome to the windy city where niggas don't give a fitty fuck if you out of carats
Stupid silly, no luck, no love
West side
I'm such a west side nigga
I'm such a west side nigga

Sawbuck we go back 
I've been chosen but I wanna be as high when I got picked
My lil bitch told me stop letting all these rappers say they miss you
Cry me codeine rivers, I use two liters for tissue
700 horses, I can see you if I missed you
Loyalty is hoping all this money make me cured
Royalty like corpses rotten wrapped up in the tissue
Knowing me its probably my reaction that just get you
Notice me its all she really after at the end of the picture
No AP but I spent this whole advance instead of go figure
Knowing me I'ma just go faster cause it'll kill them

I'm robbing all the actors
Can't feel my face
I'm falling off these ladders
Automatic to the static
Wish everything was tragic
Wish everything but magic-?
Gave my hoe body cameras
What you say, on me, and you
Back off, i'm lost, cut off
Everything I knew, for you, too you
Need you, wish you, would come back, just jump back
That's auto, that's my bro
That good gas, Gelato
I talk fast, the motto
With no xans i'm hollow
Bitch what friends, they all gone
Bitch what friends, I robbed them

Cartier frames don't hide my high

East side bitch and she see it everyday
Chicago bitch don't wanna get high, well you needa stay yo ass out of LA
I'm in the city with the racks 
Almighty Sosa, just blew my high
Folks get money off road like a range
Where all this money gon' go when I die
This bitch think her percs is safe
Almighty Sosa, just blew my high
I got a few more yerks anyway

Touch they soul, they give me the key
I got it hangin' from my belt, oh

Bless up to whoever buy
They paid, oh well

In the car, I feel like LV
Baby could you tell me, mask on, could you tell this

J'fais pas d'cadeau car Santa dort
J'te baise sur l'beat, tu m'sens, t'adore
Le sang gé-char comme Contador
Dans les céréales je met le sky d'abord
Pour le champagne, j'attends ta mort
Pied d'biche, j'ouvre la boite de Pandore
Chloroforme, j'te baise et j't'endors
Ton rap a disparu : Dinosaure
Tu rentres pas là où même pas on sort
J'suis dans le 5 majeur, dans le 11 d'or
C'est pas un hasard si j'fais qu'des rimes en or
Tu veux jouer les gladiators
À c'qu'il parait, le sang t'adore
T'es trop mimi, jamais tu scores
La peur qui suinte par tous tes pores
Personne croit en ton rap de mort
Ta seule chapelle c'est une te-por
Personne t'aime, tout l'monde m'adore
T'es comme le dernier d'la té-por
SPA, j'te laisse à ton sort
J'ouvre le score : Andy Delort
Canardville, Daisy en juste-au-corps
Parce que j'suis Picsou sur son tas d'or
Oublie l'reste de l'album, là on vient tout plier
J'ai l'flow marteau-piqueur, oui je viens outillé
Le EP sort maintenant pour les top de fin d'année
T'es cardiaque, écoute pas ce couplet tu vas caner
M'suivre en soirée, beaucoup ont essayé
Autant d'bouteilles que d'rimes rangées dans mon cellier
Vous écoutez trop d'merde, vos cerveaux vont saigner
Jette une oreille sur nous on s'en f'ra un collier
On vient à quatre comme une embuscade
Une vidéo de Bangbus crade
Nous on est pas les Dieux du stade
Juste des mecs bourrés au rade
On est pas les meilleurs mais vient pas tester ma team
Plus pain au chocolat que chocolatine
Pendant c'temps sur Twitter  on fusille les porcs
Comme Gurzil ou Harvey Weinstein
J'viens enculer les fils de morts
Relique du passé comme John Connor
Sur un coup d'te-tê façon Casque d'or
Tu veux tiser, viens Rue Saint-Maur
Comme Kombouaré, j'suis sang et or
J'dois avouer le foot c'est pas mon fort
Tout l'temps blessé comme Javier Pastore
Je suis une légende à Boca Junior
Gillbien, Luczer et le Patron
Pour le rap plus précoce que LeBron
Passement m'jambes, lucarne : Chevanton
Écouté même à Charenton
Triple double on enfile les fions
Ta meufs on la bloque au rebond
Après une DP ta queue sens pas bon
Sur la gâchette, appuie, fais pas l'con
Quand y en a plus, il y en a encore
Comme ta reumé 
Vous baisez vos soeurs ? On vient pas du Ch'nord
Tu croyais qu'j'étais sérieux ? Tu peux m'appeler Garcimore
J'arrive à poil : Terminator
Dans le futur, te mettre à mort
Homme de principe : Lew Alcindor
Pas prêt à tout pour le putain d'tas d'or
J'arrive en balle comme une Aventador
Premier virage, j'me fous dans l'décor
Rap de mongol : Oulan-Bator
J'suis ton daron, j'suis Dark Vador
Mon son t'transperce, mec t'es pas d'accord
Finit dans un thread à la #BalanceTonPorc
Trouve-nous dans l'bloc, dans les Cités d'or
Jeunes et ambitieux : Castors Juniors
La vie c'est une course pas un sprint, j'suis essoufflé quand j'fais 100 pas
J'tape du 0 à -200 dans les 15 premiers jours du mois
Dans la vie j'sais pas quoi faire donc j'improvise et on verra
J'ai pas d'projet à long terme à part m'faire sucer et péra
Ta mère la pute se prend 16 bites comme si c'était une Super Nes
Pour faire mon sport j'la soulève vite, pas b'soin d'aller chez Néoness
J'arrive à iep', j'repars en Benz
Ta meuf sapée, repart topless
Tu perds la tête comme Pierre-Robès
Va niquer ton rap, nique ton père obèse

Never could she play for keeps, did you check the bottle now?
AJ gotta attitude, I'm Googling new designer now
And I miss my son but everything about a dollar now
And I know niggas scheme
But nigga, damn, now you're partners now?
Heart was on my sleeve
Probably somewhere in the lost and found
Left me for dead, zombie mode but I'm conscious now
My big brothers be from blood  so I can't stop it now
Wish I was  there when Tyler need me but I cut him out
I was down on the ends, the white folks called me
I ain't even talk 'em out
Heart be on my sleeve, ask 'em if it's in the lost and found
I know you be blessin' me even though I talk a lot
I know you be, ay, ay, ay
I know you be blessin' me even though I talk a lot
I know you be, ay, ay, ay
I know you be blessin' me even though I talk a lot
My biggest problem tryna fit this widebody in the parking spot
I know you be blessin' me
I deserve it, I do
I deserve it, I do
I deserve it, I do
I know you be blessin' me
I deserve it I do“Is not a image”
“My intentions where never to be brought out as ‘oh Charli Baltimore’ Rapper/Super Model like, I can’t help how I look”
I'm truly tthe shit, of course i'm not new to this shit dummy
Promethazine Prince, ay, oh, ay
And my money right
And my truck a sport, 
Raw like Monday night
Gazi keep her spoiled
Think i'ma fund her life
My new bitch adore it
My old bitch abort it
Nah it ain't a straight, but the engine roar,  
Ain't been out of state, 
Brought my bitch on tour
Rich off Apple Music
High off purple fluid
No codeine no sleep
I keep dreamin' lucid
And my money right, oh, ay, ay
And my money right
And my truck a sport
Raw like Monday night
Raw like Monday night
My brothas get it just like me, I don't even say that just, I don't even say that just to make them feel good
It’s really over here on this side
Dash money EFG
Stick together like the group home but you knew that
Promethazine Prince
“For the love of money definitely was not an anthem for me growing up, I watched a lot of things that, I was really happy about and enthused about fall apart you know what I’m saying?”

        ПРИПЕВ
Падает снег за окном
Глаза ещё не проснулись
Снились, те тропы рая
Где бесы с Богами столкнулись
КУПЛЕТ 1
Столкнулись два ангела смерти
Жрущие сладкие души живых
Но подавились моей темнотой
И не смогли забрать её вниз
Этот мир кусок бумаги
В нём все красочный рассказ
Но изобразить себя мог
Только цветом чёрных глаз
Ты не знал с чего начать
Свою жизнь пустую
Думал, будут деньги
Будет много дури
Открой сейчас же свои веки
Оглянись вокруг скорее
Всё твоё здесь окруженье
Без лица и окрыленья
Эти стены здесь крушатся
Под иконами во лжи
Все тут смертные ублюдки
Хотят думать что творцы
Но, творцы вы без идеи
Без морали, с отвращеньем
Ваша жизнь скучна и глупа
Тут уйдёт ко дну каюта
ПРИПЕВ/BRIDGE 
Тут уйдёт ко дну каюта
КУПЛЕТ 2
Доброта, любовь, семья
То, что предавал не раз я
Не был я хорошим братом
Все это не видел важным
Не хотел я быть спокойным
Мальчиком здесь на цепи
Постоянно уходил
От людей с коронами
Я помолюсь за здоровье
Всей своей семьи
Я скажу бывшей любви
Человек такой прости
Доброта в моем сознанье
Будет ярче солнца
Я уже давно забыл страшную
Границу фроста
Ты не знаешь, что такое
Холод, холод, холод
Ты же ведь не знаешь
Что такое дикий голод

Want city girls, in a low and starin' at the lake

On the eway I go vroom vroom, hit me girl
Catchin' feelings for a rap nigga, silly girl
But ain't no tellin' though she might just put the check, in my face
Scrappin' the venue and they didn't even check
Pop up wit' you in yo' feelings, not yo' bag, you in debt wit' me
Bae that shit ain't hurt me when it happened I was stuck wit' me
Bae I miss New York, Wockhardt I score
I'm in a building, free my slime, he got my drank
I'm startin' to feel it, niggas lyin', and filthy broke
Them bitches feel it at the bank, I can't deposit, a single feeling
City dangerous, I won't go on a date with a hoe
Like where we makin' it, this all about my cake with a hoe
I wouldn't have it any other way, Diddy girl
No finesse wit' them suburban hoes
Want city girls

Hm, ay ay

What it is, what its not miss my baby but she got, lost 
Huh-huh course
What it is, what its not miss my baby but she got lost
I got drank, and I got cake
No more sad songs over no thot
Broke ass rap niggas hate the virus, ain't got paid since touring stopped
Ain't no talker, but I ain't friendly, only my brother can hold my Glock
Stay lowkey, but don't front my moves, you know how Chicago get when its hot
I'm from the Raq' we don't ride no drops
Tinted up trackhawks, Sport Mekai
I was with KK, that my baby, hit my phone sorry bye
Loso a bebe kid but lying like he sell em for 29
You know Sawbuck he still with me, he on BOA's and thots
And Javon just called my phone he talk like "Vegas niggas not"
Miss my baby, but that bitch naughty
Took my heart, I forgot yo collar
Niggas playing for keeps, and these hoes gon help rebound em
What it is, what its not miss my baby but she got, lost
Huh-huh, ay, ay
What it is, what its not miss my baby but she got lost
I got drank, and I got cake
No more sad songs over no thots
What it is, what its not, oh, ay, oh, oh, ay, ay
What it is, what its not miss my baby but she got lost
I got drank, and I got cake
No more sad songs over no thots

I can't go like that, don't trip off a hoe cause it go like that
I can't, ay, ay, ay
I can't go like that, don't trip off a hoe cause it go like that
I give her what she want when I lost it, said it's gon go right back
I do what I want, buy what I want, cause my soul ain't happy
Mud the only thing I need to see, but I get paid to travel
I can't go like that, put tints on the rental cause i'm low like that
Say this ain't Need For Speed, the Cayenne made to go slow like that
Group home all I trust, when it came down to it they had my back
Only do in sport beamer, listen to the growl cause the cat like that
200 then I do it, cop no opp do a cat like that
It was trust, but it's ruined
So much come when the racks look sad
2 plus 2 is death
Take my heart when I get back
Gotta watch for myself, one more move and I end up stabbed
I can't go like that, don't trip off a hoe cause it go like that, man, ay, of course
I can't go like that, don't trip off a hoe cause it go like that
I give her what she want when I lost it, said its gon go right back
I can't go like that, don't what, ay, I can't, ay, ay
I can't go like that, don't trip off a hoe cause it go like that
I do what I want, buy what I want, cause my soul ain't happy, ay, ay, ay
I do what I want, buy what I want, cause my soul ain't happy, ay, ay, ay
I do what I want, buy what I want, cause my soul ain't happy

Do you wanna stab or watch my back, ay
Do you wanna stab or watch my
Shit too dangerous, niggas wanna kick it
Do you wanna stab or watch my back
I got old friends hatin' from a distance
Mad I ain't never lie in none of my raps
I got hoes swearin' they loyal
Man I put AJ in all of my raps
I got old hoes thinkin' I owe 'em, just cause she retweeted some of my raps
Tell 'em book a one flight, where lets go
Hood still livin' yea I don't like overseas
My pretty girl look good in Dior
Bitch work in Saks wanna fuck her with me
Baby can I take you with me on tour, I don't want the groupie hoes lyin' on me
Flew to the Raq' I was there lowkey
Just saw Lex give yo momma some G's
Two tone trackhawk look like a Glock
Back to the hills ducked off like Keef
Remix sprite gon' remix the wock
Brought her back she ain't trip on the lean
Pops say put that shit in some stocks
Folks say put that shit in the weed
Thought she was gon' say spend it on her
But split this shit up because you might need it, ay, ay, ay, woah
Shit too dangerous, niggas wanna kick it
Do you wanna stab or watch my back
I got enough friends in this shit
Don't call me yo twin lil nigga we rappers
I got a name she think that's lit
These niggas hate when put me on a plater
Shit too dangerous in thisСука здесь хочет веселья
Получит шрамы на теле
Чую холод в рукоятке
Knives знает дело, мэн
Здесь тебе не цирк ходячий
Я тебя получше спрячу
В этом холоде собачим
Не найдет даже Апачи
Не хочу я знать о боли
Настрадался за все горе
Не могу назвать любовью
Но рожден благословленный
Посмотри в мою ты душу
Демон там внутри разбужен
Он почуял запах туши
И не прочь тебя покушать
LUCKY,LUCKY,LUCKY,LUCKILL 
Нахуй вас
Нахуй вас здесь всех, парень
Ты не знаешь, что тут значат эти прятки на квартале
Видел  свет 
Видел свет черными глазами
Но моя душа не достала света слезами 
Нахуй ваш трёп, нахуй ваш фейк
Нахуй ваш понт, нахуй ваш бенг
Нахуй ваш сленг, нахуй ваш дэб
Нахуй этих сучек, нахуй вас всех
Я буду смотреть в эту стену скитанья
Ты глупый мудак пали тут оправданье
Вы так заебали, зачем вы живете
Убейте в себе эту тупость и ложь, блять
Залито мрачными красками пепла
Багряно-бордовые - мои оттенки
Бит топит холодную кровью подземелья
Вы просите света, стоя на коленях
Стоя на коленях, сука
Стоя на коленях
Стоя на коленях, сука
На спине перевернутый крест
А я вчера выебал твою телку, нахуй

Your bitch pull up wit' them sprites and them woods for us
I got Sawbuck we on Melrose in a dub toy

All that lonely wit' a love boy, aye
Don't be fooled by the drugs boy, whoaNotre vie n'a pas d'sens : on fume on tise, c'est l'essence
Rentre dans la danse, il faut tenir la cadence
On va s'péter la tête, demain on f'ra pas les fiers
Rejoins-nous au bar avec des clopes et des bières
Des clopes et des bières et du Jack pour tasser le tout
Je suis trop bourré, à chaque pas j'peux tomber et me casser le cou
L'objectif c'est d'fumer et boire jusqu'à c'qu'on ressente le dégout
Etre sous alcool c'est doux oui, comme la chatte à Léa Seydoux
Rejoins-nous au bar tous les soirs, oui rejoins-nous au bar
Ça finira au domac ou au resto à manger du homard
Je travaille beaucoup toute la journée et je termine très tard
Patron remets moi une pinte que j'trinque à la santé de tous ces bâtards
Je bois pas pour le moral, non en fait je bois pour être normal
J'en ai plein l'bocal, j'suis intelligent j'aurais dû faire normal
Dès que j'vois un cul j'ai la dalle
S'il-te-plait, viens qu'on passe à table
Un seul bras musclé comme si j'étais Rafael Nadal
Un pied sur l'bureau et l'autre est déjà dans le cercueil
J'ai tellement bu de bière d'Abbaye, qu'mort j'veux que les moines m'accueillent
Tu veux parler ? Ferme ta gueule
Tu sais pas ? Demande à Google
J'vais pas voter pour les élections sauf si vous faites un doodle
J'veux passer des quais d'Seine à la scène comme Dalida
Pour y crever comme à mes 27, c'est la vida loca
Comme une rock star, j'veux toucher 7 ciels
Pas venu là pour qu'la vie me bégère comme un charclo et la vinasse
Cette année c'est la dernière : Jimmy Hendrix
J'plane comme un hélicoptère, pop la 8.6
Dans tous les pubs, dans tous les bars
J'fais mon jubilée
Ramène la bière et l'pinard
Oui je fais mon jubilée
J'ai trop traîné dans les bars crades
Un tache de vin rouge sur mon âme
Pour des Lucky j'la brade
Encore plus pour des jolies dames
J'veux voir ton cul sur instagram
Te secouer comme Jéroboam
J'ai pas b'soin d'21 grammes
J'ai pas b'soin d'21 grammes
Philosophe après quelques bières
C'est p't-être pour ça qu'on traine au bar
J'suis du-per, j'sais pas quoi faire
Et j'erre sans but tard le soir
Recherche du bonheur perpetuel
J'veux être heureux comme Gucci Mane
En attendant je me démène
Paradis artificiel
Du sky japonais dans mon verre
D'la OG Kush et j'quitte la terre
Je m'envole comme un Canadair
Je fly, j'suis bien dans mes Nike Air
Ce soir avec mon possee on est venu s'mettre pépère
PDTG meilleur mélange depuis des clopes et des bières
J'prends des clopes et des 16'
Des capotes et j'te baise
J'prends des clopes, des Heineken
Des capotes et j'te ken
Des clopes, des Kronembourg
Des capotes et j'te 
Un whisky, bien té-bour
Si tu veux qu'j'te fasse l'amour
T'as subi deux couplets balourds
Tu peux plus appeler au secour
Rap de yencli qui fait la queue, qui fait la queue à Carrefour
Qu'achète son survêt' treillis, le samedi à Clignancourt
Release party, c'est la qu'les clients courent
C'est après ta racli que tous les jours Lucki court
Je zigzague sur le beat, sur l'instru j'fais du parkour
Tu m'connais par coeur même si tu voudrais être sourd
J'emmerde les oreilles d'puristes, j'finirai même pas sur une rime
J'finirai même pas dans les tempsJ'aime le rap les dessins animés
Le sky, la skunk, j'suis parfumé
T'es vert, j'suis bleu comme la Chimay
T'approche pas, j'risque de t'abimer
Si tu jactes on va t'allumer
Te fumer comme un calumet
T'as aucune personalité
J'te vois comme personne alitée
Rock star comme Johnny Halliday
Ta gow m'a déjà validé
Jamais j'me ferai à l'idée
Qu'tu suces pour t'payer ta vida
P'tit courant d'air, t'es pas si frais
Moi j'chille posé dans ma villa
On vous amène la qualité
Vous êtes juste mort comme J Dilla
J'arrive, j'insulte vos mères et j'cavale, j'drop the mic
Le jour où j'arrête le rap, j'monte au quinzième, j'drop ma life
Si on arrête de boire, on fout l'feu dans ton thé dansant
Si on arrête les chattes, on fout l'feu comme les allemands
C'est Lucki et Rico
Par ici les euros
Posés dans ton bendo
On débarque sur l'réseau
C'est pour les petites gow
La famille les potos
Je vous aime #nohomo
Luc passe moi l'micro
J'aime la yayo et le plata
Ma femme comme Pablo aimait Tata
Ta meuf me voulait mais elle m'rata
Je n'la tromp'rai pas pour Emrata
Je suis libre du désir comme Gala
Mon style est chaud, le tien est froid genre "Glagla"
Tu t'sens prisonnier comme dans Castlevania
J'aspire le sang comme les serviettes Vania
C'est sur le mauvais cheval que tu parias
Je suis le patron et tu n'es qu'un paria
Tu ne me connais pas mais crois-moi, j'ai jadis porté la marque Kaïra
Depuis je n'ai plus de nom, plus d'visage, je suis la même formation qu'Aria
Tu la ramènes, tu voudrais qu'on t'dises "Amen"
T'habites pas Compton, t'habites à la Garenne
Ne sous-estime pas le barême car tu n'es pas prêt à rentrer dans l'arène
J'ai été gentil toute ma vie, maintenant ça ne sera plus jamais la même
Mes patrons étaient ravis, c'est pour ça qu'il n'ont pas compris quand j'ai posé ma dém'
Ce jour-là, je leur ai mis dans l'cul tellement fort que ça leur a fait un œdème
Aujourd'hui ça a payé, je touche 56K comme si j'étais un modem
Je n'suis pas un dramaturge même si la nuit je rêve que je parle à Racine
J'ai tellement la dalle que je suis prêt à manger les pissenlits par la racine
"Armstrong je ne suis pas noir, je suis blanc de peau
Quand on veut chanter l'espoir, quel manque de pot"
"Belle image de la ville d'Evry. Tu me mets quelques blancs... Quelques blancs... enfin quelques whites, quelques blancos... Hinhinhin."

Pussy so good she want me to chase
But Lucki you in the straight
He so spoiled, keep switchin' his moods
Two toned kitty, like Garfield, vroom
Keep getting fat, you ain't eating no food
But Lucki she in the way
Skippin' that hoe like hop scotch
Me and a basic hoe feel top notch
She ain't even ask for the wifi
Money, syrup, hoes, know about it
She was like Lucki you syrup to me, gotta get use to withdrawlin'
I don't let her pop percs with me, if you hoes had yo body
Evеry new person get closе to me, somehow bringing up a dollar
Spend how much? I surprise myself
Hollywood Tune I disguise myself
5% Tune I blind myself
When you not home gotta mind myself
She was like, this yo energy? It's just something thought 'bout it
Same time god right with you, ain't you still tryna get higher
She was like, who yo enemies? And a bitch know everything 'bout 'em
Spend how much? I surprise myself
5% tune i blind myself
When you not home gotta mind myself
Come back for me when you find yourself
Pussy so good she want me to chase
But Lucki you in the straight
He so spoiled, keep switchin' his moods
Two toned kitty, like Garfield, vroom
Keep getting fat, you ain't eating no food
But Lucki she in the way, oh
Pussy so good she want me to chase, why not
But Lucki you in the straight
Oh, oh
Pussy so good she want me to chase
But Lucki you in the straight
Oh, oh, oh
But Lucki you in the straight
Pussy so good she want me to chase
But Lucki you in the straightLyrics from Snippet

Les putes balancent, les maquereaux nient
Les rappeurs sont à l'agonie
Nous on vient chercher la money
On débarque sur la scène de Paris
Va déménager en Laponie
On commence jeune comme Rooney
Dans le rap on t'appelle la momie
Tu tournes en rond comme un handspiner
Ou la musique d'Hans Zimmer
Tu me proposes un film de Nolan, je te réponds "Nan cimer"
Avec Luc, on vient tout niquer
Ouvre tes oreilles grand comme Mickey
Trouve nous sur les quais à Riquet
Pas besoin de polémiquer
Du sang partout c'est un bourbier
J'suis trop bourré, je marche en biais
T'es trop rasoir, j'vais t'étrangler
Avec l'écharpe de Christophe Barbier
Je bois un coup et j'lâche mon rot
R.E.P à Jeanne Moreau
Nos morceaux ne sont pas tro moraux
Voilà pourquoi je cris Mort aux lâches
Crache, vas-y lâche ton cash
Tu peux sortir les haches car c'est ton crew que je clash
Trouve toi une meuf bien, pas une twittasse
Fais ton propre truc comme dans Kick Ass
"Bah là, je viens de terminer de lester le corps, tu vois... C'est à dire, lester le corps, tu dois le remplir de certaines choses, parce que tu vois, tu dois savoir que quand tu immerges un corps dans l'eau, il se gonfle d'air, hein..."
Le L c'est d'l'amour, de l'emo, des gros mots en slow mo
Achète notre album pour qu'on puisse s'payer de nouveaux polos
Avec Rico mon kho bobo
On vient te faire des gros bobos
Tout niquer comme des bonobos
Contrôler l'jeu comme N'golo
Reste pas là, mets-toi à l'aise, on va t'offrir des sucreries
Pour tes oreilles, pendant le son, tu vas crier "Oh oui Lucki"
1m78, 85 putains d'lo-kis
C'est pas du rap de maigre, la grosse chatte à Scottie
C'est l'introduction, installe-toi bien, tu peux monter le son
Petite mise en bouche, on va te prendre dans toutes les positions
Rap game Mario Bros, on va t'sauter pour te piquer tes pièces
Puis r'partir à 4 pattes car quand on rappe, on s'met des maudites caisses
Rico et Lucki arrivent en stud' donc écartez vos fesses
C'est nous les plus chauds donc si t'es grosse, on va t'faire fondre ta graisse
Le thème de notre album c'est tout niquer en étant un blanc-bec
Le rap game sur ma bite tourne en rond comme la viande d'un grec
Tu veux jouer l'rude boy mais t'es du scrotum au SIF humide
On va t'déboiter et jouer ta reum au shifumi
On débarque à Paris pour tout niquer comme l'ont fait les nazis
Flèche rouge à fond comme PES, mojo toujours levé en I
Cosmos au maximum, on est gé-char comme des uzis
Quand on pose on est dans les temps comme le petit Grégory
"Tu vois, y'a un barème quand tu lestes un corps, c'est à dire, tu fais 3 fois son poids normalement, un homme moyen, comme cette victime ci, c'est 3 fois son poids. Mais sinon, par exemple, ça change... Tu as pour les enfants ou pour les nains, ça change, pour un enfant c'est... il est plus léger un enfant, hein ... c'est 2 fois son poids, ouais 4 fois son poids. Comment ? Non, non, parfois, par exemple pour les nains c'est une fois son poids, c'est beaucoup plus lourd, hein, les os sont beaucoup plus lourds chez un nain, donc c'est une fois le poids, une vielle dame, par exemple ou un viel homme, 5 fois le poids, les os sont poreux déjà..."The storm was rough
Off the starboard bow
The sails were up
Lashed by the winds frightful howl
I fell overboard
Sunk into the sea below
That's where I heard
A song I'd never known before
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
I sought the song
In a darkened cave
That sat so black
Deep beneath the rolling waves
There, upon a rock
In a single light beam's ray
I saw a girl
And I became the words she sang
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
As the song wore on
On the melody's repeat
I got wrapped up in her arms
And I noticed she had fins for feet
I pledged my love
And I took my seat
Now, I'm a queen
And all day & night, she sings for me
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myself
You better love me 'cause I hate myselfJ'invoque les pouvoirs de Belzébuth
Comme dans GTA je baise des putes
Et direct après je les bute
J'les découpe en tranches comme des Tuc
Je crois qu'j'suis suivi par les stups
Je suis louche comme Niels Arestrup
Plus rien à foutre de ma réput'
Tout l'monde sait déjà qu'je baise des putes
Pas celles qui l'font pour payer leur loyer
Y a un respect quand il s'agit d'travailer
Juste un conseil avant de tapiner
Pense à nettoyer la merde sur ton pallier
J'veux prendre le pouvoir comme le Grand Vizir
Viens me sucer ça me fera zizir
Sur ce son j'suis le méchant en pire
Suce moi jusqu'au sang comme si t'étais un vampire
Ou mieux encore comme un zombie
Ramène tes copines, surtout si elles sont bi
Parait qu'tu es chaude, c'est c'que les autres ont dit
Parait qu'tu sautes de Clichy à Bondy
Viens avec moi, je te montrais le filon
C'est avec le bonheur que nous filons
Promis j'te ferais croquer le million
Comme avec la femme de François Fillon
J'te viole en groupe : Orange Mécanique
Je sors ma bite, range tes canines
T'es bonne ou t'es moche, dans tous les cas j'nique
J'baise entre tes loches jusqu'à c'que j'les abime
Après qu'j'ai baisé, je prends le micro
J'ai un couplet long comme la bite de Nico
Je suis un sans-dent mais j'ai encore mes six crocs
J'ai buté l'mari pour m'taper la Veuve Cliquot
Bébé j'suis romantique
Suce moi la bite
Viens pas m'dire qu'j'vais trop vite
Tu croyais quoi pour que j't'invite
J'baise des putes, j'baise des putes
C'est pas vrai mais j'baise des putes
Selfie avec Belzébuth
J'suis louche comme Niels Arestrup
On débarque dans cette boite à moitié rance appâté par les tchoins
Pirate, drapeau noir en berne on espère ramener le butin
J'parle dans la sœur et mère de cette consanguine de Christine Boutin
J'sais pas danser donc j'tise au bar, j'aperçois ton regard au loin
T'as les yeux revolver, le cul chargé, putain c'est lancinant
J'espère qu't'as des belles lèvres, qu't'a chatte ressemble pas à Didier Deschamps
J'fais du rap mégotrip, laisse des culs d'joints, mes poumons cramés
Poupée on va mé-fu, car j'aime baiser quand j'suis défoncer
J'ai niqué le rap game sans le rappeler, je l'ai ghosté si fort
Parait qu'j'suis qu'un bâtard, quand j'suis parti je l'ai laissé pour mort
Toutes ces chattes de MC's sont venu pleurer pour qu'j'reconnaisse leurs gosses
Salopes barrez-vous ma bite est difficile à la négoce
J'suis l'Boucher d'Blaviken
Ça m'fait golri quand j'te ken
L’événement est incroyable
Tequila-Heineken
Lucki le félin, j'retombe toujours sur mes pattes
Tartineur de catin, j'finis toujours dans une chatteChorus:

Verse 1:
I think it’s funny
I just think it’s funny

2nd Vs:
Yeah I heard you were the man around the way
But that’s not gonna ever make me stay
Fancy cars you drive don’t turn me on
It’s the man inside that keeps me strong
If ya blinded by the diamonds, 
Taken over by designer 
Who cares bout resumes
All I need to know is you down for me
Pre:
Just want you for you
No one else got my attention
Don’t be insecure
Cuz your the one I'm obsessed with

I just wanna love you, love you, love you
Want you for me, me, me
Just let me love you, love you, love you
That’s how it should be, be, be
I just wanna love you, love you, love you
Put up the fight, fight, fight
Break down them walls, walls, walls
It’s all about us tonight, night, night
Chorus:
Shut up & love me
Ion wanna know bout what you have or where you been
Shut up & love me
I just wanna be ya homie, wifey & friend
Shut up & love me
Just be yourself, Ion want no one else

Shut up & love me Lyrics from Snippet
Bought a high-speed, but you still ain't ate
All that greed, you'll fit right in
Took a little break, now I'm back up to ten
Burn this bitch down like little league
Put a bad bitch in the 
Fifty K earring, nothing cheap
Bitch and her friend wanna buy me chrome
Sit back, feelin' like 
 give me hell
Walk in, big clothes, like it's twenty-oh-threeI'm off my medic juice, trust me I got it
Flawless like me, flawless like VVS 
No getting cozy, ayy, ayy
No getting cozy
SRT the rengo
Tinted like I'm the police
Can't break my heart, you're not codeine
You got nothing for me
 I really want to see you
 bumped into your homie
Gotta hide my blessings from me
Do I deserve that?
My bitch call me a wordsmith
And leave me out your songs, damn
These niggas urk my nerves too
But I don't even show 'em that
You drive baby mamas coupe
Strictly cats and rovers now
Wide bodies and super sports
Cause I deserve that
Fuck with her when it's safe
Shorty  but I'm late
New blue mud and I count it
 shit ain't doubt it
Just woke up in a dream
And I found a codeine fountain
Aye
Guess what
Everything is what it seems
I'm getting rich off magic
2 point extra tint
Who can I trust to have it
They scream MVP
She love me like Jerry love Dallas
Aye, aye, aye
Fuck with her when it's safe
Codeine, don't do dates
Aye, aye, aye
Fuck with her when it's safe
Codeine, don't do dates, aye
No getting cozy
SRT the rengo
Tinted like I'm the police
Not pulling over for no police
Got nothing for me, aye
Baby girl got nothing for meAy, 60mgs and i'm feelin' just like myself
Baby what's best for me?
G-Lock 
Baby what's best for me?
Tinted up tracks keep gettin' next to me
Hit 'em like ecstacy
I was in a high speed when you was texting me
 arresting me
Felt my pain now they wanna invest in me
Baby what's best for me?
Codeine  can't let 'em see
She get the best of me
Mama gettin' scared she don't know i'm trying
Bitch wanna have me to herself she ain't good at lying
Ay, uh, evеrything you say true
Tony from the jump, got a nigga gon' break your hеart
Pretty girl bulletproof
Swear I like a HEMI with  SVR 
I'm not gonna lie i'd probably do that shit too
I ain't been posting, and you say i'm out of reach
Live at the Roxy in the crowd I sleep
Livin' like slime, gettin' fly gettin' geeked
Ain't tryna hate, how you don't like lean?
Why you say the same thing to me in my dream
 off now I can't get no sleep, ay
When I tell the strippers don't go to my show
Tell the other nigga better keep that lean
Can't let a nigga where I can't can't go
80mgs and i'm feelin' myself
Baby what's best for me?
60mgs and i'm feelin' just like myself
Baby what's best for me?
G-Lock 
Baby what's best for me?
Tinted up tracks keep gettin' next to me
Hit 'em like ecstacy
Ay, ay, baby what's best for me?
Ay, ay, ay
60mgs and i'm feelin' just like myself
Baby what's best for me?
G-Lock 
Baby what's best for me?Ay, I can't just quit cause my heart in this shit
I can't just quit cause my heart in this shit
Wide body, don't know how to park if its shit
Caught me a opp when she listen to me
Insecure niggas apart of this shit
I'm still on lean, its a hunnid to sip
I can't just quit cause my heart in this shit
Can't cut them off cause they stuck in my heart
Fuck with the ones, she tinted her car
Bought her a purse, Glocks and pints
Darker the fanta it looks like its art
I try to quit but my heart with the bitch
Old body straight I can't push to startAy, she hit me when i'm, ay, yuh, yuh, yuh, ay, ay
Ay, she hit me when i'm , so she, yuh, ay, yuh, ay, uh
Ay she hit me when i'm gone, so she sorry on my posts
Really from the west but I get it on the low
S up on my chest, off this 30 I just float
I woke up with them racks, spent the penny just to boast
We only want the facts all the other shit for broke
I don't want no  cause I couldn't get it when I was broke
That's just how she act, she so sedictive when she's on go
Undertaker, dead man, walkin' on a tight rope
Ain't no kickstand, we layin' on the floor
She fucked him cause the wrist band, got her in my show
Really in Atlanta  from the go
Disrespect the Fanta, it remind me of a hoe
Really in the matrix, and its mind over matter
Geeked up, sippin' green couldn't find nobody who had it
 to them fan hoes, them boujee sluts a challenge
I was sixteen had yo bitches in white palaces

Yo, aye, way too many xans up, yo, yo, yo, aye
Yo, aye
Way too many xans up how I don't sleep
 how I don't creep
It's too many goofies talking bout they know me
When I talk about this trash you gotta show me
Break a bitch, I get her back, I feel like Kobe
Push starter all night, I get to know me
I still ride with Kenny Cho, he good with police
Tryna meet all of my idols, hope I OD
She said she a real one, she gotta show me
I don't  serving codeine
Tell her look me in my eyes like she owe me
And I still count with Kenny Cho
I bet we ain't off a Penny though
I said fuck drank, but it's in me though
Have you ever floated? What's a kidney, bro
All this talking, save the truth up at my funeral
And I still sip with Kenny Cho
And I still count with Kenny Cho
And I, oh
This is a high quality film, right?
Oh, oh, I bet we ain't off a Penny though
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Aye, 
This is a high quality film, right?Oxy
Ay, ay, ask about shorty i'm the truth too
Ay, oh, ay, huh, oh, ay
Ask about shorty i'm the truth too
We can be forever, keep this mutual

Ay, ay, I can see the stars through the tunnel, wo
I can't stick around get to comfortable, ay oh
Can't you see they frauds tryna run with you
Ay, oh, ay, ay, ay, ay, oh
Pour a four in my Minute Maid, reached my limit dang
I'ma slid her, down the interstate in that Viper thang
Too much feelings, she distracting me, i'm stuck in my ways
Off this molly, my hoe pressing buttons think this a arcade
In the mirror all this lean and soda puffing up my face
Niggas copy, they gon die with me, sippin' to the grave
Niggas bragging about bein' independent, not even getting paid
My bitch trippin', Wockhardt in the way, Wockhardt here to stay
Whatchu thought, i'ma dashboy ain't no tax for it
Ion see them, little ass boy, lose a bag boy
Wanna see me, bitch i'm out the way, 
Why you crying about the attention and you asked for it, ay
Bitch you ain't nothing I ain't use too
Rolling off a flat, it look like fruit loops
I know her exactly i'm like who you?
Bitch you ain't nothing I ain't use tooVroom, uh, oh, vroom, vroom, yuh, ay, ay
The city dangerous, I won't go on a date with the hoe
Vroom, ay, ay, ay
The city dangerous, I won't go on a date with the hoe
Like what we making it, its always about my cape with the hoe
I wouldn't have it any other way, get it girl
No finesse with them suburban hoes, want city girls
In the low-end staring at the lake
Let me demonstrate or execute, you hear me girl
On the eway I go, Vroom Vroom, hear me girl
Catching feelings for a rap nigga, silly girl
But ain't no tellin' though, she might put the check in my face
Creep in the venue, and they didn't even check proper ways
You in your feelings not your bag, you ain't with that with me babe
That shit ain't hurt me when it happen I was stuck with me babe
I miss New York, Wockhardt I score, I'm in them buildings
Free my slime, he got my drank, i'm starting to feel it
Niggas lying, and filthy broke, them bitches feel it
At the bank, I couldn't deposit, a single feeling
The city dangerous, I won't go on a date with the hoe
Like what we making it, its always about my cape with the hoe
I wouldn't have it any other way, get it girl
No finesse with them suburban hoes, want city girls
Huh, vroom, vroom, vroom, ay
Vroom, vroom, vroomChorus:

        Ay, oh, ay, ay, ay
She offended me, I don't even know how you even talkin'
I like, I use to see 'em when I was walkin', she a, oh, ay
She offended me, I don't even know how you even talkin'
I like GLE's, I use to see 'em when I was walkin'
She say my friend with me, ain't no part of you give me options
It ain't shit I got it, you ain't buddy you count my pockets
In the Raq we the hottest,  can't wait to stop it
My lil brothers clockin', I love E cause he the smartest
Don't beliеve it, I don't love her if shе ain't in my pockets
I'm Derrick Jeter, in the bitty 
 with the scope, that's just me who got it
One to many 30's, quittings not a option
These lil bitches flirting
My bitch out her body
I'm too busy workin', scared of empty pockets
Police make me nervous, but my new lawyer cocky
Treat this shit like Fortnite, my city a gauntlet
Treat this shit like courtside, bring her to my block then
I don't fuck with your side, just broke niggas plotting
She offended me, I don't even know how you even talkin'
I like GLE's, I use to see 'em when I was walkin'
She say my friend with me, ain't no part of you give me options
It ain't shit I got it, you ain't buddy you count my pockets
Ay, broke bum ass nigga
Dash money AMG,  grouphome
Yuh, She offended me, I don't even know how you even talkin', yo ay
Of course I don't need to be friends with other rappers, I got a bunch of niggas behind me
Ay, ay, ay, she offended me, I don't even know how you even talkin'AMG
Talkin' shit as usual
In a sixteen ounce pop, it’s 200 a dollar cup
She gon send me love back, what expected from a slut
This codeine gave me a gut, and got me up
Freewave threw a steppin' stone, I recouped my first month
I got two new  phones, one for bucks, one for sluts
Give my new hoe both lines, still a sucker for some love
Do me dirty both times not a hunnid K to come
Got my heart broke one time, 
In LA not courtside
And the 40s with my cuz
Gotta keep it both ways
I'm a weirdo with a gun
Ask about thе old days, shut the party down for fun
Hellcat sound like road ragе, vroom vroom it made her cum
Take me back to those days, want no money  trust
Can’t go back to those days jumpin' niggas on the bus
My lil bitch want sola
I ain't high, it ain't no good
What's Miami finger lickin'
Now we out west with a gun
Now we my way, but I still miss the low
Wockhardt on the seal take 290 then we gone
Huh, huh, ay
In a sixteen ounce pop, it's 200 a dollar bucks
She gon send me love back, what expected from a slut
Codeine gave me a gut,  got me up
Freewave threw a steppin' stone, I recouped my first month, facts pussy
Ha, of fuckin’ course
Woah, woah, woah, ay
Woah, ay
Of course
Ha, of fucking course you would try to keep with us
Every time though, AMG group home  like that
Copy, copy, copy, ay
Lucki and tune 808Catch me cruising with the lid open
Blue ocean, lit left the crib smoking
Old bay, had her legs soaking
Made it easier to crack like the shell broken
Huddle up, You could use the coaching
A lil butter kept it smooth while the bread toasting
A lot of reck, can't dispute commotion
I just tell them keep it real they go off pure emotion
Guess its deeper than rap, temperature check
Put the heat to ya back, hope you don't freeze up
Enеrgy change, you a mood rang
Love the ass, still a titty boy I'm two chainz
9/11 that was two planе
So forgive me while I bolt I look like Usain, bang
Still the hottest I'm the blue flame
Kicking fire on my Lou Kang, this ain't nothing new maine
Forgive me, Forgive me
Looking back at my life
So much wrong ,I'm just tryna get right
Forgive me, Forgive me
Looking back at my life
So much wrong ,I'm just tryna get right
I talk to God cuz it's been a while
Dark times made It hard to see a nigga smile
Wild thoughts, I'm talking hella foul
Almost convinced I brought him up, just to let him down
But never mind that shit we spin the town
Big bags, hit the jeweler just to bust it down
O.T.F only the fam around
And I ain't Phelps, so the motto we just lettem drown
My boogie board was wore daily, all 80's
Gottem looking all crazy
Heavy chicken made the fit gravy
Plus the handle 99 so I'm never shakey
Its been a minute, I been illing lately
HD I'm 4k you still 1080
The clearer picture em, I slim shadys
Now my circle bout as small as a pin maybe
Forgive me, Forgive me
Looking back at my life
So much wrong ,I'm just tryna get right
Forgive me, Forgive me
Looking back at my life
So much wrong ,I'm just tryna get right

Pretty girl from the rack in the hills for the winterJ'erre sans but comme Marcello dans la Dolce Vita
La nuit j'raye des voitures comme Diam's et Vitaa
Tous les jours j'erre sans but, la ville est mon habitat
Je s'rai toujours en elle, je n'connais pas le célibat
J'erre sans but comme Marcello dans la Dolce Vita
J't'ai proposé de v'nir avec moi mais tu m'évitas
Je suis des meufs mineures qui ressemblent à Lolita
J'ai un regard pervers, la dégaine d'Alfred Molina
Et oui gars, j'en suis là
Tout l'monde pense que j'suis un cas
J'n'ai jamais été très haut mais en tous cas là, je suis bien bas
J'ai une gueule de bois constante
J't'offre un verre si ça te tente
J'dois pas rentrer trop tard à la maison mes bouteilles m'attendent
Et je taffe toute la journée pour engraisser des actionnaires
Nique sa mère
J'suis pas sur cette terre pour vivre sur des horaires
Le soir j'ai des crises d'angoisse, quand je pense à mon future
Vie de jeune blanc aisé qui se perd dans la lecture
J'manque d'air pur
J'suis blasé et je vis dans l'amertume
J'suis pas en forme, j'devrais manger plus de fruits et d'légumes
J'erre sans but, je tremble et puis au fond je vous hais
Tout est faux comme le 11 septembre et le film sur NWA
J'traîne toujours mes Vans trouées, ma dégaine d'lendemain d'jour de l'an
J'recherche un but et j'me fais chier, regard noir comme à l'enterrement
J'sais pas pourquoi je suis ici au bout de 27 ans sur la terre
J'sais pas pourquoi j'traîne la nuit, à la recherche de la lumière
Attiré par les néons fluos des stripclubs et des sex shop
Mais jamais rien d'nouveau, j'finis au pub avec les potes
Alcoolique par lassitude
Je m'ennuie par habitude
Jamais la bonne attitude
J'rève d'partir vers d'autres lattitudes
J'me verrais bien glander sur une plage de Micronésie
La hess est plus cool au soleil qu'entouré de micro-nazis
Dans ma tête j'me tire d'ici, j'dis même pas merci pour le poisson
Et j'continue d'rôder la nuit, j'me perds dans un débit d'boissons
J'marche comme un rat des villes, hypnotisé par cet air de flute
J'suis différent d'ces débiles, j'insulte même pas leur mère de pute
J'recherche un sens à ma vie, la vie n's'arrête pas si j'me bute
J'rentre tard et je traîne la nuit, je zone pour rien et j'erre sans butHis name is Cody. He works at Wal-Mart
He's a ripe young man of 35
He wears his khakis, that old blue t-shirt
Thanks the good Lord for each day that he's alive
His manager loves him. She's always gushin'
'Bout how he greets every customer with a smile
Cody's worked here going on ump-teen years
So, yeah, I guess you could say he's been hear for a while
Workin' that same old job, punchin' that same old clock:
Seems enough to drive a man made inside
But Cody's got a roommate. He calls her mother
Been just the two of them since Papa died
They live together in all kinds of weather
In a modest little home down off Route 5
Sure, it's mobile. That don't matter, though
Both of them and all the cats are happy inside
And when the rain comes, Cody listens to it drum
On the roof while he sits just for a while
'Cause Cody's got time to burn before they place him in that earth
And he don't know any better than to wear a smile
Oh, Cody. Your ignorance is bliss
I reckon that's why no one ever sees you spit
And Cody, I'm afraid to ask you to change
'Cause I think it's kinda beautiful how you don't have any shame
But Cody, how can we let you live like this?
There's so much more to life than this made-in-China plastic
Ah, Cody. Well, maybe it's all just a game
Since you're the one still playing, that means I'm the one that's lame
What can I do? Can I live like you?
It's the American way. Yeah, yeah, yeahMR. ICICLEYou\'re falling down
In front of me
The cycles neverending
And now i know
I can\'t believe
You\'re crisis of pretending
You\'re falling down
In front of me
The cycles neverending
And now i know
I can\'t believe
You\'re crisis of pretending
I paid the rent
I stayed a while
The act was getting tired
And now i know
I can\'t believe
The act you\'d had\'s expired
I gave the best of me
And now that\'s all i\'ve got
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
And as it starts to rot
Same as it was before
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
Procrastinate
A little while
A job i need to find one
There\'s got to be
Be something more
Than asking myself what for?
There\'s little time
For me to waste
And all i do is waste it
There\'s got to be
Be something else
And i just want to taste it
I gave the best of me
And now that\'s all i\'ve got
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
And as it starts to rot
Same as it was before
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
The air is thick again
Filled with friends that i can\'t call
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
This cannot be
This cannot be right
Time,time
Thinking myself back again
Fine, fine
Lying to myself and then
Cry, cry
Tear will wash this hope away
Cry, cry, why
Oh when i find where i should be
I wish to stay
I gave the best of me
And now that\'s all i\'ve got
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
And as it starts to rot
Same as it was before
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
The air is thick again
Filled with friends that i can\'t call
I\'ve given in to live the same routine
I\'ve given in to live the
I\'ve given in to live the
I\'ve given in to live the, same routineSpend my nights all my days
In this cold room this cold place
Neighbor's noise heard from all sides
There's no quiet place to hide
Sentry unit number three
Is where I always wanna be
My carpet home my carpet hope
My carpet walls my carpet dope
Carpet 7 Double-O 3
There's no other place in town
I can make noise I can settle down
Be with people that I like
Lesdystics and Luckie Strike
Sentry unit number three
Is where I release my energy
My carpet home my carpet hope
My carpet walls my carpet dope
Carpet 7 Double-O 3
Sometimes we get pissed and shout
Cuz nothin' gets done when Jim hangs out
And it's so cold and there's sometimes rain
And it feels like a giant pain
But not one really seems to mind
And it just seems to work out fine
My carpet home my carpet hope
My carpet walls my carpet dope
Carpet 7 Double-O 3No one knows, no one sees
The rhymes and what they mean
Sour lies, and shrouded town
As shallow as this soggy ground
Smog covered truth, light rail trains
Cellophane people and what they say
Eyes that lie, lips that sting
There's gotta be someway out for me
There's gotta be someway someway
There's gotta be someway out for me
They can't see me
Only what they want from me
The truth is here
But it's not what they want to see
Maybe one day we could find a way
To wash this dirty old town away
And all it's plastic people
Could roll down the river into the bay
Then I'll run
And sing I'm free
We're victims here
If we stay the dream will end
Dead ends
And dead friends
There's gotta be someway out for meLike Prisoners we wear these chains
We're innocent and we're through
With rules that say be home at 12
They can't tell us what to do
They tell when it's safe to be
Out in our community
We know the rules
We'll disagree
We'll stay out late tonight
Many opportunities
Are wasted when authority
Takes away our right to be
Ourselves, doing what we do
So if an when I'm doing wrong
Just save your rules
And play along
Quit your acting so uptight
'Cuz we are staying out tonight!
They'll tie us down!
They'll stay home!
They'll tie us down !
We've still got so much time
Before we're forced to live like you
Our time to choose not to live our lives
Without a little sacrifice
Like Prisoners we wear these chains
We're innocent and we're through
With rules that say be home at 12
They can't tell us what to do
They tell when it's safe to be
Out in our community
We know the rules
We'll disagree
We'll stay out late tonight
 need a plan
its ok
were never going home
They'll tie us down!
They'll stay home!
They'll tie us down !

do you go away
with all that fat we must go home
They'll tie us down!

They'll tie us down !There's a place I want to see
Away from everything I couldn't be
Thought I'd never find it but here I am
And inside the looking glass
She whispered to me things I've feared
Till they all seemed faded
Till I couldn't feel
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind
From me
Follow in without a clue
Find some time some tea for two
Through the smoke I see it clear
But the party's over
I can't fight, I can't win
What the hell am I turning in
I don't know what who I am
And I don't give a damn
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind
From me
Mr. Rabbit and his ticking pocket
Watch the crescent cheshire smile
Gave my heart away for a brand new game
Wonder how long since I've died...
Fall behind
I've lost my mind and now I'm far behind
Will I make it home
Fall behind
I've lost my time and now I'm far behind
From meAnother back breaking day
Tearing away at my skin
Feeling soft and acting like i'm dull
Nothing left but dreams and peace
Halfway to sedated streets
Somewhere i'm between
Heaven and hell
Right or left i turn around
Next delay might come too soon
Feel the ground from underneath my feet
Pull the shade and hear the ring
Loud and undeniable
Stumble into another
Lost and found
And it's a Boingo dayNo one, is gonna bring me down
I could only defy myself
I'll do it on my own
Do what's good for me
It's mercury
I choose, what it is I want to do
Follow through for me
Not wasting time pretending
That I'm someone else
I'm sick of comparisonsAnd I could've rolled right off the sidewalk
If I couldn't find a place to go
Bright eyes
Big skies
Locked up it's no surprise that
I've spent another day in this beat up town
Funny how this crazy life it takes you
Everywhere you do not care to go
Believe
Achieve
You could be on to something
If you're only willing to let go
And if there's some bright idea
It's surely not mine
Another batch of questions all I find
Walking
Dowtown
Move forward looking down
Thinking that the sky will fall on me
Maybe the sky will fallWhy do I see it everywhere?
It's all around but I don't care
I see right through the mess you made
Lie motionless you've been enslaved
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
You simulate just what you saw
It's dead and now you make the laws
You put it on, wear it around
Still leave without making a sound
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
You'll get nowhere, life isn't fair
Counting faces that aren't really there
It's all an act, it's all a joke
But hey man you got signed man, aren't you stoked?
You're getting bored
Just look around
And start getting used to being let down
Why do I see it everywhere?
It's all around but I don't care
I see right through you're falling out
I'm standing you're wondering how
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
Hey sir, should I buy another one?
Was it your intention to let all this be what you portray?
You'll get nowhere
Life isn't fair
And I bet three or four years ago you had long hair
It's all an act it's all a joke
But hey man you got signed man, aren't you stoked?
Aren't you stoked, man aren't you fucking stoked?!Never thought I'd want to be stuck in Sacto again
But I'm half-way to Texas, can't believe the state I'm in
Cold, tired, and hungry, with a dollar to my name
It doesn't matter where we go this hard luck still stays the same
I'm lonely, and the floors been hard, that's how the story goes
It's funny that when your home you want to get back on the road
Drive all night just to make me sick
Play for an hour just to get my kicks
And I miss you, I miss you so
Punk rockers, sweaty shirts, smokey rooms feeling like a jar
Stick-up kids and forty ounces are waiting for me in the car
Would somebody take me home?
'Cause you don't know hard times till you know the road
I guess for us that's just how the story goes
Would somebody take me home?
'Cause you don't know hard times till you know the road
I guess for us that's just how the story goes
I guess for us that's just how the story goes The astronaut looks up again
For the alien
Some kind of story he can tell
But not so well
Something you can't take away
But then today
You can't erase your big mistakes
You learn from them
Create fiction in your head
It's to simple you'll be read
While you were out the shit went down
A thousand faces passed you by
Don't ignore what's meant to beWishes burn I start to fall
Climb so high inside it all
Pushed and pulled my arms so weak
I refuse to ask or beg for
I refuse to ask or beg for more
I've seen the truth it swallowed me whole
Hope is won from impending tales
I've seemed to forget all their worth
Put it off another day
Put it off another day
Something's creeping up on me
Somewhere I can't tell which way is up or down
Until I hit the ground
Wrong or right can't seem to find
Just a little piece of mind
Searching for that street I pray
I force myself to fake a smile
And I can't stop now my heart is broken
Put it off another day
Put it off another day
Am I cheating you?
Searching for that street I pray
