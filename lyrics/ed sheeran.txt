The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body

I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of youI found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress, looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonightWhen I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillI found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
He shares my dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
Well, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin' to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect, and he looks perfect
No, I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonightWalking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
I fluffed the pillows, made the beds, stacked the chairs up
Folded your nightgowns neatly in a case
John says he'd drive then put his hand on my cheek
And wiped a tear from the side of my face
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
You got to see the person I have become
Spread your wings and I know
That when God took you back
He said, "Hallelujah, you're home"When your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling, I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Well me, I fall in love with you every single day
I just wanna tell you I am
So honey, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause, honey, your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
And I'm thinking 'bout how
People fall in love in mysterious ways
And maybe it's all part of a plan
Well I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
That, baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
So baby, now, take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh baby, we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areShe played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
A cappella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway GirlI'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
I don't like nobody but you, it's like you're the only one here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, I don't care
I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here
I don't like nobody but you, baby, yeah
'Cause I don't care 
When I'm with my baby, yeah 
All the bad things disappear 
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody 
I can deal with the bad nights 
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near 
You can take me anywhere 
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohOh, maybe I came on too strong
Maybe I waited too long
Maybe I played my cards wrong
Oh, just a little bit wrong
Baby I apologize for it
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And jumping in harder than
Ten thousand rocks on the lake
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
And don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
You're a mystery
I've travelled the world
And there's no other girl like you
No one, what's your history? 
Do you have a tendency to lead some people on?
'Cause I heard you do, mmm
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
And lie awake, every day
Don't know how much I can take
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
So let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
I could fall, or I could fly
Here in your aeroplane
And I could live, I could die
Hanging on the words you say
And I've been known to give my all
Sitting back, looking at
Every mess that I made
So don't call me baby
Unless you mean it
Don't tell me you need me
If you don't believe it
Let me know the truth
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into you
Before I dive right into youLoving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone, wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know, know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages, you just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Oh, you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
And if you hurt me, that's okay, baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won't ever let you go
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
"Wait for me to come home"I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Sei la mia donna
La forza delle onde del mare
Cogli i miei sogni e i miei segreti molto di più
Spero che un giorno, l'amore che ci ha accompagnato
Diventi casa, la mia famiglia, diventi noi
E siamo sempre bambini ma
Nulla è impossibile
Stavolta non ti lascerò
Mi baci piano ed io, torno ad esistere
E nel tuo sguardo crescerò
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ti ho guardato ridere e sussurrando ho detto:
"Tu stasera, vedi sei perfetta per me"
Ballo con te, nell'oscurità
Stretti forte poi, a piedi nudi noi
Dentro la nostra musica
Ho creduto sempre in noi
Perché sei un angelo e io ti ho aspettato
Quanto ti ho aspettato
Perché tu stasera, sei perfetta per meI met this girl late last year
She said, "Don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me, "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then you should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
 on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next 
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat 
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babeShe got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she’s wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I’m gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don’t wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I’m in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in 
And won’t stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me 
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Bardi, uh
You never live 'til you risk your life 
You wanna shine, you gotta get more ice 
Am I your lover or I’m just your vice? 
A little crazy, but I'm just your type 
You want the lips and the curves, need the whips and the furs
And the diamonds I prefer, in my closet, his and hers, ayy
He want the lil' mamacita, margarita 
I think that Ed got a lil' jungle fever, ayy 
You are more than 
Something borin' 
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh 
Go explore in  somethin' foreign 
Bust it up, a rain forest, it be pourin', yeah
Kiss me like you need me, rub me like a genie
Pull up to my spot in Lamborghini
'Cause you gotta see me, never leave me 
You got a girl that could finally do it all
Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh
So join me in this bed  that I'm in 
Push up on me and sweat, darling 
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing 
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border 
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with meWaking up, half-past five
Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark timesWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, days end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
'Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hopin' for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
Or sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieI was born inside a small town, I lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lies, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point, I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind, and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
Guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
Show me the locked doors, I'll find another use for the key
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that can destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the pictured perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of all evil, and fame is hell
Relationships, and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Conversations with my father on the A14
Age 12 telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, dad, and they know me
With my beaten small guitar, wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd's 240 thou'
I may have grown up, but I hope that Damian's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate, but keep erasing it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more
Another one to take the sting away
Oh, I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
But my heart will stay the same
Welcome to the new show
I guess you know I've been away
But where I'm heading, who knows?
My pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain eraserWe are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown 
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
L.A., mmm
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful, yeah
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautifulOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire 
I see fire 
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountain sideYeah, I was born a misfit
Grew up 10 miles from the town of Ipswich
Wanted to make it big, I wished it to existence
I never was a sick kid, always dismissed quick
"Stick to singing, stop rappin' like it's Christmas"
And if you're talkin' money, then my conversation's shiftin'
My dreams are bigger than just bein' on the rich list
Might be insanity, but people call it "gifted"
My face is goin' numb from the shit this stuff is mixed with
Watch how the lyrics in the songs might get twisted
My wife wears red, but looks better without the lipstick
I'm a private guy and you know nothin' 'bout my business
And if I had my 15 minutes, I must have missed 'em
20 years old is when I came in the game
And now it's eight years on and you remember the name
And if you thought I was good, well, then I'm better today
But it's ironic how you people thought I'd never be great
I like my shows open-air, Tokyo to Delaware
Put your phones in the air if you wanna be rocked
You know I want way more than I already got
Give me a song with Eminem and 50 Cent in the club
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I wanna crack on and I wanna be paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
I can still remember  tryna shop a deal 
From Taco Bell to TRL
I climbed the Billboard charts to the top until
As fate would have it , became an addict
Funny 'cause I had pop appeal
But they said time would tell  if I'd prevail 
And all I did was  put nine-inch nails 
In my eyelids now 
I'm seein' diamond sales like I'm in Zales 
Without a doubt, by any means
If rap was skinny jeans, I couldn't do anything in 'em
I'd be splitting seams of denim when I'm spitting schemes
Which really means, no "if," "ands," or "buts" are squeezin' in between
You sleep on me 'cause you're only fuckin' with me in your dreams
Not even when I'm on my deathbed
Man, I feel like Ed, it isn't time to drop the mic yet
So why would I quit?
The thought that I would stop when I'm dead
Just popped in my head
I said it, then forgot what I said
It isn't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
Ain't nobody cold as me, I dress so fresh, so clean
You can find me in my whip, rockin' my Fendi drip
Man, you know just what I mean
Shinin', wrist with the rocks on it, Buscemis with locks on it
Everything my voice on, this shit knock, don't it?
Balenciaga saga, I'm in Bergdorf ballin'
It's just another episode, my hoes, I spoil 'em
She like the fly shit and I like to buy shit
Shit, I'm gettin' stupid money, what else we gon' do with money?
Bitch, we be ballin' out, the king bring you 50 bottles
Tonight, we gon' blow a check, worry 'bout your shit tomorrow
The turn up be so real, we 'bout to be super lit
Boy, I'm kickin' straight facts, that's just how we do this shit
Tomorrow, we hangin' over 'til we start feelin' sober
Then it's time to start it over, here we go again
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
And it's about time you remember the name
Ayy, ayy
You know it ain't my time to call it a day
I got rap locked and I'm already paid
But it's 'bout time you remember the name
Ayy, ayyNah nah nah nah nah
I heard he spent five hundred pounds on jeans
Goes to the gym at least six times a week
Wears boat shoes with no socks on his feet
And I hear he's on a new diet and watches what he eats
He's got his eyebrows plucked and his arsehole bleached
Owns every single Ministry CD
Tribal tattoos and he don't know what it means
But I heard he makes you happy, so that's fine by me
But still, I'm just keepin' it real
Still lookin' at your Instagram and I'll be creepin' a lil'
I'll be tryin' not to double tap, from way back
'Cause I know that's where the trouble's at
Let me remind you of the days when
You used to hold my hand
And when we sipped champagne out of cider cans
I guess if you were Lois Lane, I wasn't Superman
Just a young boy tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Your new man rents a house in the 'burb
And wears a man bag on his shoulder, but I call it a purse
Every year, he goes to Málaga with all the fellas
Drinks beer, but has a six pack, I'm kinda jealous
He wears sunglasses indoors, in winter, at nighttime
And every time a rap song comes on, he makes a gang sign
Says "Chune, bwoydem light up the room!"
But enough about him, girl, let's talk about you
You were the type of girl who sat beside the water readin'
Eatin' a packet of crisps, but you will never find you cheatin'
Now you're eatin' kale, hittin' the gym
Keepin' up with Kylie and Kim
In the back of the club, kissin' a boy that ain't him
Okay, you need to be alone
And if you wanna talk about it, you can call my phone
I just thought I would tell you, 'cause you oughta know
You're still a young girl tryin' to be loved
So let me give it to ya
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
Baby, I'm not tryin' to ruin your week
But you act so differently
When you're with him, I know you're lonely
Please remember you're still free
To make the choice and leave
Don't call me up, you need to show me
I don't wanna know about your new man
'Cause if it was meant to be
You wouldn't be callin' me up tryin' to
'Cause I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
I don't wanna know about your new man
We'll get there eventually
I know you're missin' all this kind of love
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about me
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
But I'm positive that he don't wanna know about
I don't wanna know about your new manYou are the one, girl
And you know that it's true
I'm feeling younger
Every time that I'm alone with you
We were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
In the summer
As the lilacs bloom
Love flows deeper than the river
Every moment that I spend with you
We were sat upon our best friend's roof
I had both of my arms around you
Watching the sunrise replace the moon, but
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
So tell me that you love me too
Yeah, we were sitting in a parked car
Stealing kisses in a front yard
We got questions we should not ask
How would you feel
If I told you I loved you?
It's just something that I want to do
I'll be taking my time
Spending my life
Falling deeper in love with you
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me too
Tell me that you love me tooI was twenty-four years old
When I met the woman I would call my own
Twenty-two grand kids now growing old
In that house that your brother bought ya
On the summer day when I proposed
I made that wedding ring from dentist gold
And I asked her father, but her daddy said, "No
You can't marry my daughter"
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
Well, I met her at Guy's in the second World War
And she was working on a soldier's ward
Never had I seen such beauty before
The moment that I saw her
Nancy was my yellow rose
And we got married wearing borrowed clothes
We got eight children, now growing old
Five sons and three daughters
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford border
From her snow white streak in her jet black hair
Over sixty years I've been loving her
Now we're sat by the fire in our old armchairs
You know Nancy, I adore ya
From a farm boy born near Belfast town
I never worried about the king and crown
'Cause I found my heart upon the southern ground
There's no difference, I assure ya
She and I went on the run
Don't care about religion
I'm gonna marry the woman I love
Down by the Wexford border
She was Nancy Mulligan
And I was William Sheeran
She took my name and then we were one
Down by the Wexford borderWell get up, up on the dancefloor tonight
I've got two left feet and a bottle of red wine
Making me feel like the beat and the bassline
Are in my blood, both hands up on her waistline
Get on up, baby, dance to the rhythm of the music
Don't care what the DJ chooses
Get lost in the rhythm of me
Place don't close until we wanna leave it
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Well, get up, up on the dancefloor, move, it's a Saturday night
I fell in love with the sparkle in the moonlight
Reflected in your beautiful eyes
I guess that is destiny doing it right
And dance like they do in the Mediterranean
Spin you around me again and again, and
You're like something that God has sent me
I want you, baby, solamente
And you and I, we're flying on an aeroplane tonight
We're going, somewhere where the sun is shining bright
Just close your eyes
And let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Barcelona
Oh, Barcelona
So let's pretend we're dancing in the street
In Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
We'll dance around La Sagrada Familia 
Drinking Sangría
Mi niña, te amo mi cariño 
Mamacita, rica
Sí tú, te adoro, señorita 
Nosotros, vivir la vida
Come on, let's be free in Barcelona
Las Ramblas, I'll meet you
Come on and dance with me in Barcelona
Drinking Sangría
I just want to be in Barcelona
Mamacita, rica
Feel that summer breeze in Barcelona
Los otros, viva la vida
Siempre vida BarcelonaNow I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
And I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me, hey
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
I sing, "I write my own tune and I write my own verse," hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
Musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi yeah
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realize
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, now moving steady
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
Woooah
Woooah
Woooah
Yea
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the old jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flows developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
Do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women, then I packaged the image
Put in some content, then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me man
Don't need yu
Cool…Ain't got a soapbox I can stand upon
But God gave me a stage, a guitar and a song
My daddy told me, "Son, don't you get involved in
Politics, religions, other peoples' quarrels"
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know when I have children they will know what it means
And I pass on these things my family's given to me
Just love, and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song that I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
The revolution's coming, it's a minute away
I saw people marching in the streets today
You know we are made up of love and hate
But both of them are balanced on a razor blade
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
I know, I'm all for people following their dreams
Just re-remember life is more than fittin' in your jeans
It's love and understanding positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
I'll paint the picture, let me set the scene
You know, the future's in the hands of you and me
So let's all get together, we can all be free
Spread love and understanding, positivity
We could change this whole world with a piano
Add a bass, some guitar, grab a beat and away we go
I'm just a boy with a one-man show
No university, no degree, but lord knows
Everybody's talking 'bout exponential growth
And the stock market crashing and their portfolios
While I'll be sitting here with a song I wrote
Sing, love could change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a moment
But what do I know?
Love can change the world in a momentAnything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry 'bout her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me

Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
It's FRED again
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me

Cross me, cross me, if you, if
And she ain't messin' with no other man
And me and her have something different
I really need all you to understand

And I don't ever wanna run around
I spent my youth jumpin' in and out
But you know I fuckin' love her now
Like nobody ever could
And you know I stay trippin', am I crazy? Oh, no
I'm stickin' with my baby, for sure
Together, or solo
It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, no
So, if you hear about my lady, just know
That she ain't the one to play with, oh no
And I'll be standin' so close
So you know that, ayy
Anything she needs, she can call me
Don't worry about her, that's my seed, yup, that's all me
Just know, if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
If you cross her, then you cross me 
And nobody's comin' close, yeah
And I think that you should know that
If you cross her
Then you cross me
So come on, and let it go
Oh, I think that you should know
That she ain't messin' with no other man
Now, what you not gon' do
Is stand there, 'cross from me, like you got kung-fu
Death stare, cross arm, runnin' your mouth like a faucet
But you don't know that my girl been doin' CrossFit
Pew, kung pow, hit your ass with a cross kick
Pulling hair out, wear you out, you exhausted
Know she gonna slide anytime you bitches talk shit
Keep a lil' blade in her fuckin' lip gloss kit, ayy
No one say hi to me without her
Better pay your respect to the queen
Better do that shit without a flirt
Gotta respect the HBIC
Couple of things that you need to know
If you still wanna be friends with me
Just know if you cross her, then you cross me
Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
If you cross her

Cross me, cross me, if you, if you, if you, if you
Oh yeahI gave all my oxygen to people that could breathe
I gave away my money and now we don't even speak
I drove miles and miles, but would you do the same for me?
Oh, honestly?
Offered off my shoulder just for you to cry upon
Gave you constant shelter and a bed to keep you warm
They gave me the heartache and in return I gave a song
It goes on and on
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
I gave you all my energy and I took away your pain
'Cause human beings are destined to radiate or drain
What line do we stand upon, 'cause from here it looks the same
And only scars remain
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
But if I don't
Then I'll go back
To where I'm rescuing a stranger
Just because they needed saving just like that
Oh, I'm here again
Between the devil and the danger
But I guess it's just my nature
My dad was wrong
'Cause I'm not like my mum
'Cause she'd just smile and I'm complaining in a song
But it helps
So before I save someone else
I've got to save myself
Life can get you down so I just numb the way it feels
I drown it with a drink and out-of-date prescription pills
And all the ones that love me they just left me on the shelf
No farewell
So before I save someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I blame someone else, I've got to save myself
And before I love someone else, I've got to love myselfThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Check it, I've gotta tell you, I'm in love with your shape
You said them other bruddas couldn't really juggle your weight
And you were shy in the beginning, used to cover your face
You got that sweet, sweet loving, I'm a sucker for cake
I know, girl, you got a body they would kill for
Love you through whatever, who you tryna skip a meal for?
Girl, you're too precious, why you tryna split the bill for?
I ain't even gassing, they should have you up on billboards, that's real talk
And you can go to work and let me pick up the slack
And when you've finished what you're doing, we'll be kicking it back
We can listen to my tunes until you're sick of my raps
And I've got money in the bank, but not a figure like that
You got me looking at your shape, man, I've already won
Tryna come and kill the game like my brother Teddy done
I ain't even tryna play it cool 'cuh this is bigger than my pride
Let me multiply your lovin', then I hit you with Divide
Ayy, check
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Pour out my liquor, there's not a flaw in your figure, I'm so impressed
Come on, be my baby, come on
And baby, you can call me, it's quicker, I don't be talking on Twitter, girl, that's dead
Come on, be my baby, come on
Girl, stop curbing the question, I'll turn your curse to a blessing, that's overnight
Come on, be my baby, come on
Weigh up your options and spend a day with The Problem, I'll do you right
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on

I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of youBibia be ye ye
I lost my shoes last night, I don't know where I put my keys
I was tired and fell asleep beneath an oak tree
I bet my mother's proud of me from each scar
Upon my knuckle and each graze upon my knee, and all I know
Is I got a cab and then threw up on his car seat
He kicked me out and then I walked in the rain
I tell myself in every way I won't be doing this again
And tomorrow's a brand new day
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye
Bibia be ye ye, ye ye, ye ye
Bibia be ye ye
I remember less and less and mostly things that I regret
In my phone are several texts, from girls I've never met
And in the pocket of my jeans are only coins and broken dreams
My heart is breaking at the seams and I'm coming apart now
Now things are looking up, I'll find my shoes right next to the oak tree
And I'll get a bus straight into town and spend the afternoon
Looking around for the things that I left on the ground
And say you're with me, tomorrow's a brand new day
Someone told me, "Always say what's on your mind"
And I am only being honest with you, I
I get lonely and make mistakes from time to time
Se enioma enko ye, bibia be ye ye

I love your hair like that
The way it falls on the side of your neck
Down your shoulders and back
We are surrounded by all of these lies
And people that talk too much
You got the kind of look in your eyes
As if no one knows anything but us
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so beautiful in this light
Your silhouette over me
The way it brings out the blue in your eyes
Is the Tenerife sea
And all of the voices surrounding us here
They just fade out when you take a breath
Just say the word and I will disappear
Into the wilderness
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Lumiere darling
Lumiere over me
Should this be the last thing I see
I want you to know it’s enough for me
Cause all that you are is all that I’ll ever need
I'm so in love
So in love
So in love
So in love
You look so wonderful in your dress
I love your hair like that
And in a moment I knew you, BethShe is the sweetest thing that I know
Should see the way she holds me when the lights go low
Shakes my soul like a pothole every time
Took my heart upon a one way trip
Guess she went wandering off with it
And unlike most women I know
This one will bring it back whole
Daisies, daisies perched upon your forehead
Oh my baby, lately I know
That every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah
She is the river flow in Orwell
And tin wind chimes used for doorbells
Fields and trees and her smell fill my lungs
Spend my summertime beside her
And the rest of the year, the same
She is the flint that sparks the lighter
And the fuel that will hold the flame, oh
Roses, roses laid upon your bed spread, oh my
All this, all this I know
But every night I'll kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Well, I found love hidden inside
The arms of the woman I know
She is the lighthouse in the night
That will safely guide me home
And I'm not scared of passing over
Or the thought of growing old
'Cause from now until I go
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah
Every night I kiss you, you'll say in my ear
"Oh, we're in love, aren't we?"
Hands in your hair
Fingers and thumbs, baby
I feel safe when you're holding me near
Love the way that you conquer your fear
You know hearts don't break around here
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You know hearts don't break around here
Oh yeah, yeah, yeahOne, two, three, four
Settle down with me
Cover me up, cuddle me in
Lie down with me
And hold me in your arms
And your heart's against my chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Settle down with me
And I'll be your safety
You'll be my lady
I was made to keep your body warm
But I'm cold as the wind blows
So hold me in your arms
Oh no
My heart’s against your chest
Your lips pressed to my neck
I'm falling for your eyes
But they don't know me yet
And with a feeling I'll forget, I'm in love now
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Yeah, I've been feeling everything
From hate to love
From love to lust
From lust to truth
I guess that's how I know you
So I hold you close to help you give it up
So kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
We're falling in love
Kiss me like you wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
You wanna be loved
This feels like falling in love
We're falling in love
Falling in loveI'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a LEGO house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
And if you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right, we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it
But I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got you to keep me warm
If you're broken I'll mend you
And keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better nowGive me love like her
'Cause lately I've been waking up alone
Paint splattered teardrops on my shirt
Told you I'd let them go
And that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love

Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love
Ma-my, my-my-y, oh give me love

'Cause lately I've been craving more
And it's been a while, but I still feel the same
Maybe I should let you go
You know I'll fight my corner
And that tonight I'll call ya
After my blood is drowning in alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me, or burn this out
We’ll play hide and seek to turn this around

'Cause it's about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo 
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low 
I don't mess with your energy , no photos 
So antisocial, but I don't care 
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though 
Got my hat low, don't talk to me 
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom , when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" 
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
 Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot

On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
Don't touch me, yeahOh, I'm a mess right now, inside out
Searching for a sweet surrender, but this is not the end
I can't work it out, how
Going through the motions, going through us
And oh, I've known it for the longest time
And all of my hopes, all of my words
Are all over written on the signs
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
I messed up this time, late last night
Drinking to suppress devotion, with fingers intertwined
I can't shake this feeling now
We're going through the motions, hoping you'd stop
And oh, I've only caused you pain, you know
That all of my words will always be low
Of all the love we spoke
When you're on my road walking me home
Home, home, home, home
See the flames inside my eyes
It burns so bright I wanna feel your love, no
Easy baby, maybe I'm a liar
But for tonight I wanna fall in love
Put your faith in my stomach
And for how long I love my lover?
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now? 
For how long-long I love my lover?
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
For how long-long I love my lover, now, now
For how long I love my lover, now, now?
For how long-long I love my lover?I don't want bruise your ears
Or hurt you again
But I got back-stabbed by a black cab
When I needed a friend
Now I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now 
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you're just bluffing
Name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
With stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds 'cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need youIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING!Tell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only oneJet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while
So take me back to London 
I do deals, but I never get twanged 
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
No goons that were never in gangs 
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? 
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, traveled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home
So take me back to London
Yo, when I squeeze off this little pen of mine
Done the remix, now I got Ed on grime
And this ain't like any top ten of mine
I arrived at Wembley ahead of time
And that's stadiums, man are aliens
I drink supermalts and Vibranium
I got an RM11 titanium
And I rock a 5970 daily, but
I want soul, I want flows
Don't need tags ripping off my clothes
Don't need pricks blowin' up my phone
And Ted said, "That's just the way things go"
It's just the way things go, amazin' flows
Grime or rap, man, I gave 'em both
Took this sound that was made in Bow
Went global, man, now the case is closed
2015 in a Badingham pub
I told Stormz two years, he'll be wrapping it up
And you'll go through tears with the people you love
But when you get to the top, man, it's never enough
'Cause you can win BRITs 
And you can do Glasto 
But when you're miles away and you're feeling alone
Gotta remember that there ain't no place like home
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home 
So take me back to London
So take me back to LondonI've been spinning now for time
Couple women by my side
I got sinning on my mind
Sipping on red wine
I've been sitting here for ages
Ripping out the pages
How'd I get so faded?
How'd I get so faded?
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
I've been looking for a lover
Thought I'd find her in a bottle
God, make me another one
I'll be feeling this tomorrow
Lord forgive me for the things I've done
I was never meant to hurt no one
I saw scars upon a broken hearted lover
Oh, no, no, don't leave me lonely now
If you loved me how'd you never learn
Ooh, coloured crimson in my eyes
One or two could free my mind
This is how it ends
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
Fading out again
I feel the chemicals
Burn in my bloodstream
So tell me when it kicks in
Well, tell me when it kicks in
Tell me when it kicks in
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind
Calling out across the line
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
All the voices in my mind 
Calling out across the line 
So tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
Brokenhearted
Tell me when it kicks in
And I saw scars upon her
Tell me when it kicks in
BrokenheartedI found your hairband on my bedroom floor
The only evidence that you've been here before
And I don't get waves of missing you anymore
They're more like tsunami tides in my eyes
Never getting dry, so I get high
Smoke away the days, never sleep with the light on
Weeks pass in the blink of an eye
And I'm still drunk at the end of the night
I don't drink like everybody else
I do it to forget things about myself
Stumble and fall with head spin I've got
My mind's with you but my heart's just not
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
That's why you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
Everybody said we'd be together forever but I know that
I never wanna settle down, come around
Break up the love like Lego now
Never wanna turn into another "like you"
Sleep with my thoughts, dance with my views
Everything’s great, not everything’s sure
But you live in your halls and I live in a tour bus
Now I'm in position to be another stalker
Like every thing I say seems to always sound awkward
Like our last kiss it was perfect, we were nervous
On the surface
And I'm always saying everyday that it was worth it
Pain is only relevant if it still hurts
I forget like an elephant, or we can use a sedative
And go back to the day we fell in love just on our first kiss
So am I close to you anymore if it's over
And there's no chance that we'll work it out?
Oh, you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
Because, if I was gonna go somewhere
I'd be there by now
And maybe I can let myself down 
And thinking I am unaware, I keep my feet on the ground
Keep looking around, to make sure I'm not, the only one to feel low
Because if you want, I'll take you in my arms and keep you sheltered
From all that I've done wrong
And I'll know you'll say, that I'm the only one
But I know God made another one of me
To love you better than I ever will
'Cause you and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I lied
You and I
Ended over U-N-I
And I said that's fine
But you're the only one that knows I liedThings were all good yesterday
And then the devil took your memory
And if you fell to your death today
I hope that heaven is your resting place
I heard the doctors put your chest in pain
But then that could've been the medicine
And now you're lying in the bed again
Either way I'll cry with the rest of them
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love
And things were all good yesterday
But then the devil took your breath away
And now we're left here in the pain
Black suit, black tie, standing in the rain
And now my family is one again
Stapled together with the strangers and a friend
Came to my mind, I should paint it with a pen
Six years old, I remember when
And my father told me "son
It's not his fault he doesn't know your face
And you're not the only one"
Although my grandma used to say that he used to sing
Darling, hold me in your arms the way you did last night
And we'll lie inside for a little while here, oh
I could look into your eyes until the sun comes up
And we're wrapped in light and life and love
Put your open lips on mine and slowly let them shut
For they're designed to be together, oh
With your body next to mine, our hearts will beat as one
And we're set alight, we're afire love
Oh love
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And my brother and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujah
And all my brother and my sisters
And my father and all of my family
Rise from their seats to sing hallelujahI'm not a rapper, I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics, you know
You'll find me ripping the writtens out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten 'cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm, prisoner with the vision
Signed to a label but didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't, so perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system and you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga, we drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I'll do my own thing now and get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded like a paperweight
At 16 years old, yeah, I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray, I tried to say goodbye and I choked
And went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star and adding to the population
Not my imagination, I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax? I'll take it back now
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack, I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black when I bring it to school
I'll make a beat with my feet by just hitting a loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove that I can fit in these shoes
I'll give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene like an Opal Fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm, I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering, "Everything that happens is from now on"
I'll be ready to start again by the end of the song
And still they're claiming that I handle it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy except the NME
But I'll be selling twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me and festival fees
Are healthier than a dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses, rubber dinghy rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect, and I don't know if I'll have it
This song's from the heart, covered the planet, I'll take it back now
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No, I'll take it back now
Now, I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's gotta win worst-dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene, giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change, thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking Absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly, need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again, living life on the edge with a closed handful of friends
It's good advice from the man who took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be, I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams, but
But I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be, but more likely
You'll find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid, discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised, remembering our background, sat down
That's how we plan it out, it's time to take it back now
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm, come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
My dreams keep me awake at night, written in rhyme
Till I deliver the hype, am I just living a lie?
With this you must know that the numbers just sold
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 percent of it when we wake
But the other 10 percent, it never fades
Dreaming dreams of day-to-day goals, stay awake loads
Tried to make the cut like the paper with a razor blade
Oh, never give up, just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me busking on the street when it was cold outdoors
Now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold-out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it, never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper, I'm a singer, I just take the piss
And most of these other guys are kids that pose
His little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams are your own, just set your goals and have the upmost faith in it
Tread your own path, you'll never make it as a follower
You'll never know where you will go or you will be tomorrow

Blud, take off your shoes when you're here
Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here
It's Brum
Fam, are you dumb?
Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed 'til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze cos I won't take none
VIP in my own section
Wild, wild west with the old western, it's Brum!
Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny
Blacked out Roll full of yack and maggy
And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali
Hit the booth, man, slap it snappy
Bap bap, that's that, track wrapped, I'm happy
Some man are blessed, some are bad and trappy
Gets cold up north, pack your hat and trackie'
Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid
Fam, I stayed in my lane and came with that flame
Day to day we on stage
Make my K, then I skate and catch the next plane
Baking up when I wake
Rake it up, get it saved
It's make it or break
It's make it or break
Human man, still make a mistake
Mad now Aitch just made a mixtape
Told Jaykae to make the next eight
We 'bout to set pace, I can't get about no more it gets bait
And I don't get head no more, I get face
She don't want him no more, she wants Jay
And she don't want me no more, she wants Aitch 
Jaykae, make a lot of P 
Go straight there if that's where I've got to be
Wait, stop, pop my collar, I'm a G

Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome
No town does it quite like my home 
So take me back to LondonMy lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight, day to day, it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell does she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forget
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Baby, the best part of me is you 
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you 
Baby, I'm so in love with you 
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with youYou're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers 'round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right
You're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
And eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll tell you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
You are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
Oh, you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my
Thumb and hold me tight
And you'll be all right
You were just a small bump unborn
Just four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as whyI should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
'Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
'Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
'Cause we've watched it 12 times
And maybe you're hoping for a fairy-tale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blu-ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
And your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me 'til I fall asleep
And flutter eye lash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try and get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I’ll take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Cos maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Or maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I fell in love when you woke me upIt's just another night, and I'm staring at the moon
I saw a shooting star and thought of you
I sang a lullaby by the waterside and knew
If you were here, I'd sing to you
You're on the other side, as the skyline splits in two
I'm miles away from seeing you
But I can see the stars from America
I wondered, do you see them too?
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
I can hear your heart on the radio beat
They're playing "Chasing Cars" and I thought of us
Back to the time you were lying next to me
I looked across and fell in love
So I took your hand back through lamp lit streets, I knew
Everything led back to you
So can you see the stars over Amsterdam?
You're the song my heart is beating to
So open your eyes and see
The way our horizons meet
And all of the lights will lead
Into the night with me
And I know these scars will bleed
But both of our hearts believe
All of these stars will guide us home
And oh, I know
And oh, I know
And oh
I can see the stars
From AmericaNow I don't wanna hate you
Just wish you'd never gone for the man
And waited two weeks at least
Before you let him take you
I stayed true, I kind of knew
You liked the dude from private school
He's waiting for the time to move
I knew he had his eyes on you
He's not the right guy for you
Don't hate me 'cause I write the truth
No, I would never lie to you
But it was never fine to lose you
And what a way to find out
It never came from my mouth
You never changed your mind
But you were just afraid to mind out
But  it
I won't be changing the subject, I love it
I'll make your little secret public
It's nothing, I'm just disgusted with the skeletons
You sleep with in your closet to get back at me
Trapped and I'm lacking sleep
Fact is you're mad at me
Because I backtrack so casually
You're practically my family
If we married then I'll guess you'd have to be
But tragically our love just lost the will to live
But would I kill to give it one more shot?
I think not
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
Recently I tend to zone out
Up in my headphones to Holocene
You promised your body but I'm away so much
I stay more celibate than in a monastery
I'm not cut out for life on the road
'Cause I didn't know I'd miss you this much
And at the time we'd just go, so sue me
I guess I'm not the man that you need
Ever since you went to uni
I've been sofa surfing with a rucksack
Full of less cash and I guess that could get bad
But when I broke the industry
That's when I broke your heart
I was supposed to chart and celebrate
But good things are over fast
I know it's hard to deal with and see this
I tend to turn you off and switch on my professional features
Then I turn the music off
And all I'm left with is to pick up my personal pieces, Jesus
I never really want to believe this
Got advice from my dad and he
Told me that family is all I'll ever have and need
I guess I'm unaware of it
Success is nothing if you have no one there left to share it with
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
Anymore
And since you left, I've given up my days off
It's what I need to stay strong
I know you have a day job but mine is 24/7
I feel like writing a book, I guess I lied in the hook
'Cause I still love you and I need you by my side if I could
The irony is if my career in music didn't exist
In 6 years, yeah, you'd probably be my wife with a kid
I'm frightened to think if I depend on cider and drink
And lighting a spliff I fall into a spiral and it's
Just hiding my misguiding thoughts that I'm trying to kill
And I'd be writing my will before I'm 27, I'll die from a thrill
Go down in history as just a wasted talent
Can I face the challenge, or did I make a mistake erasing ?
It's only therapy, my thoughts just get ahead of me
Eventually I'll be fine I know that it was never meant to be
Either way I guess I'm not prepared, but I'll say this
These things happen for a reason and you can't change 
Take my apology, I'm sorry for the honesty
But I had to get this off my chest
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't want you no
Anymore
I don't love you baby
I don't need you baby
I don't wanna love you no
AnymoreI'm feelin' like a bullet jumpin' out a gun
I'm feelin' like a winner, I feel like the one
You're doing somethin' to me, you're doing somethin' strange
Well, jump back, talk to me, woman
You make me wanna make a baby, baby, uh
Supernatural woman, supernatural freak
Don't know what you're doin', got me feelin' weak
Oh, I wanna call you fever, baby, you can set a fire on me
Hot damn, pop it like a pistol, mama
You got me down on my knees, begging please
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
You red leather rocket, you little foxy queen
Everybody's watching, pretty little thing
Baby, tell me, what's your fantasy?
Come closer, let's talk about it
You want white lines in a limousine
Whipped cream, and everything in between, yeah
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mind
I'm comin', baby
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you, yeah
Locked, loaded, shoot my shot tonight
I'm comin', baby
I'm gunnin' for you
Pull my trigger, let me blow your mindI've known it for a long time
Daddy wakes up to a drink at nine
Disappearing all night
I don't wanna know where he's been lying
I know what I wanna do
Wanna runaway, runaway with you
Gonna grab clothes, six in the morning, go
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own
I've never seen my dad cry
Cold as stone in the kitchen light
I'll tell you it's about time
But I was raised to keep quiet
This is what I'm gonna do
Gonna runaway, gonna make that move
Gonna grab clothes and when it's morning, go
"How long you leaving?"
Well, Dad just don't expect me back this evening
Oh, it could take a bit of time to heal this
It's been a long day, thumb on side of the roadway, but
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There's nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my own
Backpack and a flat cap turned to the back
As I packed my clothes up
My dad wasn't down with that plan to attack
Intends to show love
I don’t wanna live this way
Gonna take my things and go
If things change in a matter of days
I could be persuaded to hold on
Mama was the same
None of us are saints, I guess that God knows that
I don't wanna runaway
And one of these days, I might just show that
Put my home in a suitcase
Tie both shoe laces, and hope that
Things change, but for now I'll leave town
With a backpack on my shoulder
I love him from my skin to my bones
But I don't wanna live in his home
There’s nothing to say 'cause he knows
I'll just runaway and be on my ownI feel it, can you feel it tonight?
I feel the fire between you and I
I mean it, don't you turn off the light
Though I don't wanna leave you ever, no
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand
So don't make plans
For nothing but me and a lil' romance," hey
You and I, whiskey on ice
Maybe later we can turn down all the lights
So keep 'em on with nothing on
Ooh-my-my-my
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you 
And you ain't got nothing on you 
Mami, suelo acobardarme pero hoy tomo alcohol, ah
Quiero comentarle que no sé qué pasó, ah
Desde que salimo' por la tarde lo' do'
A besarno' lo' do', hasta hacer el amor
Ahora tengo tu olor, ven a la habitación
Lo que hacemo' lo' do' no se puede igualar
Parecemo' ficción cuando entramo' en acción
Esta peli de amor no se puede acabar, yeh 
Pero lo que mata e' que esta noche no' vemo' ya en mi casa 
Y sé lo que te gusta y te atrapa
Que te diga que no te voy a soltar
I was rolling up something with you 
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
Look, take the lead, follow me, what's it gonna be?
How you playin' hard to get when you hollered me?
I take Chanel to Chanel for a shopping spree
Home girl, only right she in a proper tee
What I want and need, you and a sofa
I fly in a spaceship, I gotta land the Rover
Casa Cruz, Casa Blanca, Casanova
I'm a fashionista, she in Fashion Nova
And a mad persona when I had her over
The outfit, it cost bread, I got the matching loafers
Why? 'Cause that's suttin' to do
I got a million and two but they're nothin' on you, nah
I was rolling up something with you
Kickin' back in a way that we do
I got everything I need in this room
Smoke clouds and a scent of perfume
And all my friends are in the club
And they keep ringin' my phone 
But they ain't got nothing on you
And you ain't got nothing on you
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
Want to be your man
"Boy, I never took you for a one night stand"
She was like "Damn¨
And you ain't got nothing on youI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like 'when you leaving me?'
Should I, Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
On cold days, cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little loveStop the clocks, it's amazing
You should see the way the light dances off your head
A million colours of hazel, golden and red
Saturday morning is fading
The sun's reflected by the coffee in your hand
My eyes are caught in your gaze all over again
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
The weather outside's changing
The leaves are buried under six inches of white
The radio is playing, Iron & Wine
This is a new dimension
This is a level where we're losing track of time
I'm holding nothing against it, except you and I
We were love drunk, waiting on a miracle
Tryna find ourselves in the winter snow
So alone in love like the world had disappeared
Oh, I won't be silent and I won't let go
I will hold on tighter 'til the afterglow
And we'll burn so bright 'til the darkness softly clears
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglow
Oh, I will hold on to the afterglowI said, oi, you, are you gonna bang doe?
No, I want some fucking Nando's
Wanna eat up with chicken and chips
Everyone knows I freestyle like this
When I freestyle on the beat about chicken
You know it's finger lickin'
And now I'm gonna pass it over to Example now
He's gonna freestyle and he's gonna show you how
Chicken, chicken wings
They're my favourite things and I love to sing
I say chicken, chicken wings
If you give me them I will eat them tings
Yo, and we eat chicken for free
Cause he's got a black card you see
He made a song about chicken from Nando's
And are you gonna bang yo?
Yes please I want some chicken right now
Please I want to put it in my stomach yes
It tastes so good I wanna eat the chicken
With the fucking breasts and the wings
And the thighs and the chips and the...
And all them things that are nice
Nando's from me, fat chance I gotta black card
If you come to me and ask for chicken you'll get a fat scar
In your left cheek I eat Nando's every week
Sometime on a Tuesday, sometime on a Thursday 
I get free drinks, refillable even when I'm thirsty
On a Thursday I eat chicken in the worst ways
Yeah, I said we are on tour, saw him
I'm like get out the store, yo!
Cause you are a whore
Eat Nando's for free everyday on tour, yo!
And it's a par, I ate Nando's from your car
Can't freestyle cause you'll see me starve
I slap you in the face cause like I'm like Febreeze ya!
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
I eat chicken off the floor
I eat chicken off the bone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken on the phone
Chicken off the floor
Chicken off the sky
Chicken off the bone
I eat chicken off the bone
I love Nando's more than your mum does
More than your mum does
Nando's 
I love Nando's
My tongue is on fire
I wanna say Elliot 
Nando's I desire 
I want some free Nando's from your black card
You ain't getting in my wallet
Ain't getting in my wallet
I'm on it, I'm on it 
You ain't getting my wallet
Cause I need them pounds every time I go there to eat my food
And you're so fucking rude you don't fucking buy it for me
So I want Nandos for free
And you look like you put your fingers in electricity sockets
To get your hair up like this
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You're never touching my card, this is my card
You come to me, play your guitar
Step to me hard, you ain't getting my card star
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's
I want some Nando's 
I want some Nando's right nowListen, little lady
This is just the worst way to spend your birthday, it's 30 degrees, Thursday
You work late, you was with a perv making dirty fake love in his Mercedes
Lady, the word "rape" sums up events that take place every night
You wanna get up but you know your legs will ache if you try
And you remember that your punter went crazy last night
You drag yourself to the mirror to check your face then you cry
Forget the visit to the clinic you were booked in for
You'll make a trip to the Whittington where they'll look at your jaw
They'll be inquisitive and ask about your business for sure
They'll know you're fibbing if you tell them you got hit by a door
But young woman, the pimp sees you as nothing but a dumb hooker
Medical attention could be fatal cause the cunt wouldn't
Ever let a doctor near someone that's getting dough for him
Cause next you got poxy authorities sticking their noses in
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
Little lady, your mind you've made up
Your injuries you can't hide with make-up
You need some medical advice, you make up a little lie to say just
In case the doc opens his eyes and don't decide to play dumb
With any luck you'll see the same dude who stitched your top lip
Last year when your pimp just lost it
He wouldn't recognise you if you stared him in the face anyway
'Cause all the heroin is making you age
But you're a heroine for taking the strain of being a prostitute and punching bag
The funds you have left go where your from using MoneyGram
Mother had to get you out the motherland to study
That was all she struggled to have a single daughter with the upper hand
Little does she know you're never coming back
She put you in her brother's hands, only for him to formulate another plan
He's the fucking cause of your appalling state, this summer
Fancy that, you came to London to get pimped by your uncle, damn
She's just under the upper hand
And goes mad for a couple grams
And she don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Now an angel will die, covered in white
With losed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time now, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Little lady, you're trembling with fear
Your skinny frame kinda resembles a deer
You're sitting facing the detective, oh, dear
The meddling nurse couldn't just leave it
She's only gone and made it much worse calling police in
She'll never know the gravity of the damage she's caused
You're causing scandal going mad in the ward now
The cop is trying to calm you, telling you he won't let no one harm you
The same question he keeps trying to ask you, "Who you working for?"
He's talking to you like you're worth more than a dirty whore
You're having a conversation you could be murdered for
You're learning more about exactly why you need to help bring him or her to court
He's kicking knowledge you ain't ever heard before
Just before he leaves, he reassures you that he knows that it's hard
He underlines a mobile number you can phone on his card
Begs you to use it, he's useless if you're gonna be stupid
'Cause an answer hasn't come from your bruised lips, you're on your own
You've gotta go and give your pimp what you owe
You reach your door and then it dawns that you've been followed home
Before you turn around you feel a cold blade on your throat
And then a voice says, "Where you been, bitch? I wanna know"
No prizes for guessing who it is, resistance would be foolishness
You open the front door, he boots you in
There's something new in him, he's silent now, that fills you with terror
Get your alibi straight, you could be killed for an error
He towers over you, the six-inch knife catches the sunlight
At this point, your life flashes before your eyes
Your handbag's dropped and all the contents are all over the floor
Despite the mess there's only one thing that has caught his eye
And in the moment of rage, he brutally murders his niece
And dumps her body in the boot of his Mercs in the street
Little lady left this earth in the worst way
All because she got a card on her thirteenth birthday
And we're all under the upper hand
And going mad for a couple grams
And we don't wanna go outside, tonight
'Cause, in a pipe, she'll fly to the motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
And fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
And angels to dieHe rode through the streets of the city
Down from his hill on high
O'er the wynds and the steps and the cobble
He rode to a woman's sigh
For she was his secret treasure
She was his shame and his bliss
And a chain and a keep are nothing
Compared to a woman's kiss
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are warm
For hands of gold are always cold
But a woman's hands are ...Ooh, I can't wait to get home
I don't know why, but I'm feelin' low
Happened again and I want you to know
Having my woman there is good for my soul
I try to be strong, well, I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you who can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
When I'm alone with you, you make it better again, yeah
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Catch my eye, and she starts to say
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
My darlin', I'll be all you need, you need
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Hey baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whenever you need
To put it all on me
Ooh, you're there for me when I
Need you to be, 'cause I
Find it hard to say the words
But some shit don't need an explanation, baby
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want love
It's you and only you that can be takin' away
The shit that I go through each and every day
Baby, I can't wait, in love with all your ways
Your arms are where I wanna remain
Grab my waist when I start to say, now
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly 
My, darlin', I'll be all you need, you need 
I know it hasn't been your day or week, or week, or week
So put it all on me
Oh, my darlin', put your worries on me
Can't judge you 'cause I feel the same thing
And I'm here for whenever you need, you need, you need
To put it all on me 
Love, on me, o-o-on me 
Hey baby, we can dance slowly 
Love, on me, o-o-on me
Put your, put your, put your worries on me
Love, on me, o-o-on me 
Hey, baby, we can dance slowly
And I'm here for whatever you need 
So put it all on me
I try to be strong, but I got demons
So can I lean on you?
I need a strong heart and a soft touch
And you're the one when I want loveI met you when I was a teen but then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder, in any other summer
Could you have been my part time lover to me listening to Stevie Wonder?
Under the covers where we used to lay
And RE: Stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home, up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching a DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stay up all night like when we needed to sleep
We go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I'll say you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don’t even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes
To get on a plane or make a mistake, so say it again
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
And every weekend in the winter you'd be wearing my hoodie
With drawstrings pulled tight to keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away we'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet, creating new habits
Acting as if we were two rabbits and then you'd vanish
Back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear, you call me selfish
I understand but I can’t help it
I put my job over everything except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever so I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluate quick before we make a mistake and it’s too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on a plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again
Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina
But then again you should know, Nina
Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?
Love will come and love will go
But you can't make it on your own
Sing that song, go
Oh won't you leave me now?
People grow and fall apart
But you can't mend your broken heart
Take it back, go
Oh won't you leave me now?

Oh Nina
You should go, Nina
Cause I ain't never coming home, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now?
And I've been living on the road, Nina

Oh, won't you leave me now, now?

Cause that’s you and me both, Nina
Oh, won't you leave me now, now?When the sins of my father
Weigh down in my soul
And the pain of my mother
Will not let me go
Well, I know there can come fire from the sky
To refine the purest of kings
And even though I know this fire brings me pain

Well, a seed needs the water
'Fore it grows out of the ground
But it just keeps on getting hard
Hunger more profound
Well, I know they can't count tears from the eye
But they may as well all be in vain
And even though I know these tears come with pain
Even so, and just the same

Oh, make it rain

Make it rain down, lord
Just make it rain

Well, the seas are full of water
Stops by the shore
It's like the riches of grandeur, oh no
Never reach the poor
And let the clouds fill with thunderous applause
And let lightning be the veins
But fill the sky with all that they can draw
When it's time to make a change

New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
This the type of shit we used to dream of 
Bad bitch look like Mona Lisa 
Flippin' off a yacht in Ibiza 
Clear port, hasta la vista
Do it all again when we touchdown, everything bust down
Teacher said I would lose, I be like, "What now?"
I started makin' moves, they showin' me love now
Lit like a light bulb 'cause, bitch, I'm the plug now
And now you know we poppin', we bubble like soda poppin'
I see it, I like it, I wake up, pull up, and go and cop it
The millions get wired, them Benny hunnids still go in pocket
I party with Ed Sheeran, my homies still hold a rocket
'Cause I'm so hood, it don't make no sense
Still remember the times I couldn't pay my rent
Now, I walk in a stadiums, tell 'em, "Play my shit"
And they gon' sing like this
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
Last night, I played a show at a stadium in Atlanta
Husband and wives, daddies and daughters with the cameras
I never thought it would get this big, but why does it matter?
Everything is already part of a plan
I remember, damn, me and my man inside of this Splitter van
200 a night, end of 2010
Stayin' up in every city's Holiday Inn
If it wasn't there, then I was at the couch of a friend's
Wetherspoon's was an easy option to get a cheaper lunch and
£2 pint, the waitress maybe leave her number
On to the next town, but now it's to the next continent 
And I don't think it's gonna be stoppin' anytime soon
Birds eye view, pay my dues for a two-mile queue
Don't need to read reviews if you can't do the things I do
Oh, let me invite you to my world
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded 
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nights
Mmm, I'm so faded, yeah
I don't even know how much I made this year
I'm so used to bein' on some player shit
Cheated on my girlfriend with a famous bitch
Hoodie on pull up, just like the Reaper, yeah
I do this on the regular, make you seem unfair
St. Laurent, Gucci sweater, the red and green Moncler
Me and Meek and Ed Sheeran just like the Beatles, yeah
From her head to her toe, she know she be flee, oh yeah
Everyday, I be seein' her and Ceiline, oh yeah
She wanna come closer, but I don't see us there
I'm not a regular person, I be low-key, oh yeah
From New York out to London
She was, she was with me all the time
And I've been on the road, so long she couldn't call my line
And now she got her ass and titties done for a thousand likes
Oh, I been on for a thousand nights
New York to London, different city every day, yeah
Playin' on, playin' on, puttin' up 50 thousand lights
Oh, I've been gone so long, gettin' up and gettin' faded
So I'm on, keepin' on, stayin' up for a thousand nightsIt's such a beautiful night, to make a change in our lives
East Anglian sky, empty bottle of wine
I got you by my side, talking about love and life
Oh how lucky am I, when I look in your eyes?
What a wonderful way, to spend a moment or two
To be lying awake, and be here talking to you
I got something to say, I know what I got to do
To be making a change, now the moment of truth
Why I’m feeling so nervous?
Things are going so perfect
Now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you
So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life
A gentle touch of the hand, fingers running through hair
Lips pressed to my lips, oh I was caught unaware
Oh so many times, I gazed in both of her eyes
What a beautiful way to spend the rest of a life
Some will reappear, burning auburn and red
I'll chest the pill, bring us home to bed
Last night was the night, one last moment of truth
What a wonderful way, to fall in deeper in with you
Why was I feeling nervous?
When things were going so perfect
Well, now I know that it’s worth it
To spend forever with you
So I count to three, and get down on one knee
And I ask you, darling honestly
I've waited all this time, just to make it right
So I ask you, tonight, will you marry me?
Just say yes
It's one word, one love, one life
One life
One life

I spent it in good company
And all the harm that e'er I've done
Alas it was to none but me
And all I've done for want of wit
To memory now I can't recall
So fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Of all the comrades that e'er I had
They are sorry for my going away
And all the sweethearts that e'er I had
They would wish me one more day to stay
But since it falls unto my lot
That I should rise and you should not
I'll gently rise and I'll softly call
Good night and joy be with you all
A man may drink and not be drunk
A man may fight and not be slain
A man may court a pretty girl
And perhaps be welcomed back again
But since it has so ought to be
By a time to rise and a time to fall
Come fill to me the parting glass
Good night and joy be with you all
Good night and joy be with you allIt's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight, hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say that death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today, hold on
So live life like you’re giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart, and hold onStar sign, Gemini
Brown eyes, fair hair in the light
We called time last night
And I can't stop thinkin’ 'bout her
And her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don't know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
’Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say
How can I see through the dark?
All I can do is wonder where you are
Are you happy in someone else's arms?
Well, that's the way to break my
Heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That’s the way to break my—
First love never dies
Guess I’ll see you in another life
12 years down the line
There's just one thing I remember
Her lips upon mine
So soft, feelings I don’t know the name of
Under the clothes we take off
Used to be two hearts in love
Oh, why, oh why am I alone?
Did I, did I do something wrong?
Am I the reason, or have you found someone else?
So tell me, girl
How can I live without love?
How can I be what you want?
'Cause when the morning comes around
You're still gone and I'll say

Well, that's the way to break my

That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my heart
That's the way to break my—
That's the—
That's the—
That's the—
Did I, did I?
That's the—
That's the—
That's the way to break my—We're not, no we're not friends, nor have we ever been
We just try to keep those secrets in our lives
And if they find out, will it all go wrong?
And heaven knows, no one wants it to
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you
We're not friends, we could be anything
If we tried to keep those secrets safe
No one will find out if it all went wrong
They'll never know what we've been through
So I could take the back road
But your eyes'll lead me straight back home
And if you know me like I know you
You should love me, you should know
Friends just sleep in another bed
And friends don't treat me like you do
Well I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you
But then again, if we're not friends
Someone else might love you too
And then again, if we're not friends
There'd be nothing I could do, and that's why
Friends should sleep in other beds
And friends shouldn't kiss me like you do
And I know that there's a limit to everything
But my friends won't love me like you
No, my friends won't love me like you do
Oh, my friends will never love me like youI was born inside a small town, I've lost that state of mind
Learned to sing inside the Lord's house, but stopped at the age of nine
I forget when I get awards now the wave I had to ride
The paving stones I played upon, that kept me on the grind
So blame it on the pain that blessed me with the life
Friends and family filled with envy when they should be filled with pride
And when the world's against me is when I really come alive
And every day that Satan tempts me, I try to take it in my stride
You know that I've got whisky with white lines, and smoke in my lungs
I think life has got to the point I know without it's no fun
I need to get in the right mind and clear myself up
Instead, I look in the mirror questioning what I've become
I guess it's a stereotypical day for someone like me
Without a nine-to-five job or a uni degree
To be caught up in the trappings of the industry
They showed me the locked doors I find another use of key
And you'll see
I'm well aware of certain things that will destroy a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
I used to think that nothing could be better than touring the world with my songs
I chased the picture perfect life, I think they painted it wrong
I think that money is the root of evil and fame is hell
Relationships and hearts you fixed, they break as well
And ain't nobody wanna see you down in the dumps
Because you're living your dream, man, this shit should be fun
Please know that I'm not trying to preach like I'm Reverend Run
I beg you, don't be disappointed with the man I've become
Our conversations with my father on the A14
Age twelve telling me I've gotta chase those dreams
Now I'm playing for the people, Dad, and they know me
With my beat and small guitar wearing the same old jeans
Wembley Stadium crowd two hundred and forty thou
I may have grown up but I hope that Damien's proud
And to the next generation, inspiration's allowed
The world may be filled with hate but keep erasing it now
Somehow
I'm well aware of certain things that will befall a man like me
But with that said give me one more, higher
Another one to take the sting away
I am happy on my own, so here I'll stay
Save your lovin' arms for a rainy day
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
And I'll find comfort in my pain
Eraser
I woke up this morning lookin' in the mirror
Thinkin' to myself that I should probably be thinner
The industry told me to look like them
But I found my happiness in fried food for my dinner
I wish that she could have been my first time
And I wish that I'd never took that first line
And I wish that every word in this verse rhymed
But forgive me if it doesn't
I wish that I could make peace with my older cousin
I wish he didn't think that it was me when it wasn't
I wish I didn't love it when I'm high and my face feels buzzin'
And the taste stays underneath my tongue, and
Wish that I had known what to do as a youngen
Wish I hadn't dropped out of school and missed every single party
With that hardly matters now, man, does it?
Wish I had an answer to everything, but fuck it
I wish creatin' art didn't come with a budget
But while we're on the subject
I wish my private life would have never gone public
But that's the sacrifice that we make
Spendin' my whole time high livin' life away
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I wish my family and friends, they stay healthy
I wish that love was a currency and the whole world was wealthy
I found myself late night wishin' on a star
Everyday I wish I'd never broken a heart, uh
And I wish I'd never run through
Every woman that I loved that kept my life and what it's come to
I wish I was the role model you looked up to
If I told my fans the things I did they'd say, "Fuck you"
I wish I was home more
I wish my team could see their kids on their birthdays, but yo, we're on tour
And I wish I'd grown more, wish I told more
People that I love 'em but it's in the music that I'm known for
And I wish he never got cancer
And if I smoke a pack a day, well, does that make me a wanker?
Oh yes, I guess it does, and we're still stressing 'cause
Every day this cocaine gets the best of us
Usin' my balance on razor blades
Spendin' my whole time high wishing life would wait
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm singin' this is how we're livin' down here
Sittin' on the edge, lookin' out without fear
Yeah, we got drama but you know we don't care
I wanna see you sing it, put your hands in the air, one wish
I'm using jumpers for goalposts, cigarettes for throat coat
Mum sayin', "Don't smoke," no, I don't listen, I got
Love for a ghost note, shows on the gold coast
People that I don't know share the same vision
I find truth in the hard times and words that aren't mine
Tryin' to find a love with a compatible star sign
Sometimes I can't write, sentences can't rhyme
Starin' at my notepad quick, I'm tryin' to find mine
Shit quick before I hit it again
Surrounded in the industry by all these ignorant men
And who knew that I'd be paid just to pick up a pen
Just let me hit the studio when we can rip it again
I'm a competitive dick with an adrenaline kick
My daddy told me, "Work hard and you can never be shit"
I've seen all my heroes dethroned except my dad
Set back here reminiscing 'bout the times we had
One wishBa-da-boom, ba-da-bing
You done knocked me right off of my feet
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah 
I waited most my life for somethin' real 
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Baby, I got the feels for ya
Jump into the crowd, leave your hand in the sky, babe
No hand, no nothin'
Gotta trust your crowd, gotta land in the cloud, babe
Baby, I got that feel 
I don't know why you're doin' this to me
I tried to tell 'em not to do it this loud
I tried to tell 'em not to bust it out the wrap' 'til we leave
I was thinkin' suicide for the rivals
I done went and bought a car with the title
Told the promoters have her on the rider
Knockin' boots backstage at the Wireless
She contagious like poison ivy
Baby, I got the feels, yeah
Say that I'm out my mind, but it's somethin' real
Somethin' real
Ooh, I got the feels, yeah

But for you, I'll travel a thousand acres
When we met, I told her I play for Lakers 
One day, we'll get married in Las Vegas 
I'm good for your health, this can't be a sin 
This love give you protein and vitamin 
See you wigglin', jigglin' 
If I have a bite, will it taste like cinnamon? 
This is one in a million
So I never ever treat you like Billie Jean
Ain't nothin' like anything I ever really seen
And you give me this feel if you know what I mean

You done knocked me right off of my feet)

If we should ever do this right

Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know
That I'll never let you down

Like you were a grade 8, but I've never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground
And never ever let you down, down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
My chest is a pillow for your weary head to lay to rest against
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are my mirror to take me to the edge again
I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
I'm never gonna let you down
Oh, I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around, so I'll know

I been away on the road for a little while
Today, I'm headin' home to make my baby smile
She hates it when I am over a thousand miles
Away, and I'm not there to pick up when she dials, yeah
She's always lookin back, and sayin' "There was a time
When you would be around every single night
Now, I'm not sayin' that I want another guy
But I need you here for the good times and the bad times
Yeah, the pullin' out my hair, gettin' mad times
Not just the when I'm in your bed on my back times
Baby, every time I call, it's a bad time
Just want you here on your own"
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home
And she keeps tellin' me over and over
 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time
I used to be around more, but I was strapped for cash
And that's not attractive, workin' my ass off
Tryna make a success outta myself I guess
I could have been more present, but I was in a mess
I remember bein' on tour, stayin' up on the phone
30 minute conversation, "Boy, when you comin' home?
I can't be buildin' a family life here on my own"
Baby, I'm doin' it for us, so why you takin' that tone?
Like I'm the bad guy
I thought it would have made me better in your dad's eyes
I'm busy stackin' up the paper for the bad times
'Cause, baby, you never know
I'm poppin right now, but there will come a day when I won't
There ain't no diamonds, silver or gold
That can replace a man's love in the home 
And she keeps tellin' me over and over
 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time 
 I don't want your money, baby, oh
You know I just want your time 
You know you're my baby 
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy
Why you gotta mess with my mind?
You know you're my baby 
I'm sorry I been away, yeah, no lie
Boy, you drive me crazy, you know, you know
I don't want your money, baby, oh 
You know I just want your time 
 I don't want your money, baby, oh 
You know I just want your time 
And I love, and I love, and I love you
Yeah, I love, and I love, and I love you
And I love, and I love, and I love you
But I want your time, yeah
Want your time, timeThis is the start of something beautiful
This is the start of something new
You are the one who'd make me lose it all
You are the start of something new, ooh
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall into my arms again
And I'll throw it all away
Watch you fall, now
You are the earth that I will stand upon
You are the words that I will sing
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall into his arms again
And I've thrown it all away
And watched you fall, now
And take me back
Take me home
Watch me fall, down to earth
Take me back, for
This is start of something beautiful
You are the start of something newBorn with a heart
That could ache more than beat
The mind of the killer
The soul of the meek
Born aimless and angry
Ran hard from the day
Left love at the crossroad
Into a man that I hate
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
I fight for the hope
That blood has a face
To give me a kiss
For the faith that I wait
Flock with no shepherd
Is a vulnerable game
I can live without heart, without love
But I do need a name
Father, do you burn if your hand is in fire?
Does your head spin with rage when fooled by the liars?
Should I drop to my knees?
Scream your name out in vain?
Tell me good teacher, are we all just insane?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?
King of the kings, do you feel any pain?You’re not her, though I try to see you differently
I tow the line, you see, I’m searching for what used to be mine
And I saw your eyes, and I saw Alice staring back at me
So I will try to find another one who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
She was mine
I was hers and all that’s in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her and keep her from the darkness that will be
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren’t clear
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
If you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scarred and left me, like a sunburn
Don’t drop me in, it’s not my turn
And if you cut deep, then I might learn
That you scar and leave me, like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I’d miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss you
And I miss youI still got a rucksack with the old clothes, I rap with cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes, in fact you don't know
On tracks I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
My flow's developing, skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Ever since I hit the mainstream with The A Team I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women and then I packaged the image
Put in some content and I then I sold it back as a gimmick
The fact is this, I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses, I think I'll need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders, I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard bars sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rappping, back to back cause I've been practicing
I'm back to sing this
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
X2
You need me
I said you need 3 man I don't need 2
Not none of ya, unorthodox runner up
In my own gear like I'm stepping on a double clutch
No brakes, cut them up, the tyres stay screeching
Now I've found out being odd ain't even
I qualified for everything, long straight season
It's not a dilemma king, got a straight queening
You are what you eat, that's something to believe in
MC with the mic is MC dinner time
Now I'm feeling gassed, like, MC give me light
I didn't even have to do a disco rap
I bet I still end up with a Sisqó plaque
This is what happens when your gift is talent
And all you imagined exists, imagine
I never drop shit and I came from the back end
Now I've got the game in my hand, I'mma smash it
You need me, but I dont need you
D-E-V-L-I-N Ed and 32
Lyrically more capable to break 'em all
I won't have to amputate a lower limb to make them fall
Like autumn, check my post mortem
The game passed away upon the day I came and killed it for this fortune
I don't mean money, I mean luck
But now the clock's aviated
Everybody's time's up
Nothing's what I had and everything's what I gave
Like a sprinter near the finish line fighting for his place
Keep your diamonds and your chains
I can walk for any manner, any time of day and stay safe
Cause I get respected
While they get detested
Tell the truth there ain't nobody that done what Devs did
If you ain't on the tune or Eminem or 5'9
You ain't competition just a fish you're tryna bite a lineIf we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep, it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when I wake up, and your make up is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, oh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We can lay down, so I'm next to you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least you're next to me
And if I wake up, you say it's late love, get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all these things I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You make me scream, and then I made you cry
When I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth?
Darling how I miss you, strawberries taste how lips do
And it's not complete yet mustn't get our feet wet
'Cause that leads to regret, diving in too soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoa
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
You're my little birdNo lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
Another night, another club
Another room, another one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
I don't know why, you're not enough
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
'Cause maybe you could just be the one, ayy
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark
Another night, another day
Been thinking 'bout it wide awake
I never thought I'd be alone
While everybody blowing up my phone
Don't trust no one, no, so don't want to get close
I get mine, I walk away
No lie, yeah, my mama always told me to be a bad girl
Never let anybody get in the way of what I'm trying to do now
This ain't man's world, thank you next, I'ma go my own way
Sometimes being solo is the way to go
When you need to figure shit out
And if I want you boy, I'ma tell you so
'Cause I'm the one in control, yeah
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely 
No lo-lo-love for the lonely , no lo-lo-love for the lonely 
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely 
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
And I will try to find someone to hold me, yeah
My love is a flickering candle , in the dark
No lo-lo-love for the lonely , no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark 
No lo-lo-love for the lonely , no lo-lo-love for the lonely, in the dark
And I will try to find someone to hold me 
My love is a flickering candle, in the darkThis city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Don't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
Hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home 
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home 
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes two
And my lungs hurt, and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I need to move along
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps, then that makes twoShe's like cold coffee in the morning
I'm drunk off of last night's whiskey and coke
She'll make me shiver without warning
And make me laugh as if I'm in on the joke
You can stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to
I'll wake with coffee in the morning
But she prefers two lumps of sugar and tea
Outside the day is up and calling
But I don't have to be so, please go back to sleep
Stay with me forever
Or you could stay with me for now
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to
'Cause I love the way you wake me up
And for goodness sake, will my love not be enough?
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonight
Tell me if I know
Tell me if I do
Tell me how to fall in love the
Way you want me to
Tell me if I'm wrong
Tell me if I'm right
Tell me if you need a loving hand
To help you fall asleep tonightJet plane headed up to the sky
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to  London
I do deals, but I never get twanged 
Moves that ain't ever been planned 
Know goons that were never in gangs 
Where I'm from, chat shit get banged 
Where I'm from, chat shit, let a 12 gauge rip
Yeah, it's sick how it fits in my hand 
I don't mix with the glitz and the glam 
All these stupid pricks on the 'Gram
I don't do online beef, or neeky grime beef
I'm way too G'd up to beef with grime neek
I bought an AP to help me time keep
My shooter ride deep, he moves when I speak
My shooter ride , he shoot a guy 
Leave you wet like you scuba dived
We were younger then and now we're unified
South London boys, get you crucified, I'm gone
It's that time
Big Mike and Teddy are on grime
I wanna try new things, they just want me to sing
Because nobody thinks I write rhymes
And now I'm back in the bits with my guy
Give me a packet of crisps with my pint
I hit my friends up, go straight to the pub
'Cause I haven't been home in time, yes, I
But that's my fault 
Grossed half a billi' on the Divide Tour 
Yes, I ain't kidding, what would I lie for? 
But now I'm back on the track with Big Michael 
He said, "Teddy, never get off your high horse
And never let 'em take your crown"
I've been away for a while, travelled a million miles
But I'm heading back to London town right now
Jet plane headed up to the sky 
Spread wings in the clouds, getting high 
We ain't hit a rave in a while 
So take me back to London
Bass high, middle nights, ceilin' low 
Sweat brow drippin' down, when in Rome 
No town does it quite like my home 
So take me back to— Birmingham, 0121, stand up!
You better tell them the hooligan's here
My team can't lose when I'm here
Outside, quick twos and a beer
You see me when I choose to appear

Yo, I can turn boos into cheers
Tiptronic man cruise through the gears
Rep blues when I'm here

Red red wine or you want a redrum
You can be forty, you don't wanna war me
End of story, you're gunna get spun
Man smoke weed til my whole head's numb
Don't talk greaze 'cause I won't take none

Wild wild west with the old western, it's Brum!
Old school raving, back to scally
And the AP, packed with gally
Take me back to Manny

And a S3 boot full of packs of Cali

Huh, man was made to set pace
Young Aitch, I came for first place
Made a change to get paid

Ed Sheeran and Kranium
You know your body look good
So good, so good, yeah
The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Hey, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Come, come on now, follow my lead, mmm
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you 
So good, so good, yeah
Gyal, your body good, me swear to God, you know me nah lie
Thinking 'bout your shape in every way, gyal, you no normal

Plus she want fi have sex, oh yes

Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on 
Come on, be my baby, come onHit the corner, burnin' rubber like a stunt driver
Burning marijuana, bitch, I'm a bit liver
Gotta keep a bitch in check, microphone check
Killed your boy's career, still no arrest yet
Snow white yacht in my red Yeezys
Ed Sheeran got the city streets tweakin'
On a back block you may catch the boss
M-cig, let it vape so we liftin' off
With a weapon, go to steppin' like I'm Kevin Spacey
No prom date, women they would love to hate me
It's such a pretty thing, life is such a bitch
Went to sleep as friends, waking up to this
See it my way or see me at the top
Built an empire, bitch, off a nickel rock
Microphone check, microphone check
We came to party, smoke until there's nothing left
I met this girl late last year
She said "don't you worry if I disappear"
I told her "I'm not really looking for another mistake"
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jumped right in a week later, returned
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause until the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me "I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around ten
Baby, bring the lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets till the late AM"
Baby, if you wanted me then should have just said, she's singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
And for a couple weeks I only wanna see her
We drink away the days with a takeaway pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha, all over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her, we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes, the same day
And those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on a couch
But we should get on a plane or we'll be missing it now
Wish I'd have written it down, the way that things played out
When she was kissing him, how I was confused about
Now she should figure it out, while I'm sat here singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
 on my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder, I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed, that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex, of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun, and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realised what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
And all this time, God knows I'm singing
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I don't wanna know that babe
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babeLetra de "Shape Of You " ft. Zion & Lennox
El club no es el mejor sitio para encontrar el amor, no, no, no

I'm in love with the shape of youNow I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
See, I’m true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I’m real, I do it all, it’s all me
I’m not fake, don’t ever call me lazy
I won’t stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tunes sell
Call yourself a singer-writer, you’re just bluffing
Name’s on the credits and you didn’t write nothing
I sing, fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to BRIT School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can’t last, if I’m smoking on a crack pipe
And I won’t be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear in Wikipedia
And musically I’m demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man
And all I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennessey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise the top?
Just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky, Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived and as the mist clears
I arise from my tomb in disguise, all alone, A lone star
Urban Angel rising from the ashes, surprising all haters
Guiding, now moving steady when we say
Ayy, ayy, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out, pass out
Yeah, we bring the stars out
We bring the women and the cars and the cards out
Let's have a toast of celebration, get a glass out
And we can do this until we pass out
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning
I've been burning, burning, burning
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
'Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
'Cause like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'ma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time
Now my eyes are red
'Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man
'Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop until my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damian Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian Nights
Because I'm young, I know my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter, yeah
The game's over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows but
I haven't got a house plus I live on a couch
So you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow, from day one I've been prepared
With V05 wax for my ginger hair
Now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of
What the future holds cause it's another day
Plus
I'll keep my last name forever, keep this genre pretty basic
And I'll be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Slipping into another rapper shoes using new laces
I'm selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back, when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago, but more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Rufio
Melody music maker, reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevatorAnother day, another life
Passes by just like mine
It's not complicated
Another mind, another soul
Another body to grow old
It's not complicated
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Another tear, another cry
Another place for us to die
It's not complicated
Another life that's gone to waste
Another light lost from your face
It's complicated
Is it that it's over or do birds still sing for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Ooh how I miss you
My symphony played the song that carried you out
Ooh how I miss you
I miss you and I wish you'd stay
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Do you ever wonder if the stars shine out for you?
Float down, like autumn leaves
Hush now, close your eyes before the sleep
And you're miles away
And yesterday you were here with me
Touch down
Like a seven four seven
We'll stay out and we'll live forever now...I can taste salt water
And if I blink again
You’ll be sinking in
So we'll learn to swim in the oceans you made
I'll hold ya
And you think of him
And pretty soon you’ll be floating away
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyes
I still taste salt water
On my lips from your kiss of bitterness
And I'll drown within the oceans you made
And I hate to love you, these cuffs are covered in your make-up
I’ll never trust you again
You can just be a friend
And I’ll hold on to the words you spoke of
Anchored down in my throat, love
And I’m captain of the sinking boat, now
With just one armband to carry me home
When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your lips, your mouth
Your thighs, your back, you drive me wild
Tonight, the fact is I
I’m on my way home
On the way home
I lied, I tried to cry but I’m-
I’m drowning in the oceans you made
When salted tears won’t dry
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
These hearts will be flooded tonight
I’ll wipe my shirtsleeves under your eyes
Your eyes, your eyes, your eyesOoh, ooh, whoa, oh, oh, oh now now
Five drinks in on Friday night
We only came to dry your eyes
And get you out of your room
Now this bar has closed it's doors
I found my hand is holding yours
Do you wanna go home so soon?
Or maybe we should take a ride through the night
And sing along to every song that's on the radio
In the back of a taxi cab in Brooklyn
Oh no no, the sun could rise
Burning all the street lamps out at 3AM
So DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new love
In New York
Yesterday, gave me a call
Stressing out about it all
Said the world is moving too fast
And you don't know where to begin
Cause you've spent a lifetime fitting in
Only to wind up on the other side
By yourself
And every day
Screaming out
To all the people that you used to know
From a window that looks upon Manhattan skyline
It's just the way that life goes
And you hear it in every song you know
So DJ, play it again
Until the night turns into morning
You'll be in my arms
We'll just keep driving
Along the boulevard
And if I kissed you, darling
Please don't be alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything if you want
A new life
In New York
And every song that plays
Is just like the day you had
And it's okay to cry
But I'm saying maybe that's
A waste of water
You know I'm here for you
In the back of the taxi cab tonight
In New York
It's just reached the morning
And you're still in my arms
And we've stopped driving
Down the boulevard
And I just kissed you, darling
I hope you weren't alarmed
It's just the start
Of everything that you want
A new love
In New YorkCould I wake up next to you when we're hitting double figures?
Look into your eyes like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer? Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn, it's hers to get hurt
On a late night, coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face, I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine, smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines, hey
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeah
And now I'm sitting on a night bus, flicking through my iPod
Feeling kinda tired so I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off, lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one, gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to UNI
People see right through me, but I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one, I'm gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to except get a 2:1
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
I think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me, yeah
When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate who wants to be my duvet, yeah
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And it's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
It's not a homeless life for me, yeahI paid all my dues
And she wanted to know
That I’d never leave her
But now I’m ready to go
And strange as it seems
She’s endless to me
She’s just like paperwork
But harder to read
Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I made all my plans
And as she has made hers
She kept me in mind
But I wasn’t sure
I searched every room
For a way to escape
But every time I tried to leave
She keeps holding on to me for dear life
And blocking my way
Patience's my enemy
And loving’s my friend
It’s harder to leave with my heart on my sleeve
Than to stay and just pretend
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
And like the back of her hand
She already understands everything
"Won’t you stay?" She says
And she already knows how it goes
And where she stands
I’ll stay, anyway
Cause she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
Oh, she knows me so well
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
Oh, she knows me like I know myself
I know myself
I know myself
I know myselfI know you heard this before
I know you heard this before
It's working for sure
Gonna be hurting tomorrow
But tonight, hey hey
We're going for it 
Tonight, we're going for it 
Tonight, we're going for it 
Tonight, we're going for it 
We've come to have a good time
And we won't compromise
We wanna hear the colors
We wanna feel the lights
Automatic wine
My money stacked so high
It feels like stick like Tide
Takes the smallest slice
It still touch the sky
Tonight we're going turbo
The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo
We're gonna need a lot of merlot
But the question is where'd I just go
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name
They're lifting you
So let them say what they want to about us
When they say your name

Tonight, we're going for it 
Tonight, we're going for it 
Tonight, we're going for it 
You ever seen one girl take over the night?
Take over the city and restore its pride
If you're gonna roll a blunt
Then roll a blunt right
The room is too dark
Someone spark up the light
Police, got the strap on the side
My people still fly the kite
But I learned from my grandma
To master my eye
Oh shit I'm talking too much
I'm too fucking hyped
Tonight we're going turbo
The dance-hall is packed to the curb yo
We're gonna eat a lot of merlot
But the question is where'd I just go
So let them say what they want to about us

Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, blood
Blood, blood, blood, bloodHi, I'm Ed Sheeran, in session here and this is my cover... kind of... of Justin Bieber's 'Love Yourself...
For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Oh, if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourselfAcross the sea by the Tennessee skyline
They told me I'd find my hopes and my dreams
But I long to be, in the bed of my true love
Back where I came from, she's waiting for me
So I'll make my way through long winding country roads
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
I told my dad on the phone it's amazing
From the straight to the craziest places I've seen
But I long to be, in the arms of my true love
Like he loves my mother, he understands me
I spend my days, just traveling and playing shows
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
I met a man in the bar down in Memphis
He told me he went there to follow his dreams
He told me "son, you know I lost my true love
For the same exact reason that you crossed the sea"
And I found truth in people I barely know
But my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English rose
Oh, my heart still beats for my home and my English roseI fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew your heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars, if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Teach my skin those new tricks
Warm me up with your lips
Heart to heart, melt me down
It's too cold in this town
Close your eyes, lean on me
Face to mouth, lips to cheek
Feeling numb in my feet
You're the one to help me get to sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
It's only been one night of love
And maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
Only been one night of love
Maybe that is not enough
Hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyesI didn't mean to break your heart, I was just lonely
And everybody falls apart sometimes
I know you found another one
But won't you just hold me tonight?
I wish I never called you up, and nobody told me
And they don't know we don't speak anymore
So take a good look at us
And won't you just hold me tonight?
And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
I never meant to sleep around, I was just lonely
And you did the same, again and again and again, whoa I know
So here's to the both of us
Here's to our story tonight
And I will stop trying to fall in love again, and keep it a secret
It never works out anyway
But I am not anything like I was
Cause you are the only one for me, yeah yeah
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
When I see my future, it is with you
And we’ll get there
And I want my children to be with you
And we’ll get there
Cause maybe I don't wanna lose a lover and a friend
In one night, if that's alright
I shouldn't have fucked with your mind
And your life too many times
And maybe I don't wanna be lonely
Darling, you are my only love
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you want
Behind my truth lies
Everything you areI am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now
Hey ay ay yeah

Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah
Hey ay ay yeah 
Hey ay ay yeah 
Hey ay ay yeah

And I know dark clouds, will gather me
And I know my way is rough and steep
And the beautiful fields that lie just beyond me
And I know my needs are rough and steep
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home now
'Cause I am a poor, wayfaring stranger
Traveling through this world alone
And there's no sickness, toil, or danger
In that bright land to which I go
And I'm going there to see my mother
And I'm going there no more to roam
And I'm only going over Jordan
And I'm only going over home nowOh baby, baby
How was I supposed to know
That something wasn't right here?
Oh baby, baby
I shouldn't have let you go
'Cause now you're out of sight, yeah
Show me how you want it to be
Tell me, baby, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind
Give me a sign
Hit me baby one more time
Oh baby, baby
The reason I breathe is you
Yeah, you got me stranded
Oh, pretty baby
There's nothing that I wouldn't do
It's not the way I planned it
Show me how you want it to be
Oh, tell me, babe, 'cause I need to know now, oh, because
My loneliness is killing me, and I
I must confess I still believe, still believe
When you're not with me, I lose my mind

Give me a sign

Oh oh oh
Waking up, midnight November
And you're still in my bed
It's kinda rough, cause since I met ya
There's things we've never said
So if I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke
Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
It's not enough, to say I want ya
Cause I'll say anything
I'm holding out, to feel without a doubt
I had have just been questioning it
If I go for a little while longer
When I'm home we can talk about the pitfalls of the road
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the role now
And act like it's never been broke
Though my soul, oh oh oh
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, oh oh oh
How long, how long, can we be
All of my bones, they scream I'm right
If you're taking me home to stay the night
Darling my soul would heal
If you say go, I would stop everything oh
My heart would play the wrong
And act like it's never been broke, though my soul
Lately I really need to know
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
Oh my soul, how long
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and go
How long, how long, can we be touch and goFor fuck's sake, yeah
Yelawolf, Melody Man
Living the life of a student, yeah, I begin on a high
Losing my mind and they say that I’ve been winning for time
Never been to a gun fight and never needed a knife
But then I make the cut whenever delivering lines
Sit on the side with a rhyme pad with a ten in my sights
Sipping a lemon and lime Corona only with my best friends
'Cause I've hidden my pride, giving the time
To write rhymes but I find truth at a quarter to five
Hey!
It’s kinda like I took a train to the left side of my brain, oh, mayne
Puddles of mud, under my love, you know I’m stepping in my own lane
All of these speakers sitting behind me
But what psychology, psychologically insane
Pardon me while I get down, down, down
Making you get up and say...
If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah
Ten toes to the dirt, pencil to the paper
God has a favor for your thirst
Drink, drink a pint bye-bye
To this bullshit praise Allah
To the wheels, I’m a ridah, steel ring, no Prada
Only thrift clothes and my ada-di-das
I’m a fetus in my room, say na na
Daddy’s home, on the mic, hey papa
Back with a bang yo, straight loop pedal, no band though
But every single one of my fans know
That every damn show I’m taking their ears on a journey
Like I’m flying overseas with Van Gogh
Livin’ so sweet without Gretel and Hansel
Critics hate the lyrics 'cause they think I’ve been tangoed
Find me wearing old clothes, rocking a Kangol
I’m riding 'round with Yelawolf in your daddy’s Lambo
Hello me, how ya been?
You got a mullet again like when you was 10
You’re probably sipping sweet tea still, huh?
And your piggy bank is full of change
That what you used to steal from
You been playing fools like a steel drum
Pulling out early, and they still come
Eating from the game when you know the meal’s done
Yelawolf is gettin' back at these pilgrims
Hold up baby, sit still, son, woah
This old rock, the hill's been rolled
Still shocking when I see 'em go
Bananas, when they handle this animalistic flow
If you don’t know
If you don’t know by now, you better tell him ’bout it
What you gonna tell him ’bout? Yeah
Yeah
I’m not the average half-a-wit after this hour gets out of this
60 seconds, I’m goin' any direction and
Chasing this Jack with a shot of Budweiser and water
Is probably the better idea, yeah, you move when the direction in
Fact, it's a part of me to be the looser of cannons
Blow on this fucking mic like a wind 'til college start again
Hooligans, hooligans rule again but really who’s a friend?
Jump in this lake of fire, jump right back in the pool again
Knew I'd be new again, a student of you my friend
Marshall Mathers, I’m tossing rappers up at my crew of 10
Minus 4, minus war, you don’t want it
Shady Records, I’m already better, fuck it, doggonnit
Dog don’t gotta lead, dog’s already home, Jack
Dogg I’m a beast, I’m a wolf, bring your dogs back 
A melody-man and a melancholy mellow-yellow can
Shhhh, tell 'em how we gonna sell 'em man
Been working hard all week
So if you wonder if we earned it, well it's not a probably
So won’t you bring that back to me
And holler when you hear it like all the screams of a Halloween
I got blisters on my feet
To walk at night with you, is not the shoes to be borrowing
So won’t you bring that back to me
'Cause all the soul of my pen is only what all the sorrow brings
If you don’t know
You don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know 
If you don’t know, if you don’t know, if you don't know There wasn’t much left
Except for the last twenty sack
And the last twenty of my last cheque
I took a pill and went to sleep on the last step
Woke up and took it in with a half breath
Then a deep sigh, I struck a matchstick
I lit my cigarette, feeling half dead
Whisky on my mind, then came the debt
Sheriff in the yard, here comes the rest
I sat like a ghost, they all passed by
My girl cried 'baby this’ll be my last bye'
Baby in her arms, she took a cab home
She told me I was only good for a sad song
A crooked smile I gave, nonchalant about it
Maybe she’ll come back, this time I doubt it
Act like I care, but I really don’t
Wanted to change but somehow I knew I really won’t
See I’m the type of man who can’t stay out the bottle
If the sun is out I’d rather be in the shadow
Sadness is like a wound that I can’t heal
Maybe I love blood, I just let it spill
And I never turned to church for a praying hand
God’s not going to lend another saving hand
If the time came like it has time again
Then I would watch the clock, and be late again
One gun and a harley in the driveway
One way out, dirt road pathway
Put another dead butt in the ash tray
I stand up still drunk, half baked
Cover my eyes from the bright morning sun blaring
And through the fence I can see this little boy staring
Paid him no attention, in fact I barely seen him
Until he walked away, and he started singing…
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we’ll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash, right down again
I didn’t see it coming, I didn’t see the wall
And I went from running to a slow crawl
I feel like I’m a child, but I’m afraid to cry
Would say I’m okay, but I’m afraid to lie
I speak no evil, but hear no angels
My family is callin’, but all I see is strangers
Take the bible from the hotel drawer
Hell froze over, ice cold, hell’s door, knock-knock,
I’m on the salt road non-stop
The exit I will pass ’cause the sign did rot
In the gust of a dry summer
Dirty water in the tap, I think I found my number in the sand
Right next to an empty can
Old number seven, Jack is back again
And the voice goes round and round
And I would take the bridge but I can’t forget the sound
London Bridge is falling down, falling down
And if it don’t stop falling, then all of us will drown
Then we’ll crash, crash, right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash, right down again
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
And we’ll crash, crash right down again
Oh we’ll crash, crash right down again
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes down
Rollin' like a rock till I hit the ground
Running from the law but I can’t be found
Only my God can track me down
I’ll be coming up when the sun goes downI'm filled up with doubt
I have to move home
But I want to stay with you for all of the summer
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world, then, please, ask your mother
I cannot hold your hand to watch you go
Oh, I am a liar, as you might know
I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need your smile and your kiss
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmmmm
Hmm-hmm-hmmm-hmm
I see your voice
And from my window
When it is late at night it'll show me your shadow
I have my plan that you won't remember
If you want to see the world and, please, ask your mother
Now, ah-oh-ah-oh
I cannot hold your hand, to watch you go
Oh, I'm a liar, as you might know
I need you now
I need your touch and your lips
I need that smile and your kiss
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
And you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Hm, you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
Now, these words I say mean you’re so amazing
And I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe
These words I say mean you’re so amazing
But I've noticed lately, I need you, maybe
'Cause you're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...
You're so cool
You're so beautiful
You're so... and you're so...One, two, three
Unhappy days
That left us on the floor
And you squeeze me
Till you're not feeling sure
Everything will brighten up, if we go to Brighton I'll
Take you along the pier
Everything will lighten up, and if you feel too frightened I'll
Make things disappear, dear
Darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
Sunny days
That left my skin dark red
And you breathe me
Till these thoughts leave my head
If it gets too complicated I'll give up and be frustrated;
Can you see what's wrong?
If you feel like you've been jaded, and this love's too overrated;
See what's going on
And darling don't be nervous
I'll understand if you let me go
I did this on purpose
Now, 'cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into a dress
So I can be like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you're leaving too, maybe I'll put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
Take me back to live at home
Take me back to Albert Road
'Cause when I'm missing you
I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, I think that I love you
And I'll stop eating food and I'll squeeze into your dress
So I can feel like you and then I'll see your bitterness
And why you left me too, I thought I’d put you to a test
And say that I love you, now it seems you loved me tooYou give me life and a loss of oxygen
You treat me like I was in love again
And I hold you tight, tight enough to know
That you are mine, I'd never let you go
And it's you I miss
And it's you I miss
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now
And you speak to me behind your darkened stare
And you let me be as if I wasn't there
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
It's you I miss
And it's you I miss, oh-oh
So let it out
I let it out now
I let it out
I let it out now, now
It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
Like glue, we're like glue, we're like glue
So let it out
I let it out now

It seemed perfect, a concept free from any regret
Another couple based on teen sex
You eejit, true I was just like you
We couldn't be torn apart, you see we were just like glueJust keepin' it honest

And you know, you know
And you know, in this foreign car let it goSmoke alarm went off at nine
I woke up, wiped the sleep out of my eye
She left a note "I'll be back in 5"
Well, I'm still waitin' for that moment to arrive, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved
I never told her that I liked
The way she dances slightly out of time
And pretends she knows the words to a song she's never heard
But I tell her all the time, hey
I was told to put my job in front of you
But it won't hold me like you do
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be loved
But I do it for the love, waitin' on the gold rush
Keep it on the edge, smokin' on a roll up
When I see my friends, all they say is hold up
Ed, remember the time
When we were in school listenin' to grown-ups?
Didn't learn a thing, but then again, you know what?
You know how to sing, but, you don't know anything other than that
So maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
Maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way
And maybe you should learn to love her
Like, like the way you wanna be lovedShe's reinventing loving me
When we're resembling cutlery on the sofa
It must have been about 5:01 like my blue ripped jeans
And my eyes are closed and I'm way too tired
Hoodie still smells of the beach bonfire
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside again
And we're both so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with you
When the morning comes
We're not watching Formula 1
It's not what we breathe for
So kick off the day with Friends on T4
Two, boiled and brew
Two sugars ain't too sweet for you
On the sofa, where we lay
I wanna stay inside all day
And it's cold outside again
And we're still so high
We could fly to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa
On the sofa with you
And it feels like I'm flying
And it feels like
We could go to Berlin, Tokyo or Jamaica
Through the streets of New York, that is where I will take ya
Paris, Rome, to Rio, passing through Las Vegas
We can go where you want, say the word and I'll take ya
But I'd rather stay on the sofa, on the sofa
On the sofa with youFaces change
But this place'll stay the same
And I'll know when I'll go
Home
Yeah, and I'm pickin' up another bag
And I pack another knapsack
The airport's like a stop light to me
Sittin' on red, green light go
Can't see my family
My family grew into a globe of friends and fans
Or some may call 'em
And it's on the stage I stand
To jam, rock, sing
No wakin' up to stop the dream
I lived the life, signed a picture
Cause no dam could stop the stream
Or flood gates, I'm in a fucked race
And a pocket fulla culture condoms
They put you on the podium for first place
But on the block, they judge you on 'em
So
Who got the South in a six-pack, and a shotgun just for show?
I put the white boys back in gold teeth
Put the hood in mossy oak
I'm the
Child of a deadbeat, so I gotta give the beat some life
Beat me down with criticism
But at least the critic's write
With a broken pen, there they go again
I'm a token man, I'm a rollin' gem
Like a rollin' stone, I'm closin' in
I'm goin' home, I'm home again
Bring it back up in the U.K
With a Dixie flag and a sixty sack
Catfish Billy, hell, you say
I'm just bein' blunt, homie
Keep the grass
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will fly
Yeah, take one look
Better yea? Take two
But if I take that break, as a move you made
This dude you shape, will come take you back
Back to the roots of bein'
Without a fuckin' pot to pee in
Or a spot to sleep in
Hot or cold outside, it's not the season
Cuz I am not the reason
That the image you're used to seein'
Is usually being fake, so to me the hate is meaningless
Meaning yes, I'm different
Differently made
And me screamin' the A
Is not the difference in grades
It's the place I stayed
Cuz the schools were underpaid
The teachers taught, but to me they fought
The star that was underway
It was under Wayne, it was in my name
Michael, M.W.A
Atha
And in trouble I stayed
Breakin' out of this bubble they made
Played with the dice, but I rolled that seven
And I'll go back to heaven in a Chevrolet
Fuck the world with a tattooed hand
Committed to the words I say
A blood-line's not a family-tree
It's a needle in my skin for all to see
I ain't never got a spring-break tattoo drunk
But I drink and take the ink
You changed me
Into what I am now
You made me
It was something I was always gonna be
It seems these broken dreams don't lie
And so now my broken wings will flyI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
5 o'clock with lights off, interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear I said, that I'll sleep when I'm dead
Who's on the beat upon the feature with Ed?
It's D-E-V to the Zed
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage I've acquired
And over the time within this maze I think you'll find you'll
Never find that peace of mind you seek to find until you're dying
Cause I got too much to stay awake for
To sleep, or even take four seconds out the game, it's time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
Two psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm hailing from the Essex and the East London border line
Villans never sleep, they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like you're snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow, I live with the rats now and those
That hate me call me Ron but they won't slither in too easy
Believe me I'm snake minded, be within this great time, be
On minimum wage, life is a prison escape that I'm in
It's all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when I flip my pillows
Some of the songs I write are real because the charts are filled with si-li-cone
I'm still broke without the money for a Mac Pro
Living out of three bags, no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cause I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise, I will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die 
Two guys with the same view, keep it tight like Scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while you're catching Zed's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information
And then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen, I've hardly changed my bed sheets
At all over the last 12 months cause I haven't slept in 'em, true
I'm coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong, so I'm correcting 'em
We got the fans all like, "Oh wow it's Devs and Ed"
What less did you bloody expect from 'em?"
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock
And no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony, but I'm only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in lately
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free
It could be
The times I'm living in latelyI feel like I had plastic surgery, cause today I looked in the mirror an' realised I'm faced with neglection
Feeling like I'm in the belly of the beast, trying to get out, I don't even think it knows that it's pregnant
Stuck in the dream of deception, similar to a scene from Inception
Looking at reviews from the last show baffled, thinking "how come I didn't even get a mention?"
Shocking. I think somebody put too many plugs in my extension
I signed to music for twenty-three years, now I'm wondering why it doesn't want an extension
I'm being ignored, even the crowds just staring, I see the tension
Now I'm on the stage feeling like a mobile phone in the basement, cause I got no reception
Ah, no bars, get it?
Now I'm choking, no bars, get it?
It turned cloudy, no stars, get it?
I hit the ground so hard, headache
Ah, it's mad
I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
Uh, my mum walks past me. my brother Prays asking why I have left them?
I didn't know I broke up with my girlfriend 'til I saw her with someone else in Beckton
I text her, "you dissed it". She don't reply like it's none of my business
My mind goes round in circles, it keeps on rolling, rolling more than Limp Bizkit
Why'd you do me so wicked? Something must've happened, how did I miss this?
Love turns to pain, expressed with rage. I want justice but I got no witness 
Now I'm powerless. Probably why I'm fascinated with Misfits
I guess I'm single, not happy, cause my heart doesn't feel like triplets
Ah, FREE, nobody understands but me
I don't think I got no-one but myself, so when I'm broke I still say "I got P"
Ah, it's mad. I should be proud right now but I'm sad
Cause me and the world are out of touch, like the relationship between me and my dad
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep Me Warm
I'm out of sight
All these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
So many thoughts battle me, got me holding my head in agony
Trying to put the pieces together and figure out if this nightmare is really reality
So many turning their back on me
It's slowly coming back to me
All I can see is the word tragedy, but I didn't think there was a fatality
Uh, damn, I think I know why I don't see my dad
I think I know why my mum walks past
And why me and my girlfriend don't chat
See, all this time I thought I was mad
I know why I'm not proud and why I'm sad
I'm out of sight and touch, cause back in March I don't think I survived that crash
I'm out of touch, in a cold December
Now
Keep me warm
I'm out of sight
With all these things I've done
Don't hold me down
It's more than I can take
Now
I'm out of sight
In a cold December
Cold December You and I
Two of a mind
This love's, one of a kind
You and I
We’re drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
You and I
We’re learning to speak
With kisses on cheeks
You and I
We’re lifted
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
If I fall for you
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead 
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead 
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new 
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, come on be my baby
Come on, I can't wait for long
You know I love your body but I hate that you a star
No, I do not really need you 'cause you know I ball
Yeah, I'm in love with the shape of you
No, it do not matter if you're skinny or you're tall
If you're thicker than a snicker or you're small
Get the picture when I kiss you
Diamonds gleaming, they be shining on my wrist 
And I don't know why they be always acting bitter 
'Cause they know that I'm the one that's gonna get her
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Shoulda saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said, "Baby, I am not afraid to die"
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
Phantom that's all red, inside all white
Like somethin' you ride a sled down, I just want that head
My Brittany got mad, I'm barely her man now
Everybody got the same swag now
Watch the way that I tear it down
Stackin' my bands all the way to the top
All the way 'til my bands fallin' over
Every time that you leave your spot
Your girlfriend call me like, "Come on over!"
I like the way that she treat me
Gon' leave you, won't leave me, I call it that Casanova
She say I'm insane, yeah
I might blow my brain out
Xanny, help the pain, yeah
Please, Xanny, make it go away
I'm committed, not addicted, but it keep control of me
All the pain, now I can't feel it
I swear that it's slowin' me, yeah
I don't really care if you cry
On the real, you shoulda never lied
Saw the way she looked me in my eyes
She said: "I am not afraid to die."
All my friends are dead
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
Push me to the edge
All my friends are dead, yeah
All my friends are dead, yeahHmm, let me go
To see my family
Please, Father, let me go
As my mother sleeps
I don't know about James bond
But round here nobody lives twice
When you're gone, you're gone, without no bye
Cause only a judge can give you life
This is my advice
Trust me, I nearly lost my life
3 weeks after I got this ride
Pissed like I had way too much wine
Wished I didn't get one
Anyway, I was going to The Macbeth booked for a set
Even though I didn't have a set one
Skream hit the decks, I was like check one
Put on a show, but it weren't my best one
Left it, dropped off Blacks at his destination
Then I was off to the next one
20 minutes later I was on the M1
Tired, but I kept on going
Fell asleep without even knowing
No motion in my face
No movement in my legs, but the car still kept going
Woke up, lorry, flash
Panic, break, skid, crash
Skidded more, bang, smash
Out cold, ribs cracked, ouch
I was in so much pain
Crawled out of a Mégane that now looked like a Mini
When I was still on the first lane
Baffled, didn't even know my name
Fainted, too much shock in my brain
Surrounded by paramedics and feds
Trying to get up but fainted again
See, I just want you to take a sec and hear me out
Don't think I'm happy cos I smile when you see me out
I've had serious madnesses where I've nearly disappeared
And I'm begging Lord to save me and let me go
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soul
Please, Father, let me go
Keep me safe, as my mother sleeps
Eyes closed, they just wouldn't open
I could hear voices and my phone ringing
Fighting for life, can't tell if I'm winning
One of the worst situations I've been in
I could hear all of the angels singing
But when they stopped humming
My brain turned on, started running
Still in pain, but it started numbing
The stone cold comeback I made was stunning
I still tried to do a few shows 'cos I didn't wanna tell them that I weren't coming
But I was left with a permanent problem
Nobody knows about the pain that I'm in 
Ever so cunning
6 weeks later, jogging and running
I used the first aid kit like a drum set
Picked up the tools and I gave it a drumming
Trust me, when it comes to mistakes
You can't afford to let one in
Never done tunes for a while
The pipeline was blocked
So I learned and done a bit of plumbing
They say tomorrow never dies
But they forgot to tell you, you can
You can have a sicker clan than Wu-Tang
But when your time's up, that's it, it's you fam
You can try beg for another
Sometimes I'll be on my way to a show
Thinking "I just wanna see my brother"
Then do a U-turn, I'm gone, one up
To see my family
And keep it inside
Dry eyes, while my brother weeps
Save my soulAll you cool people, you better leave now
'Cause it’s about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo 
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low 
I don't mess with your energy , no photos 
So antisocial, but I don't care 
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though 
Got my hat low, don't talk to me 
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what’s in my brain
Music loud, easin’ my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don’t touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don’t touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
Anti, anti , anti
Io non so cosa ci faccio, mi ci son' catapultato
Faccio "sì, sì" con la testa 
Se vedi, sono antisocial 
Se c'è un cane antidroga 
Parli troppo , hai un brutto vizio 
Conosco chi ne fa il triplo in jeans e white T-shirt 
Non rispondo , ma visualizzo 
Mi fido poco, c'è sempre chi fa gli screenshot
Ai se eu te pego, cabrón
Spero ti cada nelle grate l'iPhone
Io volevo soltanto sing a song
E invece no, ti dedico un new post , oh-oh
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom , when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied and movin' dolo 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" 
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
 Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me

On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night
Don't touch me, yeahIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
J'étais à l’affût dès que je l'ai vu dans le fumoir
Elle m'a dit : « Tu me plais, j'ai peur de te blesser, fuis moi »
C'était comme un frisson qui m'sortait d'un puits sombre
Une impulsion puissante de mon intuition
Ton cœur est brisé, laisse-moi réparer tout ça
La souffrance à tes côtés me paraît douce
Elle m'a dit : “ C'est de la parlotte, chéri ”
Oui, mais on est séduits l'un par l'autre, chérie
Allez, montre-moi...
Je ne vais pas m'étendre, non
Allons se détendre, elle m'a
Demandé que je l'étrangle tendrement
Alors on cède aux vices sans trop discuter
Elle le sait d'office grosses cuisses pour m'exciter
J'ai mis en scène les prémisses de cette promiscuité
On s'est rien promis, on s'aime pour mieux s'quitter
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
]Hey, can you hear me
I just wanted to let you know, hmm
I hope you can hear what I write to you
How could I say goodbye to you?
When I'm a life that came out of the inside of a life that was inside of you
I gotta respect the way you provided food, for the whole fam
You came over a moon rush supporting a mar jays old man
Cold double 8, 8 kids bare wheels
Plus racists full of hatred in your own plant
3 jobs in a day
Rest in life in you working but you were never stress free
Just locked in a cage slaving
They said they were gold in the pavements
But you came and saw the road to amazement
Broke your heart
But still you were prone to last and your sorrow was over fast
I hope your listening right
I still think of you every Sunday
No one can top your chicken and rice
Even through the darkness times
You held us all up because your vision was bright
I knew your strength was your wisdom inside
You never let anyone see your heartache
You just got on with it
Anyone tells me that they knew you said you were beautiful
And your words you would stand strong with it
Cause they were like warmth on a winter night
But I was just too young to go on with it
And there somethings I could try to do
But it's an impossible task for me to even try to say goodbye to you
I couldn't do that, I owe my life to you
]
And of the pieces of my soul
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh
I think you phoney
I was younger with the knowledge of things that I know now
I would be by your side when you needed me
Instead of asking you "Nan can I go out?"
Standing in a road with the gangs that I know now
Everyone's missing you loads, Jessica's grown up
Warreen, Lauren and Alex are fine and I'm living with hope
It's been a while since I've seen C and the mouths
I miss seeing a family, being a family
And us agreeing with smiles how it used to be as a child
But as time goes by, the bridge seems longer
Family problems have never been funny
In my heart the only one that dissed me was Sonia
She took all our inheritance money
Left the rest of us to pick up the pieces
I never forgive the way she betrayed us
There ain't a big enough reason
Before I sell out my fam I'll be giving up breathing
But I guess that everyone's different
Or should I say no one's perfect?
She had happiness in front of her
But chose to ride the wave that no ones surfing
Since you gone the foundations crumbled
So building it back up is my next step
I got all the bricks and the cement but
It's hard when it's done, I don't know what to expect
So give me the strength that I need to perform this task
Make it right, I must do
And I ask cause I trust you
It goes way beyond a song when I say I love you
And of the pieces of my soul
You know I never want to be alo-oh-oh-one
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you? Ohh
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
It's just for now so I should hush
I'll never get enough, I'll see you when I see you but
I miss you, oh how I miss you
There ain't enough words to describe
How sorry I am for the pain that I caused
Sorry for when I stuck up my own blood
We were young and he said it was raping his broad
And for the day police came to the door
I'm sorry for being such a bad youth
Stealing from your purse and making you mourn
I never been able to say this before
Cause I was so inconsiderate
You loved me unconditionally
And I took advantage of it like a idiot
Not seeing the pure soul that I was living with
I really hope that you can forgive me
You going away was a punishment
But I won't let go I'm holding you with me
But I still fight the emotions within me
I can see the stars as the cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
And can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down your face
Feel the chill of your warm embrace?
And can I say goodbye to you?
I can see the stars as a cold wind greets the air
And will you think of me up there?
Can I say goodbye to you?
And paint the stains of the teardrops down my face
Or feel the chill of your warm embrace?
Can I say goodbye to you?Treat me beneath this clear night sky
And I will lie with you
I start to feel those butterflies
When I’m next to you
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land
It’s been this way since we were young
We’ll fight and then make up
I’ll breathe your air into my lungs
When I feel your touch
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we land
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Da da da da, da da da da
Da da da da
Tell me your secrets
Give me a friend
Let all the good times flood in
Do I love you? Do I hate you?
I can’t make up my mind
So let’s free fall and see where we landRight now it's the millitant spot with Fizzer and Dot
We've got a villainous plot to make billions watch
Bringing the hot flows skipping across
Delivering some of the illest bars, killing them off
Ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh, yeah we're doing the damn thing
Man think we need them but onna that thing
Nah I'm back in this raptures, double my ad-libs
Got them all banging the anthems having a madness
For me the music's the thorn in my vein
Calling my name, yeah, we're lord of the raves
I swear down I got them all talking my name
Been working all year it's the ultimate gain
Uh, look I don't need you making us angry, we were so peaceful
You don't really wanna see us get so lethal, any foe to approach
Will be ghosted and don't be fooled, yes, people
'Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
Yeah, yeah y'all messed up everybody's hyped
Even a blind man can see the devil in my eyes
Many were the times that he saw me stepping on the mic
Setting it alight, come up with the energy and vibe
Feel like I'm back from a coma, stronger than ever
Songs are forever so I'm living longer than ever
Any genre, whatever, I'll be setting off a bomb
Cause my longevity's just too long for a measure
Well I'm setting off better, I'm taking over faster
Showering down, you better put your umbrella on
Yeah I'm stepping up a level, got my foot on the pedal
I'm coming to be the better vision than  when I'm spitting
They had to resist because they need a stage to perform
Case and a cord, you won't see me pace through the door
Thinking I'm gonna be rich so I'm chasing the Forbes
Spreading like a plague, songs getting played when I

Yo, living out our days in 
As if I went crazy in a whip crashing the ride
Double "P" when we enter that's passion and pride
They ain't gotta life cause they let that battery die
I'm a shooting star that ain't catching your eye
An assassin with lines and immaculate rhymes
They all say they're the truth but it's actually lies
So we hit them with a punch like a Cassidy line
Yeah I tried to relax but you can feel the anger inside
Raging like I stand on the right, yeah my stamina is high
Yeah I'm living like I stand with the Mayans
So think twice cause our plans are defiant
It's blatant you need me, who's this face on the TV?
Come on, we're taking it easy
Got kids in the school exchanging the CD
Love hearing the bars, impatient to cheer me

You need meLying in a bedroom, lighting up a Benson
Face hair is growing, so I cut it with a vengeance
Hey, did I mention as she makes an entrance?
Said I had a tendency to finish off a sentence
Oh well, she’s a local girl
No make-up cause she knows me well
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
It's like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
So she buys me chips and cheese
And I tell her that I love her and she’s all I need
I take it with a cold glass of the fruit and the barley
She’s still a sucker for the apple and Bacardi
Heading to the party, sitting in the car seat
B.E.P. on radio, it makes me feel naughty and lastly
She knows me well
Bit of a catch to have a local girl
Hair tied up in elastic band
With a kiss on the cheek for her one-night man
I don’t wanna go alone
I don’t wanna go alone
No, I don't wanna go alone
Tell her that I love her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I want her, tell her that I need her
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myself
And we’ve got that love in us and we're the drink killers
We’re gonna dance all night to the floor fillers
If we talk outside, say "Hey what's new?"
I don’t really dance so I’ll just watch you
Are you taking me back tonight? Tell me if that’s alright
I don’t wanna be here, I’m not the sofa type
Tell me if you have a toothbrush you don’t mind sharing
She said I wanna take off what you’re wearing
She’s like the fast food, I’ll regret it after
And I needed money but I’m too shy to ask her
But she buys me chips and cheese
So I tell her that she’s all I need
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that she turns my cheeks the colour of my hair
All I wanna do is be near
Tell her that I, tell her that I
Tell her that she’s more than a one-night stand
Tell her that I love her more than anyone else
If you don’t, I’ll tell her myselfI found a love for me
Darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect tonight
Darling, you look perfect tonightHi, my name is Jme
There was a time when radio played me
'Cause my music came from my heart
It was real to me, but now it's a par
I'm here struggling, keeping it real
While the rest of them are hustling, seeking a deal
Sometimes I sit back and think
"Jme just do one tune, make a couple Gs and chill"
The reason I started making music is the exact same
Reason that I'll never do it, I swear
I didn't go through all of that for this
I'll give that a miss, that's just how it is
I'm fair, straight, who can tell me different?
Look at me, determined, man on a mission
My music is me, and I am my music
So like it or lump it, I'mma do this
I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

Are you gonna play me though?
This song was never meant for the radio
(I get it in forget a radio spin, I'm just doing my thing
And I don't have time for a playlist)
How much will you pay me though
If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Thank God for night clubs and the raves
'Cause I don't think they like us on the airwaves
Unless we water it down
But cordial music is boring me now
I swear, I guess it matters what your goal is
Or in this music scene, what your role is
I'm still trying here, 'cause I'm a pioneer
I use my mouth less than I use my eyes and ears
See I'm just telling you the truth
Can't shoot the messenger, bulletproof booth
You won't hear me on the radio
But go to the rave, and the crowd, they're raising roof
Why is that? What's going on there?
To tell you the truth, I don't really care
I am my music, my music is me
Like it or not, this is how it's gonna be
I never had a playlist in my heart
Now I need an A list just to chart
But I've been famous from the start
How am I gonna make my mark?

If this song's not a hit on the radio?
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I feel it on the airwave, spinning on the dial
Bleeding through the speakers, written by the pile
So won't you hear me out?
Never feel it from the bass line, feel it in the club
Maybe I could take time singing for the dub
So won't you hear me out?
I never had a playlist in my heart

Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, ohStay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
Cause I'll find my faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it
Just close your eyes
And all you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat itI'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
We're at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm

I don't like nobody but you, I hate everyone here

When I'm with my baby, yeah
When I'm with my baby, yeahI met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
You're my pretty little Galway Girl
Galway Girl, you're my pretty little Galway Girl
And now we've outstayed our welcome and it's closing time
I was holding her hand, her hand was holding mine
Our coats both smell of smoke, whisky and wine
As we fill up our lungs with the cold air of the night
I walked her home then she took me inside
To finish some Doritos and another bottle of wine
I swear I'm gonna put you in a song that I write
About a Galway Girl and a perfect night
She played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
"I just want to dance"
With my pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway Girl
Galway GirlI heard there was a secret chord
That David played, and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
It goes like this, the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled king composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Maybe there's a god above
But all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot at someone who outdrew you
It's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
You said I took the name in vain
Well, I never really knew that name
But if I did, what really is it to you?
I've seen your flag on the marble arch
Love is not some victory march
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew her
She tied you to a kitchen chair
She broke your throne, and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew the Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
HallelujahOn the last few days of LA, I got taken into this guy's house and he was sponsored by an alcohol company---quite a few actually---and uh-- got pretty wasted, umm-- all times and I was sitting underneath a tree with my phone just putting in lyrics, "Bah! This is how I feel. Bah!" And uh... I came up with this song and it is called "Wake Me Up"
Because I was really pissed, it is quite silly. Bear that in mind
I should ink my skin with your name
And take my passport out again
And just replace it
See I could do without a tan
On my left hand
Where my fourth finger meets my knuckle
And I should run you a hot bath
Fill it up with bubbles
Cause maybe you're loveable
Maybe you're my snowflake
And your eyes turn from green to gray
And in the winter I'll hold you in a cold place
And you should never cut your hair
Cause I love the way you flick it off your shoulder
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And would you ever feel guilty if you did the same to me
Could you make me a cup of tea
To open my eyes in the right way
And I know you love Shrek
Because we've watched it 12 times
And maybe we're hoping for a fairytale too
And if your DVD breaks today
You should've got a VCR
Because I've never owned a blue ray, true say
I know I've always been shit at computer games
Because your brother always beats me
And if I lost, I go across and chuck all the controllers at the TV
And then you laugh at me
And be asking me
If I'm gonna be home next week
And then you lie with me till I fall asleep
And flutter eyelash on my cheek between the sheets
And you will never know
Just how beautiful you are to me
But maybe I'm just in love
When you wake me up
And I think you hate the smell of smoke
You always try to get me to stop
But you drink as much as me
And I get drunk a lot
So I take you to the beach
And walk along the sand
And I'll make you a heart pendant
With a pebble held in my hand
And I'll carve it like this necklace
So the heart falls where your chest is
Now a piece of me is a piece of the beach
And it falls just where it needs to be
And rests peacefully
So you just need to breathe to feel my heart against yours now
Against yours now
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up
Maybe I'm just in love when you wake me up

I walk a lonely road, the only one that I have ever known
Don't know where it goes, but it's home to me and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk alone
I walk alone, I walk a-

Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

My shallow heart's the only thing that's beating
Sometimes I wish someone out there will find me
Til then I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
I'm walking down the line that divides me somewhere in my mind
On the border line of the edge and where I walk alone
Read between the lines, what's fucked up and everything's alright
Check my vital signs, to know I'm still alive and I walk alone
I walk this empty street on the Boulevard of Broken Dreams
Where the city sleeps and I'm the only one and I walk a-

Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing will never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like when a lemon's green
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's ever been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
It's what I hoped in my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Faith in my crafts getting dark by the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm not where the stars be
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmares'll fade in
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me
You better wake up cause I A.M making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rules
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy tryna keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight but the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding
And I had to fight to get her, I am tekken 
Control of my inception
Cause they're try to hit my misses with my erection
See they better marry Donna cause when I strike, back
Not even Argentina's gonna cry for them
See I'm awake at night, with the ammunish
Cause the haters know where the family lives
Anyone I catch playing knock down ginger
Is gonna lose a lot more, than Annie did
They say sleep is the cousin of death
But I ain't hearing that shh... cousin, I'm—
Gang signs I'm in LA reading 
I'm a CEO, mother suckers I'm next 
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me
They're watching me, they watch me sleep
Let me go
I fell asleep on myself, woke up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever, got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve your dreams you can't doze off cause you dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fond of
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I'm Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I'm Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance, worst luck
Trying to hit women like Mr Ike Turner
Yeah, but I walked from that ish
Now they gotta put me to rest, mattress
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me
I feel my nightmares watching me

I should just walk away, but I can’t move my feet
The more that I know you, the more I want to
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Oh, oh
Hey
I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted you
I don’t need butterflies when you give me the whole damn zoo
By the way, by the way, you do things to my body

You know just how to make my heart beat faster
Emotional earthquake, bring on disaster
You hit me head on, got me weak at my knees
Something inside me’s changed
I was so much younger yesterday
Yeah, yeah

I didn’t know that I was starving till I tasted youThe thoughts I have could be clear ones, they can seem vivid
The goals I reach are not near ones, the further the limit
I block her out so when I'm looking though my mind she ain't in it
Can I be free for a minute? Can I be me for a minute?
The thoughts I have can be dark ones, even be smart ones
I know I'm gonna have a couple straight from the heart ones
Tell you what I think, I will until I depart mum
It's you that I live for, I'm the first and the last one to love you lots
What's better than thinking about the ones you love?
Nothing much when you're thinking about the ones you love
I feel the same when I'm on the floor, see the sun above
Unconditional like bills payed when I've run 'em up
No one here to help you pay now you're gonna moan
No one here to save the day now you're all alone
Wish I was born with a golden spoon in my mouth
Fact is, I wasn't so I'm coming from a quarter zone
And when the sun falls down I'll be up again, and never close my eyes
And if the dawn might break I'll see nothing when, nothing when
My thoughts are only you, and my mind is over you
My thoughts are over you, and these words are all for you now, for you
I wanna see you happy, I wanna see you smile
Cause you've been trespassing and you won't leave my mind
Now I've been thinking about this, you told me say "Yes Nan"
I'm 31 now, I'm still saying "Yes Nan"
You had to replace my mum, dad, two parents in one
I know you're proud staring at your grandson, I found a job I like
Got the flat, the cars to buy got the quad I like
And cause of you and Kylie it's in every single song I write
Had a golden life, wanted people to honour mine
Tell 'em while I'm here cause one day I'm gonna die
And when I'm gone I want my music to play
And when my people listen to this track it's gonna make 'em wanna cry
I ain't gonna lie, I think about the scene I made
I say the game's better, it's a must now I've gotta fly
My talents gonna shine real shortly, fam i know it
I work round the clock I don't stop at nightI've been drinking, I've been drinking
I get filthy when that liquor get into me
I've been thinking, I've been thinking
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Why can't I keep my fingers off it, baby? I want you, na-na
Cigars on ice, cigars on ice
Feeling like an animal with these cameras all in my grill
Flashing lights, flashing lights
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
You got me faded, faded-faded, baby, I want you, na-na
Drunk in love, I want you
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
And we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, and everything all right
No complaints from my body, so fluorescent under these lights
Boy, I'm drinking, park it in my lot, 7-11
I'm rubbing on it, you rubbing on it, if you scared, call that reverend
Boy, I'm drinking, get my brain right, gangster wife
Louis rags, he sweat it out, he sweat it out, I'm with that
Boy, I'm drinking, now I'm on the mic to my boy's toys
Then I fill the tub up halfway then ride it with my surfboard
Surfboard, surfboard
Graining on that wood, graining, graining on that wood
I'm swerving on that, swerving, swerving on that
Big body just graining on that wood-wood-wood-wood-woooood
We woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, last thing I remember is our
Beautiful bodies grinding up in that club, drunk in love
Now we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
I don't know much about love but I - know I've been shot by you
I don't know much about Algebra but I know 1+1 is two
Cause we ain't got nothing without love
And baby you got enough for the both of us
Cause we be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, love, love
We be all night, loveYeah, Slumdon Bridge
Mr Ed, Catfish
Back me up, let's go
I’m out to bark again, ball cracked on the target
Demolish it, don’t jump out your seat, nah, take a squat and then
Think while I jump back on the beat, like I need audiences
To speak too like a leech needs to retrieve blood
Should I creep into these ambient sounds with the speech? Obvious
Witness the retardedness with cerebral palsy, that's
Several pauses, you might need a coffin wit'
Holes in the top, with these tubes to receive oxygen
 You're buried alive like a freak, six-feet
Clawin' and snatchin' and gnawin' like a cat, and a dog and a rat
And a hog in a pen with a frog and all there is to eat is frog and they
Beat each to a pulp with nails, teeth, and jaws and then
They fight to the death for at least a piece off of him
See that, you back two bars again, he's asleep in a coffin, man
I’m all thee all that’s been, ever was, I'm the start of it
You mention the squad and then you mention the god of pens
Not of men, but of harder than flesh, I’m harder than
Titanium breastplates that are polished, then
Sticking emcees up like a fly-trap, or a bobby-pin
When I rap I’m astonishing
I attack tracks like a train-track strapped to a bomb and send
Shockwave’s that's what I made, got this bastard popping then
I spit on my pop's grave without apologin'
Take shits on shihtzus, pisses on igloos
Throw it up 'til the whole fucking world is sick too
Vomitin' stomach-fluid like you just ate shit-stew
Did I say shit again? Do I give a shit, dude?
Neither does Little Johnny give a shit if he sniffed glue
Or Beethoven care if you like his hair or the stick used
To orchestrate, or does a porpoise hate when you dip through
Swimming in his ocean? No, he just moves
What I’m trying to say is
It’s my motherfucking ocean
And I crossed it
Built the bridge, Slumdon Bridge, hollerAll you cool people better leave now
'Cause it's about to happen
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo 
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low 
I don't mess with your energy , no photos 
So antisocial, but I don't care 
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though 
Got my hat low, don't talk to me 
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something

Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom , when I zoom 
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon 
Right past noon, then I'm doomed
Occupied by movin' dolla 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" 
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it 
Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
I've been lost out inner space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me

Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Goodbye Norma Jeane
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jeane
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would've liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever didI'm in so deep
Omar Epps could relate to my situation on a real
Pain ain't the emotion I want to feel, but I'm thriving off it
So it's only right I like this topic, I be on a hill
Keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about, just me, myself and my shadow
And I'm parro, running out of ammo
And it seems like everyone around me's on the same path so it's narrow
The less then the better
More proof for the last one left
So they want to leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise, how they ever gonna guess I'm clever?
How can I be at my best with this pressure?
I've got a lot to lose
So when I watch the news, my minds infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress
I got my door kicked down by a bunch of feds
And when they left, it looked like I'd had a rave
And invited more than a hundred guests
I shoulda bust the back door and jumped the fence
It's easier when you look back shoulda, woulda, coulda
But I bet you can't bring should, woulda could back
Back to 15, 
I said to myself that I'm more than a hoodrat
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you will never drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You can never drown me out, the water supply's too low
And I'm round about 6-1, 10 stone
I've never seen someone drown without
A sufficient amount of liquid in their lungs
And I'm an MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking?
Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking? I'm floating
Even though they want to send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that sunk many years, blud, I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin when it's in motion
Nothing can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken?
No real stress, no, my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck them all, this ain't tug of war, still they'll get roped in the open
I don't want to reveal my violent side, but I swear that I will soon
If the Lord above don't provide a sign, then I'mma kill you
Arm for arm, eye for eye
I just want to live my life
But they don't want to see this guy surviveThis city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it’s late
And sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can’t close my eyes
Don’t control what I’m into
And this tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
My hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Don’t control what I’m into
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
It will take me where I need to go
So I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I’m used to
And the shop across the road
Fulills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don’t think I’m gonna make it
Past tomorrow
And London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this
To keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts, but I
Need to move along
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me
And London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes two
Burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
And I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn’t up to you
And if the city never sleeps then that makes twoShock, horror, I’m down, lost, you’re not around
There’s a lump in my chest that sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I’m on auto-pilot, and my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down, next to you and me
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you
These words mean nothing to me
I’m just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching, constrict and suffocating
My mind is racing with the picture I’m painting
And my belly’s sick to its stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
When you lay down next to me
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you, more than I let on
I kissed you far too long
I’ll let go as soon as you do
See I know we’re not through
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, woah
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss you and I miss you
I don’t know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time that you say, you say, you say
That I miss youThe rain won't stop falling
It's harder than before
This car keeps on stalling
Pedal to the floor
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
Is if you want me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We were young and we were foolish
School books in our arms
Dodging homework, dodging classes
To set off fire alarms
And what I need to know
Is if you love me and I
Really need to know
If you need me when you
Call
If you want me when you
Call
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
Our lives away
We are waving
We are waving
We are waving

And what I need to know

If you need me when you

If you want me when you
CallNow I'm in town, break it down, thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show
Every night in front of a new crowd
That's new now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won`t hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you 
You need me
I sing and write my own tune and I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another word-smith to make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer-writer you're just bluffing
Your names on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
A young singer-writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, 
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, 
You need me
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it or what the hell does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter what a yidder, yidder, yadder, it don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Hey, so I keep singing that
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and... all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy...
My head in the sky... Ready to die
Ed Sheeran, Alone Star
Coming out here freestyling with the guitar
Cause I've forgotten the lyrics of this bit right here
So I freestyle off the top of the bit with the...
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bub
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
You can find me in the club, bottle full of bubbly
Mummy I've got the X if you're into taking drugs
Into having sex, I ain't into making love
Come give me a hug if you're into getting rough
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning on a spliff off your high grade
My eyes are red I've been burning, I've been burning, burning, burning
Now where I come from burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high grade weed, you know I got to have it
Cos if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cos like I said where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yup, we'll do da bun in the place up in the hood
One of them things I have inherited like a ghetto man should
One of them things is smoking weed it yes it makes me feel good
Burning high grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
But me is a man, ah, talk about sensimilla is a drug
And if I start to smoke it I'mma-nna turn into a thug
Where I come from that they talking could that only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed it is a blessing from above
Where I come from yes we bun it when we listen rub a dub
Where I come from yes we bun after we just-a make a love
Where I come from yes we bun it when the sun starts shine
I blaze high grade weed all the time!
Now my eyes are red
Now my eyes are red
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, I don't need you
Okay so this is the breakdown bit where we get a little bit funky. Ugh, and I forget about the whole week, you forget about the whole week, the whole weekend. Just forget about everything! 'Cause it's Sunday and we're all gonna get drunk after this and have a very, very good time and I'm not stressed anymore. We're just letting it unwind. I wanna split the room in the middle here. Who's up for that? Not, not, not literally. You don't have to literally divide. It's all good, all good. Peace and love, peace and love and harmony. What was I gonna say? This side, up there, are you with me? This side, up there, are you with me? Everyone scream as loud as you can!  Okay, so we found out that everyone's voices work. This side, I'm not gonna insult you but you are West Ham, okay? You're West Ham, yeah? You're West Ham Football Club. Get in the geezer mode, yeah? This side, you're Millwall, yeah? You two, you two hate each other. You two are gonna beat each other at whatever you do, no matter what. So if I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. If I give you something to sing, you have to sing louder than them. Are you all up for that? Millwall, are you ready?  West Ham, are you ready?  Okay, West Ham, you sing this...
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall, you sing this:
My eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red!
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, 
You need me, man, I don't need you
Millwall are winning I think
I seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the scene, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my bloodshot whites and irises they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy, they won't be closing soon
Cause I heard that time waits for nobody, I suppose it's true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say whatever I feel to vent a rhyme
So I can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cause real recognise real is what my father says
And I'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But I'll just keep going strong and never let my eyes close
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
I got my friend, very good friend Random Impulse. He's gonna come up and he's gonna spit a few bars on the beat. Everyone give it up for Random Impulse!
Yo!
In this game, I am my own damn man, no restriction, post or boundaries
Spouting heat, hungry and my circle always round to eat
Crossing circles, counting thousands at a thousand feet
Counting sheep and he's sound asleep
Summoned from the deep, now I float, to sink my boat, you'll need a thousand fleets
Walk on any beat and stomp it like a thousand feet
Talk is cheap, so I could treat you to my words for free
Now that I'm out, man, I ain't playing like I hurt my knee
It's common courtesy, I left you for a minute
Now I'm back and packing punches like I'm Popeye popping spinach
Eating every course... lunch, I ain't forgotten dinners
Play guitars as well as bars so you ain't rocking with beginners
Sorry, time's ticking, I can't mess with up-and-comers
National lottery business, only winners have my numbers
Man I'm nothing like you fronters, show you how it is
I can't really do nothing for you 'less you got something to give, Ed!
Cause you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
And you need me, I don't need you
You need me man, my eyes are red
You need me man, I don't need you
You need me
I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other peoples tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with just jack, still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the MySpace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Later!
Thank you... thank you so much! See you soon!She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in 
And won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Nah, nah
Oh, oh
Yeah, yeah
So join me in this bed  that I'm in 
Push up on me and sweat, darling 
So I'm gonna put my time in
And won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border 
Come south of the border with me
Come south of the border, border
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with meCome ye masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behind desks
I just want you to know
I can see through your masks
You that never done nothin'
But build to destroy
You play with my world
Like it’s your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
As the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But I see through your eyes
And I see through your brain
Like I see through the water
That runs down my drain
You fasten all the triggers
For the others to fire
Then you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young people’s blood
Flows out of their bodies
And is buried in the mud
And you’ve thrown the worst fear
That can ever be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threatening my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
That runs in your veins
How much do I know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I’m young
You might say I’m unlearned
But there’s one thing I know
Though I’m younger than you
Even Jesus would never
Forgive what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good?
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could?
Well, I think you will find
When your death takes its toll
All the money you made
Will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death'll come soon
And I'll follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I’ll watch as you’re lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I’ll stand over your grave
To make sure that you’re dead
Cool
He's an intense guy, isn't he?Come on now, dry your eyes
I'm sick of all your lies
I've grown to despise you
Already sick of what you're saying
Hoping now I'm only praying
My baby's gone away
And I've already packed my bags
You didn't know me
You couldn't show me
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You'll never leave me alone
Now I'm off on my own
I'll never ring your phone again
And still you keep on crying
If I said I loved you, I'd be lying
You need to dry your eyes
And I've still got to pack my bags
You didn't know me
You couldn't show me
My one and only
Has gone away
Far away
You didn't know me
You couldn't show me
My one and only
Has gone away
Far awayMet her smoking a cigarette
In  a toilet cubicle
Red  dress, tattooed chest
She's beautiful
This ain't the time or place to start a future
But  darling I don't care
Broken  hearts can find a love
To make them whole anywhere
Oh  darling, here we go again
We are only man or woman
And we all make mistakes
Don't you know we're only human
It's  what our hardships say
And when I heard those words and knew them
I could feel your pain
Cause I have felt the same, oh
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in her eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
She told about her mum and dad
And they sound just like mine
Day by day, exchanging names
We're two souls intertwined
We have both got it wrong
From time to time and let that go
With each other, hand in hand
As we mend broken souls
Darling, here we go again
We are only blood and bones
That cover beating hearts
Scarred by sticks and stones
But we know who we are
I could put you back together
When you come apart
We should make a start now
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
And it feels like we felt serenity
And some things are not what they seem
My love, right now it's only you and me
She said we are penguins on the ice
We're not meant to fly
But god knows we can try
Oh, I see a hope that's in your eyes
Can you feel the love in mine?
Can you feel the love in mine?Now I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night
In front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao
Seems that life is great now
See me lose focus as I sing to you loud
I can't, no I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true
My songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue
I stick to other artists
I'm not you
No, that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing
And move to greener pastures
See, I'm real, I do it all, It's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put
Give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
Hey
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man
I sing, I write my own tunes
And I write my own verse, hell
Don't need another wordsmith
To make my tune sell
Call yourself a singer writer
You're just bluffing
Name's on the credits
And you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit school
I came fast with the way I act right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
Young singer/writer like a Gabriella Cilmi
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man
Cause you need me, man I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning
My eyes are red, I've been burning, I've been burning out
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning on a spliff of your high-grade
My eyes are red, I've been burning
I've been burning burning burning
Now, where I come burning weed it is a habit
A big fat bag of high-grade weed you know I got to have it
Cause if I don't have it in my pocket I'm going to panic
Cause like I say where I come from weed smoking is a habit
Yeah do da burn up the place up in the hood
One of the things that I've inherited
Like a ghetto man you should
One of the things is smoking weed
Yes it makes me feel good
But high-grade sensimilla, yes it makes me feel
Mommy, yes I'm gonna table sensimilla is a drug
And If I start to smoke I'm gonna turn into a thug
Where I come from all that talking
It could only get you mugged
Where I come from burning weed
It is a blessing from above
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When we listen rob a dove
Where I come from, yes we burn it
After we dash to make love
Where I come from, yes we burn it
When the sun does shine
I blaze high-grade weed all the time
Now, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, my eyes are red
Eyes are red
Ooohh
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Eyes are red
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Yeah
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in lights
At stadium heights, with Damien Rice
On red carpets, Now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young I know my brother's gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height, and I'm going hyper
Never be anything but a singer/songwriter
Yeah, the game's over, but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track, without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows, but
I haven't got a house, plus I live on the couch
So, you believe the lyrics when I'm singing them out, wow
From day one I've been prepared
With VO5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa
Giving a dose of what the future holds-
Cos it's another day close, close, close, close brrrrr
I've still got a rucksack for the old clothes
I rap with the cold flows
I'm back with the most jokes
In fact, you don't know
On tracks, I throw blows to make my punchlines relevant
If you can't keep up you'll get none, you're celibate
Man, flows developing
Skin lacks the melanin
Give me a shot of adrenaline and I get it in
I do it for the hell of it
Cause ever since I hit the mainstream with the A team
I seem to sell a bit
I took what held me back with the women
And then I packaged the image
Put in some content
And then I throw it back as a gimmick
The fact is this
I'll end up dating actresses
Wake up on dirty mattresses
I think I need to practice this
But I make shit happen, call me a laxative
World's on my shoulders
I don't even know what Atlas is
Hard part's sharp like a cactus is
I'm back to rapping back to back
Cause I've been practising
I'm back to sing this, yes
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man
I'll keep my last name forever
Keep this genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tune
When I chase it
And replace it with an elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rapper's shoes, using new laces
I'm selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the papers
Selling CD's from my rucksack
Aiming for the majors
Nationwide tour with Just Jack
Still had to get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the moustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But, more people hear me, though
According to the Myspace and Youtube videos
I'm always doing shows, If I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up, call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up and coming
Like I'm fucking in an elevator
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need youI'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it, and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking and it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broken I will mend ya and keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done, I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done, I will love you better nowThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love with the shape of youWhen I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
One works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillAh- la-la-la-la-la
I met this girl, i late last year
She said dont you worry if I disappear
I told her Im not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend
Thinking that the trouble would wait
But then, I jump right in a week later return
I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time, for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause
Until the moment was right
I went away for months
Until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We´ll be in between the sheets until the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should´ve just said
Shes singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
For a couple weeks i
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now shes staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
Never want to sleep I guess that I dont want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day
Those shows have never been what its about
But maybe well go together and just figure it out
Id rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane or well be missing it now
Wish Id have written it down the way that things played out
When she was kissing him How?!
I was confused about
She should figure it out while Im sat here singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
*Knock, knock, knock* on my hotel door
I dont even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed thats all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
Its not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun
And I thought you were different
This is not the way you realize
What you wanted
Its a bit too much, too late if Im honest
All this time God knows Im singing
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my arm
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-la
Dont fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I dont wanna know that, babe
Ah- la-la-la-la-laHey, Ed, here's a reminder
It's time for the party, let's go
Uh, uh, yeah
I'm at a party I don't wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody's even lookin' me in my eyes
Then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party 
Everyone's got so much to say, mmm 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway? 
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights, yuh-uh
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Here's your reminder, don't go to anymore parties
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Would you like me to call you a cab?Well, I've walked this street
Well, I've walked this street before
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In misery
And everyone's locked up their door
Cause they heard me coming
And I've been running
From what?
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
]
You said we went too fast
And you said we wouldn't last
Now I've put the past behind me
And I'm running
From what?
I don't know if she's there
Or if she cares
It's taken you a long time to see
You've got a goldfish memory
This song's for you, not for me
In misery
It's taken you a long time to see
In miseryWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieI fell in love next to you
Burning fires in this room
It just fits, light and smooth
Like my feet in my shoes
Little one, lie with me
Sew you heart to my sleeve
We'll stay quiet underneath
Shooting stars if it helps you sleep
And hold me tight, don't let me breathe
Feeling like you won't believe
There's a firefly loose tonight
Better catch it before it burns this place down
And I lie if I don't feel so right
But the world looks better through your eyes
Lyrics added by: Grzesiul_GShe played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
I met her on Grafton street right outside of the bar
She shared a cigarette with me while her brother played the guitar
She asked me what does it mean, the Gaelic ink on your arm?
Said it was one of my friend's songs, do you want to drink on?
She took Jamie as a chaser, Jack for the fun
She got Arthur on the table with Johnny riding a shotgun
Chatted some more, one more drink at the bar
Then put Van on the jukebox, got up to dance
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my
You know she beat me at darts and then she beat me at pool
And then she kissed me like there was nobody else in the room
As last orders were called was when she stood on the stool
After dancing the céili singing to trad tunes
I never heard Carrickfergus ever sung so sweet
Acapella in the bar using her feet for a beat
Oh, I could have that voice playing on repeat for a week
And in this packed out room swear she was singing to me
You know, she played the fiddle in an Irish band
But she fell in love with an English man
Kissed her on the neck and then I took her by the hand
Said, "Baby, I just want to dance"
My pretty little Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, my Galway Girl
My, my, my, my, my, my, myHello, everyone! Yay, we're so near the time for Ed! It's so exciting! Woohoo! Um... just wanted to say a couple more things: just remember that we are filming this for a DVD that you guys are going to be able to buy and tonight is being recorded for a live EP that you guys will also be able to buy so... I think we'd all agree that we're all a part of something really special because we're going to be able to take tonight home in a few weeks  So yeah, big honor for us all to be here and... I just want to personally say a big thank-you to Ed for asking me to um-- host tonight because it's just amazing and I think he's fantastic and I feel honored to be here. So that's it! It's time to welcome the fantastic Ed Sheeran to the stage. Make some noise!
White lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieAnd that I'll fight my corner
Maybe tonight I'll call ya
After my blood turns into alcohol
No, I just wanna hold ya
Give a little time to me 
We'll play hide and seek 
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love
Give me love
My my, my my
Give me love
My my, my my
Give me love
All I want is the taste that your lips allow
My, my, my, my, give me love
Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me love
As youths we used to play games
Like hide and seek and Simon Says
And then we realized we’re not mice, we’re men
And that was kinda dead
For one more time, let’s play Simon Says
But this time, it’s not Simon, ‘cause Simon’s Ed
Give me love like it meant life or death
Like it meant your final breath, yeah
Give me love like you could buy it from the corner shop
You could spend your time, so it don’t matter if you’re poor or not
Give me that real love, something you could feel, love
Maybe it could heal ya, just like the first time you said it
Give me love cause hate is the worst kind of weapon
It’s like I finally see the person in my reflection
Check
Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well
Yeah give me love like there was love to give
I be wondering if love exists and if it does then give me some yo give me love
Give me love, say give me love, give me love, yeah
]
Oh, I just wanna hold ya
(Give me love like there was love to give
And if it does exist, well)
Give me love
Love me, love me, love me
Give me love, give me loveBreak it down, thinking of making a new sound
Every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
Break it down
Every night in front of a new crowd
That’s you now
I can’t, no, I won’t hush
I’ll say the words that make you blush
I’m gonna sing this now
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’t
You need me, man, I don’t, don’tSara, what you do is enlighten my mind
Oh wow, I said
Sara, what you do is make my soul unwind
Hey now ‘Cos your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that
Sara, reminds me of drunken talks in a hammock
Behind a can of Strongbow
Oh wow, I said
Sara, you say that you don’t look good when you do
Even with that soul
Your hair is blonde, your eyes are blue
Half the guys I know are after you
Cheer me up when I’m in a mood
So I thought I’d write a song for you
And may I say, you look like an angel today
May I say, take me to the place where your mind lays
If only to make you smile today
‘Cos you are great, I thought I’d say that
May I say, you look great
May I play this to make your dayI stole a car last night
Don't know where we're gonna go
But go ahead and drive
I will take you home
Honey, it's cold outside
And your jumper's torn
But darling, hold on tight
I will keep you warm
And we will cry
'Til this fire is drowned
And we will write
All our memories down
And we will drive 'til these tyres wear out
But darling I, I will take you home
If we could drive all night
Until the sun is shown
I'll see it in your eyes, yeah
They will take me home
Honey, it's so damn bright
Daylight's taking over again
Just follow the signs
They will lead us home
And we will drive 'til our tyres wear out
And we will write all our memories down
And we will cry 'til this fire is drowned
But darling I, I will keep you warm
Oh darling I, I will keep you warm
Darling I, I take you homeCome south of the border with me, border with me
Come south of the border with me
She got the mmm, brown eyes, caramel thighs
Long hair, no wedding ring, hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And now I really wanna know your name
She got the mmm, white dress, but when she's wearin' less
Man, you know that she drives me crazy
The mmm, brown eyes, beautiful smile
You know I love watching you do your thing
I love her hips, curves, lips say the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
I kiss her, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in
I won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me 
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
He got that mmm, green eyes, givin' me signs
That he really wants to know my name—hey
I saw you lookin' from across the way
And suddenly, I'm glad I came, ay
Ven para acá, quiero bailar, toma mi mano
Quiero sentir tu cuerpo en mí, estás temblando
Mmm, green eyes, takin' your time
Now we know we'll never be the same
I love his lips 'cause he says the words
"Te amo, mami, ah, te amo, mami"
Don't wake up, this love is like a dream
So join me in this bed that I'm in
Push up on me and sweat, darling
So I'm gonna put my time in 
And won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me

Flawless diamonds
In a green field near Buenos Aires
Until the sun's rising
We won't stop until the angels sing
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that water, be free
Come south of the border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with me
Jump in that...
Be free
Come south of the border with me, border with me
Be free
Come south of the border with meNow it seems I’ve been young, dug my hole in the ground
To me there’s only up, there ain’t no point in looking down
However hard I try, I only get weaker
Seems my lies and worries got my mind in a sleeper hold
What you gotta do is never get yourself down
Bastards do that for you, get you deeper in the ground
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it
When I first started this rapping shit I felt pressure from haters
Became invaded with sadists and just developed a hater radar
And made for the stars, kept my grind in the dark
And then appeared with a remedy kicking rhymes with a melody
Hennesey shots and Glocks, all these fools on the block
Who said you gotta be a gangster now to raise to the top?
I'm just a normal, casual, usual, everyday type of guy
With my head in the sky
Ed Sheeran, Urban Angel coming ready to die
So see the signs, stand to the side
Open your eyes and take a look and realise
The resurrection's arrived
And as the mist clears, homie I arise
From my tomb in disguise
I'm all alone, Alonestar
Urban Angel rising from the ashes
Surprising all haters, guiding, advising them all to steady move
Now back up
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget it
All I want in this cold world is to make music and use it
Not to abuse it and get affected, infected with the who's who of music
Who did it, who is it, who's in it, who…what the fuck does it matter?
Chitter chatter, don't matter, yidder, yidder, yadder
It don't matter to me
All I want is a bit of dignity in me to battle this industry freely
To be me in this seedy, needy world, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, can you hear me?
Keep out of trouble, ain’t no trouble being pure
Seems like all you bastards gave me something to ignore now
Move on, forget it
Now move on, forget itI felt the fall on my breast
At the bottom of my stomach
She put my hand on her chest
While she looked into my eyes
You rescued me
And called up these words in threes
And you know I can’t forget it
And 10 months on you liberate truth
See, I was wrong on how I hate you
And it’s the worst thing that I did
When I read through you
You weren’t translated
So I looked up love in the Yellow Pages
So I’d be free from it
See, all this truth sparks lies in me
Just to demonstrate, aggravate sympathy
The key is just to ignore
Even if this time has made me unsure
And 12 months on I’m back in my mood
See, I got drunk and said I loved you
And it’s the worst thing that I didThe angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
And they say
They scream
They see
Slowly sinking, wasting
And they say
They scream
They see
Slowly sinking, wasting
An angel will die
Closed eye
This time, we’ll fade out tonight
We don’t wanna go outside, tonight
And in a pipe, she flies to the motherland
It’s too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly
To fly
To fly
Or angels to dieYou and I, two of a mind
This love's one of a kind
You and I, we're drifting
Over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?
You and I learning to speak
With kisses on cheek
You and I we're drifting over the edge
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?
And I will fall for you
And I will fall for you
And if I fall for you
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?
Would you fall too?L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown 
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful, yeah 
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful Well I once heard a story about a run-down home
Where a man and his thoughts lived all alone
He tried to live, no effort was shown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice family with smiles and frowns
They never could solve his way to be down
Cos he’s one dog who don’t want a bone
He’s slowly finding a way back home
He had a nice house with windows and doors
He said to his wife what’s mine is yours
But the seeds of deception are soon to be sown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His children have left but the rooms are still there
His misses the noise and the scents in their hair
But far from the nest the babies have flown
He’s slowly finding a way back home
His wife was an angel sent from above
He never returned her kisses or love
But soon he’d found that she’d overgrown
This man who’s finding a way back home
So the leaves are all dead in this broken man’s June
The rain will still fall on the sunny afternoon
He stares at the floor, no more to roam
He’s slowly finding a way back homeThis city never sleeps
I hear the people walk by when it's late
Sirens bleed through my windowsill
I can't close my eyes
Can't control what I'm into
This tower is alive
The lights that blind keep me awake
With my hood up and lace untied
Sleep fills my mind
Can't control what I'm into
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
The pavement is my friend
And it will take me where I need to go
I find it trips me up
And puts me down
This is not what I'm used to
The shop across the road
Fulfills my needs and gives me company
When I need it
Voices speak through my walls
I don't think I'm gonna make it
Past tomorrow
London calls me a stranger
A traveler
This is now my home, my home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
And my lungs hurt
And my ears bled
With the sound of the city life
Echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts
But I need to move along
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me
London calls me a stranger
This is not my home, home
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
I'm burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I'm blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
And if the city never sleeps
Then that makes two
That was fun!Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
They crawled out of the woodwork
And they whispered into your brain
They set you on the treadmill
And they made you change your name
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend ever did
Loneliness was tough
The toughest role you ever played
Hollywood created a superstar
And pain was the price you paid
Even when you died
Oh the press still hounded you
All the papers had to say
Was that Marilyn was found in the nude
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Goodbye Norma Jean
Though I never knew you at all
You had the grace to hold yourself
While those around you crawled
Goodbye Norma Jean
From the young man in the 22nd row
Who sees you as something as more than sexual
More than just our Marilyn Monroe
And it seems to me you lived your life
Like a candle in the wind
Never knowing who to cling to
When the rain set in
And I would have liked to have known you
But I was just a kid
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never did
Your candle burned out long before
Your legend never didWhen I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hillMy mind is a warrior
My heart is a foreigner
My eyes are the colour of red like the sunset
I'll never keep it bottled up
And left to the hands of the coroner
Be a true heart not a follower
We're not done yet
And i see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
Now keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That ill never let you down
I'll never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
My eyes are a river filler
This drink is a liver killer
Your chest is a pillow for my weary head to lay to rest
Again
Your body is my ballpoint pen
And your mind is my new best friend
Your eyes are the mirror to take me to the edge again
Now I see it in your movements tonight
If we should ever do this right
Im never gonna let you down
Oh I'll never let you down
We'll keep it on the down low
And I'll keep you around so ill know
That I'll never let you down
I'll l never let you down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
Ill pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Hold my heart to stop me bleeding now, now, now, and I'll
Never let you down
Cus your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade
8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You down
Your strumming on my heart strings like you were a grade 8
But i never felt this way
I'll pick your feet up off of the ground and never ever let
You downI'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk
I wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
I'll be drunk
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
Drunk, drunk
Drunk
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
To feel a little love
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk
I'll be drunk again 
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
Drunk, drunk
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
Drunk, drunk
To feel a little love
All by myself
All by myself
All by myself
All by myselfStay for the night
Call it what you want
And I'll compromise
To have you in my arms
Is this what you needed?
Cause I'll find my faith in anything
Don't fight the feeling
Rewind, repeat it
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat it
Just close your eyes
And all you need to see
Is your heart and mine
Underneath the sheets
Don't fight your demons
Cause they will tear you apart from the seams
And if darkness creeps in
Rewind, repeat it
If the world ends tonight
You'll be in my arms
We'll be frozen in time
Underneath the stars
My lungs are screaming
This heart is bleeding
I love this feeling
So rewind, repeat itCould I wake up next to you
When we're hitting double figures
Look into your eyes
Like I'm looking into double mirrors
Could you make it any clearer
Everything's such a blur
It's not my turn
It's hers to get hurt
On a late night
Coming home from way too many train rides
Lace not as red as my face
I'm home at the same time
Highbury estate's fine
Smoking like a dragon, but don't chase lines
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my meals for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
And now I'm sitting on a night bus
Flicking through my Ipod
Feeling kinda tired
So I try to close my eyes up
Driver, turn the lights off
Lights on, on stage, mics on
Song plays, nice one
Gotta keep my hype strong
Truth be, never went to Uni
People see right through me
But I'm not a fool, see
I'm never gonna do one
Gonna live past 22, done
Everything I need to
Except get a 2:1
I haven't slept for the past week
Two hours ain't enough for me
I feel inspired, at quarter to three am
I haven't changed since our last meet
I'm still getting all my food for free
Think I'm being shunned by my feet again
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
When I feel cold
You keep me warm
And I'm not looking for some loose change
Just wanna find a true mate
Who wants to be my duvet?
So this is the part where everyone gets a bit involved and uh... I introduce myself. My name is Ed Sheeran and it's a pleasure to be here. Who's up for singing a bit, yeah? The lyrics are "It's not a homeless life for me / It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be" That's a little bit of a sing-song right now
It's not a homeless life for me
It's just I'm home less than I'd like to be
Thank you!Steel Banglez
Producer Zeph, bop bop bop
Friday night and I'm ridin' solo 
When I touch down, keep it on the low-low 
I don't mess with your energy 
No photos
So antisocial, but I don't care
Don't give a damn, I'm gonna smoke here 
Got a bottle in my hand, bring more though 
Got my hat low, don't talk to me 
I've been down, give me some space
You don't know what's in my brain
Music loud, easin' my pain
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes 
When I zoom , when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon 
Right past noon, then I'm doomed 
Occupied and movin' dolo 
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues 
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you" 
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it 
Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
I've been , lost out inner space
You left , me right in my place 
I put you down on my name
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the nightWell my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’
Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on
You break meWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to fly, fly
Angels to fly
For angels to die
Covered in white
This time
Angels to die
This time
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
For angels to die
Covered in white
This time
Angels to die
This time
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to flyYour love is the strongest thing I know
I reckon it's been doing weights
Eating raw eggs in its cereal
And running ten miles a day
And your love has a driving ban
From trying to steer intoxicated with another love inside her hands
And your love is a friend of mine
So we'll take it care tonight
If you could only say the words
I'd take it and I'd write it down
And hold it deep inside of me
Until the day you found me out
But I know your love
And that's why
I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And I could be your diary
Baby if you open me up
Keep it inside me
I'll give you the world
Just give me the words
And your love
Has never been my enemy
Used to hold me
And promise it would never leave
Never been better since all the therapy
To read the words between the lines
And take away my melody
And your love
Told me it was turning to a different page
And you know, if I let you go
I'll still keep you safe
You are the one I fall asleep with
But never wake up to
Cause work is something you must do
I trust you like you trust me
It must mean true love
It does exactly what it says on the tin
Let me begin
You are the one I watch the movies with
For recognizing my love for Kiera Knightley for what it truly is
Just an excuse so I don't have to watch Love Actually again
But you're actually the same
It's just to spite me
And we eat ice-cream with fishes in it
Until the dishes finished
Playing computer games although I know I'll never win it
I tried to make tea once for you in bed
But all I did was spill it
So you made it for me instead
Let me in bed
If you get in ahead of me
It's better to do
Yeah, love is ahead of the truth
But in love
We are better in two
I'll be the newcomer
Stuck in heaven with the devil in youWhen your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
Baby, my heart could still fall as hard at 23
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
Now, I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mmm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it is evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh, baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areHey, look, it's funny how the city where the Queen sleeps still ain't got clean streets
But there ain't a day when she ain't got clean sheets
And homeless people roll with needles
And you've gotta pay tax when you own a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs is a no-go area
The man are like "pass me your mobile, hear me now"
And chew the crunch on the credit
You can't get a roof over your head, you're stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don't play they
Dive in, snatch things and they don't say
Now the crib's vacant, victim of inflation
The black letters turn red cause they've been patient
And that six years' rent has just been wasted, wasted, wasted
London calls me a stranger, a traveller
This is now my home, my home
I’m burning on the back street
Stuck here sitting in the backseat
I’m blazing on the street
What I do isn't up to you
If the city never sleeps then that makes two
And my lungs hurt and my ears bled
With the sound of the city life echoed in my head
Do I need this to keep me alive?
The traffic stops and starts but I need to move along
Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the cityMy lungs are black, my heart is pure
My hands are scarred from nights before
And my hair is thin and falling out of all the wrong places
I am a little insecure
My eyes are crossed, but they're still blue
I bite my nails and tell the truth
I go from thin to overweight day to day it fluctuates
My skin is inked, but faded, too
But she loves me, she loves me
Why the hell she love me
When she could have anyone else?
Oh, you love me, you love me
Why the hell do you love me?
'Cause I don't even love myself
Baby, the best part of me is you
And lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
I overthink and still forgive
I lose my phone and place my bets
And I never catch the train on time
Always 30 minutes behind
Your worries ain't seen nothin' yet
But you love me, you love me
Why the hell you love me so
When you could have anyone else?
Yeah, yeah, he loves me, he loves me
And I bet he never lets me go
And shows me how to love myself
'Cause, baby, the best part of me is you
Oh, lately, everything's making sense, too
Baby, I'm so in love with you
With you
Da-dum, da-dum, da-dum, da-dum
Baby, the best part of me is you
Lately, everything's making sense, too
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with you
Baby, I'm so in love with you
Oh, baby, I'm so in love with youWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
Cause we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
Cause in a pipe we'll flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to flyI'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryin' act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
Since they are claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazine will ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taken my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every days some lyrics and a melody can be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinth can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely you find me in the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint of McDaid discussing records we made
And every single second knowing that we'll never betray
The way we were raised remembering our background sat down, that's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Mmm come on and take it back love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back love
No
Very superstitious, writings on the wall
Very superstitious, ladders bout' to fall
Thirteen month old baby, broke the lookin' glass
Seven years of bad luck, the good things in your past
Believing things that you don't understand
Then you suffer
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rha
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition ain't the way
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Superstition, babe
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
I wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Cause ain't no sunshine when she's gone
She's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
And I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
Know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, I know, know, I know, I know
I know, I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know
Hey, I oughta leave young thing alone
But ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the way
Oh anytime she goes away
Superstition ain't the wayWell I walked from my house to yours
In a warm cold April rain
We barely went outdoors
And your family took the blame
Take time to be with you
She can only glare
I’m a bad influence, that’ll do
‘Cos I need to cut my hair
Wash my mouth, change my clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door
It’s just that they don’t care
Dad said beware, watch your back
Just don’t reply to that woman there
And even if she makes a fuss
Just ignore that trust
And don’t give in to lust
And leave that one alone
The girl’s trouble
Time spent in burnt-down shed
Add up near two days
Fall down and cut my head
Take time to misbehave
Spend time and be with you
She can only glare
‘Cos you’re a bad influence, that’ll do
Boy you need to cut your hair
Wash your mouth, change your clothes
Just don’t talk to those friends of yours
Tell them not to come here anymore
Time to go, don’t be slow
This’ll only take a mo’
Take yourself right out of my door
This is the dancing song
Close your eyes
Hypnotise to the beat
And the movement of the week
Do that shuffle of your feet
And pound out the fever, either
Dance as you’re a true believer
Cleaner lives are what you don’t see
Fell the weight, gravitate
Feel the pace of me
This world is 2D
The only thing that’s free in life is love
And that don’t come cheapI think I took too much
I'm addicted to your touch
But I'm crying
In shame again
And now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
Oh well, we've come this far
You're my Venus
And I'm your Mars
And we've passed the moon and stars
And I'm gone
But now I'm high as a kite
And I know I might be gone
When you get home
I'm high as a kite
And I know I'm almost gone
When you get home
So please come homeJust give me a pen and I’ll write my worries
Now and again I’ll try and not see that you don’t care
Taking the time to taste and savour
Life’s bitter wine and childish behaviour
But you don’t care
And hey, I don’t speak that language of youth
And hey, oh not the one that speaks truth
And hey, I lay in this world for a while
When all is lost just smile
They’ve written the dates and the times to follow
See all the fakes that look so hollow
But you don’t care
What ever happened to the youth and culture?
Wear chains and the same fecking Lonsdale jumper
So you don’t careFace me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Your smile and your memory
Simply eases me to sleep
In my ear while the whispering
Melts my heart on every beat
Still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floor
Face me, are you tired of living?
Replace, she was so unforgiving
And I’m so frustrated, so dilated
And she’s telling me I’ve wasted my time
And I’m running back like, just to face the facts right
To tell me your voice takes me through the night
Time past, heal this broken heart
Pulled away that sellotape
Take your time, ‘cos I won’t mind
I doubt if I even know that I’m awake
And still you’re singing lullabies and postcards to this place
And we’re asking for so much more
Now you’re bringing smiles and laughter to this face
While bad memories are in pieces on the floorSing the song Celestial Man
Shake the thing your mother gave ya!
Tear your lungs out, scream your heart
Be on your worst behaviour
I’d wager that you’re gonna take it
Make you fight nature, born and raised in
Funk those things that make you go bump in the night
Turn off the dark, put on the light
And he said ‘You and your big cheeks have got me’
Along with ‘Disarm’ and ‘Flooded Quarry’
Turn off the base with the beat-box detox
Pull off the pace, while you sing with no socks
Lampshades, carpets, the stage black
You make the room’s hands laugh as they clap
You make my mouth water with support acts
They could even match you in talent - ignore that!
Gary Dunne and Newton Faulkner ain’t wrong
He’s got me singing to ‘Amerikan Folk Song’
Loop pedal class is used as weaponry
You gotta know your enemy
Gotta check your distance
Don’t talk, only whisper
Slap the base so hard you get blisters
Chikka boom, boom, chikka boom
JP beat-box, feet as flip-flops
Doing the hip hop, mixed with the warm sock
And Stephanie propped up, up by the mic stand
This ain’t no fake, it’s music in your hand
As you run into the centre of the crowd
Silence falls like water
You just wanna shout ‘Wow!’
How did they even have the guts to do it ?
If your name’s Nizlopi, then there ain’t much to it
‘Cos you and your big cheeks have got me spinning around nowIt’s been a while since we were here
Been too long my fear is
Holding back the memories of your eyes
Scattered notes and broken glass you had left for  me
All that’s left is shattered hearts
It’s plain enough for us to see that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me
We’re just friends tangled up in loose ends
I feel it coming around again
Let me know where you let your heart go
And I will just pretend
That I have never felt this way
Since you I have never felt this way
Since you
I feel strange
Playing games
It’s no fuss
I’m not in love
Twisted tunes, a melody of spite
If you give me the words then I might
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that I cannot fight
When you speak that shite
Let go unknown feelings
Telling me that
You’ve got me
You’ve got me
I lost it in your kiss, your lips
Sweetness, in your smile
Your words make me whole
But your scars demand a healer’s touch
It’s true
I’m glad I’m not youThink it's written on a notebook somewhere
Can you feel it as you breathe the night air, yeah
I can't remember what you said to me
But I know it was hard, hard, hard for you to speak
Time drift as you speed into love
Heart race as you heat up my blood, yeaaah
Let's just continue what we used to do
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
And it's late, it's late
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Ooooh, oh no
Drift off into space without care
Can you see it as you sit back in prayer, yeah
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
Sleep tight and I will not wake you up
Kiss me and I want to be in love, heeey
Lights dim and flicker blacker than the room
Cause I know it was hard, hard, hard to see the truth
And it's late, it's late, no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go, oh no
I miss you, oh no
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let go
I miss you
I can't let goSorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had there
I walked to Spanish Point
I knew I'd find you there
I stood on the white strand
You were everywhere
Vivid memories fade
But the mood still remains
I wish I could go back
And be with you again
In Milltown there's a pub
It’s there that I sat down
I see you everywhere
Your face is all around
The search for times past
Contains such sweet pain
I'll banish lonesome thoughts
But they’ll return again
I walk along the shore
The rain in my face
My mind is numb with grief
Of you there is no trace
I'll think of this again
In far off lands I roam
Walking with you
By this cold Atlantic fog
Sorrow and sadness, bitterness, grief
Memories I have of you
Won't leave me in peace
My mind was running back
To the west coast of Clare
Thinking of you
And the times we had thereI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up, lip sticks to me
So now I maybe lean back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But a house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat in
'Cause you take parts of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Not watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There may be other people like us
Who see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us but burns don't heal like before
And you don't hold me anymore
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again

It doesn't matter where we are, oh no, noI think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think the braces are breaking
And it's more than I can takeIf you wanna put this on me, that’s fine
I never blamed you for anything at all, in my life
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
Things we try to do won’t work
So can you help me out?
And say if you love somebody new
So even in my mind it’s true
Cause I have fallen for you
Say if you love somebody new
See I wanna take her to the Get Cape. Wear Cape. Fly Show
I could have taken anyone there
But I like the way she brushed her hair back
I never trust, begin to realize
How fast I would turn an eye
I was blind to all, yeah I saw all
Seeing this fake heart break
And stomach ache has got me
Acting like a pregnancy
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Cause even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind it's true, in my mind now
I never fell for you, you tripped me
Even in my mind, in my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped me
In my mind now, my mind
I never fell for you, you tripped meIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!
Louder!
Sing!
This love is ablaze
I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know
But something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singing in a local rave, no
I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said "it's nice to meet ya"
Then she handed me of a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness
I'm in deep if anybody finds out
I'm meant to drive home but I drunk all of it down
Not sober enough we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another now she's kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!
Louder!
Sing!
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
Can you feel it?
Found you hiding here so I hoped you'd take my hand darling
Before the beats kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushing through you from your head to toe
Sing!Nuair is léir nach seasann do chosa níos mó
Is nach leanann do shúil mar a bhíodh
An mbeidh teacht ar do bhéalín ar bhlaiseadh mo ghrá?
An mbeidh d’aghaidh ag fógairt d’aoibh?
A stórín, beidh mé ag fanacht leat féin go seachtó naoi
A leana, is tú an duine dom fiú ag fiche trí
Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir gan ach buille ar lámh
Titim féin i ngrá leat arís is arís
Tá rud ar intinn agam le rá
Bí liom ann Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m’ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
Nuair atá mé níos sine is ag briseadh go mall
Dearmad déanta ar m'ainm arís
Gan mo lámha in ann don mhéid céanna
Ó is tú a bheidh fós i mo chroí
Beidh tú liomsa, is mise leastsa go deo mo chroí
Tú le feiceáil gach oíche i mo bhrionglóidí
Tá mé ag rá leat go dtiteann daoine i ngrá gan aon chúis ná haon bhrí
B’fhéidir go mba chuid é don phlean
Mise agus tusa le chéile go deo
Ag glacadh go mbeidh tuilleadh ar lean
Bí liom ann
Féadfaidh tú mé a thógáil anocht
Ó luí liomsa faoin solas ón oíche gheal
Éist le buillí mo chroí ar m'ucht
Ag smaoineamh os ard
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhan
A leana, fuair muid neamh anseo ar domhanI woke up early looking out my window
At the Amsterdam sky
Oh baby I was high last night
Café clouds and red lights
When I gotcha in mind
You slowed down time
Oh baby I was out of my mind
Sing a song cover and hold me tight
I drill you deep into my chest
That’s where it feels the best
You can remove all the scars
Stop them from breaking my heart
Been on a hurting spree
That brought out the worst in me
Cause I don't want to be alone
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song
Café clouds and shooting stars are floating across the sky
Oh baby what a beautiful sight
But we're only satellites
Oh di ba di ba oh la lights
Oh baby I am so damn high
Have you seen my eyes
With the beat beat of my heart
You take me back to the start
Where everything began
Holding you inside my hands
Between my fingers and thumb
I seal you in with my tongue
Cause I don't want to be alone
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another song
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sweet Mary Jane
Na na na na na Sing another song
Mary Jane
I've been hoping alone
Mary Jane
Since you came along
Mary Jane
I'm almost home
Mary Jane
Sing another song
Cause everyday that I'm breathing I think you are the one
I love the way that your sweet words just roll off of my tongue
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won't you sing me another song
Cause everyday that I’m breathing, sweet mary jane
I love the sound of your sweet words, sweet mary jane
Feel the flame of your wisdom and fill up my lungs
Sweet Mary Jane won’t you sing me another songTBAI'm at a party I don’t wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody’s even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you’re making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don’t care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
’Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
'Cause I don't care
When I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oohStanding at the bar
And your eyes are telling me come closer
But if you could see me dance
There's no way that you would let me hold ya
I feel you pulling on my hand more
and dragging me to the dance floor
all my inhibitions fall away
feel the rhythm of the track
and telling the DJ pull it back...
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say
Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again
It could just be the baseline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go
you can keep me on the dance floor
but I don't wanna waste your time
Feel the rhythm of your hips more
It makes me wanna taste your wine
Its getting hard to keep in time
When I'm looking in your eyes
Everyone but you just fades away
feeling the rhythm of the track
and telling the DJ pull it back
With a whisper in my ear I hear you say
Softly do you feel that you could love me
and want me
more than anybody else
but then again
It could just be the bassline
That made me close my eyes
opened up my mind
Could you come back with me tonight
It's not the first time
that we've been on our own
So I'll hold you close
And never let you go
How, could I take you home tonight
I should be hailing a cab
But I don't wanna leave just yet cos I knowI'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a lego house
When things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December
But I've got ya to keep me warm
If you're broken I will mend ya and I'll keep you sheltered from the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it
And put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
And I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking
And it's more than I can take
And it's dark in a cold December
I've got ya to keep me warm
And if you're broke I'll mend ya
And keep you sheltered from
The storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done
I think I love you better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done
I will love you better nowI’m getting very edgy
Cos you’re trying to take this from me
And it’s something that I wanted so bad
Cos you’re the definition
Of someone who has to ruin
The best thing that I ever had
Cos you’re a jealous girl
And all I can say is
It’s your fault but partially mine
For losing hope
For not treating you right
But that will disappear in time
All I gotta do is pass you by
Never say what’s wrong
Whenever I say why?
Standing in the corner
Shadowed by the light
To you I seem much smaller
But I know it might be you
How much better could I do
To be myself, not someone else?
I’m losing sleep
I live only for the week
I’ve grown to ignore you
Cos when I seem to bore you
You pretend that you’re not interested
Your eyes start to twinkle
Your smile starts to widen
And I just seem to try and forget
But you pay me no attention
Even though I do
But I don’t care as long as you’re mine
It’s happening every time
And I’m falling harder now it seems
My slip-ups haunt me in my dreams
And I can’t sleep although I think I can
It’s insomnia I think I have
But who cares when I’m not your man?These lyrics have yet to be transcribedCan’t get you off my mind
Look at me and you will find
Time after time it seems
I’ll say what I don’t mean
In your world we were the same
In mine now you’re the one to blame
You can’t remember my name
We’re lost, it’s such a shame
Listen to me
Stop making me see
What I’ve been waiting for
Listen to me
Stop making me see
I’m strong yet proud
I’m quiet yet loud
And I’m everything
You want in me
I’m small yet tall
I have it all
And I’m everything
You want me to be
And I still feel like
I need you still
And I still feel like
I’m on some pill
And I still feel like
I need you stillThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me, I’ll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love
I’m in love
I'm in love
I'm in love with the shape of 
I'm in love 
I'm in love
I'm in love 
I'm in love with the shape of
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I’m in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I’m in love with your body
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love
I'm in love
I'm in love
I’m in love with the shape of 
I'm in love 
I'm in love
I'm in love 
I'm in love with the shape of
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love
I'm in love with your body
I'm in love
I'm in love with the shape of 
I'm in love 
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love 
I'm in love with the shape of
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body 
And last night you were in my room
And now my bed sheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new 
Dance 
I'm in love with the shape ofI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And every excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me
It never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your make-up lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe leave back there
I'm sat here wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
But our house gets cold when you cut the heating
Without you to hold I'll be freezing
Can't rely on my heart to beat it
'Cause you take part of it every evening
Take words out of my mouth just from breathing
Replace with phrases like when you're leaving me
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
I'll watch it fizzle at the bottom of a Coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So shall we speak then
Keep it between friends
Though I know you'll never love me like you used to
There maybe other people like us
You see the flicker of the clip when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
On cold days Coldplay's out like the band's the name
I know I can't heal things with a hand shake
You know I can't change as I began saying
You cut me wide open like landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
We'll applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I, should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little love
All by myself
I'm here again
All by myself
You know I'll never change
All by myself
All by myself
I'm just drunk again
I'll be drunk again
I'll be drunk again
To feel a little loveJust lay it all down on me
It’s getting harder for me to breathe
Just want to know if it will be
Just want to know if it is me
And you know I’ve learned from my mistakes
And how much have I got to lose?
You find my heart is hard to break
Can’t keep playing the fool
Breathe in, exhale
To turn to move beyond the pale
Flag up, set sail
To find what’s there beyond the pale
I feel like I’ve gone to the end of the world
What do I have to do?
What can I do
Just to let you know
That you’re in my mind?
To try and justify
The way you liberate me
Every timeWe the Best Music

Right before I leave she give me more than just some issue

I've been lost out in the space
You left me right in my place
I put you down on my name
Don't touch me, don't touch me, don't touch me, I can't even fight it

I can deal with the bad nights 
When i'm with my baby yeah
Cause i don't care
As long as you just hold me near 
You can take me anywhere 
And you make me feel like i'm loved by somebody 
I can deal with the bad nights
When i'm with my baby yeah"" "Over the castle on the hill"
When I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back
I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back
I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sun—
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sun—
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillOld yeller!!!I'm standing on a mountain
Waiting for you to come
You were sitting counting
The days that I had gone
The note I wrote
I wrapped up in a cigarette
Burned away the memories
I tried to forget
But not yet
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
How can I tell you?
I don't know what to say
This chance that I won't miss
But I miss you anyway
I feel your pain
It's turning me insane
Thrown away
I had to take the last train home
But then you came
Wishing my life away
But these three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
I love you
Wishing my life away
These three words
I have to say to you
My baby blue
You know it's true
You know it's true
I love you
I love you
I love youStrings on my guitar are rusty
Even my best friends don't trust me
Everybody thinks I must be crazy
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Cause, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Everything's in a haze
Yeah, the drink's got me in a daze
Everything's blurry
Oh, what's happened to me?
Say, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I mean
Now, I'm your typical average teen
If you know what I meanNow I'm in town, break it down
Thinking of making a new sound
Playing a different show every night in front of a new crowd
That's you now, ciao, seems that life is great now
See me lose focus, as I sing to you loud
And I can't, no, I won't hush
I'll say the words that make you blush
I'm gonna sing this now
See, I'm true, my songs are where my heart is
I'm like glue, I stick to other artists
I'm not you, now that would be disastrous
Let me sing and do my thing and move to greener pastures
I'm real, I do it all, it's all me
I'm not fake, don't ever call me lazy
I won't stay put, give me the chance to be free
Suffolk sadly seems to sort of suffocate me
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you at all
You need me
I sing and write my own tune
And I write my own verse? Hell
Don't need another wordsmith to make my tune sell?
Call yourself a singer-writer
You're just bluffing
Your name's on the credits and you didn't write nothing
I sing fast, I know that all my shit's cool
I will blast and I didn't go to Brit School
I came fast with the way I act, right
I can't last if I'm smoking on a crack pipe
And I won't be a product of my genre
My mind will always be stronger than my songs are
Never believe the bullshit that fake guys feed to ya
Always read the stories that you hear on Wikipedia
And musically I'm demonstrating
When I perform live, feels like I am meditating
Times at the Enterprise when some fella filmed me
"A young singer-writer like Gabriella Cilmi"
'Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me
Cause with the lyrics I'll be aiming it right
I won't stop till my name's in light
At Stadium Heights with Damien Rice
On red carpets, now I'm on Arabian nights
Because I'm young and all my brothers gonna give me advice
Long nighter, short height and I'm gone hyper
Never be anything but a singer-songwriter
The games over but now I'm on a new level
Watch how I step on the track without a loop pedal
People think that I'm bound to blow up
I've done around about a thousand shows
But I haven't got a house plus I live on the couch
So you can read the lyrics when I'm singing them out
Wow
From day one, I've been prepared
With vo5 wax for my ginger hair
So now I'm back to the sofa giving a dose of what the future holds
Cause it's another day
Plus I'll keep my last name forever keep the genre pretty basic
Gonna be breaking into other people's tunes when I chase it
And replace it with the elephant in the room with a facelift
Into another rappers shoes using new laces
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the papers
Selling CDs from my rucksack aiming for the majors
Nationwide 'til we're Just Jack, soon as I get the bus back
Clean cut kid without a razor for the mustache
I hit back when the pen hurts me
I'm still a choir boy in a Fenchurch tee
I'm still the same as a year ago
But more people hear me though
According to the Myspace and YouTube videos
I'm always doing shows, if I'm not I'm in the studio
Truly broke, never growing up call me Ruffio
Melody music maker
Reading all the papers
They say I'm up-and-coming like I'm fucking in an elevator
Cause you need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you
You need me, man, I don't need you, at all
You need me, man, I don't need youI'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...
Hit my plug, that's my cholo
Cause he got it for the low, low
If you snitchin' I go loco
Hit you with that treinta ocho
Niggas thinkin' that I'm solo
50 deep, they're like, "oh, no"
Heard the feds takin' photos
I know nothin', fuck the popo
I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...
36, that's a kilo
Need a brick, miss my free throw
I'm in love, just like Ne-Yo
Bustin' shots, now he Neo
Free my homies, fuck the C.O
Fuck the judge, fuck my P.O
All this coke, like I'm Nino
Water whip, I'm like Nemo
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Bakin' soda, I got bakin' soda
Whip it through the glass, nigga
I'm blowin' money fast, nigga
I'm in love with the coco...
I got it for the low, low...It's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignoring everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
I don't wanna know
If you're getting ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
For the longest time lady
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh Oh Oh Oooooooh 2x
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
This love is a blaze I saw flames from the side of the
Stage
And the firebrigade comes in a couple of days
Until then we got nothing to say and nothing to know but
Something to drink and maybe something to smoke
Let it go until I roll with the chain
Singing we found love in a local rave
No I don't really know what I'm supposed to say but I can
Just figure it out and hope and pray
I told her my name and said it's nice to meet ya then she
Handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know it she's a keeper
Just from this once small act of kindness I'm in
Deep if anybody finds out I am meant to drive home but i
Took all of it now I'm not sobering up
We just sit on the couch one thing led to another now she's
Kissing my mouth
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rushin' through you from your head to toe
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Louder!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
SING!
Ohhhhooohhhhoooo
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance...
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from above
Can you feel it?
Found you hot in here so I hope you'll take my hand darling
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it? Oooohooohooo wappaaa
Can you feel it? Oooohhoooo no no no
SING!
I need you darling
Come on set the tone
If you feel you're falling
Won't you let me know
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x
SING!
If you love me come on get involved
Feel it rush undo you from your head to toe
Oh Oh Oh Ohhhhhh 2x
SING!So, so you think you can tell
Heaven from Hell
Blue skys from pain
Can you tell a green field
From a cold steel rail?
A smile from a veil?
Do you think you can tell?
And did they get you to trade
Your heroes for ghosts?
Hot ashes for trees?
Hot air for a cool breeze?
Cold comfort for change?
And did you exchange
A walk on part in the war
For a lead role in a cage?
How I wish, how I wish you were here
We're just two lost souls
Swimming in a fish bowl
Year after year
Running over the same old ground
What have we found?
The same old fears
Wish you were hereIt's alright to cry
Even my dad does sometimes
So don't wipe your eyes
Tears remind you you're alive
It's alright to die
'Cause death's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for tonight
Hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
It's alright to shake
Even my hand does sometimes
So inside we'll rage
Against the dying of the light
It's alright to say
That that's the only thing you haven't tried
But just for today
Hold on
So live life like you're giving up
'Cause you act like you are
Go ahead and just live it up
Go on and tear me apart
Hold onWalking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youI want to be real
Not some conscience to myself
The way you worship, never ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
How you put upon yourself
A man who never seems
To answer to you words
So go and make me over
I’m a fly upon your neck
You can’t control me
I have my words, my voice
My strengths, my choice
And I can cut as deep
Just as deep as I need
Don’t want your advice
Cos I’ve made up my own mind
The way you bore me with the stories
Of far and distant times
I’ve heard it before
So don’t try that on me
The way you worship, never-ending
Some idol who’s pretending to be true
It could be you
Brainwashed by the lies
It’s no surprise
That you’d wanna waste your timeToday is gonna be the day that they're gonna give it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
Backbeat the word is on the street that the fire in your heart is out
And I'm sure you've heard it all before but you never really had a doubt
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
Today was gonna be the day but they'll never bring it back to you
By now you should've somehow realized what you gotta do
I don't believe that anybody feels the way I do about you now
And all the roads we have to walk are winding
And all the lights that lead the way are blinding
There are many things that I would like to say to you
But I don't know how...
I said maybe...
You're gonna be the one that saves me...
You're could have be the one that saves me...
And after all...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...
You're my wonderwall...Mr. Ruskin come and paint my picture
We’re losing sleep 'cos we steal the week
Now who’s your best friend?
Can you introduce me?
See I can’t seem to even let you breathe
When I dance with Billy Ruskin in my mind’s eye
Please let me forget that I’m standing on my own
And I am my own best friend and I need me to see
That I am more than what is hiding in me
Come and show me if you can
See I know you’re me
But I can’t seem to understand
If you know me, place my hand on mine
And we will resurrect the time
That we lost when you left my mind
It’s psycho-paranoia disappearing in time
Come and show me what makes you tick
I need you to get out of my mind quickI write this song in memory of
The wayward smile
The boy we won’t forget
The soul you took away from us
The river flows
The tears that we wept
Missing you
Is all that needs to be said
More than blue
The words inside my head
And I know that you’re gone
The cheeky smile
Of jokes and laughs
The memories of times
We crossed the line
The stepping stones
Across my mind
Washed away
We all now feel so blind
GoodbyeYou know I got to get away
To find some peace and sanity
I’ve been playing hide-and-seek too long
Shaking, making, everybody waking
Setting the hi-fi bleed
Keeping me back
While you’re spinning my track
That’ll knock you off your feet
Monkey see what monkey do
But I’m a monkey telling you
I just think that we should take a break
Tickity-tock the clock
With the hip-hop
And Alonestar backing me up
We won’t stop
I gotta be searching for my peace of mind
Now let the track rewind
And play, let the music play
It came, so let the music say what it feels
Shame, shame it took too long
To see that you were wrong
Now turn the song back on
[Verse 2:
This is Alonestar coming at you
With a new style
Kicking dust
Ready to bust
It's Urban Angel
Artistic, flipping the script
Who'd you really want to get it with?
Ed and Alonestar
We're like live wires sparking
Ready to blow
We've already sown our seeds
We're just waiting to grow, blow
We're gonna lift you like a shock to your body
Metaphorical speech when we come and see
You ducking for cover
Sheeran Lock coming ready to rock
With Urban Angel and Alonestar
And Ed, keep it locked
Let the beat pump
Drop the bass but don't stop
We're kicking the sound
Let the bass bins pound
We're gonna roll
Can you feel me now with my body?
Get down to the sound
It's Ed Sheeran in the place
And Alonestar rising up
We gotta rise up
I said rise upOoooh darlin' 
Its 4AM beneath the stars under the night,
and you're here, and you're here.
With candles lit the room is dark the moon is light,
we can lay here, we can love here...
Forever,
is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' 
I bought some food, a change of clothes, a little wine,
and a blanket,
and we used them all...
I dreamt the day away on a planet full of life,
and just stayed there,
i fell in love there.
Perfect comes near,
perfect just for one,
and forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' 
We're lying down her cheek is resting on my shoulder,
play with her hair, i adore her.
This is the single sweetest love I've ever known yeah,
we can stay here, run away dear.
Love knows no fear,
Father doubted some,
forever, is all i ever want,
so be careful,
when you're giving it to someone.
Ooooh darlin' On Saturday I know that you're coming up to see me
When I go away things will change
And you'll never know it was easy
It won't help pretending that we'll stay close
I can't help thinking that
I try to pretend that it's your loss
And I never know, oh I'll never know if it will work
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
And I left her today
And I left her today
Come Sunday I'll see that one day you'll rescue me
And when I leave again I'll feel strange
And I'll never know, oh I'll never know if you're in love again
I can't stop being a fool for you
I won't help thinking that
Still I am falling for her and she did too
Oh I'll never know, oh I'll never know if I'm in love
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her today
There's no better time
She's still thinking I'm too far away
Understanding why she's not thinking I'm a fool to wait
But I left her todayIn shadow there lies hope
Cut tension with a knife
I find it hard to cope
Stop playing with my life
You analyse my fears
Analyse my dreams
Choke on burning tears
Through my silent screams
Things aren’t what they seem
Tell a hundred craftsmen to work on me
Tell this army of angels to make me breathe
Open doors just to take away the key
I’ll let you all see that I’m doing better
Watch me fall
As I stumble at your feet
Always losing in this game
Your lies cut me deep
And you don’t even know my name
With your consistency
To always make me crawl
And my durability
Not affected at all
Feel the pain
On my brain
Feel the strain
As I start to decay
Feel the strain
Every passing day
Feel the pain
As I start to decayCause you need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you at all
You need me
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need you

You need me, man, I don’t need you
You need me, man, I don’t need you
Cause you need me, man, I don’t need youI found the words to say how I feel
But I just can’t spell them
I lost the nerve in a Suffolk field
So you can tell them
That I’m a different man with a different tune
I didn’t find love until last June
But I lost it, just like I lost it all
I tried to use it to break my fall
‘Cos I need something, anything to replace you
Or something closePass me a drink
You say it’s gonna take a while
Your consciousness sinks
Tears from a crocodile
You’re wasting your time
Giving me the speech
You try to, don’t reach
Your smile
You’re holding your tears
Your inside is dead
You’re eating your fears
In a cigarette
You’ve waited too long
To finally see
The sunshine in the rain
Is as deep as the sea
I’ve taken the blow
It’s all down on paper
Had fun in the snow
But no ‘see you later’'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Happier with you
Happier with you
Happier with you
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeahNow, Wembley, I've not played this song in a...
Around two years, maybe, maybe longer
But I feel like playing it today
Let's see how it goes
You're just a small bump unborn
In four months you're brought to life
You might be left with my hair
But you'll have your mother's eyes
I'll hold your body in my hands, be as gentle as I can
But for now you're a scan of my unmade plans
A small bump in four months, you're brought to life
And I'll hold you tightly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
Oh, you're just a small bump unknown, you'll grow into your skin
With a smile like hers and a dimple beneath your chin
Finger nails the size of a half grain of rice
Eyelids closed to be soon opened wide
A small bump, in four months you'll open your eyes
I'll whisper quietly
I'll give you nothing but truth
If you're not inside me
I'll put my future in you
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You can lie with me
With your tiny feet
When you're half asleep
I'll leave you be
Right in front of me
For a couple weeks
So I can keep you safe
'Cause you are my one and only
And you can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
You are my one and only
You can wrap your fingers round my thumb
And hold me tight
And you'll be alright
You were just a small bump unborn
Four months then torn from life
Maybe you were needed up there
But we're still unaware as whyI seem to find myself talking to the powers that be
Awaking the shade and shadowed under towering trees
Admiring the seen, inhaling fumes of flowers that breathe
Jet lagged eyes are begging for an hour to sleep
Although my blood shot whites and iris's they never find any
Clock stops at times where the sun shine can blind many
Although my eyes are heavy they won't be closing soon
Cos i know that time waits for nobody, I suppose its true
We make corrosive tunes with acid tabs and vocal booths
To see the flashing lights at photo shoots, we make our motive moves
I say what ever I feel to vent a rhyme
So i can still invent the lines and stay close to the friends of mine
Cos we all recognise, real is what my father says
And i'll be sticking to this phrase until I pass away
Overworking, no sleep is just another way to die slow
But i'll just keep going strong as ever, never let my eyes close

Interview with a vampire
Sleep is for the living and not a utensil that I require
I swear i said, that i'll sleep when im dead
Whos on the beat upon the feature with Ed its D-E-V to the Z
Over tired, pale faced like Michael Myers
Bags underneath my eyes can show the baggage i've acquired
And over the time within this maze i'll think you'll find you'll never find that peace of mind you seek to find until your dying
Cuz i got too much to stay awake for, to sleep or even take 4, seconds out the game
Its time to wage war
Scissors, grab a sword, and sharpen up your hunting knives
2 psychopathic lyricists are driving on the hunt tonight
I'm haling from the Essex and the East London boarder line
Villans never sleep they mastermind in all sorts of crimes
Be wide awake just like your snorting lines
Or get left mortified like you just seen the ghost of Jesus walking by
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be
The times i'm living in lately
I brush my teeth every night but still I wake up with a bad mouth
And the background is my past and my presence will bring it back out
Deliver the raps how I flow
I live with the raps now and those that hate me call me wrong
But they won't slither in too easy, believe me im snake minded
Be within this great time, be on minimum wage, life is a prison escape that im in
Its all to do with timing not the label that you sign with
Then my mates are doing fine but then they never put the time in
I try to hide my cold side like when i flip my pillows
Some of the the songs i write are real because the chart is filled with si-li-cone
Im still broke without the money for a mac pro, living out of three bags no talk about my cash flow
Opposite of sober cos I never did my homework
Which has got me on the sofa, no degree but growing older
I played a fool to catch the wise i will never tell a lie
I wake dead, take deep breaths, try to never die!
Never die
DEVLIN
2 guys with the same view, keep it tight like scrooge
Making metaphors flow and move, like typhoons and tunes
And if we got our eyes on you, we'll catch you while you snooze
Times elapsing while your catching Z's, the masses like to move
We scan the situation, analyse information, and then decide what probably is most practical to do
Driven young gentlemen
I've hardly changed my bed sheets at all over the last 12 months cos i haven't slept in them, true!
Im coming home, the lights are on, your rights are wrong so im correcting 'em
We got the fans all like 'oh wow its its Devs and Ed' what less did you bloody expect from 'em
In the end sleep deprivation might just be our detriment
Fighting through writers block from 9 o'clock to 5 o'clock and no way will I ever waste a second of the time I got
I keep my pupils engaged
Like a classroom in holy matrimony but im only trying to stay awake
I never sleep
When trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be, ahhh
The times i'm living in i never sleep, when trouble steals thoughts from a restless mind for free, it could be. x4
The times i'm living in latelyI keep my hopes and dreams inside you amongst these other things
My mother seems to never see the bruises that I'm covering
Never been known as my government name
My foster home is where I've been placed away from the pain
And now you sit before me, with a folder holding my story
You're my saviour with nothing on me but hope and glory
And surely, you'll never ignore me
'cos when the court came the court date was made to disappear for me
You think you understand me, but never what I went through
But you were never meant to, I won't hold it against you
I take a ball point pen to play dot to dot
With the cigarette burns etched in my forearms
Forget me not, never let me stop, you'll just sit and watch
It's your job to be patient so you'll let me off
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyes
And these dreams are all I have to hold me
When sleep's the only thing I want to take me away, away
Okay session's over time to get back to the classroom
I hate this lesson and I guess the teacher finds it hard too
You told me I should try my best but guess what, I still find this trigonometry a head fuck
Constantly told I won't pass my GCSEs
I'll end up in Mac D's serving burgers and cheese
But you told me I can do anything if I put my mind to it
Mistakes make a change if you put a line through 'em
Lately classmates think I'm crazy
Turn up daily resembling Bill Bailey
And I ain't saying that I can't be groomed with it
Without new clothes or shower it's hard to do so
After school you'll take me shopping for some new clothes
But they'll get taken off me when I get back to the group home
So come with me take a walk on the wild side
And see life in a day through a child's eyesYou're not her
Though I try to see you differently
I tow the line
You see, I'm searching for what used to be mine
I saw your eyes
And then I saw her staring back at me
And I will try to find another one
Who suited me as well as her
I've moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear
When we never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss you
She was mine
I was hers
And all that's in between
If she would cry
I would shelter her
And keep her from the darkness that will be
If I moved far away from you
And I want to see you here beside me, dear
But things aren't clear,oh
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
And I miss you
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
If you scar and leave me
Like a sunburn
Don't drop me in
It's not my turn
If you cut deep
Then I might learn
You scarred and left me
Like a sunburn
We never even tried
We never even talked
We never even thought in the long run
Whenever it was painful
Whenever I was away
I'd miss you
I miss youI went out late last night
And cold air met me
Lost a grip on my shoes
Walked home in bare feet
And I'll stay awake
Till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away, out
Tonight, this day won't end
The fire keep burning now
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight
I'm here again, the fire keeps burning now
I'm never gonna leave here
Let the dark cover me
And hold me tight
Hear the words in my sleep
Close your eyes for a second life within
And I'll stay awake till the morning greets me
And I'll stay away out, tonight
This day won't end, the fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here, tonight I'm here again
The fire keeps burning out
I'm never gonna leave here
Outside, in the winter, in the cold, I have not been asked where to go, and so, oh
I am here alone, waiting for tonight, waiting for tonight
And day, to end, the fire is burning now
I ain't ever gonna leave here now, and I'm here again
Oh, oh I ain't ever gonna leave here
Tonight, I'm out to meet ya
Tonight, I will feel no cold
Tonight, I'll ignore that my feet hurt
And I'll be no more, without youYou way too close, you way too close
You way too close 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me

Me and the night, me and the night
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close
I need room, I need room
Where you standin' way too close
You might catch fumes, might catch fumes
When I zoom, when I zoom
Pass out, wake up by myself right past noon
Right past noon, then I'm doomed 
Occupied and movin' dolo
Hennessy's drownin' all of my issues
Right before I leave, she give me more than just a "miss you"
That thing got more back, just like my engine, I can hit it
Seen a vision in the boy, then we committed 
Won't let nothin' come—, won't let nothin' come—
Won't let nothin' come—, won't let nothin' come—
Won't let nothin' come—, won't let nothin' come—
Won't let nothin' come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night 
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
On something, on something
On something, I wanna riot
Don't touch me, don't touch me
Don't touch me, I came to vibe, yeah
Won't let nothing come in between me and the night, yeah
Me and the night, me and the night

Me and the night, me and the night
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close, you way too close
You way too close, you way tooWalking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm
Only a month we've been apart
You look happier
Saw you walk inside a bar
He said something to make you laugh
I saw that both your smiles were twice as wide as ours
Yeah, you look happier, you do
Ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody love you like I do
Promise that I will not take it personal, baby
If you're moving on with someone new
'Cause baby you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I'll feel it too
And until then I'll smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Sat in the corner of the room
Everything's reminding me of you
Nursing an empty bottle and telling myself
You're happier, aren't you?
Oh, ain't nobody hurt you like I hurt you
But ain't nobody need you like I do
I know that there's others that deserve you
But my darling, I am still in love with you
But I guess you look happier, you do
My friends told me one day I’ll feel it too
I could try to smile to hide the truth
But I know I was happier with you
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
Hey yeah, hey yeah
‘Cause baby you look happier, you do
I knew one day you’d fall for someone new
But if he breaks your heart like lovers do
Just know that I’ll be waiting here for youMade of clay, shoot me down
I'll ricochet to the ground
Words of paint, draw me out
And fill me in with your mouth
And hold your tongue
And I know it's over before it's begun
I lost my way, so help me out
And lend your hand 'til I am found
My voice is mute, not to be heard
So it's up to you for you to bring those words
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
This grief you give, it takes its toll
It dries my heart and drowns my soul
I am a tree, whose branch you broke
The brittle wood has turned stones, oh
I
And I
Have come undone
For the last time
For the last time
For the last timeWalking down 29th and park
I saw you in another's arm

For dead presidents I pimp like Huddy roll
Doc the one that excite ya divas 
If the media shine, I'm shining with both of the sleeves up
Yo Christina , better hop in here
My block live and in color, like Rodman hair 
The club is packed, the bar is filled
I'm waiting for sister to act like Lauryn Hill
Frankly, it's a rap, no bargain deals
I drive a four wheel ride with foreign wheels
Throw it up baby it's Brick City, I heard of that

What?I found a love for me
Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waitin' for me
’Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowin' what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, "Darling, you look perfect tonight"
Well, I found a man stronger than anyone I know
I shares his dreams, I hope that someday we'll share a home
I found a love to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are just kids, but we're so in love
Fightin' against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be your girl, you'll be my man
And I see my future in your eyes
And, baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass while listening to our favorite song
When I saw you in that dress looking so beautiful
I don't deserve this, darling, you look perfect tonight
Baby, I’m dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, while listenin’ to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And  looks perfect tonight
You look perfect tonightI’m screaming out upon my face
Followed footsteps catch my pace
Broken windows fall in place
Now shattered lovers find their place
We’d flirt
And you’d treat me like dirt
All the pain and the hurt
Just to make matters worse
And I see you all over him
Irresistible sin
When can we be the same again?
What can I do to be making you see?
To come out clean?
You’re better off with me
We’re stuck
Taking time and wasting mine
No luck
Running around and crashing down
In you I trust nevermore
Leaving you in sand and glass
All I ever felt for you
Went up in a cloud of smoke
How I could I be such a fool
To ever think that we were close?We are, we are
We  are, we are
Huge  Danny
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis  and their rented Hummers
The  party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And  they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I  could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people

This is my only fear: that we becomeStevie was a boy
Who turned into a man
He never had no master plan
But I knew that he could
Find right from wrong
Sing me a different song
He told me which road to take
And now I’m gone
Keep on singing
Make her life whole
Stevie you’re winning
And I just feel cold
Take your life beyond the mark
You can do no wrong
When I lose my way in the dark
Keep singing your song
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breathe
Please come follow me
I find it hard to breatheDrunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little love
Drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
To feel a little loveI'm in so deep Omar Eds can relate to my situation its so real
Pain ain't the emotion I wanna feel but I'm thriving off it so it's only right, I like this topic
I'll be on a hill, keeping my head above water
I can't afford to ever get caught in a corner
So I move with the force of a sorcerer
It's dark when I'm about just me myself and my shadow
Im paro, running out of ammo, and it seems everybody around me is on the same path so it's narrow
Then less than a more proof for the last one left so they don't leave me as wet as an umbrella
I play fool to catch wise how we ever gonna get so clever
How can I be at my best with this pressure
I got a lot to loose but when I watch the news my mind's infected with terror
No wonder I'm under stress, I got my door kicked off by a bunch of feds
And when they left It looked like I had rave and invited more than a hundred guests
Oh-o-oh
I should of bust the back door and jump the fence
It seems the way you look back, should of, would of could of but I bet you can't bring shit with a good back
Back to fifteen our face to myself, then I'm more than a hood track
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out, out, out
Youuuuu won't drown me out
You can't ever drown me out, the water supplies too low
And I'm around 6'1, 10 stone
I never seen someone drown with insufficient amount of liquid in my lungs
A violent MC, my mouth can vouch
Do I sound like I'm choking? Seriously, do I sound like I'm joking?
I'm floating, even though that they wanna send me to the bottom of the ocean
But I am a ship that's so many years, but I'm maintaining
Plain sailing, no commotion
Like a dolphin, when it's in motion
But i can't break me, so why would I show them I'm broken
No real shit, throw my skin ain't close to corrosion
Fuck em all, this ain't no tug a war, still don't get roped in the open, I don't wanna reveal my violent side
But I swear that I will soon if the Lord above don't provide a sign
Then I'ma kill you, arm for arm, eye for eye
Nah, I just wanna live my life, but you don't wanna see this guy survive
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out
Ooo, you can drag me in the deep ends
Ooo, but you won't ever drown me out, out, out
You won't drown me out
You won't drown me outWell my friend it seems we’ve come too far to disagree
My knees feel weak and I fell too fast
The tide is high but we swam in too deep
To catch your breath you tear me apart piece by piece
You can take away all this mess
And I could never think anything less of you
‘Cos you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all I have left
The tide flows out as I leave empty rooms
To spur this on we left that room too long
You open wide and all the lies flow out
To eat you whole
But we both know that you’re too cold
And she said ‘I can put away all those lies
And show you there’s no surprise in me’
Well still, you break me
You numb me
You still seem to stun me
This pain has outrun me
You are all that I have left
Exorcise these demons
But they keep talking to me
I am no believer
But I believe you will relieve me
I believe you will relieve me
And that’s what’s going on
You break meSame reason at my eyes I do
That’s when she made her move
Whispered in my ear
And said
Hey let’s leave this party
Let’s start it back at homeTake me with you I do declare
I love you dearly through here and there
What can I do to make you share?
What can I do to make you care?
The world is harsh
I’m stuck in the dark
I’ll make my mark
I’ve got my spark
We’d be together through bad or worse
Sending letters we shall converse
We could do better but we must first
Make amends
That depends
Will you be my friend?L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out

I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
Mmm, L.A. drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become

Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautifulI wanna be drunk when I wake up
On the right side of the wrong bed
And never an excuse I made up
Tell you the truth I hate
What didn't kill me, it never made me stronger at all
Love will scar your makeup lip sticks to me
So now I'll maybe lean back there
I'm sat here, wishing I was sober
I know I'll never hold you like I used to
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna hold your heart in both hands
Now I'll watch you fizzle at the bottom of a coke can
And I've got no plans for the weekend
So should we speak then? Keep it between friends?
Though I know you'll never love me, like you used to
There may be other people like us
Will see the flicker of the clipper when they light up
Flames just create us, burns don't heal like before
You don't hold me anymore
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
I wanna be drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk
On cold days cold plays out like the band's name
I know I can't heal things with a handshake
You know I can't change, as I began saying
You cut me wide open like a landscape
Open bottles of beer but never champagne
To applaud you with the sound that my hands make
Should I? Should I?
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, again
Maybe I'll get drunk, again
I'll be drunk, againWhen your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks
And darling I will be loving you 'til we're 70
And baby my heart could still fall as hard at 23
And I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe just the touch of a hand
Oh me I fall in love with you every single day
And I just wanna tell you I am
So honey now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
Maybe we found love right where we are
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way, mm
I know you will still love me the same
'Cause honey your soul can never grow old, it's evergreen
Baby your smile's forever in my mind and memory
I'm thinking 'bout how people fall in love in mysterious ways
Maybe it's all part of a plan
I'll just keep on making the same mistakes
Hoping that you'll understand
But baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are, oh
So baby now
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars
Oh darling, place your head on my beating heart
I'm thinking out loud
That maybe we found love right where we are
Oh maybe we found love right where we are
And we found love right where we areHola Ani preciosa
Que tal estas
Espero que todo bien
Sos preciosaAll I need is closure
Oh what you said to me
Cause I
I could never be mad with you babyMmm, yeah you burned me again
Well, I don't wanna know where you've been
Mmm, how is your new best friend?
And do you know I will treat you like him?
And I know
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
Apologies for the way I've been
I couldn't wash you off my skin
No I, I couldn't live without you
Mmm, tears and eyes can dry
But I know I'm burning like the wire in light bulbs
It could be in the way you bleed me
And I know
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
You're under my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo on my skin
Running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way that you loved me
I guess that you had to leave a tattoo to remind me
A tattoo to remind me
A tattoo
Under my skin and running in my bloodstream
These scars are the way you loved me
I guess you had to leave a tattoo to remind meThey tell me you can only dream when you fell asleep
But now I'm working to achieve, but sleep is the only thing I never see
And I vowed that my breathing with never cease
To the retrieve then I can't let them be
I won't let 'em leave and I had the same feeling since 17
But I wasn't ready then like a lemon screen?
Now I'm in the magazines almost every week
Cause I'm getting heat like in Tenerife
Right now it's better than it's never been
Never fade like a plant that's evergreen
So I hope to my heart, but my self doubts are getting me
Afraid for my cross, getting dump for the day and I'm getting weak
Cause I'm new, I'm that boy that starts it
They chase dreams together like a slumber party
And now I'm on my own, even though I'm smooth sailing
I'm scared to sing, cause my nightmare is fading
Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
You better wake up cause I am making moves
And even when I'm dozing I'm breaking rooms
I'm only hitting the sack when I'm training
Too busy trying to keep up with the latest snooze
Made my bed and that's where I'm heading
I fly straight with the best man I embed 'em
Married to the game was a quiet wedding, then I had to fight to get her
Now I'm taking control of my inception
Cause they try to hit misses with my direction
See they better marry donna cause when I strike, strike
Not even Maradonna is gonna cry, I'm awake at night
The haters know where the family lives
Tell me what I catch, but you're playing knock door ginger
Just gonna lose a lot more, than I need it
They say sleep is the cause of death
But I hear shit because I am deaf
Gang signs I'm N/A reading
I'm a CEO, man you suckers are next
Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
They watching me! They watch me sleep!
Let me go!
I fell asleep on sofa, walk up in reality
And daydream about losing my sanity
I've been rhyming forever got a blind flow
So I can see an off note with my eyes closed
But to achieve the dreams you can't doze off cos your dream a sleep
I ain't nodding off but I'm nodding to the beat
I be shocking in my sheets, when I should have been asleep
See, all the dreams I'm fonder
You placed me in the team insomnia
Now, I Mr hard worker
In my nightmares I Mr can't turn up
And I missed my chance worst luck
Trying to hit women I Mr I turn up
Yeah, and I walked from ish
Thinking it will put me to rest on my mattress
Chorus:
When the darkness creeps in
I feel my nightmares watching me
And when my dreams are sleeping
I feel my nightmares watching me
Oh, oh, oh!
I feel my nightmares watching me
Watching me!Hey man
Just one more night in AmericaYuh, everything's so down right now
I took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made, memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when your down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces but it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Uh, everything seems so depressing
I can't believe my grandma passed
There's nothing I can do about it
So I guess I'll just sit and cry, uh
My mum is ill and passed away
I am so very sad, her death is out of my control
I can't get her out of my damn head
I think about her and it just makes me cry every day
Yeah, damn, everybody's drunk and sad
Grandma passed away
We're gonna go to bed sad
And will have to be sad all the time, uh
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh
Yeah, we're all sadThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
And you come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body

One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me

Oh darling, just dive right in and follow my lead
Well, I found a girl, beautiful and sweet
Oh, I never knew you were the someone waiting for me
'Cause we were just kids when we fell in love
Not knowing what it was
I will not give you up this time
But darling, just kiss me slow, your heart is all I own
And in your eyes, you're holding mine
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favourite song
When you said you looked a mess, I whispered underneath my breath
But you heard it, darling, you look perfect tonight
Well I found a woman, stronger than anyone I know
She shares my dreams, I hope that someday I'll share her home
I found a love, to carry more than just my secrets
To carry love, to carry children of our own
We are still kids, but we're so in love
Fighting against all odds
I know we'll be alright this time
Darling, just hold my hand
Be my girl, I'll be your man
I see my future in your eyes
Baby, I'm dancing in the dark, with you between my arms
Barefoot on the grass, listening to our favorite song
I have faith in what I see
Now I know I have met an angel in person
And she looks perfect
I don't deserve this
You look perfect tonight
You look perfect tonightWe are, we are, we are
L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sundown and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're headin' downtown
Everybody's lookin' for a come up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
We don't fit in well 'cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
L.A., mmm, drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere 
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there 
I'm not fazed by all them lights and flashin' cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
We don't fit in well, we are just ourselves
I could use some help gettin' out of this conversation, yeah
You look stunning, dear, so don't ask that question here
This is my only fear: that we become
Beautiful people
Beautiful people
Ed & 
We are, we are, we are
Beautiful people
Drop top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Prenups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
Beautiful peopleI'm at a party I don’t wanna be at
And I don't ever wear a suit and tie, yeah
Wonderin' if I could sneak out the back
Nobody’s even lookin' me in my eyes
And then you take my hand
Finish my drink, say, "Shall we dance?" 
You know I love ya, did I ever tell ya?
You make it better like that
Don't think I fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say 
I always feel like I'm nobody, mmm
Who wants to fit in anyway?
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
And you’re making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I’m with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don’t care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights
When I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
’Cause I don't care
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care
We at a party we don't wanna be at
Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah
When we walked in, I said I'm sorry, mmm
But now I think that we should stay
'Cause I don't care when I'm with my baby, yeah
All the bad things disappear
Yeah, you're making me feel like maybe I am somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
'Cause I don't care as long as you just hold me near
You can take me anywhere
And you're making me feel like I'm loved by somebody
I can deal with the bad nights when I'm with my baby, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Yeah, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't care
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
'Cause I don't careWhen I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
Tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh, how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way, driving at 90
Down those country lanes, singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
And we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
One friend left to sell clothes
And one works down by the coast
One had two kids but lives alone
One's brother overdosed
One's already on his second wife
One's just barely getting by
But these people raised me
And I can't wait to go home
And I'm on my way, I still remember
These old country lanes
When we did not know the answers
And I miss the way you make me feel, it's real
When we watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hillI won't wear makeup on Thursday
I'm sick of coverin' up
I'm tired of feelin' so broken
I'm tired of fallin' in love
Sometimes I'm shy and I'm anxious
Sometimes I'm down on my knees
Sometimes I try to embrace all my insecurities
So I won't wear makeup on Thursday
'Cause who I am is enough
And there are many things that I could change so slightly
But why would I succumb to something so unlike me?
I was always taught to just be myself
Don't change for anyone
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah
Don't wanna wake up and feel insecure
I wanna sing, I wanna dance
I wanna feel love inside my hands again
I just wanna feel beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful
I'll wear my sweatpants on Thursday
And I'll drink sloe gin from a can
I'll build my own independence
I don't always need a man
You know sometimes I feel lonely
Could do with the company
Oh, I get high when I'm down
But you know that's alright with me
So I will do nothing on Thursday
Sit alone and be
And there are many things that I could change so slightly
But why would I succumb to something so unlike me?
I was always taught to just be myself
Don't change for anyone
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah
Don't wanna wake up and feel insecure
I wanna sing, I wanna dance
I wanna feel love inside my hands again
I just wanna feel beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful
I won't wear makeup on Thursday
'Cause who I am is enough
And I-
I wanna laugh, I wanna cry
Don't want these tears inside my eyes, yeah
Don't wanna wake up and feel insecure
I wanna sing, I wanna dance
I wanna feel love inside my hands again
I just wanna feel beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh-oh-oh, I just wanna feel beautiful
Oh-oh-oh, oh I-
Oh I-
Oh I- , I just wanna feel beautiful, baby, let's ride
Mmm, excuse me, , blame it on the juice and the Jager Bomb
Shot in my handIf we take this bird in, with its broken leg
We could nurse it, she said
Come inside for a little lie down with me
And if you fall asleep it wouldn't be the worst thing
But when i wake up, and your makeup is on my shoulder
And tell me if I lie down, would you stay now?
Let me hold ya, ohh
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
If we take a walk out, in the morning dew
We could lay down, so I'm next you
Come inside for a little home made tea
And if you fall asleep, then at least your next to me
And if I wake up, say its late love get back to sleep
I'm covered by nature and I'm safe now
Underneath this oak tree, with you beside me
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
And I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird
My little bird
My little bird
And of all this thing I'm sure of, I'm not quite certain of your love
You made me scream but then I made you cry when I left that little bird with its broken leg to die
But if I kiss you will your mouth read this truth
Darling how I miss you, strawberry's taste how lips do
And its not complete yet, mustn't get our feet wet
Cause that leads to regret, diving into soon
But I'll owe it all to you, oh, my little bird
My little bird, whoa oh oh oh whoaa
My little bird
My little bird
Your my little bird...Come, you masters of war
You that build the big guns
You that build the death planes
You that build all the bombs
You that hide behind walls
You that hide behinds desks
I just want you to know that I can see through your masks
You that never done nothing
But build to destroy
You that play with my world
Like it's your little toy
Put a gun in my hands
And you hide from my eyes
And you turn and run farther
When the fast bullets fly
Like Judas of old
You lie and deceive
A war can be won
You want me to believe
But i see through your eyes
And i see trough your brain
Like i see through the water
that runs down my drain
You that fasten all the triggers
For the others to fight
And you sit back and watch
As the death count gets high
And you hide in your mansion
While the young peoples blood
Flows out of their bodies
and is buried in the mud
you've thrown the worst fear
It can never be hurled
Fear to bring children
Into the world
For threadning my baby
Unborn and unnamed
Well, you ain't worth the blood
that runs in your veins
How much do i know
To talk out of turn
You might say that I'm young
You might say that I'm unlearned
But there is one thing i know
Though I'm younger than you
That even Jesus would never forgive
what you do
Let me ask you one question
Is your money that good
Will it buy you forgiveness
Do you think that it could
I will think that you will find
When your dead takes its toll
All the money you made
will never buy back your soul
And I hope that you die
And your death will come soon
And I will follow your casket
In the pale afternoon
And I'll watch while you're lowered
Down to your deathbed
And I will stand over your grave
to make sure that you're dead

One week in we let the story begin

You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead

A little crazy, but I'm just your type

Something borin'
Legs open, tongue out, Michael Jordan, uh

Drop a album, drop a baby, but I never drop the ball, uh

L.A. on a Saturday night in the summer
Sun down and they all come out
Lamborghinis and their rented Hummers
The party's on, so they're heading downtown
Everybody's looking for a come-up
And they wanna know what you're about
Me in the middle with the one I love and
We're just tryna figure everything out
:
We don't fit in well
'Cause we are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation, here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here
This is my only fear
That we become
:
Beautiful people
Drop-top, designer clothes
Front row at fashion shows
"What d'you do?" and "Who d'you know?"
Inside the world of
Beautiful people
Champagne and rolled-up notes
Pre-nups and broken homes
Surrounded, but still alone
Let's leave the party
That's not who we are
We are not beautiful
Yeah, that's not who we are
We are not beautiful
:
Drove for hours last night and we made it nowhere
I see stars in your eyes when we're halfway there
I'm not fazed by all the lights and flashing cameras
'Cause with my arms around you, there's no need to care
:
We don't fit in well
We are just ourselves
I could use some help
Getting out of this conversation here
You look stunning, dear
So don't ask that question here

That's not who we are
We are not beautiful 
Yeah, that's not who we are
We are not beautifulWhen I was six years old I broke my leg
I was running from my brother and his friends
And tasted the sweet perfume of the mountain grass I rolled down
I was younger then, take me back to when I
Found my heart and broke it here
Made friends and lost them through the years
And I've not seen the roaring fields in so long, I know I've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Fifteen years old and smoking hand-rolled cigarettes
Running from the law through the backfields and getting drunk with my friends
Had my first kiss on a Friday night, I don't reckon that I did it right
But I was younger then, take me back to when
We found weekend jobs, when we got paid
We'd buy cheap spirits and drink them straight
Me and my friends have not thrown up in so long, oh how we've grown
But I can't wait to go home
I'm on my way
Driving at 90 down those country lanes
Singing to "Tiny Dancer"
And I miss the way you make me feel, and it's real
We watched the sunset over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hill
Over the castle on the hillWe are, we are, we are

Yeah, that's not who we are 
We are not beautiful 
We are, we are, we are
We are not beautifulWell the road is wide
Waters run on either side
And my shadow in the fading light
Is stretching out towards the night
When the sun is low
And I have so much more to go
And my lonely heart is beating so
Tired of the wonder
There's a sign ahead
Though I think it's the same one again
So I'm thinking 'bout my only friend
Till I find my way home
Cause when I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
Oh, well the air is cold
And yonder lies my sleeping soul
By the branches broke like bones
This weeping tree no longer holds
Oh well, the night is still
And I have not yet lost my will
Oh, and I will keep on moving 'till
Until I find my way home
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding light
When I need to get home
You're my guiding light, you're my guiding lightI'm what's good in your thoughts
And the bad girl that you want caughtLook its funny how the city where the Queen sleeps
Still ain’t got clean streets
But there ain’t a day when she ain’t got clean sheets
Homeless people roam with needles and
You’ve got to pay tax to afford a vehicle
Tube fare doubles up every two years
And the buses upstairs are a no go area
Man are like ‘Pass me your mobile, here me now’
And with the crunch of the credit
You can’t get a roof over your head
You’re stuck in the debit
But every single month they come for the debit
Direct action, if you don’t play they
Dive and snatch things and it don’t say that
Now equipped fear ‘cause a victim of inflation
The black letters turned red and they been patient
And now six years rent has just been wasted
I’m from a city where the rain won’t cease
Pollution in the air matches that on the street
The black smoke gets your head into a muddle, like
Walking into elephant syringes in the puddle, like
I was a country boy when I moved out
Grew up too fast for my family to find out
Now I try to stop my music running into nosedives
Can’t resort to arrogance with white lies
This city won’t erase me
But I can’t help to see how this dark city changed me
It’s all the same see, music is my life, but
Now I try to fight whatever I need to hide from
North, South, East, West, London’s my home now
Knees weak, but we never slow down
Now I start to do my music properly
And stay from all the negative shit that will follow me
Hey, look, I'm from a city full of jammed up traffic, night buses
All-night clubbers, Kings Cross to all-night lovers
That knew when to pay rent and stay in their apartment
Talented buskers playing that guitar riff
The church pastor's still praying for answers
Way too much congestion, they're charging
Way too much for petrol, I'm laughing
But there ain't no funny side
It's like winter all year, there ain't no summer time
Stone Island jacket, keep warm
And all phone lines are tapped, you've been warned
And also mind the gap and keep calm
Cause one wrong move on the train, big beard
And it's gunshots, two in your brain, it's weird
So as much as I'm in love with this city
Just maybe I've had enough of the cityHey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey hey
Simmer down, simmer down
They say we’re too young now to amount to anything else
But look around
We worked too damn hard for this just to give it up now
If you don’t swim, you’ll drown
But don’t move, honey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Let’s get out, let’s get out
'Cause this deadbeat town’s only here just to keep us down
While I was out
I found myself alone just thinking
If I showed up with a plane ticket
And a shiny diamond ring with your name on it
Would you wanna run away too?
'Cause all I really want is you
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down
I made a mixtape straight out of ‘94
I’ve got your ripped skinny jeans lying on the floor
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I'm so down
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
You look so perfect standing there
In my American Apparel underwear
And I know now that I’m so down 
Your lipstick stain is a work of art
I got your name tattooed in an arrow heart
And I know now that I’m so down
Hey, heyI'm just a bachelor, lookin' for a partner
And someone who knows how to ride without even fallin' off
Gotta be compatible and takes me to my limits
Girl when I break you off, I promise that you won't wanna get off
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
I'm sittin' here flossin', peepin' your steelo
Just once if I have the chance, the things I would do to you
You and your body, every single portion
I send shivers up and down your spine, and fluids flowin' down your thigh
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
Wanna get freaky baby
And feel you next to me
And you can join my jockey team 
Wanna get nasty baby
And feel you next to me 
And you can join my jockey team 
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on it
If you're horny, let's do it
Ride it, my pony
My saddle's waitin'
So come and jump on itIf this is to end in fire
Then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father, oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on
The mountain side
And if we should die tonight
Then we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father, oh
Prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn over
The mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire
Inside the mountain
I see fire
Burning the trees
And I see fireFull lyrics will be available upon release, stay tuned!

Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heart
Oh my brother, why you've been
It's been the longest time apart
And I remember the days we were running free
Long before you broke my heartWhen your legs don't work like they used to before
And I can't sweep you off of your feet
Will your mouth still remember the taste of my love?
Will your eyes still smile from your cheeks?
And darling I will be loving you till we're seventy
And baby, my heart could still fall as hard at twenty-three
When my hair's all but gone and my memory fades
And the crowds don't remember my name
When my hands don't play the strings the same way
I know you will still love me the same
Cause honey your soul could never grow old, it's evergreen
And baby, your smile's forever in my mind and memory
Take me into your loving arms
Kiss me under the light of a thousand stars, oh darling
Place your head on my beating heart, I'm thinking out loud
And maybe we found love right where we are
I'm thinking out loud
We found love right where we are
We found love right where we areYellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heart beat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

        This year's love had better last
Heaven knows it's high time
I've been waiting on my own
Too long
And when you hold me like you do
It feels so right, oh now
I start to forget how my heart gets torn
When that hurt gets thrown
Feeling like you can't go on
Turning circles and time again
Cut like a knife, oh now
If ya love me got to know
For sure
Cause it takes something more this time
Than sweet sweet lies, oh now
Before I open up my arms and fall
Losing all control
Every dream inside my soul
When ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better last
Cause who's to worry if our hearts get torn
When that hurt get thrown
Don't ya know this life goes on
Won't ya kiss me on that midnight street
Sweep me off my feet
Singing ain't this life so sweet
This year's love it better last
This year's love it better lastThe club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lеad
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in lovе with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too

Η Αγάπη μπορεί να σε πληγώσει
Loving can hurt sometimes
Η Αγάπη μπορει να σε πληγώνει κάποιες φορές
But it's the only thing that I know
Αλλα η αγάπη ειναι το μόνο πράγμα που γνωρίζω
When it gets hard
Οταν η αγαπη είναι δύσκολη
You know it can get hard sometimes
Εσυ γνωριζεις οτι μπόρει να είναι δύσκολη κάποιες φορες
It is the only thing that makes us feel alive
Είναι το μόνο συναίσθημα που σε κάνει να αισθάνεσαι ζωντανος
We keep this love in a photograph
Εμείς βλεπουμε την αγαπη σαν φωτογραφία
We made these memories for ourselves
Εμείς κραταμε τις αναμνησεις για τον εαύτο μας
Where our eyes are never closing
Οταν τα μάτια μας ποτέ δεν κλείνουν
Hearts are never broken
Οταν η καρδια πότε δεν λυγίζει
Times forever frozen still
Στιγμές αίωνiαις σαν πάγος σταθερές
So you can keep me
Για αυτο μπορείς να με κρατησεις
Inside the pocket
Αναμέσα στο πορτοφολί
Of your ripped jeans
Μέσα στο σκιμένο σου τζιν
Holdin' me closer
Κρατησε με κλειστα
'Til our eyes meet
Ακομη και όταν τα μάτια συναντιώνται
You won't ever be alone
Ποτέ δεν θα είσαι μόνος σου
Wait for me to come home
Περίμενε με να γυρίσω πίσω
Loving can heal
Η αγαπη μπορει να επουλώσει την πληγή
Loving can mend your soul
Η αγαπή μπορεί να γιατρέψει την ψυχή σου
And it's the only thing that I know 
Και είναι το μόνο συναίσθημα που γνωρίζω
I swear it will get easier
Σου ορκιζομαι οτι αυτο θα ηταν πιο ευκολό
Remember that with every piece of ya
Θυμίσου οτι μαζι εχουμε αυτο το κομάτι απο την αγάπη ναι
And it's the only thing we take with us when we die
Και είναι το μόνο συναίσθημα που εμείς έχουμε οταν πεθαίνουμε
We keep this love in this photograph
Εμείς κραταμέ την αγάπη σαν αυτην την φωτογράφια
We made these memories for ourselves
Εμείς έχουμε αυτές τις αναμνήσεις για εμάς
Where our eyes are never closing
Οταν τα μάτια ματια μας, ποτέ δεν κλείνουν
Our hearts were never broken
Οταν η καρδια μας ποτε δεν πληγώνεται
Times forever frozen still
Οι στιγμες θα είναι για πάντα εκεί για να τις θυμόμαστε
So you can keep me
Για αύτο κρατήσε την φωτογράφια
Inside the pocket
Ανάμεσα στο πορτόφολι σου
Of your ripped jeans
Μεσα στο σκιμένο σου τζιν
Holdin' me closer
Κράτησε με σφιχτά
'Til our eyes meet
Ακομή και οταν τα μάτια μας συναντιωνται
You won't ever be alone
Ποτέ δεν θα είσαι μόνος σου
And if you hurt me
Και εαν με πληγώσεις
That's OK, baby, only words bleed
Ολα είναι καλα, μωρο μου, μόνο οι λέξεις πληγώνουν οχι εσύ
Inside these pages you just hold me
Αναμεσα σε αυτές τις σελίδες που εσύ  κρατάς
And I won't ever let you go
Και ποτέ δεν θα σε αφήσω να φύγεις
Wait for me to come home 
Περίμενε με να γύρισω σπίτι
Oh you can fit me
Ναι μπορείς να με κρατήσεις
Inside the necklace you got when you were 16
Ανάμεσα στο φυλαχτό σου που είχες απο την ηλικία των 16
Next to your heartbeat
Διπλα στους χτύπους της καρδία σου
Where I should be
Που αλλου θα μπορούσα να είμαι
Keep it deep within your soul
Κρατήσε την αγάπη μου βαθύα στην ψύχη σου
And if you hurt me
Και αν με πληγώσεις
Well, that's OK, baby, only words bleed
Καλα θα είμαι, μωρο μου, μονο οι λέξεις πληγώνουν, όχι εσύ
Inside these pages you just hold me
Ανάμεσα σε αυτές τις σελιδές που εσύ διαβάζεις, εσυ μου δίνεις δύναμη
And I won't ever let you go
Και ποτέ δεν θα σε αφήσω να φύγεις
When I'm away
Οταν εγώ ονείρευομαι
I will remember how you kissed me
Εγω θυμάμαι την πρώτη φορά που με φίλησες
Under the lamppost
Κατω απο τον λαμπτήρα
Back on 6th street
Γυρίσα στην 5η οδο
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Ακούγωντας τον ψίθυρο της φωνής σου από το τηλέφωνο
"Wait for me to come home."
Περίμενε με να γύρισω σπίτιNo lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
Another night, another club
Another room, a new one
When morning comes, I'm running off
I found lust, but I wanna find love
And every time I get close, I run wild and explode
But I'm lonely, in LA
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
To chase women and to only break hearts, that's fine
When you're eighteen but when you're older
To find love, yeah, you gotta grow up sometimes
Being solo is the way to go, but I've been doing it too long
But you never know though
That one night stand, could just be the one, yeah
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle
In the dark
Another night, another day
Another city, another plane
Another heart I'm gonna break
Another mili on the cardiae
A young girl my heart broke, so I don't wanna get close
I don't know why you're not enough
No lie, yeah, my mama never raised me to be a bad boy
But I ended up being one anyway
Man you can never change me
This is my world, I run this city and I'm in my own lane
Sometimes being solo is the way to
'Cause I love the way I get some
But you never know though cause maybe you
Could just be the one, ayy
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, 'cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
Summer nights, and no love for the lonely
Don't come near me, cause I'll only break your heart
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the dark
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
No lo-lo-love for the lonely, no lo-lo-love for the lonely
I will try to find someone to hold me
My love is a flickering candle, in the darkI took the supermarket flowers from the windowsill
I threw the day old tea from the cup
Packed up the photo album Matthew had made
Memories of a life that's been loved
Took the get well soon cards and stuffed animals
Poured the old ginger beer down the sink
Dad always told me, "Don't you cry when you're down"
But mum, there's a tear every time that I blink
Oh, I'm in pieces, it's tearing me up, but I know
A heart that's broke is a heart that's been loved
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Uh, everything seems so depressing
I can't believe my grandma passed
There's nothing I can do about it
So I guess I'll just sit and cry, uh
I hope that I see the world as you did 'cause I know
A life with love is a life that's been lived
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh 
So I'll sing Hallelujah
You were an angel in the shape of my mum
When I fell down you'd be there holding me up
Spread your wings as you go
When God takes you back
He'll say, "Hallelujah, you're home"
Uh

        Ouais, je suis né marginal
Grandi  à 16km de la ville de Ipswich
Voulu  la rendre plus grande, souhaité de l'existence
Je n'ai jamais été un gosse déjanté, toujours vite ignorer
Reste au chant, arrête de rapper comme si c'est Noel
Et  si tu parles d'argent, alors ma conversation change
Mes  rêves sont plus grands qu'être simplement sur la liste des plus riches
Pourrait être la folie, mais les gens appellent ça " doué "
Ma  face s'engourdit par ce qu'il y a dans cette merde
Regarde comment les paroles des musiques peuvent être déformées
Ma femme porte du rouge, mais reste plus belle sans rouge à lèvre
J'suis un mec secret et tu ne connais rien de mes affaires
Et  si j'avais mes 15minutes, j'ai du les louper
A 20 ans c'est quand je suis arrivé dans le game
Et maintenant ca fait 8 ans et tu te souviens du nom
Et si tu pensais que j'étais bon, alors j'suis meilleur aujourd'hui
Mais c'est ironique comment vous pensiez tous que je n'aurais jamais été bon
J'aime mes concert en plein air, de Tokyo au Delaware
Levez vos tel en l'air si vous voulez être bercé
Vous savez que je veux bien plus que je n'ai déjà
Donnez moi un son avec Eminem et 50 Cent dans le club
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
Je veux reprendre et être payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
Je veux reprendre et être payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Je me rappelle toujours  d'essayer d'avoir un contrat 
De Taco Bell à TRL
J'ai grimpé les charts du Billboards jusqu'au sommet
Comme le destin le voulait , devenu un accroc
Marrant parce que j'ai eu recours à la pop
Mais ils ont dit le temps nous dira  si j'aurais régner 
Et tout ce que j'ai fait c'était  enfoncer 22cm d'ongles 
Dans mes paupières maintenant 
Je vois des ventes de diamant comme si j'étais dans Zales 
Sans aucun doute, par tout les moyens
Si le rap était un jean serré, je pourrais rien faire dedans
J'écarterai les coutures du jean quand je déballerai mes schémas
Lequel veut vraiment dire, pas de "si", de "et" ou "mais" sont serrés dedans
Tu t'endors sur moi parce que tu baises seulement avec moi dans tes rêves
Pas même quand je suis sur mon lit de mort
Mec, j'ressens comme Ed, ce n'est pas encore l'heure de déposer le mic
Donc pourquoi devrais-je arrêter ?
La pensée que je devrais arrêter quand j'suis mort
Vient juste de me traverser l'esprit
Je l'ai dit, puis j'ai oublié ce que j'ai dit
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Personne n'est aussi froid que moi, Jm'habille trop frais, trop propre
Tu peux me trouver dans ma voiture de luxe, portant du Fendi
Mec, tu vois ce que je veux dire
Brillant, poignets avec des pierres dessus, Buscemis avec un cadenas dessus
Partout où je pose ma voix, cette merde perce, n'est-ce pas ?
Saga Balenciaga, Jsuis dans Bergdorf entrain crâner
C'est juste un autre episode, mes michto, je les spoile
Elle aime ce qui vole et j'aime acheter n'importe quoi
Merde, j'ai de l'argent bêtement, qu'est-ce que je peux faire d'autre avec cet oseille
Salope, On va aller crâner dehors, le roi te rapporte 50 bouteilles
Ce soir, on va faire péter le chequier, pense au conséquence demain
La soirée va être dingue, on va être super chaud
Mec, j'balance de vrais faits, c'est juste comment on ambiance ça
Demain, on va se reposer jusqu'à qu'on soit sobre
Puis c'est l'heure de recommencer, et ça repart encore !
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, Ayy
Tu sais que c'est pas mon heure pour m'arrêter là
J'suis enfermé dans le rap et j'suis déjà payé
Mais c'est à partir du moment tu te souviens du nom
Ayy, AyyI stare at my reflection in the mirror
Why am I doing this to myself?
Losing my mind on a tiny error
I nearly left the real me on the shelf
No
Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Brushing my hair
Do I look perfect?
I forgot what to do to fit the mold
The more I try
The less it's working
Yeah
When everything inside me screams
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Yeah
Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Fake shows, egos
Fake shows like woah
And leave me alone
Real talk, real life
Good love, goodnight
With a smile
Thats my home
Thats my home
Thats my home
Don't lose who you are
In the blur of the stars
Seeing is deceiving
Dreaming is believing
It's okay not to be okay
Sometimes it's hard
To follow your heart
Tears don't mean you're losing
Everybody's bruising
Just be true to who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are, who you are
Who you are, who you are...

1738 1738 got a sack for us to roll 1738I heard that you're settled down
That you found a girl and you’re married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead, yeah
You'd know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue uninvited
But I couldn’t stay away, I couldn’t fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you’d be reminded that for me it isn't over, yet
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead" Yeah
Nothing compares
No worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they’re memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you, too
Don't forget me, I beg
I remember you said
"Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead"
Sometimes it lasts in love
But sometimes it hurts instead.YeahWhen the rain is blowing in your face
And the whole world is on your case
I could offer you a warm embrace
To make you feel my love
When the evening shadows and the stars appear
And there is no one there to dry your tears
I could hold you for a million years
To make you feel my love
I know you haven’t made your mind up yet
Though I could never do you wrong
I’ve known it from the moment that we met
Deep down in my heart’s where you belong
I’d go hungry; I’d go black and blue
And I’d go crawling down the avenue
No, there is nothing that I wouldn’t do
To make you feel my love
The winds are blowing on the rolling sea
And on the highway of regret
The winds of change are blowing wild and free
You ain’t seen nothing like me yet
I could make you happy, make your dreams come true
There is nothing that I would not do
Go to the ends of the Earth for you
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my love
To make you feel my loveShock, horror, I'm down
Lost, you're not around
There's a lump in my chest
That sends cold through my head, and
My mind shuts sound out
I'm on auto-pilot
And my tongue's gone silent
Just switch it off and lay it down
Lay it down next to me
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you and I miss you
These words mean nothing to me
I'm just sitting on a fence of how it used to be
These three words are aching
Constrict them- suffocating
My mind is racing
With the picture I'm painting
And my belly's sick to it's stomach
When I remember all the times he was with you when you laid it down
You lay down next to me
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you
More than I let on
I kissed you
Far too long
I'll let go as soon as you do
See I know we're not through
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe when I made you mine, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss you, that I miss you, whoa-oh-oh-oh
I don't know when I lost my mind
Maybe it was every time
That you said, you said, you said
That I miss youI met this girl late last year
She said don't you worry if I disappear
I told her I'm not really looking for another mistake
I called an old friend thinking that the trouble would wait
But then I jump right in
A week later returned, I reckon she was only looking for a lover to burn
But I gave her my time for two or three nights
Then I put it on pause 'til the moment was right
I went away for months until our paths crossed again
She told me I was never looking for a friend
Maybe you could swing by my room around 10
Baby bring a lemon and a bottle of gin
We'll be in between the sheets 'til the late AM
Baby if you wanted me then you should've just said
She's singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
For a couple weeks I
Only want to see her
We drink away the days with a take-away pizza
Before a text message was the only way to reach her
Now she's staying at my place and loves the way I treat her
Singing out Aretha
All over the track like a feature
And never wants to sleep, I guess that I don't want to either
But me and her we make money the same way
Four cities, two planes the same day ah
Those shows have never been what it's about
But maybe we'll go together and just figure it out
I'd rather put on a film with you and sit on the couch
But we should get on a plane
Or we'll be missing it now
I wish I'd have written it down
The way that things played out
When she was kissing him how
I was confused about
She should figure it out while I'm sat here singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
On my hotel door
I don't even know if she knows what for
She was crying on my shoulder
I already told ya
Trust and respect is what we do this for
I never intended to be next
But you didn't need to take him to bed that's all
And I never saw him as a threat
Until you disappeared with him to have sex of course
It's not like we were both on tour
We were staying on the same fucking hotel floor
And I wasn't looking for a promise or commitment
But it was never just fun and I thought you were different
This is not the way you realise what you wanted
It's a bit too much, too late if I'm honest
All this time God knows I'm singing
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
That heart is so cold
All over my home
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
These girls ain't loyal
That heart is so cold
This girl ain't loyal
Ah lah
Don't fuck with my love
I told her she knows
Take aim and reload
I don't wanna know that babe
Ah lahmlahlah
Shorty get down, good Lord
Baby got 'em open all over town
Strictly biz she don't play around
Cover much grounds
Got game by the pound
Getting paid is her forte
Each and every day true player way
I can't get her outta my mind 
I think about the girl all the time
East side to the west side
Push your fat rides it's no surprise
She got tricks in the stash
Stacking up the cash
Quick when it comes to the gas
By no means average
She's on when she's got to have it
Baby you're a perfect 10
I wanna get in
Lemmi get down so I can win, sing it
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
I got to bag it up 
I like the way you work it 
Top Dogg, bite em all, yeah we burning shit up
D-P-G-C now we turning shit up

And when they bang this in the club baby you got to get up
Thug dealers drug dealers yeah we livin it up
My life, yo' life, boy we livin it up
Takin chances while we dancin in the party fo' sho'
Slip my hoe a forty-fo' and she got in the back do'
Bitches lookin at me strange but you know I don't care
Step up in this motherfucker just a-swangin my hair
Bitch quit talkin, quick walk if you down with the set
Take a bullet and take it down with this jet
Out of town, put it down for the Father of Rap
And if yo' ass get cracked, bitch shut yo' trap
Now get back, come back that's the part of success
If you believe in the S you'll be relievin your stress

You know I'm mobbin with the D-O-double-G
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girls looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Play on, play on, play on
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
Damn that girl looks good
Heyo heyo heyo heyoooooo
I met you when I was a teen
But then you were one as well
And I could play a guitar
Just like ringing a bell
Sometimes I wonder
In any other summer could you have been my part time lover
To me listening to Stevie Wonder
Under the covers where we used to lay
And re: stacks is what the speakers played
I'd be on tour almost every day
When I was home up in my flat is where we used to stay
Just watching the DVD, smoking illegal weed
Getting high as two kites when we needed to breathe
We used each other's air just for the people to see
And stayed up all night like when we needed to sleep
We'd go anywhere, our minds would take us
And I said you are beautiful without your make-up
And you don't even need to worry about your weight cause
We can all be loved the way that God made us
And time's the only reason that we could break up
Cause you would always tell me I'm away too much
Distance is relative to the time that it takes to get on a plane
Or make a mistake, say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
Now
And every weekend in the winter
You'd be wearing my hoodie
With draw strings pulled tight
To keep your face from the cold
Taking day trips to the local
Where we'd eat on our own
Cause every day when I was away
We'd only speak on the phone
Watching Blue Planet
Creating new habits
Then as if we were two rabbits
And then you'd vanish back to the burrow with all the Celtics
I disappear
You call me selfish, I understand
But I can't help it
I put my job over everything
Except my family and friends
But you'll be in between forever
So I guess we'll have to take a step back
Overlook the situation
Cause mixing business and feelings will only lead to complications
And I'm not saying we should be taking a break
Just re-evaluating quick before we make a mistake and it's too late
So we can either deal with the pain or wait to get on the plane
But in a day we'll have to say it again
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
But then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me both Nina
Uh won't you leave me now
Now
Love will come and love will go
But you can make it on your own
Sing that song, go, oh won't you leave me now
People grow, and fall apart
But you can mend your broken heart
Take it back, go, oh won't you leave me now
Oh Nina
You should go Nina
'Cause I ain't never coming home
Nina oh, won't you leave me now
And I've been living on the road Nina
And then again you should know Nina
Cause that's you and me
Both in a road, won't you leave me now
NowCome on, skinny love, just last the year
Pour a little salt, we were never here
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Staring at the sink of blood and crushed veneer
I tell my love to wreck it all
Cut out all the ropes and let me fall
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Right in the moment this order's tall
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And in the morning I'll be with you
But it will be a different kind
And I'll be holding all the tickets
And you'll be owning all the fines
Come on skinny love, what happened here?
Suckle on the hope in light brassieres
My, my, my, my, my, my, my, my
Sullen load is full, so slow on the split
And I told you to be patient
And I told you to be fine
And I told you to be balanced
And I told you to be kind
And now all your love is wasted
And then who the hell was I?
And I'm breaking at the britches
And at the end of all your lines
Who will love you?
Who will fight?
Who will fall far behind?The club isn't the best place to find a lover
So the bar is where I go
Me and my friends at the table doing shots
Drinking fast and then we talk slow
Come over and start up a conversation with just me
And trust me I'll give it a chance now
Take my hand, stop, put Van the Man on the jukebox
And then we start to dance, and now I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
One week in we let the story begin
We're going out on our first date
You and me are thrifty, so go all you can eat
Fill up your bag and I fill up a plate
We talk for hours and hours about the sweet and the sour
And how your family is doing okay
Leave and get in a taxi, then kiss in the backseat
Tell the driver make the radio play, and I'm singing like
Girl, you know I want your love
Your love was handmade for somebody like me
Come on now, follow my lead
I may be crazy, don't mind me
Say, boy, let's not talk too much
Grab on my waist and put that body on me
Come on now, follow my lead
Come, come on now, follow my lead
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
And last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Oh—I—oh—I—oh—I—oh—I
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of you
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with the shape of you
We push and pull like a magnet do
Although my heart is falling too
I'm in love with your body
Last night you were in my room
And now my bedsheets smell like you
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Come on, be my baby, come on
Come on, be my baby, come on
I'm in love with your body
Every day discovering something brand new
I'm in love with the shape of youI'm not a rapper I'm a singer with a flow
I've got a habit for spitting quicker lyrics you know
You'll find me ripping the written out of the pages they sit in
I never want to get bitten
'Cause plagiarism is hidden
Watch how I sit on the rhythm
Prisoner with a vision
Signs of a label
But didn't listen to any criticism
Thought you knew but you didn't
So perk your ears up and listen
Studio is a system
And you could say that I'm driven
And now it's onto the next saga
We drink the best lager
I'll never try to win you over like your stepfather
I do my own thing now
And get respect after
And I'm avoiding the 'caine
Like it was Get Carter
For four years I never had a place to stay
But it's safe to say that it kept me grounded
Like a paper weight
At 16 years old yeah I moved out of my home
I was Macy Gray I tried to say goodbye and I choked
Went from sleeping at a subway station
To sleeping with a movie star
And adding to the population
Not my imagination
I don't wanna relax
Would it hurt your reputation if I put it on wax?
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
I take it back with the rhythm and blues
With my rap pack I'll be singing the news
Tryna act like Jack Black
When I bring it to school
I make a beat with my feet
By just hittin' the loop
Bringing the lyrics to prove
That I can fit in these shoes
I give you the truth through the vocal booth
And stars burst out on the scene
Like an opal fruit
They try to take aim like Beckham when he goes to shoot
But then again that's what they're supposed to do
And I'm supposed to be calm
I tattooed the lyrics onto my arm
Whispering everything that happens
Is from now on
I'll be ready to start again
By the end of the song
This is like claiming I handled it wrong
But then I've never had an enemy
Except the NME but I'll be selling
Twice as many copies as their magazines'll ever be
With only spectacles ahead of me
And festival fees are healthier than a Dalmatian on Pedigree
Singing for the masses rubber dingied rapids
I keep this rapping a habit and keep on fashioning magic
I'm battling for respect and I don't know if I have it
This song's from the heart cover the planet
I take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
And take it back now
Now I don't ever wanna be perfect
'Cause I'm a singer that you never wanna see shirtless
And I accept the fact that someone's got to win worst dressed
Taking my first steps into the scene giving me focus
Putting on a brave face like Timothy Dalton
Considering a name change thinking it was hopeless
Rhyming over recordings, avoiding tradition
'Cause every day some lyrics and a melody could be written
Now absence can make your heart ache
But drinking absinthe can change your mind state
Vividly need to let my liver be
And I'll say it again living life on the edge with a close handful of friends
Is good advice from the man that took his life on the road with me
And I hope to see him blowing up globally
'Cause that's how it's supposed to be
I'm screaming out vocally
It might seem totally impossible achieving life's dreams
But, but I just write schemes
I'm never having a stylist giving me tight jeans
Madison Square Garden is where I might be
But more likely
You find me
In the back room of a dive bar with my mates
Having a pint with McDaid
Discussing records we made
And every single second knowing
That we'll never betray
The way we were raised
Remembering our background
Sat down
That's how we plan it out
It's time to take it back now
Mmmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
Mmm come on and take it back, love
Come on and take it back for us
Don't you fade into the back, love
No
My dreams keep me awake at night
Written in rhymes, 'til I deliver the hype
Am I just living the lie
With this you must know that the number's just sold whoa
Will keep me going through the tough times, dream with me
We forget 90 per cent of it when we wake
But the other 10 per cent it never fades
Dreaming dreams, day to day goals
Stay awake loads, try to make the cut like the
Paper or razor blade, oh, never give up
And just remember just to hold out more
A couple years ago
I couldn't just control that thought
You'd find me buskin' on the street
When it was cold outdoors
And now I'm sweating on the stage of a sold out tour
Writing love songs for the sake of it
Never to make a hit
You can't fake talent and work ethic just to make it quick
I'm not a rapper I'm a singer, I just take the piss and
Most of these other guys are kids that Pulses
Little sister has to babysit, that's just the way it is
Dreams you own, just set your goals
And have the utmost faith in it; tread your own path
You'll never make it as a follower, you'll never know
Where you will go or where you will be tomorrow rhaThe club isn't the best place to find a lover

As her warm breath starts to blow
She will for the spring like she's a domino
By his sides, she begins to glowOh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Leaves have fallen to the ground
And now there's no one else around
To hear the cry
Oh oh
I saw your body
I saw your face
Loss of presence
Loss of grace
Behind those eyes
Oh oh
And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
Oh oh
I miss your laughter
I miss your tears
I miss your rambling
About your fears
Your smile
The crowd has gathered
All around
No ones speaking
No one makes a sound
And I...
And we break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
Alone
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
Alone
Alone now...
They're never gonna change you
They're never gonna change me
They're never gonna change us
We'll always stay the same
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
We break down
We lose touch
Sometimes
We are
AloneIn hotel rooms far away from home
I miss you, more than you will know
Shine a light
Just one side
To think again
That your mine
It's high time
I'm far away from home
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Oh I need you, without you I'll fall apart
And last winter, I need you to feed my heart
But all the night
Sky blue
Stars are bright
Shine through
Like you
And I'm far away from home
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down
Tell me that there's no where left to land
And I'll fall down
Catch me with the strength of your own hands
And I'll fall down

Just to trip straight back in
Times like this don’t come round here
And chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
Love stole my sympathy
When she belonged to him
But now I will feel the soft touch of her lips again
But chances are slim
But eventually
You’ll be mine
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see, is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love
It won't grow back
She said it's time for a quick cigarette by the bike shed
She asked me if I’d regret it all and I said
I replied no love this about as far as it goes
See me going by the thought of you and it shows
She said you weren’t even listening
I might be too much right now man it’s sickening
Can’t believe I’m running from her
I’m stranded, her beauty is too much to bear
And oh I think I want her
And oh I swear she’s never been deep in before
And oh I think I need her
I can’t tell her I want her it's not right in summer
I think that I need her
I won’t miss a thing
If you’re mine
I don’t care if you’re lost
Cause in our hearts we both know that
We both know that
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
All I see is you
And I miss this
And we can't see this through
We can’t fix this
Love, it won't grow back
Your love hit me like a punch in the nose
Baby your love deals the hardest blowsI’m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed it
And I rang you up to check how you’ve done
And your eyes shine like gold from the sun to me
And I hear that you have messed it all up again
I’ll be right there to catch you
Like I’m gonna catch this train
And I’ll always be here you know
I will love your smile and love your way
As long as you can let it show
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
It’s a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I can’t wait
And she can’t drive yet
But she can drive me to a point of mental craze
And she will wind me up
She’s the sort of girl that keeps you hanging on and on for days
And I
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in a crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
It’s a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I can’t wait
Broken hearted
I’ve departed
To a place I feel more comfortable
And I belong here
Don’t shed no tear
Just remember I’ll be back again
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
Am I lost or stuck
These females don’t give up
I guess my dumb luck
For getting shot down in the crossfire
All that I can say
Is I’ll walk away
Its a game they play
If I’m shot down in the crossfire
I’m so tired today
Was meant to catch that train
From Fulham Broadway but I missed itYou've got scars on your body and your soul
Bruises on your back now
Broken heart with nowhere to go
Living in a high-rise flat
Torn apart, so keep on keeping it together
Nothing is forever you know
You can start again like this, like this
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
You can never be alone if you're bleeding with the skyline
Waiting for the right time
When the night's already gone
It's been travelling without your mind now
Let it let go and fuel you
Like petrol you find so much
Beauty in what makes you mental
Your friends know it's only
A state of mind, you're only getting by
By always getting high that's why
Now I see blood in the sky
Blood in my eyesight
And everything's turning to red
So we'll beat it away, colour the nightlife
And light me up, burn me today
I'm seeing blood in the skyline
Stuck in the right mind
Afraid again to leave any dream
And replace it with anything better
So get up
And take away your scars
I can take away your scars
I can take away your scarsLoving can hurt, loving can hurt sometimes
But it's the only thing that I know
When it gets hard, you know it can get hard sometimes
It's the only thing that makes us feel alive
We keep this love in a photograph
We made these memories for ourselves
Where our eyes are never closing
Our hearts were never broken
And time's forever frozen, still
So you can keep me
Inside the pocket of your ripped jeans
Holding me close until our eyes meet
You won't ever be alone
And if you hurt me, that's okay baby
Only words bleed inside these pages
You just hold me
And I won’t ever let you go
Wait for me to come home
Loving can heal, loving can mend your soul
And it's the only thing that I know
I swear it will get easier, remember that with every piece of ya
And it's the only thing to take with us when we die
Oh you can fit me
Inside the necklace you got when you were sixteen
Next to your heartbeat where I should be
Keep it deep within your soul
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
Wait for me to come home
When I'm away, I will remember how you kissed me
Under the lamppost back on Sixth street
Hearing you whisper through the phone
Wait for me to come homeTell me that you'll turn down the man
Who asks for your hand
Cause you're waiting for me
And I know, you're gonna be away a while
But I've got no plans at all to leave
And would you take away my hopes and dreams?
And just stay with me
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
Take my hand and my
Heart and soul, I will
Only have these eyes for you
And you know, everything changes but
We'll be strangers if we see this through
You could stay within these walls and bleed
Or just stay with me, oh Lord now
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only one
Stumbling half drunk, getting myself lost
I am so gone, so tell me the way home
I listen to sad songs, singing about love
And where it goes wrong
All my senses come to life
While I'm stumbling home as drunk as I
Have ever been and I'll never leave again
Cause you are the only one
And all my friends have gone to find
Another place to let their hearts collide
Just promise me, you'll always be a friend
Cause you are the only oneOh misty eye of the mountain below
Keep careful watch of my brothers' souls
And should the sky be filled with fire and smoke
Keep watching over Durin's sons
If this is to end in fire, then we should all burn together
Watch the flames climb high into the night
Calling out father oh, stand by and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
And if we should die tonight, we should all die together
Raise a glass of wine for the last time
Calling out father oh, prepare as we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
Oh, should my people fall then surely I'll do the same
Confined in mountain halls, we got too close to the flame
Calling out father oh, hold fast and we will
Watch the flames burn auburn on the mountain side
Desolation comes upon the sky
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
And I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
And I hope that you remember me
And if the night is burning, I will cover my eyes
For if the dark returns then my brothers will die
And as the sky's falling down it crashed into this lonely town
And with that shadow upon the ground I hear my people screaming out
Now I see fire, inside the mountain
I see fire, burning the trees
I see fire, hollowing souls
I see fire, blood in the breeze
I see fire 
I see fire 
I see fire
And I see fire burn auburn on the mountainsideWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in the snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, raincoat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause she's just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyes and hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since 18
But lately, her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
And we're all under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple of grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
Or sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Fly, fly
For angels to fly
To fly, to fly
For angels to dieIt's late in the evening
Glass on the side
I've been sat with you
For most of the night
Ignorin' everybody here
We wish they would disappear
So maybe we could get down now
And I don't wanna know
If you're gettin' ahead of the program
I want you to be mine, lady
To hold your body close
Take another step into the no-man's land
And for the longest time, lady
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
This love is ablaze, I saw flames from the side of the stage
And the fire brigade comes in a couple of days
Until then, we got nothin' to say and nothin' to know
But somethin' to drink and maybe somethin' to smoke
Let it go until our roads are changed
Singin' "We Found Love" in a local rave
No, I don't really know what I'm supposed to say
But I can just figure it out, then hope and pray
I told her my name, then said "It's nice to meet you"
Then she handed me a bottle of water filled with tequila
I already know if she's a keeper
Just from this one small act of kindness, I'm in
Deep shit if anybody finds out
I meant to drive home but I drunk all of it now
Not soberin' up, we just sit on the couch
One thing led to another, now she's kissin' my mouth
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
SING!
LOUDER!
SING!
Can you feel it?
All the guys in here don't even wanna dance
Can you feel it?
All that I can hear is music from the back
But can you feel it?
Found you hidin' here so won't you take my hand, darlin'?
Before the beat kicks in again
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
SING!
I need you darling
Come on, set the tone
If you feel you're fallin'
Won’t you let me know
LOUDER!
SING!
If you love me
Come on, get involved
Feel it rushin' through you
From your head to toe
LOUDER!
SING!I'm gonna pick up the pieces
And build a Lego house
If things go wrong we can knock it down
My three words have two meanings
There's one thing on my mind
It's all for you
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep
Me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm gonna paint you by numbers
And colour you in
If things go right we can frame it and put you on a wall
And it's so hard to say it but I've been here before
Now I'll surrender up my heart
And swap it for yours
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
Don't hold me down
I think my braces are breaking, and it's more than I can
Take
And it's dark in a cold December, but I've got you to keep
Me warm
If you're broken I will mend you and I'll keep you sheltered
From the storm that's raging on now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of sight, I'm out of mind
I'll do it all for you in time
And out of all these things I've done I think I love you
Better now
I'm out of touch, I'm out of love
I'll pick you up when you're getting down
And out of all these things I've done I will love you better
NowWhite lips, pale face
Breathing in snowflakes
Burnt lungs, sour taste
Light's gone, day's end
Struggling to pay rent
Long nights, strange men
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
Ripped gloves, rain coat
Tried to swim and stay afloat
Dry house, wet clothes
Loose change, bank notes
Weary-eyed, dry throat
Call girl, no phone
And they say
She's in the class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately
Her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
And they scream
The worst things in life come free to us
Cause we're just under the upper hand
And go mad for a couple grams
And she don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe she flies to the Motherland
And sells love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
An angel will die
Covered in white
Closed eyed
And hoping for a better life
This time, we'll fade out tonight
Straight down the line
And they say
She's in the Class A Team
Stuck in her daydream
Been this way since eighteen
But lately her face seems
Slowly sinking, wasting
Crumbling like pastries
They scream
The worst things in life come to free us
And we're all under the upper hand
Go mad for a couple grams
And we don't want to go outside tonight
And in a pipe we fly to the Motherland
And sell love to another man
It's too cold outside
For angels to fly
Angels to fly
To fly, fly
For angels to fly, to fly, to fly
Or angels to die
