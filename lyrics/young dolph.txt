Fuck bitches, fuck bitches, get the scrilla
Young hustla, these muthafuckin' niggas
Never trust a bitch nigga, get the scrilla
I don't fuck with these niggas 'cause they shady
These bitches they just wanna have my baby
Born in the 80's, crack baby
Mama, she was in the streets, so guess who raised me 
You muthafuckin' right
Couldn't get it from my mama, so I got it off the block
Been workin' my whole life, but I ain't never punched the clock 
9 years old I seen a nigga get shot, damn
Niggas quick to run their mouth when they get jammed
Pussy ass nigga telling on his own fam 
Same nigga that you break your neck for
Be the same nigga that cross you out and wet you up
'pposed to be chasin' money, but you chasin' bitches
Real bosses don't talk, we just sit back and listen
Stack that paper up, and then make boss moves
She like to argue so I sent that bitch to law school
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what 
Same bitch that claim she love you she'll set you up 
Out here in these streets it ain't no such thing as love 
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs 
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak
If that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech 
I ain't got shit for a nigga
Ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free 
Zay got the muthafuckin' bass thumpin, Dolph got the muthafuckin' trap jumpin
Doors to the trap open, I'll sell you something
Hell nah, don't ask, I ain't frontin' nothing
I fucked yo bitch then told her, "I'll see you around!"
Dolph just skipped town with 2 hunnit thou'
Dolph just poured an 8 in a two liter pop
They say Dolph addicted to these streets just like his pops
Addicted to hustlin', I can't stop 
Won't stop , can't stop 
Never hear me complaining 'bout what I ain't got
Cause if I want it, I'ma go get it
Free my nigga Yo Diddy
Got Paper Route tatted on yo ho titty
Same nigga you gettin' high with he really yo enemy
Everyday niggas cross they patnas out for Benjamins
Keep it real with your dawg no matter what 
Same bitch that claim she love you she'll set you up 
Out here in these streets it ain't no such thing as love 
The only thing I trust is this pistol and these slugs 
Real nigga shit, only what I do and speak, if that nigga don't work, he a fuckin' leech 
I ain't got shit for a nigga, ain't nothing in this muthafuckin' world free Zaytoven

Ask every bad bitch in Memphis they gon' tell you that he smoke the best weed 
And he got the sack 
That lil' nigga can't pull up like me

When you from where I'm from you look up to Craig Petties
Trappin' out a four door, Bordervilles and Box Chevies
I might score a hundred just to turn into a Bentley
If that traphouse boomin' you can probably catch me in it, ayy
You ain't got the money and you wanna get fronted
Okay leave your mama address and her phone number
Shut the spot down, switch it up, we been doin' numbers
Cut my bitch off then lost fifty pounds, that's bad karma
Smoked a blunt off lemon tree and ate fish and grits
Gave her a quarter mil and she jumped on the plane at six
Everything went smooth, I treat my salad up my wrist
All I think is hustling even when I take a piss
Couple hundred thousand in a shoebox
And I got a couple choppers in my toolbox
Dope boy, all white, party on the yacht 
Man this shit too good to be true, I need to stop, ayy

On Monday my phone going crazy taking orders

I'm the man in California, half a million to my lawyers

Masked up, then you got a better chance of living
'Cause if I'm barefaced kid, it's according to how I'm feeling
All my life I want a million, but I will accept a brick or board
Shot up a nigga's house mane for tryna sneak your boy
I'm blacker than a Reese's, cat too you mesces
Moving lames out the way, this draco telekinesis
Hustle 'til I'm dead, the money never ceases
Revolver to his skull, his drawers smell like feces
Black girl mixed would never hold keys to a tepees
Smokin' on my peace pipe while on her knees-es
Talkin' work over the phone like talkin' to police-s
Get indicted, need a bitch out here with knee  like 
Slick moves with the sick jewels
Foreign rides make your bitch choose
With a pimp, cruise through the neighborhood
I wish a nigga would, I'm pullin up that Berner
AK-47, and I'm unload the burner

Reflection of my parents
4th grade when I called my teacher a HOE!
Yeah, that's when shit got real
Grandma came got me said
"Fuck yo momma house this is where you live!
You don't talk back or you get slapped
You a fuckin' Child you don't pay bills"
Where I would be without Ida Mae
Only lord knows

Grew up on the same bed we
Used to fight each other
He the only nigga in the world
That Know my whole my whole struggle
Hell yeah nigga that's my big cuz
He was with me when I flew and went
Got my first plug
Started countin' too much money
And started druggin' hard
Swear to God it fell like its a curse on me and my boys!
My patna fell asleep hit the pole and mt patna died
Couple months later I fell asleep drivin' to the Chi
Final Destination Lord this can't be my last ride
Six years later we flipped ova again nd we still alive!

Made my first 6 figures off of drugs with her
Smoking weed with the robbers, sipping syrup with killas
Sunday morning I'm in church but I'm a drug dealer
This relationship that we share is unbreakable
Your spot bitch you got in my heart is irreplaceable
Grandma tried her best to get me to stay away from you
Remember when I got locked and I caught my first case with you
You taught these fuck niggas and shaste bitches that's why my mothafucking trigga finger always itchin'
They want me to leave you alone since I started rapping
Dolph saying goodbye to the streets that would never happen
For real
Its like no matter what I do
Where I go
What I'm doing
Whereever I'm met
Across the country doing shows
Fucking bad hoes
Always wanna go back to the trap
Amen, damn
I love the streets that's why I'm fucking up in high school

On the old school  nigga trunk slaming
In the streets you can be a ho
In these streets you can be a boss
You wanna be a hood nigga you gotta make a choice
Either selling hard nigga or your playing sports
Ain't no diploma in these streets just mo' drama
Side bitches who ain't shit jelous baby mamas
I done made it out the streets thank god I started rapping
But those streets are still in me damn i miss trapping

Wish my grandma was here
Just so I could tell her I'm sorry
Sorry for having all of them pounds of weed in your gardens
Now I get 30 just to walk in and turn up and party
When there wasn't no more room I slept on the floor
Bitch I just hit the strip club, threw some stacks on the floor
Hey, I just cut the lights on when I walked in the door
Quarter milly worth of ice, just look how it glow

Straight out the trap but I never ever touch the brick
The same way I never ever trust a bitch
I ring before my ball, worst 6 digits every time they call

Poured too much syrup by mistake because I'm heavy-handed
Bitch, I'm the plug best friend, you just a middleman 
I don't fuck with them niggas, I'm cut from a different cloth 
Ask your CEO and your rap friends why they hate Dolph

Nigga, get off your ass if you plan to be rich!Brooklyn's Finest
My lawyer says to me
That it's considered a felony
Which means I broke parole
So before I go in front of the judge
He says that this is not a simple case of right and wrong
But righter and wronger
Because the defendant had to break the law...
..to protect his own lifeRemember I ain't have shit, and I was suffering
But now that dirty money got me living luxury
Working 3 plugs got me living lovely
Your baby mama say that she can't get enough of me
She say her nigga fuck her good, but he ain't rough as me

Everytime I fuck your bitch, she busting 3
I got 2 hoes with me like 3's company
Counting money till I'm tired, you know what's up with me
In the club sipping syrup and pouring out bubbly

On the road getting it, I'm in the air flyin'
And I be doing like this getting money was a crime

Didn't have to, but you took me in like I was you own
No momma, no daddy, raised by my granny
Used to ask me who my momma, and I would say 
You learned me like a son, when I was just a grim baby
I ain't been to church in a while, chasing 's lady
I hate that shit cause I know that ain't how you raised me
Dragged my knees to the floor, and get them all greasy
When I was 12 years old, I started smoking weed
When I was 15, that's when I start running the streets
A little after that I knocked up a couple G's
But at the same time, made you disappointed in me
The worst day of my life, I made my grandma cry
Lord, can you please tell her I apologize
Every time I think about it, I get the water eyes
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry momma, I apologize
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I'm sorry momma, I apologize
Lord please, if you can hear me
Can you please tell my grandma I'm sorry for all the trouble
And tell her that I remember everything
That she taught me, and taught me, and I love her
Life's been hard, but in 2008 when you got sick
I swear to God, it got rougher
Remember walking out the hospital, every night
Praying to God, please don't let her suffer
She raised her kids and grandkids, she didn't deserved it
To see the lady who raised you, like they 
Blunt after blunt, with the water eyes
For everything, grandma, I apologize
The worst day of my life, I made my grandma cry
Lord, can you please tell her I apologize
Every time I think about it, I get the water eyes
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry momma, I apologize
I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I say I'm sorry grandma, I apologize
I'm sorry momma, I apologizeUsed to think life was all about money and reefer
