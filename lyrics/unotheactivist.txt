Ask me do I drip for real and I'll say, "That's a no-brainer"
I put my blood, sweat, and tears in, I just got back pain
I think I need to pop a Percocet for my back pain
Don't think you niggas got the message, just don't need a new friend

I swear these niggas not stamped like I haven't written on 'em
All of these memories inside my brain, and yes

I keep one in the head, think that's a smart investment
And even if I hit you once you part of my collection 
And when I look you in your eyes I see my reflection 
And I'm out just moving pies, trying not to get arrested
And if I bring you to this side it's 'cause I got a present
I gift you with my love and all of my affection

Close y'all mouths, nigga 
Thanks, Ugly God
Itty-mini ...Riding 'round in that drop-top going, "Zoom, zoom"
I can't trust no soul, I keep a tool, tool
At least I worry 'bout my every move, move
Riding 'round in that drop-top going, "Zoom, zoom"
I can't trust a soul, I keep that tool, tool
I just touched down, I'm not in the mood, mood
Beat her back in, baby go, "Ooh, ooh"
Yeah, I'm riding 'round with the top down going, "Zoom, zoom"
Free my niggas locked down, this for you, you
I can't put the cup down, man, who knew?
Might take a trip out to Vegas
I'm goin' up later
I'm servin' dope, I got babies
Brand new Chanel, the skin gator
Huh, I told you, I'm one of a kind
My trust is fucked up, I've been slimed
But this will not fuck up my mind
This will not fuck up my mind
I was like broke just the other day
I went down, grinded for seven days
'Cause in my mind it was one day
I would count up on a Sunday
My bitch accusing me of fornication
Baby girl, that ain't up for debate
Need some time to focus on my situation
I don't think that you would understand
Baby, I think that's an understatement
And before you talk back I need better rating
Need my money to stack up to Heaven's gate
Leave you no time, never late
Need to spend all my time meditating
So I sit back and focus on reputation
Riding 'round in that drop-top going, "Zoom, zoom"
I can't trust a soul, I keep that tool, tool
I just touched down, I'm not in the mood, mood
Beat her back in, baby go, "Ooh, ooh"
Yeah, I'm riding 'round with the top down going, "Zoom, zoom"
Free my niggas locked down, this for you, you
I can't put the cup down, man, who knew? 
Rachet lil' bitch, she look like new-new
New hundreds, looking like Blue's Clues
Brand new Tesla, coming soo-oon
Nigga stay ass, paying for view-ews
Ain't no stressing
Oh, baby, I'm a blessing
Thirty on my necklace
Bad mood like Gretchen
On your block like Tetris
I don't fuck with my exes
Get a sack, I'm flexing
You can meet me at the Westin
Riding 'round in that drop-top going, "Zoom, zoom"
I can't trust a soul, I keep that tool, tool
I just touched down, I'm not in the mood, mood
Beat her back in, baby go, "Ooh, ooh"
Yeah, I'm riding 'round with the top down going, "Zoom, zoom"
Free my niggas locked down, this for you, you
I can't put the cup down, man, who knew? Yeah 
Yeah
Walked inside this bitch and I was like, "Yeah"

So I just hit that nigga wit' a coin flip
Hold on baby, why your ass ain't come back?
I wanna fuck, don't you be so upset
Bentley truck wit' the ice on your neck
She stuck in love, I'm just stuck in her neck
Big racks, big ice, that's it

So many cars you don't know what I'm in
I'm like, "Tell a friend, go tell a friend" 
Baby, bring a friend, go bring your friend
I want, yeah, I want all of them 
Baby, what's your Twitter, I might follow them

Very rare drip from Riccardo Tisci

Trying to fuck on my ho, lil' nigga, keep caution
I'm a boss in the Rolls, it came with a chauffeur
Came with some green, like Celtics, like Boston
All the big booty hoes, tell 'em back it up
Throwing my cash to the ground, tell 'em, "Rack it up"
Count it up, count it up, add it up

Diamonds on my wrist hit like old whiskey
Robbing all the banks in the town, cleaned empty
Robbing up the gang 'til the light three-sixty

Black and white diamonds like I'm Martin Luther King
Cheese just like feta, just 'bout to rearrange it
Something like the Punisher, I'm coming back with vengeance
Likе my bitch hair, know the clip got inches
Like my old bitch, boy, you bеtter keep your distance
Shoot him like a picture, get his body out the frame
Put the .40 to a nigga neck like chains
And my daddy taught me, "No pain, no gain"
The ratchet, I pop it, now the blood stained
I got your lil' ho kicking shit, Liu Kang
I count a lot a cash then I end up praying
If I said fuck a jug hit the court counting cameras
If she having cash, the pussy good, I'ma claim it
Big guns on me, you shouldn't test it now, I'm staying dangerous
I rap it, I rap it, I made it off of rapping
They mad I made it, I look at they reaction

I'm standing up on couches in the club, no manners
I am not the judge but it's time for the hammer
The bih' name Hannah
Molly Santana
I am not a monkey but the clip is a banana
Try to run away but the clip got range
Chief Keef, I'ma let it bang

She a real freak bitch, don't even know her real name
Real freak, nigga, tell me she don't want to know my name

Put a number on the tip of the chopper and let it rain
I ain't having no fun, I ain't playing no games
Yeah I know where you live, you will die where you lay
If I could I'd get my niggas out of prison today
She gon' fuck me real good 'cause she really like the Feng Shui
Maybe she's just lit off the Bombay
Real street nigga, before you look at me you look both ways
Keep heat on me like I'm in Miami with D. Wade
I'ma snipe him broad-day like my nickname Blade
And you know we at the top like a fucking toupee
I rap it, I rap it, I made it off of rapping
They mad I made it, I look at they reaction
I took her to hibachi, she eat it till it's sloppy
I pull up with some acid, I call it hippy magic

Ease up off the hinge, standing ovation like your knees they don't often bend it's time to cease one of your limbs
And these days they all pretend
I told my baby that we gon' always win, In this life of sin
Real recognize for the real make compromise

And I might just nickname him Marvin, leave him starving
Met her in the projects right at that tree where she carved out
Initials in that broken heart 'cause we fell all apart now
Geeking on Molly, can somebody come take this bar? Um
Just put my faith inside the Lord and he get me started
I think I'm harder than all these niggas going hard, um

Not new wave, I'm the ocean, swim ashore, um
So deep in that pussy I wanna float some more, um

I said, that's alright, baby, that's alright
I got Henny on ice, got Patron on ice
Bet she see me first night, want to fuck all night
I know you've been working hard
She say that she like nice shit
Baby, tell me, what is on your pallet?
I'm just trying to be on your necklace
Can I get a goodnight kiss?
Yeah, she say I heals
She a dirty dancer, Dirty Diana
Don't need no man, got both her her hands up
And so are my pants, had to pull my pants up
When the racks came in
Promise myself if she flaw I'll fuck her friend
And if she got them racks I might just fuck again
And you see me acting crazy, girl, pardon my man's
And I know you've been working hard
And I know you've been working hard
And these other hoes just acting hard
Don't know why these bitches being flaw
I said, that's alright, baby, that's alright
I got Henny on ice, got Patron on ice
Bet she see me first night, want to fuck all night
I know you've been working hard
Yeah, I know
And these niggas, they be capping, and these bitches some hoes
I cannot be no captain, I can not save a hoe
And I know you dig what I'm saying to you right now
Better know all my diamonds shining when the lights out
She gon' give me head, go waist-down
Hopping in my bed and we make sex sounds
She gon' put that ass up, face-down
And niggas, they be scared, they won't beef right now
And I promise they'd be dead if they beefed right now
And the diamonds in my wrist, they go like, "Bling, blow"
And she biting on my ear, I might let out a lil' "Ouch" 
And I know you've been working hard
And I know you've been working hard
And these other hoes just acting hard
Don't know why these bitches being flaw
I said, that's alright, baby, that's alright
I got Henny on ice, got Patron on ice
Bet she see me first night, want to fuck all night
I know you've been working hard

        Yeah, on the table, mm, mm
Fuck me on the table
Yeah, yeah, fuck me on the counter
Yeah, baby, fuck me on the floor, though 
Baby, fuck me in the bed, though 
Can I fuck you in the-
Huh
Can I fuck you on the table?
Yeah
Baby, where you going? Can you take me?
Pulled up on the block with your ho and she ate me
All these niggas walking 'round here like they hate me
Really, niggas mad 'cause they ain't me
Better hide your ho because ain't nobody safe
She a pretty bitch, hair laid, she gon' slay me
Already know fat ass, no baby
Fuck me in the bed, on the floor, on the table
Real nigga
Never scared to pull a trigger
Baby pulling up on me, pussy is revealing 
I can never save a ho because I am the villain
Got game, real court-side vision
The way she suck me, yeah, she fuck me up, I must admit it
Baby sliding in my DM, must have been a minute
I ain't even got no BM, I'ma keep it pimping
Baby, ride on this dick, mm, what a feeling
If I do double back, them I'm pussy killing
One strap, no, two strap, my cock never caught me slipping
And if I do fall over that then you know that I'm tripping
And if I do pull up at the door, we fuck 'til 6 AM
She just put that pink on my back like I'm Killer Cam
You ain't getting shit from me, bitch, I am not him
Sliding in that SRT quick with the top down
Welcome to my trap house, lil' bitch, do not make a sound
Baby, where you going? Can you take me?
Pulled up on the block with your ho and she ate me
All these niggas walking 'round here like they hate me
Really, niggas mad 'cause they ain't me
Better hide your ho because ain't nobody safe
She a pretty bitch, hair laid, she gon' slay me
Already know fat ass, no baby
Fuck me in the bed, on the floor, on the table

        Let's get it
Uno, I killed it
Yeah
Nigga, you know what I'm saying, niggas get picked off
So I show up with the stick
Show a nigga how it just hit
2 AM, ain't stopping at a red light, nigga, I ain't getting caught slipping 
Walked in the club, got a green light, blue light, red light, thought you know I risk it
Now I'm on the airplane with a deuce of the Hi-Tech and the frog eyes engine
Do it for 'em but they still locked up with no bond, they trust depending
I'm gon' burn that pussy lil' nigga that shot me, they saying they snitched on us
Boy, you a mark, shouldn't have talked, I'm 'bout to go call him up then kill shit
Looked him in his eyes and said it's barbeque or middle
Stop all of that fake shit 'cause the light always gon' reveal you
Putting on cream like a tissue
Why you wanna stop the momentum?
All the bricks the foundation that I'm building
Got shotguns, choppers, and pistols
 on riddles
And now my whole body like sickles
Yeah, it was hot like enter
I came back, I'm monumental
Had to change my environmental
Had to change my entire mental
I am not minor mental
I am the fireman
Gonna devour mentals
We here for a hour, you talking 'bout, "Think he's a wire man"
I am defiant
I come from where you draw down with no pencils
So I'm not buying it
Don't need no Malcolm up in the middle
Yeah
Nigga, you know what I'm saying, niggas get picked off
So I show up with the stick
Show a nigga how it just hit
2 AM, ain't stopping at a red light, nigga, I ain't getting caught slipping
Walked in the club, got a green light, blue light, red light, thought you know I risk it
Now I'm on the airplane with a deuce of the Hi-Tech and the frog eyes engine
Do it for 'em but they still locked up with no bond, they trust depending
I'm gon' burn that pussy lil' nigga that shot me, they saying they snitched on us
Boy, you a mark, shouldn't have talked, I'm 'bout to go call him up then kill shit
Yeah
Nigga, you know what I'm saying, niggas get picked off

Can you- can you smell it?
Ooh, yeah, I need a routine that's perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Water that I'm gon' surf in, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
From my instincts seen y'all from the beginning
Yeah, baby, I'm out this world, not from your local listings
I might fuck wit' a human girl but them hoes get mad 'cause I'm picky
Pistols be bullet pitching
These anal need a pricking
Ooh, yeah, the way that engine go, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Shotgun seat let down
Gotta buckle up them pounds
Don't try and even gun at my round
Come on, lil' bitch, sit down
Ooh, call your big homie up, I heard he mad 'cause we from out of town
Ooh, the way that juice tastes, God damn it
Uh, I've been a lil' stuck lately, ain't on you so, ho, don't panic
Uh, I ain't even seen my family but got phones like a micromanage
Huh, hope you don't feel too damaged
Yeah, hope you don't feel too damaged
The light hit my ice perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know I'm not perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know I'm no Earthling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, I need a spaceship that's perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Ooh, yeah, I need a routine that's perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Water that I'm gon' surf in, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, oh, yeah
Please be aware of where these niggas heads at
Like preacher, you said that
They want me to fall off like, "Where is my bread at?"
F&N wit' a airpack
We ain't even spare that
Trying to take a boy head off
I'm trying to be a young phenom and they wanna write me a subpoena
Like, boy, you must be dreaming, I think you'll finally feel demons
I swear, these niggas hate for no reason so I beat down your block screaming
Beat down the block beaming
In the Mazi and I'm speeding
The light hit my ice perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know I'm not perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
But I know I'm no Earthling, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Huh, I need a spaceship that's perfect, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm trying to tell you
I'm trying to tell you

        Walk inside the bando, had the birdies on the counter
Bitches water whipping like a fucking water fountain
Pull up in the Phantom, chopper hanging out the Phantom
Pull up in the Rolls, get ghost, Danny Phantom
Bitch, it's my way or the highway
She didn’t suck me up so I put her on the I-State 
Know I gotta re-up every Friday
My diamonds on the boat, the pistol coming with a silencer
Who the hell you niggas think you kidding? Got a gun under my bitches, I'ma send some bullets flying like a carpet
Moonrocks smelling like I farted
We the Dart Gang, steady looking for a target, hardly
Ay, really they your enemy
Hoe, wait, is you playing? Get the fuck out my vicinity
Really, she wore the suit acting like she got her virginity
I'ma fuck her for a long minute, I got energy
Shoutout to my niggas that be thugging out in Tennessee
Hoes, they call me plenty but I got me about ten to see
All these legs surrounding my body like a centipede
I done turned into a freak, don’t know what came into me
And all of this ice got me on chill, I think I'm sick
I done called three little pigs just for a brick
Nine millimeter, I tuck 'er, don't think I'm Chris
Ay, know what, I'ma drip
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dear Backwood, you're my one and only baby
When I be chiefing on them Honey Bourbons I be feeling so amazing
Gotta say it wit' your chest
Gotta feel it in your chest
When you smoking on the best
Gotta roll it in some shit that put your lungs to the test
How many motherfuckers got left?
How many motherfuckers got left?
In the motherfucking pack
Like, roll that motherfucking sack
Ay, put that motherfucking lighter up, ay, bring it back
Ay, blaze that shit
Dear Backwood, you’re my one and only baby
Don’t do the Swishers, I do Backwoods
Ay, nigga, fuck nigga, he know what's good
Gas on that shit up
Looked in my cup and it was mud
Fuck nigga, he don’t want it, I got killers
I got choppers on my hip, I let it rip if you get near us, nigga
And they calling us the winners
'Cause every time I sip I pop a pill, and pop a pill, and another
File my budget like Billy Gates
Uno, I'm dealing wit' bigger weight
The bitch, she don’t even know me, she look at my Rollie, she calling me bigger face
Never catch me in a bitch face
Only catch me when she topping off
I gave her mollies, she pop 'em off
She go through mollies like, pop 'em off, pop 'em off, pop 'em off
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Dear Backwood, you're my one and only baby
When I be chiefing on them Honey Bourbons I be feeling so amazing
Gotta say it wit' your chest
Gotta feel it in your chest
When you smoking on the best
Gotta roll it in some shit that put your lungs to the test
How many motherfuckers got left?
How many motherfuckers got left?
In the motherfucking pack
Like, roll that motherfucking sack
Ay, put that motherfucking lighter up, ay, bring it back
Ay, blaze that shit
