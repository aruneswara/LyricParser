Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why 
Phone ringin', never outgoin', homebody
Never outgoin', put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish addin' notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wideout, wideout
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off-kilter, off-kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gonna make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a deadhead zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't givin' up, you should set it off
Tell me “Time's up,” let the water run, let my body run
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why 
Said she wanna get high off a nigga
I wanna die durin' sex or religion
God and pussy only know my intentions
Waking on the tour bus then I'm swimmin'
You'd be hurtin' if you trust me but you isn't
Honestly, that's probably the right decision
Pick up, listen, if you wanna get rich
No sleep, how real bad man wake up
I found false hope in all kinda places
Hotel rooms and temporary feelings
I put my clothes on and try to check out
I try to hide from the sun, let it set now
Don't let God see me, I got a lot of demons
And I've been sleepin' with 'em
And now I'm tangled in the sheets and sinkin' deeper with 'em
I'm going deeper in it, find me drownin' in it
They said “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me “Do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or "Do you draw the line for when it's better days?”
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why
Who got the feelin'? Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why, tell me why 
Everything I have 
And everywhere I stand 
People don't make sense 
I'm hiding out, again, tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out, uh
I'm tryna figure it out, yeah
I'm tryna figure it out
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport for sure, all for a pretty sky
Everything you wear, I'll be the one to care
Softly, you braid your hair, all the angels stare, yeah
Tell me why, tell me why Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody help
Changed your mind when I changed my life, better start believin' in myself
And we all out lookin' for, lookin' for God so we never see it in ourself
Shit, divine intervention move in stealth
It's hard to tell what the prayer compelled
You can find me dancin' in between the raindrops
Tryna find a way to make the pain stop
Overtime, on the graveyard
Got a nigga feeling brainwashed
My instability's trademark
Copy-written in all my decisions
This is not supposed to be a way of livin'
Turned my temple down into a prison, shit
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
Yeah, back on Vincent with the braces on
Used to slide out the back without the neighbors knowin'
Pose for the picture with the pearly whites
Dead lens zoomin' in, catchin' all my strikes
Used to trade Jordan for some molly
And she gave me all I need for the night, forties suffice
Morally alright, but I need some advice
And I know that I'm actin' foolish
Chris would pick me up around noon-ish
Half a blunt, yeah, we coolin'
Twist it up, puttin' on OutKast
Hunnid, Texas heat, and yeah, we cruisin'
But when I love you right, I love you right
All by yourself
But I'll make it bright, baby, I want you to know
I'ma be there for you, I'ma make you see that
I want you, I want you
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? OhStripped down to my skin and my bones
I love huskies but I feel like a wolf 
In a pack but I feel all alone
I'm scatterbrained man, better offer the Clon'
In Tejas apartments with racists doin' weird shit
Like, this'll make the biopic 
Rile 'em up, hit Zaxby's, get the wing and tings 
Real quick bills still stacking to the ceiling 
What you mean, it ain't working? 
What you mean, you ain't finding yourself? 
What you mean, you ain't got no cash? 
What you mean? What you mean?
Shouldn't your pockets be big just like a fat chick? 
Shouldn't your mama be done paying the house off? 
Shouldn't you have a real big-ass ego? 
Shouldn't these girls be flockin' just like seagulls? 
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
The original lick-splickety, higher than Yosemite
Breaking the mold mentally, master with no limiting
Making 'em say "ugh!", they worshipping our force viciously
Watching the floor tip in your temple of authenticity
Often they say I’m off it, I offer my crossed empathy
They forgot what we on, I’ll remind 'em with hostility
Hot-diggity damn, everyone running scams
Gotta cover your clams and take another glance
Running a clinic, no scans, ain't no one claimin' yo mans
It's all pertaining to plan, call me the architect
Lap you in a UFO, I haven't started yet
Still gotta figure out exactly where to park it at
Moses with the pen, each line an ocean I can part it at
But that's too deep
Don't call me stupid
That ain't the way my name pronounced
Don't call me Cupid
I got too many hoes right now
Poolside in Houston
Tryna see if Beyoncé will take me for adoption
Broke-ass rich suburbs
A civilian shot in 3rd Ward, we just by the fountain
This is Merlyn Wood, man
Everywhere I go is The Woodlands
I need a honey-butter
Bodka in a Sprite can
When I'm in the Whataburger
All the kids know who I am
I need a honey-butter
Pouring lean in my Sprite can
Twistin' me up like licorice

Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed
I don't need nobody tryna give me shit
I got a record but I'm clean as they come
I'm Godzilla, when they see me, they run
On 37th, used to run from the Bloods
The undercovers gotta duck when they come
I moved out and in a couple of months
I'ma be a pop star, they call me a thug
I used to write raps on the back of the bus
Now I'm in the front seat shifting the gears
It's funny how things can change
Three hundred dollars to my name led to Hollywood
I was living off ramen and change
Five hundred dollars on these dinners, never have to pay
Growing up my teachers told me
"You better get them grades up if you wanna finish high school
And after high school, you better get a degree
'Cause it's a dog-eat-dog world, you could live in the street"
Flashback, I had my Walkman in the minivan
Listening to *NSYNC, saw my name on the CD
Bleach blond tips, wanted to be JT
Wanted to do big things, had to fulfill a dream
One might say I was doomed from the get-go
But those same people assume, 'cause they'll never know
What it's like to be called to what's not set in stone
I am one with the ebb and flow, that's all I know
Twistin' me up like licorice
Think I need someone who can handle it
Ice on my boys and my wrist is fixed

Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like Ruth, man
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence
Wake up like "shit" then I feel like the shit
So I guess I'm the shit
Yeah, guess I'm the shit

Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel on the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

Damn, damn, I'm frosty
Blood diamond, I'm flossing
Navy camo, I'm drowning
But you don't see what it cost me
Turmoil like the Saudi's, hand-me-downs never fit me
Party never fit me, punani never fit me
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', that's so Merlyn
That's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn, that's so Merlyn
Damn, time-travelin', Honda-swervin', book learnin'

Swan dive down the 405
Land at the bottom of El Toro High
With the precision of a cut from a Zoro knife
The boy spit like he made out of 409
So that's clean, bitch
You can't play with my team, bitch
We rock pink now on Wednesdays
Green looks good with your envy
Mix with white 'cause you salty but this stainless
I'm like platinum and it's painless
I just skip on the beat like I'm Pee-Wee Herman
Hands up for all my sermons
My wheel's turnin', now I'm more efficient than ever
I feel like Ratatouille when I'm whipping that cheddar
You see, you better find your thickest of sweaters
'Cause this ice might fuck around and change your whole life
'Cause we about to take flight
Keep a gold chain on my neck
Fly as a jet, boy, better treat me with respect

Keep a gold chain Me Ilamo Roberto y estamos buscando a Jaden Smith
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay; why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund a business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type?
Why don't you take that mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?"
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my head off, and
And my legs off, and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crackin’ sounds
Break, break, break the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack, crack, crack
Break the wheel, pack the steel, hold my niggas down
Twistin' on that syrup ‘til I hear crack
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
I got my hand on an ounce, and I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms and now I'm hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them
Feelin' like a goner, put my life in locker
Hotbox in the Hummer
Hot bars in the summer 
If I had the option, I would do it all again
If I had the option, I would do it all again
I just wanna feel like I did the right program
I just want to appeal to my dad and my cousins 
When I cut the veil, I do not think 'bout diplomas
Love is knowin' that you didn’t do it by your lonesome
So I forgive my mommy, daddy, auntie, and my uncles
For guilt-tripping feelings whenever they call my number
They see men dream, they see men fallin'
But when I dream, I'm smashing on Atlanta
Both pessimistic, drug addicted, caught in our feelings
We spit venom then stare at the ceiling, wondering, "why?"
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
Both so submissive, take turns dominating, the light has been faded
This hate-fueled love, we don't fake it, no givin', just takin'
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk, that want it ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like 
And yeah you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "Why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Timing all fucked up, thought you had just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say, "Fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin', I'm on a mission
Every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'I might go Interstellar
I feel like Matthew McConaughey
I don't care for what they gotta say
Tony Perkis how I drop the weight
Jason Bourne with the headshot
Jason Statham with the whip game
Liam Neeson with the rescue
I go Gunnar with the leather face
Bruce Campbell with the chains
Tobin Bell with the saw
Anthony Hopkins, I'm eatin' 'em raw
They don't know who we are
Molly Shannon, I'm a superstar
Ride or die like it's Seabiscuit
Tryna stack like Tobey
John Wick, I don't leave a witness
Chris Paul, I'm assistin'
Ameer go Blake Griffin
Give me forty-eight minutes
We go '04 Pistons
Catch a fade like Robert Horry
Only time to get the spotlight
Deray, how I'm top flight
Go Obama when I drop mics
I'm the Black Tom Hanks
You can call me Nigga Banks
Secret Agent Cody Banks
Quarter pound of the dank
On the scale and it stank
Put my mama in a Range
I just bought a new Wraith
Nic' Cage with the face-off
John Travolta when I take off
Brad Pitt, start a fight club
Turn the trap into the nightclub
I'm like Prince with the white doves
Paint a picture with the white dust
Lionel Richie with the white bitch
Try to tell it to her nicely
But she never wanna listen
Beat the pussy to submission
Tom Cruise on a mission
Pull a R&B singer
Bring her back to South Central
I shine just like a popstar
M.J. my initial
Kobe Bryant with the spin moves
If these niggas got issues
H-Town with Beyoncé
Turn her to my prom date
Kingpin like JAY-Z
Dance moves like JT
Heath Ledger with some dreads
I just gave my nigga head
Standing on my two legs
Fuck what that nigga done said
Bruh, I don't fuck with no white boys
'Less a nigga Shawn Mendes
I been off and I been dead
Bad as hell, I don't bench-press
High school, they ain't fuck with me
Now, the critics don't fuck with me
My own fam ain't fuck with me
But Viceland did fuck with me
I'm the only popstar with no money
Can't drive, so I'm still running
Uber taking all my show money
But that's okay, I got more money
Not enough to get my teeth fixed
So my boyfriend in the street, bitch
In the moonlight, I get seasick
Did you see all the art that we did?
Did all that shit in a weekend
We was up all late tweakin', yeah
Ice Cube on a Friday, Chris Tucker on a Friday
Michael Cera on a Friday, Jonah Hill on a Friday
Rockin' Leo's blood diamonds
Sucked off on the highway
Police right behind me like a nigga stole his OJ
Okay, I don't play, got the same last name as O.J.Pretty sure I'm maniacal, but what do I know?
I don't know, all I know is what I see through my monocle
That and the telescope, keep one lens on the money flow
The other's gold and complemental trusty, well—well...
I'm rolling down hills in a suit through the mud
Burn my dress shoes in a fire with the wood
Sit back and relax with the fumes of
Everything I hate in the world
Play Mozart, smoke my cigar on
My estate, keep the cars parked on the front lawn
Neighbors hate, place duct tape underneath their tires
And I wait
Sunsets to blood moon horizons
Left brain and right brain divided
Set frames and watch plays inside them
In the mountains now's where you'll find him
I smell a breeze in the morning
I feel your presence, it's warming
I paid attention to warnings
But we were too caught up in transforming
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Lucky days, I'm burnin' the four-cyl'
Your boy is dusty like brush up a fossil
Hear that shit urk like the noise of a possum
Bitch, I'm a king, I was born in the castle
Built like a boxer, I'm ready to tussle
Fuck on my baby, I'm ready to bust one
Come fuck with me and my dogs
Hate on my ass like in-laws, ugh
That boy stay light like a cheerleader, um
She want me filled like a two-liter, um
Eat it all day, watch it ricochet off
Then I skrrt off on that Michelin, aww
They don't got nothing on me 'til I pop
They don't got nothing on me, call the cops
I hit that run like a Heisman, boy, run it back
Look at that boy, hit that running back
Shout out to South Central, San Marcos
I got addicted to soft-shell tacos
Got down to pennies and ramen noodles
Now, I see how hunger make a shooter
Stamina, stamina
I used to be holding the camera
Head hit the glass, dog your window up
Fans praying to me like my handle Cortana
We like Wu-Tang, but I feel like Santana
She twerkin' just like she Hannah Montana
Head was clean, Tony Fantano
Made her my wife-uh
She can't kick it, she so Bella
Confused erections
Bad hoes know name brands, they brainless
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' to
Ghetto in here flash it, ooh, them boys stay nasty
Floating like Aladdin, them the ones you talkin' toThese niggas take me for granted, what would hap' if I vanish?
Bet a hunnid they'd panic, my shooters only speak Spanish
Keep my heart with my dogs, keep my car in the yard
I can't drive it nowhere so I'll let you niggas take off
Seen the shit that they drop, that shit not instantly hot
I give that instant re-bop, that replay value go off
That make my value go up, I keep that bow in my cup
My niggas rolling, got that going with a thousand to bust
That nigga Kevin can't rap, he too sappy with his shit
He don't rep me with his shit, he on that teenage bullshit
And he 'bout 20 and shit? When he let go of that shit?
He'll prolly be a little colder, y'all agree with me? Shit
That nigga need to act his age, he ain't acting like a grown up
Ain't that boy from Texas? He ain't acting like a soldier
Knew that boy in high school, man, that nigga wasn't awkward
And I know his mama, man, that nigga just a liar
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Crashed my last Benz, Benz
Cashed my last check, check
Cash don't mean shit, shit
Call me King of the Niggas, I need a crown made of thorns
God said, "Let there be light" on the day I was born
Step off the ship with the slaves, then I go hit the stage
I just left in a whip, all I need is a chain
I don't trust no niggas and I don't trust no bitch
'Cause people talk too much, I bought a black fo'-fifth
And a brand new clip, that's my new best friend
'Cause I'm a brand new nigga, in a brand new crib
I ain't sellin' no more, but got my hand in the zip
Whitey gave me the check, I ain't ask for the fame
I used to deal with the grams 'til they put the cam on my face
Now I'm evading the law, I'm on a high-speed chase
I'm in a big-ass truck, I tell 'em, "Get out the way"
I gotta couple of warrants, so I'm leaving my state
Now I'm in Cali today, with the sun on my face
I got a bag of the gas, and a blunt I can face
How I'm gon' move at your pace? I'm busy settin' the tone
You think we runnin' together? I'm in a lane of my own
Don't got no friends in this game, it's me and my brothers alone
They thinkin' that we competing, that shit depletin' my bones
I don't need all that energy, they just fuck up my chakras
I put my heart in a locker, they love me when I'm a martyr
They hate me when I'm myself, I can't barter with that
You watch us charter these tracks, it's sticking like tartar and plaque
I need a parlour of plaques, need lobsters and helicopters
I need peace for my niggas, need darker skin for all my doctors
I like to speak like a scholar, like to think like a nigga
In this world I can't wander, no honor behind the trigger
I could get shot in my back and they'd tell the world that I fought 'em
"We ain't taught 'em nothin' new, but somehow they been gettin' smarter"
That's what they sayin' in private, speaking from that entitlement
We still workin' for titles and makin' tidal environments
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Cash don't last, my friends will ride with me
Keep 'em in my bag, we robbed a limousine
When the guns go pow, won't bother us again
I don't wanna do it but they keep on pushing me
Fuck, put ya ante up, riding in the limousine
I'm stuck on some bud I hit, under concrete canopy
Fuck all this energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck all your energy, you just wanna bring me down
Fuck, put the windows up, blowin' past the exit now
Up like a money shot, swerve into the sunset
Me and all my boys jet, swerving like a doughnut
Off, off, off, off, swerving like a doughnut
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what?
Pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up, pull up if you want to
Nigga, what? Y-yoTell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?
It feels like I can see the past in your eyes
I know the future has been passing you by
These other niggas, they just passing your time
They don't know how to ride the tidal waves
That crash in your thighs
But I got the dream, and if you believe
Then I can take you somewhere that is pristine
I'm keeping it clean, my title is mean
They boxin' us in but we broke out the seams
Don't make me a fiend, I know what I want
I'm working to get everything that I need
But I got a plan for you
I'm taking a stand for you, I care for you
What's your motive with me, baby?
'Cause I don't trust nobody lately
I twist and turn, moving just like a serpent
New times are coming just like a virgin
Get you all outta my head, 'cause lately I'm better off dead
I say this all out of respect, sometimes, I want nothing with you
Wearing your love like medallions
'Cause I know thousand men want ya, wants the menages
Fucking, riding shotgun, slap your buns
Melting, fading, under stars and the sun
85, 90, gon' bust out the gun
Know they sent me from the neck of the woods
Change my name, state so they never could
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?
I need a friend 
And you need a home 
I love when you come 
I still feel alone
You make it warm in my bed
Butterflies in my head
Sunrise, let it set
But you don't love me like you say you do
White lies hold the hidden truth
You keep leaving when I need you most
It's true what they say about love had and love lost
Here you are and now you're gone
I'm left alone in the same bed, I wake up in a cold sweat
Please don't make me wait long
I just wanna be your main one
Your main, your main one, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
See, I don't want nobody, but you, mm-mm
I spent the day by my lonesome
Who do you call when there's no one?
No one ever did what you did for me and did to me
My bed is cold and indented where you used to sleep
Tell me what you're waiting for, shit
Tell me what I'm here for
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna love you
Tell me what you're waiting for
I just wanna hold you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
I just wanna love you
Just wanna hold you, never would lie to you
Tell me what you're waiting for, huh
What you waiting for?What are the rules for breakfast today?
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch
A real-ass bitch, bitch
What are the rules for breakfast today? 
What are the words I'm forbidden to say?  
I need to let my hair down and grow it like a real-ass bitch  
A real-ass bitch, bitch

Break necks, I'm the chiropractor
Come on down, you know I gotcha
Real shit, feelin' saturated
Realign the spine, fuck the haters
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
When you see me in the street, they say, "Willy, Willy!"
But you won't see me in the street, I'm like a hillbilly
I was sad 'cause nobody wanna suck my willy
Now I'm sad, everybody wanna suck my willy
They be like, "What the fuck is you on?" when we hit the room
Move til' these niggas throw me in the tomb
Hear the sounds of the fader when we spin the tunes
Everything feel right now you in the womb
Wanna motivate you in the afternoon
Top-shelf money, that's my new perfume
Twist it up, light the end and inhale the fumes
I'm the one that zoom if you just assume
I've been beat up my whole life
I've been shot down, kicked out twice
Ain't no stoppin' me tonight
I'ma get all the things I like
I've been beat up my whole life

MERLYN!I need it all downtown, nigga
Put it back where you fuckin' found it though
I need it all down 
Keep 'em right there, oh, you found 'em though
I want a shirt that make my body feel all sexy
I want a chain that make my body feel all hefty
I want my head to fall off when I walk out the door
I want the rain to fall down and I'm askin' for more
Ridin' on the roof with a dollar sign attached to my

I want a love that make me feel like I ain't breakin' ya heart
I wanna know what made you stay
When it was wrong from the start
I need to know where you went lookin'
Where you went through the chart
I need this fear of being everybody else to depart
I got a lot on my mind, not enough hours to shed
Not enough trust to believe, not enough feelin' to care
I'm feeling numb to the world so I've been ignoring instead
I'm seeing through what I wanted, to recognize who is there, yeah
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the road sign on the 45
Only you and me by the borderline 
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah 
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah, let it go

And I will show you off for everything I own
I know it's not what you're used to
See they could tear me down, take everything I made
I'll still be here next to you
Throw me in the fire, baby, I'll survive
Coming top down by the seaside
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
Ay-yi-yi-yi-yah
See the wrong side of the 45
Only you and me by the borderline

My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Thirty-two hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that smirk, life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else, I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Bimmer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries
I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from our village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like la, la, la, la
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie, whoop!
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la, la, la, la
Thirty-two hundred on the
Thirty-two hundred on theI don't know where I'm goin'
If  I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I  ain't tryna get like all up in your head again, Montana, 'Lanta
Maybe I should just go mosey my ass over to your house
Bewildered by the sight of you up on the couch, so cozy
Lowly  lit lights, rosy cheeks, oh, you so cozy with somebody else
Get  nervous, my stomach churnin', burnin'
I'm beat, ready to knock some teeth out of his ass
Late  night corner, we pass
Lick that Swisher, get red
Used to skip rocks 'round that bend
We don't go there no more
We  don't see sun no more
Baby wanna raid the whole apartment like the FBI
Takin' everything, from pots and pans to fans to Goldeneye
Everything 'cept the dog
Everything in the drawers
Used to be so perfect, but it's never gettin' solved
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
Do I matter? I'm ecstatic, I'm depressed
More like God's special mess, never had no halo
Trippy, I can barely hike it out of bed
Time bomb under it, persuading you to hop in
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
Mmm, options, runnin' out of options
Mmm, options, used to have options
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I don't know where I'm goin'
If I gotta take the high road, I'm rollin'
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help when my
Used to fight all my night terrors, now I smoke through the dreams
Depression put me into places where I'm stuck in the seams
They sealed my mouth and said the only way to breathe is to scream
Pop the stitches from society and fall to my knees
The machines weavin' our fate are gettin' harder to please
But I believe to an extreme
To anybody listenin' that's in between
Went to church for the hell of it, stumbled in drunk as shit
Been goin' through it again
Been talkin' to myself, wonderin' who I am
Been thinkin' I am better than Him
In times like these, I just need to believe it's all part of a plan
Lost a part of me, but I am still here
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire 
But you know, you know that's a lie 
Wash it out of all of me to feel the fire 
But you know, you know that's a lie 
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when my
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my eyes go red
I'm sure I'll find it
No one help me when my, no one help me when myWhen I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't—Don't—Don't—Don't let life pass yourself
When I imagine myself on acid
I taste the Backwoods and find those 'til I piss off
Even dance and pounce around
My silent thoughts who had the crown
Don't—Don't—Don't—Don't let life pass yourself
I could've got a job at McDonald's, but I like curly fries
That's a metaphor for my life, and I like taller guys
Could've got a deal if I wanted, but I like owning shit
And I like making shit, and I like selling it
Could've peaked when I was in high school, but I had bigger plans
Could've took the time out to find you, but you ain't understand
You don't gotta leave for them to define you, 'cause what could you demand?
When everybody out to define you without a circumstance
Anybody got Harry Styles' phone number?
Okay, I called him and they said I got the wrong number
I was tryna be Pac when I was younger, dreaming of better days
I don't see my mom no more, remind me of bad weather days
If you got a problem with me, try some other guy
I let you know I'm a dog, I eat the cat alive
But really, though, I'm alone, 'cause I don't stick around
And yes, I know it's my fault, so put your finger down
I would keep this shit pent up if it weren't for my mom
If it weren't for Dijon
Yeah, I don't like to lie, guess it sounds out the month
Should've opened up my mouth more, show 'em what my fist for
Let 'em get a fistful, caught up in the lust, man
Bred from the legs of straight killers on best end
Black eyes, bloody sheets, damn, where yo' feet stand?
We should get a new plan, maybe some more fans
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
I love it when the people go wild for me
Keep it wild for me, wild, wild, homie
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
I'm a shithead son, and I'm bad at growing up
My life ain't been the same since my dog died
Since my girl left
I quit drinking and drugging and still can't get ahead
Been at a loss for words
It seems I'm destined to fall apart when I'm depressed
It's all a test, scream at God from my bedside
I glue my hands together, life's got me hog-tied
There's no applause in the game of life, I just bought a car
And a new house, here's the cost to prove it
I spin a little wheel when I'm feelin' moody
And that's like all the time, try not to mind the clock
Because my heart is ticking, I smoke a pack a day and
I wish I didn't, having some trouble quittin'
I have a couple vices, we had that show on Viceland
I was hardly in it; most the time, I'm hidden
Anxious, impatient and always wanting something different
I hate the way I'm feeling, I'm sick of chasing feelings
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate again
Baby, I been trippin' off 'em, tie me up and send 'em off
And I been on a mission for it, I just want my own apartment
I just want a space with my old best friend
Lock me in your cellular, won't elevate againJabari, me paddy
Everybody  ask me how I deal with my depression
Man  look, man, I don't got the answer to your question
If I did, you would probably never hear from me again
That's a promise, not a threat and it ain't no half-steppin' 
Can't  let it compromise the pace I'm settin' 
Grandma  told me don't forget to count my blessings 
Breakin' up botanicals to ease my stressin'
Was  the one that you needed but you weren't expectin'
Game need refreshin' , what you been suggestin'? 
Wrote a new constitution, we don't need amendin' 
I go Johnnie Cochran when I'm raisin' my defenses 
Man,  I feel like Michael Keaton when a nigga start ascendin' 
Never second-guessin' , had to do a lot of restin' 
Like I played for Popovich, tryna fine our new direction 
Listen, I ain't for the shelvin', what you niggas tellin'?
My team been rebellin' from wherever you were headin', goddam
Man, this shit bump like a belly when it's pregnant 
Bonafide big brr lookin' like a Yeti 
Swift feet cheetah, that's a real big kitty
Who made y'all judges? That's a real ass feeling
I don't like the sly ones, forget 'em and I dead 'em 
Always off the shit like a constipated reverend 
Y'all don't like to shit talk, dumb pun, all fun
But I make your bitch crack a giggle with the next one 
Goofy ass boy, look like Elmer Fudd's cousin 
Heavy-ass feet, bet Pluto heard you comin' 
Actin' like Regina, you a lil' bit dramatic 
I been in the cockpit, I been in the cabin 
Take the ego out, just revolve around the planet 
Damn, I'm like Kirby, man, I don't take damage
Oh, so hot, so, sst, get branded
I'm just havin' fun, cops hit me, goddamn it
Trauma got me fucked up, my mama got me fucked up
My lil' nigga locked up, it's like Hakuna Matata
Never liked sci-fi, empathetic wifi
Keep it in the back room, hidin' with my dry eye
Put it in the vacuum, I got love for my label
Fifteen million on the table, none of my niggas is stable
Need a personal connection, I just wanna feel you, baby
Bein' sober made me realize how poorly I been behavin', uh
My bitch, she so pretty, pretty 
I get cash like really, really
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly 
My bitch is so pretty, pretty 
I get cash like really, really 
Tell the DJ, man, he ain't slick
'Cause he ain't playin' hits, he silly, silly 
Ring in their ears like a bark
Always feel left in the dark
Trauma the price for the patience
Character shift like an arc
Move like my shit stay in park
Don't feel the love or respect
Grip like a hand on my neck
This is the year, place your bets
Boy, bye
Ooh, ooh, beautiful and bashful
Ooh , ooh, ooh 
I'm beautiful and bashful
Boy, bye
Goddamn 
Boy, bye
Boy, bye
Goddamn

When there's a rough patch, don't eye for the parachute
They goin' AWOL the second that the light goes on
This a treat, ain't it, soon as she hit the powder room
I pull it back and check my rose, and yeah, I'm 'bout to bloom
It's that '90 raised from hell shit, parlay like when the lane switch
Combat how you feel, strobe light, I hit the killswitch
Neck twist like Exorcist, I'ma see you 'round
'Cause tonight's the night I'm losin' all I'm doin', I'm about this
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
White cuffs, wood grain
Money in the suitcase on my way to the bank
On my way to the bank, on my way to the bank

'Til the casket drops, I will play God
Fuck the world, let's start a riot
Got too much, too quick
God damn, I'm feelin' sick, bitch, call the doctor
Don't act like I ain't been dead to ya
Don't act like I ain't deserve this shit
Couldn't last a day inside my head
That's why I did the drugs I did
Got issues with these motherfuckers
Looking down from they pedestals
From that petty view, on that petty shit
Pray for peace with a knife in my hand
Speak my piece like a gun to my head
Come equipped just to blast this shit
Misunderstood since birth
Fuck what you think, and fuck what you heard
I feel betrayed, you can keep the praise
And all of the fuck shit need to get away
Still ain't got the fright to the fickle-minded people
I thought I knew better, wish I knew better
Should have known better, wish that I was better
At dealing with the fame and you fake motherfuckers
Guess I'm too real
Excuse we?

Black power fist hangin' from my black 'fro
Yo, she saw me in that cereal, she want to lick a Oreo, damn
Break the dam when I spit the flow
I'm on the lamb like the fuckin' wool
Hoppin' out the van, I'm at Abbey Road
Fans with cameras in the bathroom, man, that's difficult
I just wanna smoke a Backwoods by my lonely self
Chill, watch numbers go up, book off the shelf
I found myself and put my face on a missing shirt
I dropped out with no promise that this shit would
(That this shit would work, work, work
Work, work, work, work)
With the dogs in my ride, know the doors suicide
Paranoid, do or die, you should know we never lie

Este es mi amigo Jabari
Nosotros odiamos a la policía
I got pipe dreams of crack rocks and stripper poles
Of fucking centerfolds
So I got secrets only me and all my niggas know
Of kicking in the doors
I’ll send a bitch to get ya, so don’t play fucking stupid
I know you got the product
'Cause I could smell the money, I could taste the weed
Give me somethin' or a body, only way I’ll leave
I love to watch 'em squirm, I love when bitches bleed
If she’s sucking on the barrel, you can’t hear her scream
So kiss the fucking carpet, this aggravated larson
And then I’m out the door, it’s monsters in your home
Black gloves, mask on, muzzle plated chrome
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck—another cracker
Cop comin' on my block for the answers
Huh, I no got time for your question
Huh, this pon' mi mommy and mi bredren
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, but it’ll never work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete feels the hardest every time I seem to touch it
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In the creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing with myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you!
I’ll break your neck so you can watch your back
Fuck you
My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the Lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on yaI pray I find you at the bottom of the hill
I  pray I make it outta Texas
I  pray my A/C come back on
My mom was stuck outside her job
My sister just asked for a Lexus
Can  Jesus send me a message?
What's  the point of havin' a best friend if you end up losin' him?
World don't view my text messages
World  don't view my text messages
Don't view my bad side
Only get on the 'Gram to show you motherfuckers the best side
Who am I? Who am I? Who am I?
Why  I hide? Huh
Fourth grade, Mary J. Blige all I like
I made a mill' off a lie and a lie so I write another lie
RCA‚ that note wasn't 'bout y'all
No lies‚ it was about how me and my brothers been traumatized
And I must keep creatin' truths and hooks to get up outta this hell for myself
Seashells
Dearly departed
Look what you've started
I've been so heartless
I try‚ I try, I try
Why?
Why?
Why?
Try
Big dog, I feel like I don't got anybody on my side no more
Highs to lows‚ truth be told
It's hard to ignore, hard to endure
Where's my stamina in this life?
Make sure my family tight
More rubies on my neck and they catch me at night
Lookin' immaculate, no one in sight
Standards are high‚ expectations are low
Wake up sweatin' at night, mind in a flight
I don't get scared no more when I'm standin' on the mountaintop
I'm afraid of people dyin'
Rest in peace Wako, Ray, Rita
Wish you could've took me to Japan
Back ten years, holdin' my hand, felt like a hundred grand
Wish them letters didn't fade, love will never do the same
Out the window screamin' your name, bless it
Mama on track, my dad got my back
My sister graduated, now she racin'
Love her through the days and whiskey in my hand
Bloody colored trinkets wrapped around my wrist
Lookin' magnificent, man
No stoppin' me, no boggin' me down
I know myself, me and the obstacles now
I done shit on myself too much to not know how to move properly now
On the property now, money gets foul
Keep your wits about you
They stretch the truth longer than the Nile
Eyes full of evil, mouth full of vile
They tracin' your smile
Stay alert, big dog
Only one life is offered to you
How many sides to a story can there be when you saw it with your own eyes?
I got all my thoughts out on records y'all won't ever hear
Tried to give it time
Find that truth trickles down, hits the fan
Freezes over like a dagger to the spine
When somebody that you know throws you in the fire
How do you survive?
I kicked down the door inside a home I didn't own just to save a friend's life
Little did I know, the one who pulled the strings was once on my side
I had just moved to Texas, tried to make it right
I do not feel obliged to dismiss the truth because of how I feel about our time
If I knew what you would do to someone you owe money to, you wouldn't get a dime
Watch for where you land, sorry 'bout your plans
That was all a scam, you won't understand
Pass the weight off to your friends and never face the truth
Because you never learned how to be a man
And it's not my fault, and it's not my problem anymore
That's just where you stand
That's just who you are
That's your cross to bear
You could talk to God
I don't wanna hear, motherfuckerSkinny boy, skinny boy, where your muscles at?
Used to walk to work, eight hours, take the bus back
Ain't no time to stop, ain't no time for vacation
Y'all all want my spot 'cause you know that I am A1
All these pretty girls, they come running to our faces
I could do without, I could move without, I could do myself
I get in a rut, I feel depressed, I bang on my chest
I say fuck 'em all 'til I'm dead
First off, fuck Dolce & Gabbana 
Racist mothersuckers tryna be my pana 
Put that on me auntie and me mama 
Grab the Ghost then I go right back to Ghana 
I came back again , with the platinum 
To the continent , I came back again 
I came back again , with the platinum 
To the continent , I came back again 
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth

Don't go runnin' your mouth 
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth

And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
Got a lot of things to say that I could never finish
Told my mama, "I'll be back, just gotta kill another mission"
Gimme thirty seconds and I'll make off with a billion
Every verse a heist for all your underlying feelings
Got canaries on the window, smell like roses on the ceiling
Oh what a–, oh what a–, oh, how appealing
Candy paint revealing all that bullshit you concealing
Fuck what you been hearing, I'm everything they fearing
I'm black and smart and sexy, universally appealing
Genius what I'm dealing, something they ain't stealing
They prohibited the potents, might give you cirrhosis
Spaceship doing donuts, it's written, I'm the POTUS
I'm focused
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth 
Don't go runnin' your mouth
Don't go runnin' your mouth

As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
Barre Baby, spilled syrup on my big wheel
You could call me lil nigga with the big crib
My lifestyle still the same, just a face lift
Silly niggas got me running out of patience
My whole life slowly turned into a daydream
I hit the bank with a smile on my face, man
Pretty women always pullin' at my waistband
Used to get arrested, all I get is checks now
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side
And Waco is far away, I don't even mind
As long as you stay right here, right next to my side"—perfectly fine, that's fine!"
Said nigga brother, nigga brother, what you living for?
Is you gon' finish what you started? What you quitting for?
They told me God gave me a mission
But I'm missing the supplies to complete it
I ain't the one you should read in, I'm used to being defeated
So nigga, brother who you standing with?
I'm independent 'cause these parties never planned for this
Brother nigga with a brain, unintentionally swerving in every lane
The feeling's never the same, you chase what you couldn't gain
I'm so accustomed to flames, I couldn't tell you what's fire
Situation is dire, hear them calls from the choir
The disposition acquired from my position on Earth
It's telling me "Decapitate everything for what it's worth!"
When I die, these words gon' need separate caskets and a hearse
I don't rhyme, I freeze time and let these hands just do the work
I'm in tandem with my curse, going manic since my birth
See the canvas as a planet I'm commanding with my nerves, ah
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Boy, you know you don't look fly
Them gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Nothin' different now  all around now 
Who you keep around now? That's a big reflection
Don't like how they talkin' to me, why they walkin' to me?
Wear your shit upon your sleeve, stop projectin' on me
Sense is your surround sound, what's your take on me?
Kill the ego now, what that make of me?
Angle widescreen, couple sips of Tanqueray
I'ma throw a couple punches, I'ma do it anyway
Chin up little son, I slide in like the macarena
Lose time, pen it, style spiced on, jalapeño
Supersonic, move through tunnel, two-wheel cycle, slightly
Silence crowd better than 9 millimeter with extended suppressor
Bustin' out the function, highly comfortable
Got this Martine on my body, man, my sweat lethal
Sweet kisses like the candy out the carnival
I'ma call my own shots, hit the audible
Impending death is the only sign of life
I'm throwing Hail Marys 'til I die
Throw it up, all I have is peace of mind, throwin' up
Have my wings clipped, I don't need them shits
Learn to fly again
Fast track to last place, I swear
I've never been up top but I'm up here somewhere
Out here, nobody can tell me shit
Shit, never mind what I did back then
You should take a look at yourself instead
Maybe you can find yourself, love yourself
Here's to health and here's to wealth, all together now
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Tell 'em boys, don't run from us
I been down too long, cousin
I been down too long, brother
Tell the world, I ain't scared of nothing
Tell the world, I ain't scared of jumping
Tell my boy, I want a crib in London
Tell the world to stop tripping, I'll
Build a different house with some different functions
Hoo! Voodoo Man
Momma took me to the church and I sang a hymn
Co-colonized Chris-ti-an
Now I'm losing my reli-gi-on
God damn, so narcissistic this millennium
Fuck you and the bubble that you livin' in
I don't go to church, but I'm so spiritual
Pulled my life out of dirt, that's a miracle
If Jesus was a pop star, would he break the bank?
All these diamonds in my face, I'm shining like the day
I'm living in my prime, man, what can I say?
If the service is an hour, I'm an hour lateDrink of the apple pie with it, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't got no chains in my denim, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't listen what the blogs tell me, yeah, yeah, yeah
I know niggas got their own agenda, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've got , but you would never know
I like to hide them, so much I lose myself
That's why I'm pure to some, a psychopath to others
And grew up in counseling, flipping off my counselors
They gave me mood stabilizers
But when I came off 'em, I was violent
Took the drugs that I wanted, which didn't help with the voices
They just grew louder and louder
Like all the people who'd just chatter and chatter
I juggle all my personalities
Estoy tan harto y cansado, no puedo seguir haciendo esto
Ojalá pudiera rendirme pero tengo que seguir siendo fuerte para mi familia y mis amigos
I found myself getting better by the fucking minute
'Member when my momma always had to save the minutes
Got some D's, dropped out, wanted to be Russell Simmons
Gotta keep workin', my head on Innervisions
Where the kitchen at? Keep the lyrics written
Raid my cell and dope, askin' for forgiveness
I just ran into somebody sellin' lemonade
Kiss your kids tonight before them bitches run away
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
This for all my broke niggas, this for all them jokes, nigga
That you niggas made when I was still livin' at home, nigga
Did it on my own, nigga, grew up and I bossed out
Grew up and I bossed out, grew up and I bossed out
I see you peekin’ through bushes
And tryna get secret ingredients from us
I know that you do it 'cause you see us boomin'
Like C4 when you hit that detonator
Lucky-lucky on the elevator
Eat my dust, baby, I’ll see ya later
I could always call your bluff
You already said enough
Take a risk, bitch
Still sittin' on your ass, waitin' for a handout
Giving nothin', put your hands down
"Ooh, yeah, this for the culture!"
"Ooh, yeah, this important!"
Fuck off with that slang shit
Fuck off with that networking
Keep your mouth where the money at
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is see you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But I don't really know what I'm doing now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Yellow lights on my dashboard
Red flags in the rearview
I know I'm the one that made you upset
But all I wanna do is heal you
You know that lately I don't think straight
But lately I don't know what to do now
'Cause everybody got me fucked up
I'm struggling while on the move now
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Get your man, get your man all up off me
Think again, want a hundred  bands around me
In December, I don't care what they call me
Barely got control of it, must've got a hold of it
Threw me to the ground and left a scar right on my nigga-lips
I look in my closet when I think about the past life
Never good in my wallet, tryna see if I got my cash right
Fuck a flight, they ain't never wanna treat my bag right
Fuck a job, they ain't never treat my mom and dad right
I hate them quiet suburbs, I hate those picket fences
I hate the separation, first thing they called me; "Nigga"
I fight, I got suspended, my teachers saw me hit him
So they ain't listen to me, and from that moment on
I would learn that I was different, I would grow to see the difference
Second-guessing my decisions, Black bodies come up missing
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I would walk through the halls at my own pace
Every lunch, I would flow, having no place
All the books in my bag 'til my bones ache
Wonder how the world would be if I had no face
If I had no heart, if I had no skin
And I was just thoughts, reminiscing
The things I always brushed off
Had my father try to tell me I was just soft
And when I look at the things that I've been through
And the things I survived, and at what cost?
All the love in my life that I just lost
All this shit persevere to the pole vault
In the lies of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes of my own, I ain't start yet
In the eyes of the law, I'm a problem
In the eyes of the blogs, I'm a paycheck
In the eyes of the world, I'm a icon
In the eyes that I own, I ain't start yet, I ain't start yet
Power, African power!
Power, African power!
Power, African power!
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
Ugh, I feel like all my days are coming to a blend
I feel like all my days are coming to a blendPut the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now,  that's enough, that's enough
Do you see what you contribute to my consciousness?
Voices feelin' so ominous
I can't place a pen for you, they mark it out as anonymous
I would shift the whole continent
If it helped you 'round with some confidence
Thinkin' bout all the consequence
Gotta try to break what's monotonous
How could I be better?
I paid the price in full, just to clear the record
Rewound just to fast forward
On the eight-track I stole from my grandmama
Catastrophic, where the stoppin'?
Man, I wish I had a rocket
Wish I ain't feel microscopic
Wish my thoughts was telepathic
But instead I'm always babbling
Love rappin' like it's my girlfriend
Every tour is like a catfish
Just kidding, I love you assholes
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
It's hard to air out in deep water
You keep calling, I ignore it
Cleared my conscience in absurd ways
I do the things you hate, I'm changing every day
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
I just wanna know, know 
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
Put the bag in the cup, add it up, add it up
Put my friends in the truck, add it up, add it up
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enough
If you think you know me now, that's enough, that's enoughAnd mother, I am sorry, I never pick up, mm-hmm
Because I'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, "Sorry I don't call"
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, "I'll try vacation, I'll try to run away"
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My momma always had these dreams that used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
I will
I will
I will
Can I tell you how?
Can I tell you now?
I willWas I more than it's worth
Or will you see my name and I'll fade?
Pitch my camp in your mind
Sat by the fire, behind your eyes
And I'll look through them just once or twice
But I might see something I don't like
Like your hands in his shirt
Entwined in cotton, his loving smirk
Losing my way, ohh
Seeing your name, but I'll be fine, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
 Losing my way, ohh
Did I come again dressed out like a shame? Cloudy
Seeing your name
Eyes are but a pain, roses in my veins, sorry
But I'll be fine, yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah 
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Oh-oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-ooh
Oh-oh-oh-oohEvanie
Did you lie to him since you were seventeen?
How's he holding up?
Evanie
Do you cling to him like you would onto me?
Bet he needs you more than I
Evanie
Did you hide your neck to save him from his sleep?
I know how that feels
Evanie
Every chance you take, you make me want to flee
Can't you see?
You should move on
I swear you'll be fine
Whenever you want
I'll be your ride
And when you're alone
And his love is gone
Maybe you'll see that your company
Was the worst thing for him
Your sin
Little old me, I thought my world was progressive
'Cause my president was Black, twenty-five lighters on the dresser
I had guilt trip on my back and a bulletproof vest
Inside my Uncle John's Toyota was a walking Crayola, ah—
I got a hard time, I gotta watch myself
The way I move through a room full of suits, ain't no
Ain't no Constitution, I hate uniforms 
I hate handcuffs, I can't stand up 
They throw me in the crowd and tell me "Boy, I'd lose that smile"
But see I got it from my dad and that's the reason why we had
I raise my black fist, I got big lips
I'm strong as Samson, they cut my fucking locks
I lose my fucking strength
Fuck, I'm running out of zips
My life been feeling tense, I won't be on the fence
I put my phone on airplane mode 'cause I'm on autopilot
I need a lot of patience, I need a lot of silence
I hope this holy water burn because I ain't worth this life
I ain't worth the light of day, but for some I light the way
Nude along the banister, kitchen smell of lavender
Swimming in my Wranglers, I am another caliber
Ooh, yeah
La-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Soon, no no, no no, yeah, yeah
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
Soon, come on
No, no, no, no, no, no
No, no, ooh
NoThey split my world into pieces, I ain't heard from my nieces
I been feeling defeated, like I'm the worst in the boyband
I ain't sleep in some weekends, tryna headline both weekends
Lead my niggas, y'all sheepin', I keep the world in my hands
I know accounts should be deleted
I know some niggas should stop hitting my phone
Whenever they needing money or favors done
'Cause I'm still worried 'bout when Ashlan finna put the razor down
So I don't really give a fuck about what story they done spun
And I ain't done 
Yeah 
And I ain't done, you heard me?
I ain't done 
I really miss the old days before the cosigns
I really miss them cold days before the road signs
I really miss when I ain't know which way I was supposed to head
And I was pressed because my shawty gave me cold signs
I was writing poems 'bout her dawg in study hall
And she was mad 'cause I never wanna show her off 
And every time she took her bra off my dick would get soft
I thought I had a problem, kept my head inside a pillow screaming
I don't wanna waste no more time
I'm ready to go
I put my life on standby
I can leave you alone
'Cause we're born with a dollar sign attached to our temple
Life is a dish served cold most times
And all my life I've taken handfuls
Force-fed by the hand that feeds us
But not all hands created equal
I stand by, waiting for something good to come
In due time, the skies will split for the sun to smile
My mother called me today
She said she thought she felt my energy a country away
I apologized for not calling enough due to weight
But couldn't tell you if I kept it in my head to decay
I asked her "Why this world love echoing hate?"
She said "Don't let those who don't know you start dictating your fate"
I think the hardest part of love could be rebuilding the breaks
Conditioned to omit them until our foundation will shake
It's no debate
The road to peace is filled with snakes, you gotta keep your cool
And recognize the wolves that wanna try and leave you wool
Don't let 'em treat you like a window, you know you're a jewel
This world is cruel and not as simple as they teach in schools
Sometimes you gotta step away and check your own intentions
And analyze if what they do can compromise your vision
If people trust you, they don't need to question your decisions
You never needed them if they make you another villain
Pressure
"They tried to take the bike. And they took my friend's bike and then my friend was gonna get it back but then he didn't get it back and then we had to go to the police station. And then, um, then some   random stranger brought back his bike. We just, you know, and we didn't tell our mums so we got in trouble  because they found out like a day later."
Do you want to start the game again?
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Pressure makes me lash back, wish I could get past that
I can't take a step back, makes me wish you'd pass that
Take it all or leave it
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—
Pressure makes, pressure makes, pressu—
Wish I could, wish I could, wish I—
I can't take, I can't take, I can't—
Makes me wish, makes me wish, makes me—
Sipping on my pain, smoking by my pain

Yeah, yeah, mhm
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you know
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you know, oh-oh
You know that you should be my boy
Oh yes, you do

You know that you should be my boy
Oh, yes, you know, oh yes, you know
In the heat of the summer
You're so different from the rest
You know, you know, you knowI ain't the same nigga that I once was
I lost my fucking mind and then I fell in love
I did a bunch of drugs because I couldn't sleep
I lost a couple months, I chipped my fucking teeth
And there's a couple women and they know some things
About lies that I done told and shit that I done said
And niggas that I robbed, so I'm real paranoid
I have voices in my head
Hi, my name is Merlyn, I just applied for food stamps
I just moved to California, with my boy band
Dropped out of a good school, hippies in my commune
I left 'fore the rent was due
Used to want a briefcase and a short commute
Used to wanna sell coke and whip an Audi coupe
Crazy, if I did that, wouldn't be talking to you
Walking through the pitfalls of a college student
Crazy how you get them letters and that make you feel accepted
'Til you walking 'round the campus and you the only African
Nobody with passion, just cats that take direction well
Take acid trips to find themselves, well...
I gotta get better at being me 
I gotta get better at everything 
I just want a friend that I can hang out with 
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with 
Ever since I moved out, I've been broke
Ever since I grew up, I've been ugly
Ooh, I need get me some dollar, dollar, dollar bills y'all
Ever since I left my momma house
I've been mad as hell at the world
Sometimes you don't gotta rhyme when you feel it
Sometimes I barely ever feel a fucking thing
Sometimes I wish that my fucking phone would fucking ring
And go off, and wake a nigga up
I'm used to being sad and I'm used to being down
I'm used to being used, I miss my boy being around
I gotta get better at being me 
I gotta get better at everything 
I just want a friend that I can hang out with 
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with 
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one day
I just wanna be somebody someday
Dropping all I got on this one way
I just wanna be somebody someday
I gotta get better at being me 
I gotta get better at everything 
I just want a friend that I can hang out with 
Someone I can sit around, lay on my couch with 
I'm trying to look for motivation of smaller things
But baby steps to my atonement when I foster dreams
I've been told I'm too transparent with my thoughts sometimes
So I wrote songs until they pass and I can fall in line
I fell apart the moment that you thought you found yourself
'Cause I knew at that point, I couldn't be in the equation anymore
But moving on with open, broken hearts
Will show you everything you need to see about yourself to start moving forward
So many things I wanna say that I'm not sure need to be known
But everybody swears they fucking know me
So why, don't I lay every card I'm holding on the table?
At that point I wonder what they'd show me
I almost lost my father, still surreal for me to think about
Considering how many of my friends have lost theirs
I never know if what I'm saying is the right thing
If not, I'm ready more than ever for the crosshairs
It's all fair when it's not you
Some people have angels, what if only shadows follow you?
And all the ghosts inside that seem to hollow you
The branches of the weeping willow start to swallow you
And then you realize you're exactly where you're supposed to be
The horizon clears, you wipe the tears
And all the skeletons are ready for your storyHallelujah, holy lion‚ word to Judas
How I'm supposed to‚  trust what you say is the truest? 
Haile Selassie‚  insha'Allah if I gotta 
Spin my words around as if you wanted a mandala for Nirvana
Singin' a sonata towards our karma
Did a rain dance, bringin' commas from Tacoma to Oaxaca
I got spirits in my heart that make my mind move like it's water
Flow into the moment and avoid the melodrama
Gotta breathe for a second
Can't believe anybody still testin'
My whole team is a force to be reckoned with
Operatin' like specialists
One to the two to the who are you?
Sendin' out projections with prejudice
My attention to detail is in scale with classic impressionists
So the lesson is that prerequisites are irrelevant to my standards 
It's a deficit in your settlement, you better learn to mind all your manners 
My whole troop been goin' bananas
Try and step inside of our jungle 
You can try to take all your chances
We won't help your ass if you stumble‚ nigga 
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg
You need to help your city out
Hidin' at my partner house

Watch your back,  don't leave your door cracked 
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse 
Watch your back,  don't leave your door cracked 
Slither through your space and watch it all collapse 
If you want a feature, we can figure it out
Want a color for your album? We can figure it out
How you not invite the boys who colored your rollout
Then you copy-paste hard work from the BH house?
I always got somethin' to say when you take food from my mouth
I begged my mommy for money until the day it ran out
They say, "We helped you when and when, now you should figure it out"
Figure it out
Hidin' at my partner house
Couple bands'll send 'em out
'Stead of feelin' trippy, dawg

Waste your breath, watch the tone though
Take you to the dojo
Roll up my doja, sticky fingers
At the door, bruh, Jehovah, you ho bitch
Witness sadistic shit, will come again
Next time I take my belt off, spank you
Bad kid, bad seed, not me, got beef
I leave body, blackout from rage
Childproof my pockets, don't need the options
Romanticizing what I do if I ain't stop me
Can be off me, tread lightly
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law, break the law
Break the law
I'm tired of making a fool out of me and you
Is there anything that I can do that'll save us, baby?
Is there anybody lovin' lies and robbin' shotties
45's and still alive, and no drunk drivin'
That's how they killed my brother
You know, you know better, better, better, better, better
Better, better, better, better, better, better, better, bet on it
Better bet on it, better bet on it, hey
You know, you know better
Better, better, better, bet, bet on it
Bet on it, ayy, ayy, yeah
Ayy, yeah
I wanna sing, I wanna
I wanna sing, ooh
Ah, coolMERLYN! Hopping out the vehicle, I feel like Batman
Hanging with directors, 'bout that action
So please don't stick-and-move in my direction
All I got to lose is my erection
I'm a Black man with a deadly weapon
I'm a real dog, we all go to heaven
But I been tripping on the steps, and I don't think I'll make it
I'm in this big house, still, I'm suffocating
Carnival, my heart like a Supreme Phantom
Going hundred speed, blowin' steam, I throw a tantrum
Judging by my face, my eyes slit like a python
I think she might hate me for a lifetime, ayy, ayy
Daddy cracking redrum, blueprint for the pipeline
Going out the weather, leave my name, I'm goin' offline
I just want my shit to fit, tailored just like Tiffany
Oh, they say I'm perfect, on my back, oh, man, they killing me
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
White burner, black burner, I do not discriminate
I am on a pilgrimage, so don't try to insinuate
Building up an instrument to aim it at the human race
Let it off in hopes that all the pain and stress disintegrates
I think you intolerant; when you do the most, it's moderate
I come with that gas that'll make you think I had a doctorate
What we do provocative, I ain't no apologist
Don't step to professionals if you still move like novices
America's favorite, I do my best and they hate it
It's like I'm stuck in the matrix, and I'm stuck losin' patience
While they stuck on they day shift, I hate my boyfriend's fragrance
I'm a faggot, I say it, I scream that shit like I mean it
Yeah, I'm ugly and genius
I went from nothing to sleeping on Jon's couch
To makin' people bounce at every show that's sold out
You know who I'm talkin' 'bout, with ghouls all in my dirty mouth
Boys be on that silly shit, so Billy 'bout to air 'em out
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in it
Boys wanna play with my cell phone
But I don't want nobody to see what's in itBig old whiskey on them icy rocks
Flood down some veins like oxy does
I need fresh air, I need oxygen
Who the hell you fooling? It's so obvious
I don't feel it, I don't see it, this is blasphemy
I can't help but feel like you is after me
Is you drinking for the pain? Is you drinking for fun?
There's a party outside, 'til the morning gon' come
Is you dancing all alone? Is you dancing for someone?
There's a party outside, know the night is young
Is you having fun?
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
Say it with your chest, say it with your chest
Pray it work again
Putting diamonds on my back, putting diamonds on my back, yeah
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night
I said, I said "Who that? Who that? Who that? Who that?"
Lurking in the shadows
Tryna catch me liberating spirits from the gallows
They wanna blackball me, but I held my avocados
Then they melt down like the hash we mix in our tobacco
Circle tighter than the Castro, they feeding you Castrol
You'd think that it's gas, you turn the key, it's a fiasco
Could be stronger than Vibranium, don't mean that I ain't fragile
Grapple with reality to break out of these shackles
But you know if I waste my time
Talking 'bout what ain't mine
And you know I'll be last in line
Just like last, last night
Suicidal thoughts, but I won't do it
Take that how you want, it's important I admit it
I'm afraid of commitment, don't know how to fix it
Maybe codependent, can't tell the difference
When the push comes to shove, I'd rather bend than break
But something's gotta give, ain't that what they say
When you're torn between reality, and a choice you could have made
Or should've made, they're not the same, I'm not the same
Maybe I'm broken, either way I'm clinging on closely
I know it's unhealthy, appreciate your patience
I know that I'm selfish, do my best to be selfless
I know that I'm changing, I know that I'm changing
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want more
I want more out of life than this
I want more, I want moreI'm the same one you seen in the classroom, ayy
We was chillin' in the stall makin' crowds move‚ ayy

Hangin' on your speaker‚ bangin' on your speaker‚ baby 
Need to find a reason to make you believe me, baby 
Young NOLA‚ PlayStation controlla 
Send 'em just to get 'em, I hit 'em when it is over 
Roll over‚ yo soldier, no coaster
I told ya I'm back whenever the storm is over
Send it back if them boys wanna feel the clover
No closure, never reply to faux orders
My nigga so sculptured, such a short quota 
Police pull up on me, boy, I kept that cold shoulder 
Cup runneth over for a hunnid orders 
All I got is pennies, still want me to fuckin' flow, bruh 
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
There is no love in the ghetto
Money got it where I just can't let go
Ooh-oh-ooh, oh, oh
How you do that right there, boo, I'm bamboozled, yeah
Legs go up behind the head like leopard ambushin', huh
Give her space, big ol' drop, call it Grand Canyon, huh
She bust back, blow a fuse out the damn cannon
Circus, olé, okay , roly 
Poly, slide that , pole, yeah,  low blow 
Not seen like a dodo , I skip fall, stay snow globe 
Stuck inside the corridor , make me go so loco 
Major League, I'm Sheen , call me Wild Thing 
She got strings all up the neck just like a violin 
I crave that chada-ching, when that venom sting 
Eyes turn redder than a motherfuckin' cherry stem
Run up a check, ayy, uh 
Hit 'til I miss, ayy, uh 
And then keep on hittin'
My niggas ain't quittin', they way too legit, ayy, uh 
Don't get on my list, ayy, uh 
I'm from the abyss, ayy, uh 
You sayin' you real
But I watch how you act and I can't be convinced, uh
Smokin' 'em out like a habit
You know we could make it tragic 
Money had never made a nigga 
We holdin' all our money in the mattress 
Fire rapid like a savage 
Taste is way above your palate 
No, I ain't for burying the hatchet 
Take a break to pick apart the balance of this madness
Uh
You got big boy money like you ready for war
You be talkin' like you really gon' run that though
You be runnin' like the snot drainin' in from your nose
That's that ice cream, sugar, that cocaine throat
And this shit gon' bounce like my shin off your dome
And you know these boys deep, we ain't fittin' in the door
And my dogs, they bark, Michael Vick on fours
Boy, this shit long gone, why you hit my phone? 
See how full it is, homie
See how real it is
Hell no

Someone better hold me before this shit gets ugly

My daddy taught me how to sell dope
Turn grams into elbows
Light it up when the L rolled
Black mask, used to kick doors
Wasn't no bullets in the guns though
Niggas still never argued
Raid the house like the task force
Me and my niggas like drug dogs
Find the dope then we take off
Fuck my girl with my chain on
Then she tatted my name on it
Yellowstone, I was raised on it
Actavis in my baby bottle
Baby stroller was an Impala

When I tell ya all the things that I'm thinking
Just so that we could get better
But you wanna put my heart on the stretcher
I don't got insurance for this pressure
Wanna find the benefits, I can't measure
Trying not to run out on my temper
I can see the ash and the ember
That was made from emotional texture
I don't know why I took this endeavor
Don't identify with oppressors
Don't identify with surrender
All of my old friends fair-weather
Gotta treat my heart like a treasure
'Cause all I know is no one else will

You do not know me, don't speak of my homies, you are a phony
Quit pinnin' shit on me, you gon' bring out the old me
You don't wanna know what I wanna do when y'all talk down on my name
I don't wanna see you in the street 'cause I might catch a case
People smile when they face to face 
Then turn their back and switch up words you say 
Running to the papers everyday 
I'm running to the paper anyway

Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
Gimme no drugs, lend me some love
Tonight, while I'm in this club
Lonely as fuck, with my thugs
And we looking for that buzz
What's with these superficial people from my past?
Dancin' 'round the fact that I did everything the motherfuckers bet against
They be like, "Gather 'round, place your bets!
This young man won't ever be shit!"
Well my bad, I guess I just pursued this shit
While you chose to settle down to have some kids
I mean, it's okay to fall in line, just don't look back
That's a long ass line that I'm not in
I just never found the time, or had the chance
Truth is, you can kiss my ass
Never been the one to bow down
Never been the one to air out any situation, but right now
When it's all your fault, I'm here now

Thrift like a five hundred discount
I move it, I move it like Madagascar
Flip it like eight ball to inside of nose, it get raw
Bloody leaf color like fall
When you were calling, they said I'll be nothing
Well, suck on my dick and then lick on my balls
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Th—th—they want to boot up my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
Look what we did in a year
You need a neutral career
I hate on myself when I look in the mirror
Piddling voices all up in my ear
Why do I care how I look?
Why do I care what they say?
I do not care what they say! 
Nowadays, everybody wanna talk 
They forgot how to listen 
'Til the prophets arisen
We mix New Edition with nuclear fission
I don't do auditions, I don't ask permission
Ain't no politician, don't ask my opinion
You got an addiction to what ain't your business
Make the admission, I make like magicians and hit my Houdini
Why they so soft like linguine? I murder this music routinely
I know that you see me, don't see you searching the meaning
I think that’s why you won't believe and the future is leaning
Revolutions started streaming
The reason why you see me beaming
I'm dreaming of making moves like the government
You better think about who you fucking with, get back!
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't
Don't talk back, don't talk back, boy, don't

Let me find my way out of this bitch 
Find myself high in the distance 
Find me up, lying in this ditch 
With a wrist and some diamonds a-mixin' 
If I can't find the time to get my heart out 
Would you stomp 'em out when we slow the world down? 
Would you hold it down for me when my heart pound? 
Ain't no telling, no telling, so call the coroner

Baby, you can come and get it
I'm alive, I'm alive, the bags in my ride, I, I
Baby, when the karma gets you, yeah
Maybe you can run away with us
In my bag in the vault, moving on, move along
Ain't my fault, moved too fast, life had skidded to a halt
Got back on the road and made it to the start
Disregarding the emotional discharge
Can't forget the mission put into my heart
I ain't playing games with you to play your part
Standing up with pride behind my battle scars
Money walk and money talk, but money no make comfortable
Big-ass house and big-ass car don't add up when you die alone
I want wife, nice life ,highlights with some little clones
I want bliss, no strife
Rewind, don't slice around my aura with the better lies
I want a better life, bend around the corner
One deep, eyes shut, really know the place
Projecting on me, I don't correlate
Straight from manipulation, wouldn't wanna infiltrate my brothers
Still wanna get me high, eyes low off that methadone
Always throwing curve, like a reaper scythe
Gnawing on my wood like a termite
Entering my world like a parasite
Praise God, hallelujah! 
I'm still depressed 
At war with my conscience
Paranoid, can't find that shit
Woo, praise God, hallelujah!

At war with my conscience

Money on my mind , couple hunnids at a time
Try to fuck me blind, duckin' down, hear me whine 
We outside now , milk carton in the back
We don't like to fuck around with them niggas in the back
Pullin' triggers in the 'Lac 
May the praise stay bad
Ayy, Dad, Hercules want his fuckin' waves back, stay strapped 
Dancin' like a bad bitch, love on top my mattress
Hope the good Lord catch this, I ain't tellin' backwards
Lie just like an actor, Hollywood is batshit
Mama in the South still, gold all in my mouth still
Rappin' 'bout dick still, and I lease a house still
Move my nigga out, still need my nephew out here
God gave me a good deal
Miss my little niggas down low like a big wheel
Bitch, I wanna hit still
This shit for my partna 'nem, Devil keep on robbin' them
Express and feel myself, like I'm fuckin' Dennis Rodman 
Like I'm Dennis Rodman
Diamond dentures for my partna 'dem 
Golden rubbers from my pocket, friend
Ain't no answer, that's my partna 'dem 
She so bad, I let her touch my butt 
Merlyn, what the fuck?
Line 'em-line 'em-line 'em up, you know that I'm shootin' 
It ain't no one business who or what we doin’ 
Hit this gas, they break the glass and keep it movin’
To you basic bitches I know I'm a nuisance
Sugar, yeah, gimme some
Gimme dome, I'ma smoke some
Y'all ain't want the smoke, been smokin'
Garden gnome shrooms, y'all, who is y'all?
This what it mean to ball?
Okay, Chateau Marmont, Shangri-La
Valet park it, drive a shit whip
But I ain't broke, bitch
Write my own shit, hit my own switch
Watched the clock tick, never ran and hid
Tell it like it is
Dead on the nail, call me hammerhead
Texas 'til I'm dead
BBQ and cornbread, like 'em corn fed
Here we go again, hit 'em one mo' 'gain
Screwed up from The Woodlands
Number six, been through Hell, think I'm Heaven-sent
Ask the preacher man, said I need Jesus, like I ain't know
Guess I found him, I am blessed, man
Rake in dividends, let the money stack, see you copycats
I ain't trippin', but copy that
It's a wrap, keep my distance
Where's Waldo, but we winnin'
Me and my dogs ain't finished 
The real know, what's a billfold?
You can't fold, I stay grinnin'
No peekin'
Go ahead and try harder
You ain't gotta ask to put up with nobody
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get on your damn knees
And pray sometimes with your muhfuckin' ass
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves
Get yo' muhfuckin' ass on out there
That's all you gon' be, a muhfucker
You oughta be ashamed of yourselves

They ain't knockin' no more
They-they-they ain't knockin' no more
They ain't-they ain't knockin' no moreImmersed myself in discontent
Hopin' you can only repent these things
It smells like ginger
What you mean, I ain't green like Timothy?
Dead leaves in the breeze‚ sweep your chimneys
See the boy try me‚ now the boy deceased
They put the blame on me‚ but hey, it wasn't me 
Like God can't judge me, but only God can see
I ain't bein' judged, no one judgin' me
I walk on water‚ pain and torture what I bring to these
And there's a war in my head, just like the Middle East
And I'm the flurry, vision blurry, see soliloquies
I didn't get the memo, didn't CC me
Only CC me when I'm doin' burglaries
And if it weren't on TV you wouldn't have ever seen
Fuck God, I'm a dog backwards
Backwards, I don't smoke Backwoods
What you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?
When you wanna get money, get them riches
Like what you sayin'? Why you prayin' for forgiveness?

Mood is always better whenever you not around

Fuckin' up a sweater and I'm fuckin' up a gown
Look at how I'm shinin' though
Look at how I'm smilin' though
Look at how I'm smilin'
Look at how I'm wildin', and I'm still broke, uh
You still think I'm a joke, uh, I still think I'm a joke, uh

Nigga that shit is broke, broke, broke, broke
Tell me, goddamn, what God made me for?
I don't even love no more
I don't even trust no more

Some things outside of my control

But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
I don't wanna take this ride
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
I don't wanna take this ride
Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white

Pouring bleach on the white, pouring bleach on the white, white, white
Pull out your mind
Oh, oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh, oh
Oh, ohToo many things I'd rather do different
Woke up in a cold sweat 
My emotions creepin'
Three o'clock on the weekend, might as well sleep in
Stay down for the count when
She hit me with the "what-ifs?"
And the "what-whens?" and the "what-thens?"
Wonder where my life went, living in the moment
I been thinking 'bout my time spent, are the bills paid?
Is it make or break? Will I find a way?
Have my feelings changed? Will I be okay? I don’t know
But what I do know is, life don't make sense
If you can't pay rent, so I place my bet
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away 
You left a spell on my Saturday
I got cracks in my phone screen
The past fuck with my psyche
Smoke weed and get high, please
Went to school in The Woodlands
And that made niggas wanna fight me
So I don't take threats lightly
Tell them niggas, "Come and find me"
Gotta say it in my eye view
New house off iTunes
New money, my perfume
Big smile, in a good mood
I been running out of issues
I ain't trippin' when the rent due
I ain't runnin' with a pistol
I ain't locked in the system
Taking care of my kinfolk
Taking a book out the page of the greats
I'm only human and I make mistakes
Chisel my flows so they can't liberate
Talking the time as the pendulum sways
I gotta face what I didn't create
Just 'cause I can't relate, I don't debate
I educate, illuminate
Or we can't duplicate, no more moving the plates
Second chances feeling overrated
Unappreciated, so I bossed up
Missed the time when we could share space
But it'll all be straight the day we cross up
Nothing better than some time with you
Because it's time I never wanna toss up
Lose myself inside of you, you find yourself in me
I don't wanna be cautious
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook on this Saturday?
I take my L and I hold my place
I split my L and I go away 
You left a spell on my Saturday
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?
What got you shook?La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
Hi, I live a wonderful life
Should've died twice, wonder who on my side
Life always better keepin' two on the side
Need no music when my niggas arrive
We be in Van Nuys, black van with some white guys
Keep your hand out, waiting for the appropriate time
To ask a question like
"Could you perform at my best friend's birthday party?
With your friends and go crazy, just bring the shotty
Bring the loud one with the blonde hair."
Making out with Zayn in a lawn chair
They kicked me out but I belong here
Hear these songs nigga, see this long hair, see these videos
Direct these hoes with no budgets though
How the fuck did I land a fucking TV show?
Met all my friends through Kanye West and I ain't met him yet
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
Just shaved down to the baby face
Clothes on me, guess it's Holiday
Fried, no sides at the restaurant
My sleep schedule like the power here, it's never on
Feeling like the past year a whole escapade 
Four cars, need a motherfucking Escalade
Pack it up like a clown car 
Bet you know my name from here to Hong Kong, bet I get along
Make some commas, karma, watch 'em sing along
Ayy, err, err, butter knife like dancing on a knuckle
In the thunder car, rocked up in the Lumma
Incidental, I be better by the summer
I be better by the winter, I be hoppin' in the rental
Maybe Tesla for all my missus sitting in the Volvo
Damn, shoot 'em down like, hmmm, sorry, do it all here
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down

La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
I'm moonwalking on the sun hot
I used to live where the guns popped
Made some records then we moved out
Turned rap into the new pop
Bandana, I'm the new Pac
I been blowing up, I can't stop
They need my niggas in the White House
I do business with the white folks
Bring that money back to black folks
Flip it, stimulate the cash flow
Economic, but I speak ebonics
L.A. turned me to an asshole
I been shopping down on Melrose
Still a nigga but I'm livin' different
I been looking at the bigger picture
So I don't hear 'em when they talking to me
I just want a friend to fall in love with
Maybe someone I can binge drugs with
Living like a prince but I'm dove-less
Playin' my emotions, you a dumb bitch
Everybody talking on some gun shit
They don't even know where to bust it
Cry nigga, gotta fuckin' kick back
Gotta leave those soft niggas at the kickback
Splittin' all my problems like a Kit-Kat
I finessed the night that we slipped up
I could let you know where I'm next at
Tell my baby girl where the brakes at
You know I got number one pick stats
Catch me on the field, it's a mismatch
More like an eclipse, she couldn't miss that
Putting my ideas where my chips at
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do not turn my volume down
Do not bring your friends around, only few I'm holding down
La-di-da-di-da-di-da, do I trust 'em? Probably not
I think that y'all prolly fraud, I think that my brain is fried

I feel just like Zayn, I feel just like Harry
I cop it and I flip it, have it sittin' on pirellis
Me and all my niggas, Southside One Direction
Tens and tens and tens and tens, got lens that make direction
Flow to my location, lowkey I'm in Cali
Just avoiding my probation, fuck your jurisdiction
Fuck the Federales, sold out by my father
He gon' feel the karma when I get the, get the commas, nigga
I don't have, I don't have no fear, nigga
Buy the ounce, sellin' ounces over here, nigga
I don't lie, I just bought a whole grill
Arguing with my bitch, my whip sit twenty-six, nigga
Lowkey I'm a heartthrob and I ain't drop an album yet
I'm something like a poster, sitting on your girl's wall
And something about my face make her take her clothes off
Y'all say y'all got bitches but y'all bitches make my dick soft
Why y'all always mad 'cause I'm feeling myself?
What the fuck you mean, I can't feel myself?
Old girl suburban but now I'm on to new things
Ego like celebrity but real like a dope fiend
Tanning out in Hollywood, got Chantel's on my coattails
From motels to hotels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good
From hotels to motels, I'm good, bitch, I'm good

They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
They say that they want me, they forgot about me
In the city I'm a menace, I give CEO's the business
Marathons I gotta finish, foreign whip is speaking Yiddish
Lately, I been feeling vicious, why y'all crying like some infants?
You don't wanna be a witness?
Then you better mind your fucking business
All these crumbs on my denim, we the only dogs spitting venom
Been some years I tried to tell them
But they wanted me to be the villain
They just wanted me to lose, ones I loved would make me choose
Had to cut the ones I thought I'd take to the top
Just so I could make a move
Dropped out of college, smoking the same campus
Tell me 'bout limits
Last year I was suicidal, took those thoughts and tried to kill it
Used to avoid, used to being paranoid, huffin' with my boys
Pack it up, I shake the world like asteroids
Give me love before you try to give me noise, I destroy

Motel, pig-pork
Swim through the living room, straight to the bedroom, lookin' for bricked dope
My papa looked at my mama, lookin' at that closet like
"There that shit go"
Two keys and a thumper, 10K with the mustard
A whole family and no buster, this don't add up
My padre facin' them three strikes
And my mama just smacked the pipe
Crack smoke got crash tight, this shit still bad, 'cause
The boys peeped a Brillo pad and some glass tucked
And it's lookin' like my parents was up in here runnin' all through that stash dumb
But the fact, crack different than coke
Plus the smoke wasn't close enough to choke me
Lowered scrutiny so mom could kick big facts for bruh
The truth is we held the bag for this kid we took in
Tryna part with his old ways, maybe we all mistook him
'Cause I knew something was fucked up when he said
"Don't open or look in this here satchel that I'll be back for in just a couple of minutes"
Then hella hours later, like do I cook dinner now or later?
Worried about cold food for a cold fool
Motherfucker put my family in danger
I blame myself, pardon my anger
I never looked inside his stuff so he never really needed to hide his stuff
When you showed me what was really inside this stuff
I never had a clue
Now I know as police, you gotta do what you gotta do
But this my family, all I got is us, my nigga
My own mother just shot at us, my nigga
This is why we here
And I don't fuck with niggas I don't know
But I had a heart to help this kid in danger, tears in anger
Gemini gettin' violently
Police silence don't help anxiety
My daddy's priors tame all of his wildin'
All of these pilots, not one of them flyin'
Y'all planning on trying?
This flight is diving, nose tucked
Po-po stuck, play your part
All this commotion and neighbors listenin' like, "Oh fuck"
Shit finna spark
All this emotion, need a decision made with some heart
'Cause ours is broken, they tryna lock the third notch on my pop's choker
This shit ain't kosher
Moms is oh for if CPS get sent them pages
I ain't gon' see my parents for ages
All this erosion, no more protection
Shit don't feel safe
What graduation? What degrees?
What dissertation? What imagination?
Imagine my whole world taken away from me
All over some bass and misconstrued melodies
My heart racin', clutchin' my red Ranger, pacin'
I can barely breathe
And mister policeman, told policeman, we got what we need
Just let 'em be
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
And if you're hurting, love yourself with my heart
And if you're hurting, love yourself with my heart
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me
Thank God that I'm built for the distance
Thank God for me, thank God for me
Thank God for my bitches still sticking with me
Thank God, when I talk, I know you listen to me

Nigga, talk shit, I'll single you out
If you've got a problem, we can figure it out
I'm from H-Town, but the gold in my mouth
Southside niggas put a hole in your house
A hole in your spouse
Better think twice 'fore you open your mouth
It's getting real close to the first of the month
Niggas hit licks, for the gas and the blunt
Send 'em to the doc, gotta open them up
Niggas load guns in the back of the truck
Niggas hate money til they laced with gold
Gotta get a gun for your hateful foes
Flex too hard and your casket close
You don't want your momma come
And get you from the morgue
Tall white T, blood on the floor
Oh, don't say that

Ohh-ohh-ohh, I feel like Master P
I ain't no slave, ain't lettin no one try to master me
I'm getting tested, tested, but nobody passing me
Ain't sugar coating shit, don't need them extra calories
It's a machine, that's why we work inside the factory
Put 'em up for me, display it, like it's a gallery
Don't need your salary, gold on me, like it's alchemy
Giving niggas the battery when they witness the mastery
Oh, don't say that, don't talk to me, we don't play that
They got chalk for me, I make outlines, like it's pottery
I got a squad full of fucking oddities
I got squash, apricots and broccoli
We turn weird shit to a commodity
I'm on a odyssey for real quality
It's like, oh
Yippy-yay, yippy-yay, hit me on my cellular phone

I look like a Somali pirate 
Failed middle school and college 
Daddy say I'm an asshole 
Dick complexion of a Backwoods 
She text me, dry as the Sahara 
After she get in that casa Merlyn 
I was in that mouth like flouride
That pussy tight as a hair tie 
Scrunchie, I'm so horny, baby, bitch, your house, pussy, baby
When I get the munchies I steal, I don't share roaches, baby
Bum with the good haircut
Bum with a good haircut, mattress and magic dick

Take that shit from me some more, I just need to be aloneShe said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Trade in that noose they put around us for a Cuban link
So my ancestors can see me shining, tell me what you think
I remember the illusions that they tried to move to me
That pollution still ain't stunt my evolution
What you choosing?
No chip on my shoulder, hunnid leagues under the sea 
We live life like cheetah power up like Hummer diesel
Golden chain for niece and nephew
Pessimistic, I do not hang 'round them boys
Metaphysics, need another dimension I can enjoy
She said, "Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?"
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you looking grimy as shit?
I'll make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Reporting for the operation
I learned that the beauty is in the creation
I added my detail for decoration
So baby boy, what's the occasion?
You dressed like you 'bout to take over a nation
Avoiding social litigation
When that admiration turns into abrasion
Y'all can find another station
Otherwise, stay tuned, evolution coming soon
Rolling deeper than a dune
Howling at the moon, I'll be back in June
Told my baby I'd be back in November
Did some Beatles shit to kick off this September
Crazy 'cause in 2010, I had some old friends
That thought I'd be another—
Go fucking figure
If I pull up out the tool
Riding still up on the roof
Seems like only legends do
Bitch, and that's the fucking move
She said, "Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?"
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Baby boy, why you lookin' grimy as shit?
I make the wristwatch flood, let diamonds fill my sink
If I got colors on my neck, what would my mama think?
We got the weapon tucked on us, make these boys extinct
Now look, look
Good riddance, goodbye
Out of sight, out of mind
Cutthroat every time
This time, I get what's mine
Where the hell is your backbone?
Ducking me like whac-a-mole
Looking like an inflatable at a car show; a spectacle
Lick my finger, bet I found the wind
I follow that shit wherever it blows
You hung yourself, that's not my fault
I just supplied the rope, ugh!
Most thoughts, I don't think twice
Make decisions I'll die by
Never asked for the drama
But I'll turn it into dollars
Dollars, dollars, dollars
"Do you think about me?"
Ohh, ohhI used to work for people
I made a couple hundred dollars, wasn't worth it even
I'm worth a hundred thousand
Not dollars but diamonds, I am mud out the bayou
Rip a page out the Bible, come and crucify me
I'm a long way from home and this ain't Yellowstone
I trade a white bitch for catfish and yellow bones
This from the catacombs, this for the broken homes
From the south side of cities where my granny home
I moved to California, I bring a Grammy home
I call up bill collectors, "leave my fucking family 'lone"
We left the corner store on the way to caviar
The coupe is mustard colored, what the fuck is Grey Poupon?
Young K.A., never quit your day job, uh
I bring the love to work, I need the day off, uh
I need the , this hard work should pay off, uh
The lights stay off until my mind is made up, uh
A young Zuckerberg, I wake up and make stuff, uh
These niggas copy us, they really need to pay us, uh
I'm from the city where your neighbors fight back
You talking shit, we bring that work right to your lap
I love my niggas like white people love rap
We make the shit you'll probably never say on track again
Walked through doors all my life, just to close them
Tore down walls all my life, here's to the other side
A whole new life
A whole new life
A whole new life
A whole new life
Back when I was hustling, ain't get no love from them 
I paid my own bills and came up with the illest shit 
I was tryna find a way to get my family out of it 
Spent my days in basements tryna write a motherfuckin' hit
Nowadays he's stumbling, they show such love to him
I shut it down to every show, we set the precedent
I'm just tryna show these niggas, life is on some other shit
Keep your head high, smile when the trouble rumblin'
I don't do what they say, it's unorthodox
Like bears sharing porridge inside with Goldilocks
Like Ozzy with no Sharon, he just called his parents
So fuck what I'm doing and fuck these damn critics
You should think for yourself, that shit is cancerous
Get my head rubbed by fingers of fuckin' hand models
Middle finger, fuck the hair up at all our concerts
Maybe if I cared less, I'd wear a hair net
But now my eyes, ten million by twenty five
Dropped out of Lone Star, booked flight from Lone Star
Was working a couple jobs and quit, became a star, uhI spent like a year and a half on the Greyhound bus
On the way to see this girl
Take a flight back just to keep my job
Used to fly standby, late to the airport
Where the buddy pass? Stuck in the traffic
Whole lotta hours, real long distance
But I've grown since then
Learned to be on my own since then
Marble floor in my brand new crib
This the life that I wanted still
Got a hole and it burn my chest
Mash the chip that's still in my shoulder
Ain't a day that I still been sober
These the things that I'm tripping over
Y'all motherfuckers made three albums
Still talking about the same shit
The one gay, the one selling drugs
The one that's tryna act like Lil Wayne
What the fuck is this shit man?
Y'all better turn this shit off when y'all get in the whip
When y'all enter my whip, y'all better not play this shit
'Cause this can go right the fuck off
Now them boys hooked on heroin
Parents always asking like, "Where y'all get it from?"
Rehab poppin' like when Amy had the single out
Single out the reasons how I quit before I fell down
I used to pick Ameer up
Talk about what's got us fucked up
We vent 'til the sun up, ay
Hopefully get our funds up, ay
And if I didn't know y'all
Maybe I would have a desk job
Ticking 'til I off myself...
Used to drive around for some hours 
Used to get paid by the hour 
Now I'm just pickin up my check 
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat 
Used to drive around for some hours 
Circle round the block for some hours 
Now I'm just pickin up my check 
Now I'm just pickin up a sweat 
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
I spent like a year and a half feeling sorry for myself
'Cause I thought love ain't make sense anymore
If I drank, you would probably see a fifth on the floor
And a hole in the door, rest a few more
Scared of the past I’ve been tryna avoid
From before I was born
Running from the shoes that my grandfathers wore
Tryna pick a better battle I saw on the wharf
Feel the sun in my pores but I still got clouds in my head, now
Rain for a little bit, stay for a little bit
Moved along with my head, down
That's what momma taught me and I never let them fuck me
When they handed me a dead king's crown
Told 'em think of what you doing before I'm the one you're choosing
I just wanna be a human when I share myself
Hear the things I'm saying and I scare myself, goddamn
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute , I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it baby
Be there any minute , I'll be on it, in it, baby
Be there any minute, I'll be on it, in it, babyWhat I gotta do?
Keep it real with you
Stuck inside my truth
Spendin' all my loot
Diamond on my tooth
R.I.P. my brother Luk
When I spit, let it hit, hit a double U
Couple rainbows, my lil' halo
Think it's J-Lo, bro don't say so
Homie don't play, no
Takin' my day slow
Takin' my ray, throw
Talkin' to angels
Speedin' a pave' though
Changin' a page though
Lookin' like ace, talkin' 'bout spade, you are afraid though
Spendin' my queso
All on some fake clothes
When I change, never say, this is my blaze throat
South Central
All my homies know
If I could go, I would just wait though
Anyways, gotta go, disregard what I say
Grain of salt, sprinkle some over the shoulder, ayy
Lucky Strike, filterless, don't push me, 'kay?
Sensitive, abrasive, stab you in the face
Keep a blade, heaven sakes, had to raise the stakes
Dracula, in a cave, a bit lonely, mane
Grab a stake, have a cape, it don't work no more
Fly away, different ways, hit the liquor store
Better days, follow me like the saddest song
Grab a case, hideaway, fill my loads with bleach
Couple stains ain't a game, they both hauntin' me
Lot to say, people hate, wearin' blindfolds
Now where did I go? Where do we go?
How do we grow? How should I know?
Feel responsible, intolerable, displaced , insane
Piss 'em off, piss 'em off, piss 'em off
Shit, I better set it off
I just made a deposit, CDG in my closets
Fuel ain't really made of fossils
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Spying on your ho from a SpaceX rocket
She wanna know why my wrist so rocky
Flash splash on me, photocopy
My weed, my weed at the party
Shoot me a sheriff for Trayvon Martin
King, Ali, and Bobby Marley
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
Dirt on me, I'm finna blossom
You know
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, wish you would lie
I wish you'd love me for life
Love me for life, love me for life, I will
Love, love me for, yeah
Love me, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for life
Love, love me for
Love, love me for life
Love, love you for
Love you forMy arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
My arms are always open, your fears always rollin'
In the deep, and you can't control it
What you want, what you want? Emotion?
I need to step out with no frustration
I need a permanent getaway vacation
They got a permanent hit list, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right
I could've been homeless
I thought I moved to orphanage for the summer
I could've been homeless
Before I had a goal, I had a course
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
Nigga, nigga, nigga, nigga
My people still dry snitchin' whenever they touch the mic
That's what happens when a therapist isn't somewhere in sight
Take flight, never leaned to the left, or the right
'Cause they turn the other cheek when our niggas start to die
When our women start to die, when our children start to die
I don't feel their empathy, we been displaced too many times
Every summer in the city start to feel like Columbine
'Cause you gotta get yours, and I gotta get mine
One time for the paragons of the paradigm
When you underground, they gon' only try to undermine
Use the track as a gymnasium to get into the stadium
You couldn't match my alien, I'm glowing like uranium
One time for the— one time—
One time— nigga, one time— nigga
One time— nigga, one t—
Nigga  nigga, nigga 
A million reasons to get rich, my nigga
50 did it right, 50 did it right 
Wish I could call every successful black rapper for advice
How the fuck do I make this shit last my whole life? 
What if they don't want to come to the concert tonight? 
 
Nigga  nigga, nigga  nigga
 Tuggin' on my pinky ring 
Smelling like chrysanthemum
 
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
 Tuggin' on my pinky ring 
Smelling like chrysanthemum
  
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
 Tuggin' on my pinky ring 
Smelling like chrysanthemum
 
I just want that, I just want that, I just want that, I just want that
All my jewelry, and all my niggas 
All my jewelry, and all my niggas got that, yeah  
Ooh, ooh 
And you know I got it 
Just give me what I need I gotta get that bag
It's a thug life, it's a thug life
I gotta get that bag 
It's a thug life 
It's a thug life 
Ooh-ah 
La-da-da-da 
Try to treat man like baby
Feel the teeth sink in like rabies
Boy you know you don't look fly
Dem gold chains turn your neck green, bye
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah-ah, ah-ah-ah ah
It's different reconciling with skeletons I ain't know I possessed
I sought perfection out in ways I no longer accept
I understand what I neglect in times when I obsess
I'm learning to confess, this fate is harder to digest
The biggest threat I'm up against is who I face in my reflection
Depression still an uninvited guest I'm always accepting
Can't help but meet the feeling with a familiar embrace
When I know that it'll kill me if I give into my brain
I see the shadows inside, they ten feet tall with no eyes
They put my head in the water and it's so beautiful under
The sun reflecting off the corals, colors I can't describe
To make the darkness divine
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
 It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ah
 It's a, oh-uh-oh
Ooh-ah
Sha-na-na-na-na-sha-ahTen, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!

Kiss the shoulder, hop in the Corolla
These bitches talkin' shit like the bottom of porta-potties
Bright ass yellow teeth, you a shit talker, gossip
Legs movin' like a salsa dancer
Drunk, fallin' out ya car like a flaccid dick
Aww man, god damn, what the fuck wrong with ya?
Say it to my face, pussy ass boy
Need a Altoid for your hot breath, life a hot mess
Pop your biceps, cue the roid rage
I think I got like five more albums inside my mind
This that shit, that do or die, make your grandmama cry
Keep some baggy jeans on me, keep a Billie Jean on me
Got that New Orleans on me, smellin' like a queen to ya
Cu—cu—cucumber lemonade, I need something fresh today
Barber make the texture fade, actin' out like it's charades
Strawberry sweater fleece, baby, give me something sweet
We don't gotta be discreet, moonwalking between the seats
Hit on that beat and then stop 
Hop on that booty like who the hell cutie
Like I don't know cootie
My momma ain't raise no bitch ass
Ain't no kiss ass, ain't no—
Get the fuck out of my face now 
Get the fuck out of my way now
You are so far off my level
Stop!
In the barber shop with my niggas, ay
I ain't never soft for my nigga, ay
I ain't never copy no nigga, ay
So quit talkin', bitch nigga,  ay
Ay, I wanna buy a Jeep, ay, that's my energy
Trilogy, that's history, Southside, baby, rest in peace!
Uh, lordy lordy, testify, yeah
Got explosives in my mind, yeah
Search for feelings I can't find, yeah
I'm a ghost because I grind, yeah
Made a deal with Father Time, yeah
Told me "Find a way to shine," yeah
"I can make you live forever
All you gotta do is dance until you die," yeah

Ten, nine, eight, seven, six, five, four, three, two, one, yay!"Yo, get——turn that shit over, boy!"
¿Cómo se dice? Don't touch on me with them dedos
I minimize all your credentials, I maximize all of my pesos
I want that dance that can do it, give it to me straight, don't dilute it
I'm one-handed like Odell, numb the pain like Orajel
Up and down like gopher bear, hand on me like "Oh, well"
What that smell like, oh, Chanel? Way too deep like depths in hell
Need a smoking shot of whiskey, down this bitch like, oh, they prissy
Talking smack, oh, don't get lippy, love on you, oh, don't forget me
Coming like—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Take it back—ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin' em—ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Radiation is present, got my reflection iridescent
Every little moment I step in, might shift the planets direction
Glitch in the system is present
You might wanna check the connection
I don't give a fuck about freshmans
I don't give a fuck about veterans
If your perception ain't ascending, it's no reason for extension
Of my energy, this shit only happens once in a century
It's elementary when all you speak is rudimentary
Paradiddles hidden in riddles; vapid and accessories
So please don't get it mistaken, opportunities taken
Didn't want to be patient, we had to fight for this thing
Ain't no acting complacent, the disrespect been too blatant
We claimed this spot from the basement, so tell me, who you again?
Oh you was this, you was that?
But now you washed and you hate it?
You taking shots with revolvers, I got two drones at the station
Hit the button, they might come and leave your legacy vacant
You paved a path we didn't want to get demolished with aging
We get money, get dough
Dame más mi princesa says so 
Even though my teeth not gold
Baby girl know our pockets drip folds
We get money, get dough
Dame más mi princesa says so 
Even though my teeth not gold
Baby girl know our pockets drip folds

No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Woo! Woo! Woo! Woo!I don't know why I wanna fuck with you
But all I know is that I really fuck with you
Really wish you didn't like to fuck with me
Wish you took that energy and trusted me
I get so exhausted when you fuss with me
'Cause all that time could be spent in love with me
I know I need it and you deserve it
You like to size me up to see if it's all worth it
I don't know where it is now, but I'm searchin'
I think you want what I don't ever want: be perfect
'Cause I ain't perfect, I just wanna be good to you
I would take my heart right out the hood for you
Wanna do the things I know I should for you
Standing by myself until I stood for you
If I knew this love, I woulda looked for you
But I'm glad you found me, I'm glad you found me

Split the diamond with us, fuck taking the bus

All 14-15 of my niggas
To figure, ooh, that's a step-back
Ooh, my nigga, that's a step-back
If I had to choose, I would not choose you
If I had to stop, I would turn around and choose glue
If I had to hit the brakes, I'ma stop right here

I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere
Shy, shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shy, shawty shy, shawty, shawty shy
Shawty, shawty shot me out the sky, well this one year
I was flyin' high in the pimp plane atmosphere
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long
Shit, high-waist jeans with a kid
Shorty always flexin' on the 'gram
Tight, tight jeans with a rack make me go on a rant
Shawty, but your attitude rank
Drunk at the club with your girls only here for the drinks
Untouchable data, unmeasurable playa'
God, the moderator, I ain't sayin', I'm hittin'
I was just wondering if I could call at your number
If I was ever in trouble, if I could take you home
I ain't a doper, you ain't a smoker
I'm hopin' to get to know you
I'm wonderin' if I could get you gone, girl
I was lookin' for ride-or-dies
And there you came through
With your fine disguise, yeah, yeah
I ain't fuckin' around no more
Don't hear me, all she hear was sha-la-la-la
If she could, she could see my final form
I could see you Majin Buu-in' on my Dragon Balls
What you need a map and backpack just to find the one?
Dora, Dora, come home, you been searchin' too long
We all gonna die one day, man ain't that crazy? 
She said thats an odd way convince me to be your lady
That be why you bae, but you is not my baby
I met these three black girls: Ocian, Jurnee, and Mercedes
One's a queen, one's narcoleptic, and one is crazy
Pickin' one lover's just like pickin' one daisy
I need at least a dozen in my DMs on the daily
Why get your nose stuck in one when you can sniff the bouquet?
La, la, la, la, ooo-la, la, la, la

I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
It doesn't rain in L.A
And I'm afraid to see your face
Flashback to the flash floods
And the slow-paced Texas days
We never change, no no
Forever was just a phase
I didn't mean to leave you lonely
I just had to do what's best for me, selfishly
I'll admit that
I'm in a fetal hold, I'm a weak man
I'm a weak man
I hit the ground running
Trippin' on my feet
As the distance between us
Became more than I can see
I hope you're okay
Yeah, I hope you're okay
I went to the beach yesterday
And cried 'cause I missed you
The waves don't crash the same
And the sun still burns me
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
I'll miss you for all my life
I'll love you for all my life
I'll miss you for all my life

This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
I can't stand it here no more
I've been banging at your door
I'm so lost in Hollywood
All that shit I put you through
I'm so sorry, I'm so sorry, yeah
I'm so sorry
But you won't wait for someday
We had dreams, married Sunday
But I left Texas, now you hate me
In this town where I can't breathe
Yes, I love you, but I can't stay
And you ask why, but I can't say
Still ain't find all the answers
I don't want to be standard
Surgeries, I've been tampered
Watched her fight and beat cancer
Wasn't ready to let me go
I wasn't ready for life without
Fear one day that I'll make that call
I have to face all my darkest doubts
I can scream when I think of what happens for a reason
Find my ways to fly with everyone, I lost when I'm dreaming
I don't wanna wake up when I get a chance to catch that feeling
Letting go, every second that I live until I stop breathing
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy
Somewhere out there they will say
He is mine, he is mine
This ol' sky, if I die
I hope I'm no random guy

I'm just a boy, yeah, I'm just a boy, yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy, yeah
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
You made me do things I don't ever wanna do
You made me say things I don't ever wanna say
You ain't act ways that are natural
I'd rather end up in disaster
Imagine me and you outside
When the wind can't hurt my pride
Imagine me and you in a car crash
Imagine me and you shared a last laugh
Imagine me and you hold hands
Fake ass romantics
Like all the niggas we stanned
Think that's a classic, damn
You let me share your couch with you
I thank you for that
You let me share your house with you
I thank you for that
You let me wipe my mouth with you
I thank you for that
You let me write my songs about you
And I hate you for that
And I can't get itI still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
If I had another
I'm a bad motherfucker
Got love for my mother
The city that protect me
I don't fuck with y'all like I used to though
But you could come around for the Houston baby, oh
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
Who the Hell am I?
Who the Hell are you?
Don't waste my time, I got shit to do
Been in love with you, don't know what to do
Still searchin' for the truth, every which way
Mental foreplay, bound by cuffs to you
Do it my way, like everything I do
Take my breath away
Don't let me fade away
May die before I wake
Not the type to play
I take, and take, and take
Never want a change
Always wanna change
Used to count my change
Everybody changed
Memories of the days
I was young at heart
Matters of the heart
Rearrange, reactions in my brain
Redefine my pain
Been wishin' I could change
Hard to change my ways
Trained a certain way
Afraid of my own fate
Just another phase
Lost cause and a lost child
Lost my way tryna change for the wrong crowd
I'm weak and I'll say it proud
Built me up, pull me down, let's air it out
Patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better
Just patch me up, and stitch it
Make me better 
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream that you took it all away 
Blow smoke in the face
I just hope your lil' bro grow to be great 
What a day, what a day
I just had a dream where you took it all away 
Blow smoke in the face
One in the clip, and one in the chamber 
We was riding in the dark, you were putting your legs up 
Girl, I don't know, maybe I should just stay shut 
Did I ruin your life baby, even from day one? 
If it was another life, maybe you could still save us 
I still remember writin' words down
Tryna get them all out of my mouth
Big boy, you a big boy now
Big boy, you a big boy now
Don't pout 'round me
Don't cry around me
Don't laugh 'round me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin
You ain't shinin' like me
You ain't shinin' like my cousin"Take it all or leave it"
I can't sleep like I used to
The world will try to tell you who you are before you get to
Explain yourself, your thoughts
Your motives and all of your reasons
Two albums every season, what the hell do y’all believe in?
Why the hell do y'all keep reachin'?
In the evenings when I see ’em
I tell myself that love will be the thing to keep us from grieving
Need something new to believe in
'Cause these new niggas'll change on you
I mean they change on you
Why the hell the BBC only writes about me
When it comes down to controversy?
What about three CD's in one year with no label?
Then we signed and our story turned into a fucking fable
I was that nigga in a room
With no motherfuckin' cable and no table
Now my mom call me whenever she need her car note
Cellphone, whatever bill paid too, y'all niggas losers
You don't understand why I do what I do, so let me do it
Get the hell on, let me do it, get the hell on, let me do it
I don't speak like I used to
I’m thinking of a way to change the world that I move through
I feel like Nikola, what I invent is what I’m true to
I feel for Nikola with these ideas that I grew through
I know that when they see a brilliant mind they'll just abuse you
It’s hard to feel what's real, some nights I'm scared that I'm delusional
I’m scared I'm more like Nikola than I'd ever collude to
I'm scared of what can happen when ideas will consume you
'Cause there isn't room for peace I can achieve
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
Hey, boy, stay rough, get buff, get out
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
The monsters swarm 'round with them toys
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time 
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time 
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
It's the best years of our lives, motherfucker
You are now about to experience
These are the best years of our lives
I feel youI can barely rap, I can barely dance
I can barely laugh, I can barely hang
I want a male stripper to do a belly dance
For me and my boyfriend, that's entertainment
And I'm drunk as fuck, my niggas tuxed up
I need a reason to get my bucks up
I need a reason to care about society
They need a good enough reason just to hire me
But honestly, you see my mom can't walk
And her lungs don't work like they used to
I feel like it's my fault 'cause of music
I be saying shit that's just fucking rude and untrue, and
But truthfully, the words had damage, and it's cruel to me
But even more cruel to be
Dissing you in front of niggas that pay to hear me
Sometimes I be wondering, why I been tripping off it
I should probably spend my time
Writing rhymes in the dentist's office
That's killing two birds in one stone
When I was younger, way before I was grown
I wanted a deal with Death Row or Rhymesayers
I'm saving my time for mics later
I might save it, depending on the shit that y'all write later
I hate writers, I hate tweets, I hate journalists
They hate truth, they hate peace
They want my niggas to burn with us
Flicking on the face of my wristwatch
Watch the time stop just to speed up, watch life unfold
And between the tick-tocks, speeding down the one-way
Fuck these signs, fuck these lights, put my life on the line
When it feel right, I'm fine, no, I'm not lying, don't ask me
I'll pay the fine, I'll pay the toll, just hope I don't crash it
But hey, if I do, it will be a blaze of glory
Engulfed by the manifestation of death behind me
All my life I've felt inadequate
And through the years I've dealt with tragedy after tragedy
God, send a message, send a messenger my way
Never claimed to be a saint, forgive me
Feel like the light that I was blessed with has diminished
I'm haunted, by the visions of my youth turned true
I've come to expect my expectations aren't true
But I'm a master of believing my lies
And you can't break me, and I can't brake at the speed of light
I'm afraid to share the bed, what if she want money later?
Like she got laid off, uh, hit my lawyer for some paper
I'm afraid to speak my pains like, "You lucky where you at"
"You cool, but quit complaining 'bout all that"
That's why I'm showing up late
I'm not tryna be a dick, but my time is not to waste
For my shell, fuck the small talk with my sensei
Where my sense at? Four-cylinder go round
Lincoln Town Car pick me up, drop me off
I got bubble under my biceps, sneak me into the sidestep
Ego is getting sized up, I be on butterfly effect
Fuck it, I'll be myself now, tell 'em I take no shit now
Tell 'em they work for me now, tell 'em my tears, they bleed down
Tell 'em I work, like, what, what time for me now?
Wondering "who is me?" now, wondering where you been now
Lose you in crowds, I see now, 14, I see 'em all inside of me now
Bank account move like speeds now, make it from ways to feed now
Thinking of ways to be everything but right now
It's crazy how things feel the best
When reminiscing 'til we check ourselves
It's crazy how people who left
Say they feeling left out when we step for health
Still accustomed to nights filled with solitude
I don't always remember to call goodnight
I don't always remember my altitude
I don't always remember to stop the fight
But I might check my sight, it ain't right
Yeah I know, but my strife overwhelms, every night
Until I'm forced to close my eyes
Brain disease, parasite, eating me from inside
Emotions bleed, I can't believe
How I'm slipping through the nightWhy you look like that? 
He look crazy as hell
But he dress well 
Why his face look puff?
Why he look like that? 
Why your hair like that? 
Why your teeth like that? 
Why your cheeks like that?
I got this shitty moustache, and a new haircut
Short but tall enough to ride every ride so it's fair enough
Teeth crooked but my breath fresh just like the evergreens
My attitude is bit like, a psys- fuck!
You mean psychopath
I bet the marble feel good on your bare foot
I'm in the backyard hiding out like I'm Bigfoot
And I won't cater to you
Yeah I am not Carrabba's, and I ain't taking orders
Here for the loot, and to inspire some of you
To do what you do despite all the "fuck you's"
'Cause they shit on your shit, stab you right in the back
'Til you're shittin' on the toilet with Grammys in your lap
Niggas talk a lot of shit, in a safe place
Aiming with they keyboard, they shootin' uppercase
I'm booking tour dates, money in the suitcase
Commander and the chief like, Barack Hussein
Same nigga, two names, I am onto new things
Flying out of Houston, lemme say a few things
I don't give a fuck about you or your screen name
I'ma be a star even if I say the same things
'Cause them same things keep me on the wavelengths
I dropped another verse, so you gon' have to pay me
Glock with no safety, seen niggas on the pavement
Over gang affiliations, guns with extensions
Seeing niggas get anxious, all these internet gangstas
I'm running outta patience, nigga, stick to your day shift
And watch what you're saying, and please keep praying
'Cause niggas talk big 'til that price on their head
I feel the voices always drown out all the noise in the room
They don't employ you for your purpose, they just need a platoon
Another number in a line ready to march into tombs
I ain't the one to assume, I put the coon in tycoon
We colonizing the moon, I see you look to the sky
And start to wish it was you, sometimes I wish I was me
Sometimes I'm watching my life
I'm dissociated from what eats my heart up at night
Sleep on a cloud of my strife
I ain't afraid of the heights, they all afraid to appall
I'm just afraid of excitement being a trip to the mall
I need a summer to fall, I need a winter to spring
Got all these seasons within me, building a story to sing
Don't need a dollar to dream, I need a billion in facts
I need a trillion in wealth, y'all niggas need to relax
I wanna build up the culture, they wanna dream in the trap
I took the zoom off my lens and I saw the world in my lap
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in the bag, all my niggas in the bag
I'm not tryna be like you, when I grow, money in the bag
Keep the sand in theMy male role models drug dealers and thugs
My father learned how to solve problems with guns
And when I grew up, I learned what racism was
And what teaching it does, and like my teachers would say:
"Little Black boys have a place in the world
Like hanging from trees, or dead in the street"
Like I seen on TV
All them boys they killed, they looked just like me
Not like Brandon or Chandler, but Malik and Kareem
I was born with a target, and it stuck to my skin
And I learned in social studies, I was one of them men
Who were locked in the chains, but not locked in the pen
But I'm bigger than that, I'm the beginning and end
I'm the sun and the moon
I'm the light and the dark, I am life in the tomb
I'm the pharaoh and slave, gentrifying my spirit
It's like a knife in the womb, refuse to act like a parrot
Or to dance like a monkey; see, your stance is apparent
That's why I'm here for the money, don't care to cater to merit
Y'all fetishizing my spirit, I see your culture’s dependent
On what you didn’t inherit, won't let my world be attempted
I'm staying distant
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high?
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over?
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust?
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped?
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? 
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? 
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? 
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? 
Who gonna be the reason why I get high? 
Who gonna be the reason why I turn over? 
Who gonna be the gunner that I don't trust? 
Who gonna be the gunner that get they ass whooped? 
Bum, bum, beat 'em, I would never wanna be 'em
If I catch 'em slipping, they gon' have to meet the eagle
Bum, bum, beat 'em, treat these niggas how I see 'em
I don't need you either, send you right back where I seen you

Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running, run
Running thangs, running, run, running, run, running thangsI grew up all alone, my mom and dad fighting
I moved around a lot, I did a lot of fighting
I met my friend Ian, I seen a lot of cyphers
I did a lot of writing
Watch my uncles duck indictments
I'm used to ramen noodles, victims of mental illness
Products of neighborhoods with broken souls and wounded spirits
Don't judge me by appearance, I moved to California
Started getting paid,  shit's already boring
Dash into the money like a hyphen, fuck a pipe dream, man
Had this shit when I was in my diapers
Burnin' through my diapers, hot shit, that was hot shit
Back when niggas looking for the Loch Ness
Stuck 'round dip spittin' assholes, make they mamas bashful
Got holes in my pockets so my shoes full of cash though
Cigar, Fidel Castro, car full of Castrol
See the sunset when I backstroke, can't swim, but I could act, though
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends
Imagine having no friends, ayy
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
I was playing rock paper scissors with imaginary friends, ayy
Imagine having no friends, man
Ayy, ayy, imagine having no friends, manThere's not a soul in here
Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer
I used to be broke, I don't got amnesia
I used to deal with both, now it's black victims
She know not to call collect if she go to prison
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat 
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat 
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
At night I bring them out, I was sleeping upside-down
Keep you up, I come around, they stay right up on my tip
Send me a pic whenever you slip, hoping this outflow my scales
Full throttle whenever I blaze, fifty mil', put it under my wheel 
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC wide open to my skin
They can see they run, they feel like they been kicking DDR
Bustin' out the bar, human of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back 
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat 
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at? 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat 
G-P to S and figure, where you niggas at 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask thatTuggin' on my pinky ring, smelling like chrysanthemum
I just want that, I just want that bump, bump in my trunk
Blowing skunk, getting crunk with my baby, oh, what's up?
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump in my trunk
We gon' ride, ride, ride down to Mexico
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
You can see the bad man, I'll come to New York
You can't catch him though
We gon' ride white lines all the way to Mexico
Merlyn, Merlyn!
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live 
I've been trappin' out my momma house
Dope boy money keep the water and the lights on
Spray it, like it's Lysol
Your bitch don't like the dark so we fuckin' with the lights on
I fuck her with my chains on, you the one I changed on
I just won the ghetto lottery, I guess I'm hood-rich
Chillin' at the gallo, smokin' Blacks with my hood bitch
You ain't what you could be, come get on this dope dick
I sell it by the gram, now tell me who you fuck with
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live
And when this ends
At least I'll have a reason to live 
Watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me, watch me operate
I ain't here to talk now, nigga, we ain't gonna conversate
This modern terrorism, you can't moderate
I've been fiendin' time to put these demons on display
'Cause they don't understand, I don't give a damn
Smoke some shit straight outta Alice in Wonderland
BROCKHAMPTON the clan, bitch, I ain't your man
Like they're stacking just to crumble like an avalanche
This is how it stand, this is how it is
Bitch, I ain't your friend, I ain't havin' kids
'Cause I know that if I'm gon' bring him in the world
My little spawn of Satan just might take off with your fucking girl
Bump, bump in my trunk, bump, bump, bump, bump

I guess that should not matter
You were loved by another man
I guess that should not matter
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
You love to show out
When you leave the house
Your new outfit
I love it on you though
I love it on you though, I love it on ya
I love it on you though, I love it on ya

I came to California
I cannot afford this
I just want a fortune
I don't wanna pay no mortgage
I just want life for my kids
Damn, I ain't even have 'em yet
I'm ballin', and it don't stop
And it don't stop
I can see my life through the window glass
If I move with you, I don't need no cash
Had a dream last night that she loved me back
Keep God in my head, so a nigga bounced back
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened, so the past is perfect
Shit happened how it happened
Fell in love, but it ain't gon' last
Hydroplane like I ain't gon' crash
No frame with my face on glass
No rank when they check my class
Got a minute, got a second, got a day
Gotta get it, gotta find another way
I ain't tripping, I'm just feeling what I say
I ain't talking, I'm just spilling from my brain
Everybody think I got it figured out
Chasing sanity while niggas chasing clout
Show me love in the face of all doubts
That would tell me all I need to know about you
Ain't nobody gon' love you like me
Ain't nobody gon' trust you like me
Baby girl, I know we can save the world
So why you wanna fight me?
You love to show out
Show your new outfit
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love it on ya
I love it on you, I love itI done been in trouble 'bout as long as I remember
My momma tried to help me but I hardly ever listened
So she sent me to them white schools, I learned that I was different
They told me I'm a nigga, well, now I know I am
I got my finger on the trigger, I'm a project baby
A free-lunch felon, and I'm hungry every minute
Empty stomach, weed smoke can't fill it
If you don't listen to me, I set fire to the building
Need to listen to the children and the weapons they concealing
Hear the voices of a million when I sell my first million
I am bound to go diamond, ain't no luck or surprises
I am tanning on an island
I can feel the pressure, but I see my new horizons
Me and all my niggas getting stars down on Sunset Boulevard
But niggas from the Southside with Xan bars and gunplay
Niggas on that "Someday..."
If you shooting for the stars, you only headed one wayToday I'ma be whoever I wanna be
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be
It's a boy fantasy, it's a girl fantasy
This is our fantasy, baby boy, boy, boy
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be

Flap, flap, flap your wings, go high
Go high, go high

And everybody here is all the same
Life's a disgrace
Today I'ma be whoever I wanna be

Flying on my rocket ship , I'm on an acid trip 
I need another pill, snort and let it drip
I'm with my white friends, we getting wasted
Trapped in the suburbs, we suffocatin' 
We get all our drug  and education
"You came with black folks?" Hoe, your parents racist
You say they hate me? Well, I love them
We still roll up, we still best friends 
Everybody smilin', I don't see what's funny
Everybody friends, guess I wasn't lucky
Family full of athletes, I was kind of chubby
Shit was never sunny, wrists were sorta bloody
Lick my wounds with honey, save me for the vultures
I'm fallin' in the void, I don't know what I discover
I know I could hear the thunder, I can feel the hunters
They be preying on my hunger, I won't let 'em make me suffer 'cause

Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?
Oooh, take a moment
Do you take a moment?
Do you take a moment?I felt awesome when you walked in
You caught me doin' something
That I should've never been caught with
I played the forest, my far trip
I tripped and I fell, still think I'm living in Austin
Remember when I was trippin' off some wack shit
When I thought the automatic had an answer?
When I was jammin' out Beyonce like Sampha
And you broke up with me 'cause I'm a Cancer?
Our relationship was toxic, cancer
I fell in love with a dancer in Atlanta
I'm lying, I ain't a Drake-ass nigga
I'm more like Troye Sivan
With a whole lotta mela-nahn
Sendin' bombs to your lawn
Grew up on Rockafella, so I'ma get a chain
And sing every song in the vain of your name
And this'll...
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, ooh
Be there when they call me up
Save me wishin' for you, I'm missing you too
Miss the way we talk, miss the way we stop
Miss the way we talk, oohAll I do is work and pray 
Tryna' find a place to stay 
Tryna' find some food today 
This shit is real hard okay? 
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain’t it? 
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? 
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly

It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So it's Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
I just saw my P.O. 
He like me, though 
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
7 days a week though,  it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

Ay-yeahh, ay-yeahh
Ooh, ooh, oo-ooh, oohOn a palace floor I see my soul
Banging through the doors, we swing 'em closed
We need glass or something strong
For the creeps when you come 'round
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost
I wish you knew me
I wish you knew
I’m everything I am
I’m everything I am
But you don’t know me
I’m everything I am
With everything I am
You don’t know me
Hold me down, I know I've lost control
Picking up all of my dirty bones
Oh I know there's something wrong
Freak me out when you come round
I feel like fucking on the west side like bullets out a gun
These strangers coming out about twice as strong
Yeah, I know you say I miss it but come on baby please
Just know you come off strong, your soul is getting lost
I wish you knew me

His car ain't nice and flashy 
There’s something about him

There's something about him
I know I got to have it
And oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I really like how you do all the things that you do
I really like how you say all the things that you say

Your legs on the dashboard 
So tell me what I'm to do whenever I'm missin' you?
Tell me, do you love me? I, I
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
I move mountains on my own, don't need nobody's help
I've been lookin' after me like only I can watch my back
Lovin' me and it keeps hurtin' me
I hate it when I lose control over my heart
You know you really turned me on, right from the start
Just to hear you call my name, I call to God
Selfishly, I keep it all for me
Usually, I don't wait too long, but for you, I might
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
I don't wanna blink and see you out 
Pressed up on my body, like no doubt 
I don't want us movin' too fast 
That's a damn shame, but it gon' make your man insane
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
Show me all the sugar I've been patient for
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Show me all the sweet things you've got in store
Pour some more of your sugar on me
Where's the sweet thing, when I need some more, babe?
Show me some sugar when I'm feelin' lonely
Obvious why we relatin', baby, just don't keep me waitin'
Come be my sugar, baby
Spendin' all my nights alone, waitin' for you to call me
You're the only one I want by my side when I fall asleep
Tell me what I'm waitin' for, tell me what I'm waitin' for
I know it's hard but we need each other
Know it's hard but we need each other
Back and forth
I'll take that if that's all you askin' for
With my legs up on the dashboard
Only thing in my pocket is my passport, pa-passport 
Taken my heart, all over again
Watchin’ my man, watchin' his body
Look at his body, oh-oh
Oh-oh 
So, do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me, love me?
Do you love me, love me? Oh
I'm your candyman
I'll be your candyman
I'm your candyman 
I'm your candyman 
I'll be your candyman 
I'm your candymanStill the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
See, I've been trippin' and fallin'
No more slippin' and stallin'
Got no numbers I'm callin'
Just wanna be in the coffin
All this trouble we've been causin'
Benz I'm crossin', I've been saucin'
Exercising my endorphins
Since you told me you were walkin'
I've been searchin', huntin', crawlin'
What's it costin' me? It ain't doing much
Tossin' me through a loop
I hush the voices in my head
For a minute so I can listen to you
And all I heard was
"I ain't listening", shit is cripplin'
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?
Still the only one I do that with
Still the only one I do that with
Ain't that some shit?

I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
I got rubbers in my pocket, niggas like to gossip
If I need to drop 'em, let me know
'Cause I don't do much talkin', unless it's 'bout the money
If you got an offer, let me know
I was sellin cabbage, until I moved to Cali
Money in a mattress on the floor
Until I messed with niggas with fingers on the trigger
We was runnin', kickin' in the doors
Niggas on that word of mouth til' they see them boys come out
I ain't ever robbed a nigga, best believe I air ya out
See me in your area, y'all niggas hilarious
I'm addicted to writing shit that make niggas scared of us
I use protection, my nigga, so fuck your lecture, my nigga
And fuck yo' section, my nigga, I got the rest of my niggas
My niggas rushed on my niggas, my niggas love all they niggas
I fell in love with that nigga, that nigga skipped out the picture"This is Quadron, and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Holler at ya"
"Yo, this is Kevin Cinema and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1."
"Ay, this is Matt and this is Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
"Hey, what's up, it's Shawn Mendes and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."
It's too damn easy, to hide away, or run away
For me they're both the same, I just need a reason
Before I choose to stay before I choose to say "I love you"
These three simple words, have caused me so much hurt
Ooh, la, la, ooh, la, la
I feel it, I'm feeling, those feelings, I feel them
Ooh
Was told the beauty's in the details
But I'm not the type to say how I might feel
Started in high school, got my diploma
Then dropped out of college, always been a hard-head
Lacking in knowledge
But goddamn, man, when will this end?
I need new friends
And maybe it's okay to fall in love again
"If I dedicate myself to one thing, I need to focus on that
If I dedicate myself to something else, I need to focus on that
To try and do all these, and do the road, do stand up, and do a television show and then try to deal with our marriage and our home? Something's gonna give. Something's gonna give and I don't want to do that."
"And what's the most precious to you beyond family?"
"My comedy."
"Comedy. Not the sitcom, not the stand-up, just comedy?"
"My comedy."
"Being able to create truth..."
"Right."
"And enjoy, and entertain"
At this point, you're pretty much out of my mind
But when I close my eyes I think about you every time

Confederate flag , neighbors call me "fag" 
Gotta keep it low, I keep that thang up in my bag
Whose society is this? Who delayed my first kiss?
Who command my scholarship
And kick us out our neighborhood?
Play our music, make 'em rich, play our music, make amends
Box us in like plantains, free all of my Africans

I got a dream I'm willing to die for
I got a team I'll commit a crime for
Got some dead homies I ain't get to cry for
'Cause I'm working for my freedom, while the world cry war
Cry wolf when the shepherd finds a way to strike gold
'Cause the stocks gon' crash and the dollar gon' fold
You don't know that the poor eat the rich when there's no profit
They gave you the floor but you brought up the wrong topic
So it's
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the world
Me against the worldI got some demons on me, they been feeding on me
When I sold prescriptions, and my pill addiction
Fuck the damn detectives, momma called the Reverend
I know she praying for me, but I'm in the shadows
Hella drugs and ammo, kicking doors, my MO
I got some bad habits, I do some shit I shouldn't
My life is on a scale, I know there's angels on me
All my dead homies, I know they waiting on me
Selling dope from out ya house, I know you praying for me
I know you used to trust me, I miss the chicken nuggets
And the kisses from her, damn I miss you momma
Trouble keep following me
Trouble keep following me, oh yeah
The shadow keep following me

And Woody Harrelson 
Just in a restaurant, 
I was walking down the street on La Brea
Will Ferrell and Woody Harrelson are—
They looked old. He had a shaved head
Well, yeah, he looks old. What movie was he in?
I forget

Nineteen, I got my first boyfriend

I remember being younger watching Space Jam
Told my mama that I wanna be the bald man
Got older, goals changed, needed God's plan
Got older, got a chain, nigga, god-damn
Shit is gold and it hurt me when I walk man
And I ain't got it but I just got my advance
So I might cop it, yeah, nigga that's my energy
I might tell these niggas that they ain't no friends to me
'Cause I'm tired of these niggas sucking clout up

I just bought a scale, now e'rywhere a traphouse
I got on TV, then I turned into an asshole
'Cause I ain't selling dope or running with them bad folk
I'm eating shrimp and lobster, sitting next to white folk
Now I'm in Trader Joes with Birkenstock and iPhone
My agent called said they want me in the movies now
They used to call me ugly, turned 'em into groupies now
Now I'm on Melrose, I'm ready for my closeup
They call me pretty, need to put me on the poster
I write my name, then I buy a Testarossa
I kill my haters then I leave 'em for the vultures

God-damn, man, I think I need a therapist
Feel like a goldfish in the bowl with
Twenty other goldfish with the bowl switched
Bowl-cut or the mullet 'til I shaved it
Barely made it but I'm still here on my kickstand
Did the same shit that duffed Whitney Houston
They was boostin' while I'm slurping from my sippy cup 
Need blue jeans, pulling out the pocket fluff 
Talking to myself like I am my best friend 
When I walk, see the arrogance flushing 
Make the front page like Paris in the sex tape 
Barely late to my first date with my therapist
: Joba]
Brrr! Call me, I'll be running in my, Asics
Gold plated belt buckle 'round my, sweat'ns
Tube socks, white tee, Polo underpants
I will never grow old, call me Peter Pan
Dial *67, when they need to listen
I move just like a phantom, I should have been a teacher
Handing out these lessons, my pupils ask no questions
They like to think they're special, I feed them graham crackers
Got my Timex in the mail, keep it in the case
They tapping lines every day, I cannot be traced
I don't believe in credit, my people call me different
I evade, then get paid, brr! Just a second
: Merlyn Wood]
Trusty press, wear the colors of the ocean
Skeetin' sad in my Supreme clothing
Hit my line if you ever need an OZ
Don't hit my line if you think you know the old me
Have gassed-ass plans in the e-class
And I'm still getting head on public transit
And I'm still really sad about my last chick
And I'm still 'bout to cry outta both heads

"Yeah, you know, that's what I was explaining to somebody. I said I didn't mind gettin' jerked because I was like, I just want my record on the radio, I just wanna shoot videos"
"...And get it popping"
"I just wanna get popping. Look, I don't care—take my publishing, I don't know what that is anyway, you know what I'm saying? Like just take my shit so I can have a video and songs on the radio, I'll figure it out later"
"That's crazy, man"
"And then the next album, I'll start and I'm like, damn, these checks ain't like the checks I'm used to niggas seeing. I'm not being able to get four or five cars or jewelry or things I wanted to get, so I'm like let me figure out what's the loophole in this shit. Why I'm not winning"
"But isn't it crazy that it makes you question what kind of friends you had back then? Because they weren't telling you how the business was running and they were just—"
"See, that goes to show, maybe they wasn't never really my friends..."This is everything I ever wanted though
Dreaming of a candy store
Brother couldn't tell me more, no, so
I need moments where I could be left alone
Yeah, she let me ride along
To a place where I belong, woah, though
If you niggas ever get your money right
Would you still be robbing niggas?
Would you still be lying to yo momma? No
Don't you know I do this for your family?
'Cause mine ain't believe in me
Left my hood so easily
Eat, sleep, wash sheets, repeat
Watch teachers teach
High and on the damn sidelines where the bleachers be
Always feel like city streets, wish I was back in my sheets, shit
Most days I don't wanna be me, shit
Don't watch this, teen watch TV, shit
My whole family look like some Gucci shit
Shoutout my hood, they racist as hell, shit
I'm 'bout my papers like some damn immigrants, bitch
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas still fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been set up
I cannot explain it
Dropped down to my knees beneath the stars and started praying
Life put me here for a reason, I am not complaining
Look me in my eyes, I'm not here for your entertainment
Do you follow?
I ain't here as your role model
That pill is way too big to swallow
I hollowed out my path
Borrow all my sorrow but don't expect me to take it back
I been dripping candy paint, grew up Willow Avenue
Turned a right on Yellowstone, you see what them players do
So I chuck the deuce who make us home to Herschelwood
And shout out to my cousin Mo, he got off a prison sentence
Lock him in a penitentiary, he ain't takin' niggas with him
Or his daughter either, so send the lord to keep her
'Cause the police killin' fathers, man, it hard to keep 'em
And that's what's in my blood, besides the oil and reefer
I'm in the black slab, tryna catch the reaper
It's a four inside my cup, I crack the seal and fill it
It's a hole inside me, I try to pour and fill it
But in the bottom, another monster, there's somethin' with it
I'm still that little nigga with the little twisties
Waitin' for the bus, and I just missed it
That's why I'm still hungry, why you robbin' niggas?
That's why I dream bigger, fuck a couple dollars
I want a hundred million, and one for all my niggas
And twenty for my mama, she need some bigger ceilings
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I, fly
I'm waiting on the birds to call me I
Oh I, oh I
I'm waiting on
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed up
One day I'ma get my bread up
All my real niggas been fed upDressed in the same shit I wore yesterday
Yeah, it's still fresh, never flexed clichés
I never write a verse and repeat the same thing
'Cause the sheen on my chains is my calling to fame
Made in the projects, slave to my progress
I only fuck a black girl if she wearing contacts
You ain't gotta talk you still blocked from my contacts
She hit me on my MySpace she ever wanna find me
I'm way too fly to drive, too drunk to call a cab
But I still need a ride to fit a couple girls inside
Oh what am I to do? I rent an Uber for the week
It's just another whip on my back, and we don't pay no tax
'Cause where I come from, ain't no body getting shot by the IRS
The trap ain't free, better realize that
But I'ma get money, no tests on the desk
Fuck the SATs, smoking Sunday's best
Find me in the ground, only time I regress
Six feet down, no I'm not there yet
Won't you meet me in the grave? I got grass on deck
So a grave like a slaveship, candy colored spaceship
Space like a white girl but ride like a Lexus
Leather with an accent, designed by Italians
But he ain't got medallions, so maybe he a Mexican
But really what's the difference?
I don't know difference
Mirror black and white like a pilgrim
Plymouth landed on me like a kickflip
Y'all repress this, oppress this
Question next is why my mentions so menstrual?
I be going ham on Ray Street eating tofu
Loiter at the Whole Foods, sipping kombucha
Yeah, I went green but the black'll still do ya
Damn, she used to be my number one, past tense
Past time chillin', evolved into the villain
Sunday school friends in search of second circumcisions
Nah, keep your opinions
We was mall rats just cheesin' for the pictures
Now who can circumvent us?Dun-dun-dun-dun
Dun-dun, dun-dun
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
Let 'em in, kill 'em then
They proud of all my fuckin' friends, missing me
I think I fell in love again in Michigan
Let us stay for more pain
Let us stay for more rain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more brain
Let us stay for more days
Let us stay for more pain
Let us pray for more rain
Let us pray for more rain
But who really knows, yeah? 
But who really knows? 
Wild child
Been alone for a while now
If you gotta turn it down, down

Pólvora y accidentes
La navidad nunca es el mejor momento para mí
¡Ah Dios, cómo extraño a mi familia!
A veces salgo y me fijo en los aviones que sobrevuelan mi casa
Enciendo un cigarillo y miro al suelo
Manteniendo mi cabeza baja por los próximos días
Con mis zapatos atados
Pero bueno
Casi terminamos muchachos, casi terminamosFalling for the wrong one
Feeling like the right time
But at least I felt something
Think I’m losing my mind
I’m in need of your love, I just need you right here
Sharing all of those things, whispering in my ear
Tell me what they can’t know, show me what they can’t see
Tell me all the ideas, they would never believe
You see I remember my home
I remember those trees, I remember those pasts
I remember the breeze, I remember the reason why all of those people that passed
Remember you opened your heart for a second
Gave me your time for a minute
Remember the tone in your voice when I told you that I might be coming to visit
But maybe I’m tripping
You catching me slipping
Down this road again
But this time I ain't falling
First day back 'cause the demons keep calling
Look at this world and I start withdrawing
And its so hard not to fade, see its so hard not to fall
But I gotta find peace
And I gotta find sleep 'cause I don’t see it at all
So I’m going, going, going, deeper and deeper
You see I’m finding it out before my spirit gets weaker
I got a fever, fever
Been feeling sick in the head
I need a doctor, doctor
Or just one more cigarette
I’m saying
Falling for the wrong one 
Feeling like the right time 
But at least I felt something
Think I’m losing my mind
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
If I die alone, then I probably deserve that
You can turn your face up but don’t act like you ain't heard that
Oh yeah she fine
Soft from behind
Like I’m running out of time
Yeah she hurt your fucking feelings with that
Ass of hers
Dunno just to what I’m feeling with uh-
Get on her

I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
I'm just a boy yeah, I'm just a boy yeah
I try way too hard, I'm just a boy yeah
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guy
It's so mm-mm-mm-mm-mm
Texas sky, if I die, I hope that I'm no random guyOh, try to keep your cool
You got a grip, baby
But you just can't seem to fall
You know what we are
Took for granted, fell, we catch ourselves
Don't worry, baby girl
There's no one in the world
But when you say I got a girl
Say it and I know it's killin' you, yeah
When I say you make my knees so weak
Then you know I'm missin' you
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Send me to California
I'm tryna get so lost
Not turnin' up to a 9 to 5
Just wanna know why
No plate on a white Lexus
I blacked out on a random cliff
Summer nights, I saw things change
And you still not right to my tick
Pleasure, something
Deep inside my chest
Long nights, long drives
Change across my face
Cowboy, ride it
That's my wild west
Come on babe, you can put it on us
Come on babe, you can put it on me
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girl
Yeah, you know it's alright

Yeah, you know it's alright
Do you know it's alright?
'Cause I've been thinkin' about you all night girlBaby child
Lift your head and free your mind
Open up your eyes, and you'll find you will fly
Just smile sometime
Welcome to the real world
Everybody pray for peace when they don't have the power
A disconnect of intellect
Know some people packing straps, you could call 'em cowards
The realest Gs I ever met
Not on the gangster shit, not on the paper shit
Just on that have to provide for my kids and shit
There's blood on the streets
And if I had a dream, I would do anything, I make mistakes
The shit that you hear about ain't just in movies
Dog, I've seen some shit
Bag 'em up in body bags, zip 'em up and send 'em
Away from the kids
I know good felons, good drug dealers, good people
Bad system, bad people
With power
If you gotta dream and you know what that means
You can do anything, just make a change
Sometimes I think back to the ninth-grade campus
When that white boy made fun of my lips
I should've thrown a tantrum
But I remained cool cause he was way too handsome
Now I'm out in Beverly Hills using a mansion as my canvas
I bought a helicopter, threw that bitch on stage
RCA gave us money, we ain't throw it away
We took that shit, we flipped that shit
We made this company pop
They like me, I want 'em to love me like them niggas love Pac
I'm De La Soul meets Tribe Called Quest meets Oasis inside a G-Unit vest
I moved way out to the West side
But still got the South in my heart
They murdered Selena, now them niggas looking for God
Dressed like a soldier, told ya, they don't know who we are
My vest is on, let 'em know we ready for war
In the club with my boyfriend
We paranoid 'cause, we might get popped
'Cause a nigga on some bullshit
Why you wanna hate me now or ask the skies to lay me down?
I hear my brother praying now, I really need an angel now
Some type of holy savior
Ayo, Dad, do me a favor, could you pick me up later, later, later?
I've been exploring through the Joyful
The Sorrowful and Glorious Mysteries
Historians romanticize notorious victories
The visions say the scorpion was born as a centipede
That partnered with the succulents to poison their enemies
I tap in time like telegrams with telepathy
To share the bare necessities of all my discrepancies
Can't save my Macbook pages spillin' onto the melody
'Cause the margins 'round the pen
Couldn't keep up with my head again, uh
I kept that devil in my sights to never fall behind
That's how we always stay ahead, the flaw of my design
The higher that you climb, the more destructive your decline
I’m well aware that all this didn’t have to quantify
So tell me if you really think it's unrealistic
Here at this point for me to not prepare and arm our district
They shouting, "Hands up," while they deploying their ballistics
We shouting, "Hands up," and kids who need it go ballistic
The difference in our League of Extraordinary Minorities
Against the identity, representing authority
Move between 'em accordingly, and clutch my rosaries
Before they try and send the lord for me, that's more for me
That's when the forerunners told me: "This is not your speed!"
While they repeated their beliefs from the Apostle's Creed
The most consistency I found in life has never come from people
Still looking for an equal, nobody will believe you
God ain't give me a penny, I made a million dollars
I got a thug for a father so I took care of my mother
God threw me in fire, I walked out with my brothers
You know the Shadow of Death?
I was born in the valley, but now I live in The Valley
God gave me a house, God gave me depression
God gave us life, but we ain't know it was cursed
I was hurt as a child, you know I still deal with it
Now I'm a grown-ass man with immature-ass feelings
All I wanted was money, just to get it and spend it
On strippers and weed, I ain't skip on the liquor
I can't talk to my niggas 'cause if I say it, it's real
And I ain't ready to face it, I've been flirtin' with Satan
I've been flirtin' with women that like to dance when they naked
And I throw all of my dollars, I throw all of my problems
To the back of my throat with weed smoke and klonopin
I'm ashamed of myself
About three days ago, I planned on killing myself
But I'm still here breathin', you know I'm still here screamin'
Screamin', "Fuck that shit", we signed for fifteen million
And I almost missed it, I know that y'all niggas hear me
We found a light
Will you still carry me?
When I fall
Let the hope and the joy
Rain down on me
Rain down on me 
Raise me up
Carry, carry, carry meNo quiero beber agua hoy
No quiero caminar por el vecindario y ver cuán perfecto es el mundo
No quiero hablar con nadie
Solo quiero pararme enfrente de mi casa y ver como se hunde en mis llamas
Ojalá pudiera pedirle a mis amigos que se salgan afuera
Ojalá pudiera haberlos salvado, uno por uno
Pero todo se ha ido
Me pregunto a menudamente si yo seré el proximo
Summer, lo sientoSouthside, brought the wave back 
Hair nappy, need a wave cap 
Same state where Trae at
That's the reason for the mothafuckin' ASAP
That's MOB, nigga 
Why you all dressed up, why your teeth messed up
Why you look so lost, nigga 
Don't get it twisted, down in the Dirty South
All we do is floss, nigga, that shit lit
Boss nigga, that one me
Ain't got time, can't no nigga take mine
That shit our shit, lose it? No way 
I'm over it, I'm over it 
I'm on and in and out it 
I'm nauseous, I'm nauseous 
It hurt to think about it, oww!
I've been riding 'round with my people 
And I always put it down for my people 
She ain't ever caught them Southern feels 
But she gon' catch them southern feels
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the Southern love
Scumbag from the Lone Star state
Come around here?
You could be the next nigga on The First 48
Niggas run around with a snub .38
Gotta hold it down and protect your 28s
'Cause since 18
Nigga had a dream of that thang on the spokes
Got my mouth froze, got them thangs on the low
Who the fuck spoke?
Don't mind my southern drawl
Got a pocket full of stones for all of y'all
If he up, then watch him ball
Plot to make these niggas fall, shoot through walls
Take they money and they keys
And don't come back without it all
Screaming, "Fuck 'em and we ball"
I've been riding 'round with my people 
Always put it down for my people 
She ain't ever caught them southern feels 
But she gon' catch them southern feels
'Cause I get it while it's hot
I get it non-stop as I watch that body rock
Swanging through town, banging through town
Let me slow it down as I get my money right
Got this ice on my wrist, candy painted Lexus
Finna' hit a lick with my squad
Got a muddy cup of the purple stuff
Take a puff, get buck, feel the southern love
Sock tan, pack of 'Ports
Dirty bitch, might double-cup her 
Smokin' gas on the porch
Guess you could say I'm burning rubber 
Head is good, so I learn to love her
My dogs talk in numbers
My iPhones got iPhones
So all my friends can talk to me 
My flip phone even switch lanes 
My bitch got that lipstick 
Like candy paint, lick it off
Fuck me, then piss me off
Alexis, get my ren' on
Alexis, get my ren' on
Curve me, curve me 
Bitch don't hit my phone, CUT!
Heard everything's supposed to be different 'round here
Gotta make sense of shit 'round here
It's like everybody wanna hit a lick 'round here
Guess I gotta stop giving shits 'round here
Been looking for a sign or some shit 'round here
Grind hard just to get a fuckin' grip 'round here
We don't sit 'round here, big shit 'round here
You a target if you don't fuckin' fit 'round here
Better charge it to the game, nigga 
We all going insane, better find a fuckin' lane
Doing digits in a Range, nigga 
No guts, no gain, no pain, no fame
We are not one and the same, nigga
I could change your whole life, we don't need no hype
Just to get shit lit for the night
We could set it off on a fuck nigga on sight
Riding, riding, rolling with my Southern niggas
Riding, riding, rolling with my Southern niggas

Mama sent me to that white school 
Prove I could speak like them white kids 
Act like them white kids 
Smoke like them white kids 
Fuck that! 
I'm the all-Black Johnny Cash!Padre Celestial
Soy tu humilde servidor
Te presento mi necesidad de esperanza
Hay momentos en que me siento impotente
Hay momentos en que me siento débil
Rezo por esperanza
Necesito esperanza para un futuro mejor
Necesito esperanza para una vida mejor
Necesito esperanza para amor y amabilidad
Algunos dicen que el cielo se hace más oscuro justo antes de la luz
Rezo que esto sea cierto
Ya que todo parece oscuro
Necesito tu luz, señor, en cada sentido
Rezo para ser llenado con tu luz de cabeza a pies
Para disfrutar de tu gloria y saber que todo está bien en el mundo
Como has planeado, y como quieres que sea
Ayúdame a caminar en tu luz, y vivir mi vida en fe y gloria
En tu nombre rezo

Pardon the, uh, technical difficultiesYour lipstick burns my lips
But I think I'm still in love with you
Your eyes drip black
But I think you're still in love with me
But it feels like there's no air to breathe again 
And it feels like I'm drowning in love again 
I'm afraid I'll lose all that I have again 
But I'm ready for the truth 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
I've been a fool 
You say I care too much
But what does that even mean
You say I need some space
But what does that mean for me
It feels like I've fallen and fell again 
And it feels like there's no hope for us again 
I'm afraid you'll leave me for a better man 
But I'm ready for the truth 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
I'm so lost in love 
My head was spinning 
I lost, I lost it 
I've been a fool 
Ah-ha-haNo soy como los demás
No hago cosas solamente para divertirme
Siento como si en los últimos meses hubiera estado sentado en ese bowl gigante de cereal, el mismo que solíamos comer de jóvenes
Siento como si estuviera flotando en la leche, medio ahogándome
Puedo olerla en mi ropa si respiro profundamente
Ojalá te pudiera ver como antes
Acostados juntos a ver quién de los dos se dormía primero
Quisiera repetirlo
Te extraño, te amo
Pedazo de mierdaCut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through
Thank you notes came falling out your mouth
Never wished for you to see it, was never what we were about
Only color in your eyes when you look me through that blue
Now you're sinking 'cause the water risin' up around your collar
If you wish to call me over, I'd be right around the corner
I'd be in the water with ya, I'd be sinking with you
But you
Cut your thighs
You want me blind
I wish you cried too
And lately I, pressing your time, shaking I'm through
Stay clear, ah
Stay clear, ooo
Stay clear, ah-ahh
Stay clear, ooo
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
Hold me back or I'll fall on cold old light
Come to us for fixing your sore mind
Hundred thousand miles gone to form your lie
Comatose and left on a fault line
The fault line
The fault line
The fault line, yeah
The fault lineEverything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
I know who you are
I know the type of niggas you let in your car
I know I'm not special babe
I know everything you hate
The freckles on your fuckin' face
Makes the most sense to me
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
Two, O, O, seven
Two, O, O, eight
Two, O, O, nine
You, I can't relate
You, a different place
You, a different space
You, I hesitate, for you I never wait
Never wait
Everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damn
You're everything that's perfect, damnI want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want your number in my telephone
So that I can call you all the time
I want your number in my cell phone
So that I could be the one tonight
I want you in my 
I want you in my phone, before I let you go
I want you in my phone
I want you in my, in my, in my arms againI chainsmoke 'til I choke
Have a good heart but bad health
You would never know
Where can you turn at the end of a road
Let myself go, I know I'm at fault
'Cause I'm not who I thought at all
Smokescreens in the dark
I just drink and drive
The freeway eases my mind and I can cry on my own
Going 95, no one on the passenger's side
But the person in the rear view's telling lies
You could end it all if you'd like to
And you can drink a fifth and, uh
Drive to, um, wherever you'd like to
'Cause, well, nobody likes you
And nobody feels like you do
Plus, nobody understands the weight of the
Broken heart that you feel, so fuck it
You might as well just get real high and stupid
Rent a motel room and drink away your issues
It could be so simple, nobody wants to help you
They laugh and smile because you're different, you know
It's all your fault but you stay well-tempered
You've always had your wits about you
You hide away, so mental
And I'm glad you stay reclusive
You have a wound that's self-inflicted
And in times like this it's too late to fix it
The weight of the world couldn't change you
But if you died, no one would miss you
So here's to another night alone with all your fears
And all your demons, your deepest darkest secrets
The shit that keeps you from sleeping
It's better when you don't think about it
But you don't have the power, 'cause I'm your master
Speed up and surrender, this time is different
So indecisive, no wonder why she left you
One of the many reasons why you'd like to
Put a bullet in your head or veer left off the highway
You're walking a tightrope at your lowest
Now you're hopeful, but that'll change when the night falls
You're a waste of a lifeform
You should do what you couldn't do this time last year
You can hope and pray all you want but nobody cares
Death waits for the time comes, and the time's come
Shut me up if you'd like to
But you're a coward and you know it's true
I'll be here if you need me, up to you
That's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys
And that's okay and I don't mind
I think you're kind of perfect
You blend in with the guys
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Sometimes I feel like I gotta tip toe around
Around you, around you, around you
Sometimes I"Where you going? Um, what happened to y'all's house?"
"Heh... Me llamo Roberto... Eh... Bueno... ¿A dónde voy?
Acabo de destruir la casa y nunca más me verás...
O sea que no sabrás dónde voy."So I built you a house
Tryna find revenge in the dark
I think I know where you went
Tryna find your spirit is hard
I think I know how to spend
My weeks are evil
Your brother don't want me here
Your family hates me
My parents don't know I'm here
It'd be better if you loved me
But he told me love myself and that's true
It'd be nice if you could help me
But he told me help myself and that's true
The sky ain't gon' be fixed tonight
I know for sure the sky ain't perfect 
I'm swimmin' in a sea of regret
The more I sink I forget how to swim
I try to breathe, I know the feeling too well
Of fighting myself, I'm losing again
Why am I here? Cold and alone
The sea ain't a home, but it's still where I lay
And still to this day, bad credit with karma
Lighting blunts underwater
Still ain't goin' too well, so I keep to myselfHa ha! Yo , that last one was amazing, them boys was hot
God damn, yes they was
Let me just formally thank y'all before we bring out the last guests of the evening 
We just wanna say thank you, 
For coming out to the 16th annual "His Or Hers Potluck"!
16 ... It's been 1, 2, 3, 4, 5, 16! 
God damn! 
And Jessica, let me tell you something about them yams, baby girl
You leave that Tupperware around here 
I'm gonna have to put my dick in it and impregnate your yams 
'Cause I'm going to fuck them yams up, baby girl. 
Sweet ass yams, 
Jesus Christ, God damn
Let me... okay
Well, the last headlining group of the night, they go by the name of "BROCK..."  "BROCKHAMPTON," yes
These boys is coming straight out of southeast Texas 
Hotter than chicken grease 
These motherfuckers, I'm going to say the name 1, 2, 3 times, 
BROCKHAMPTON, BROCKHAMPTON, BROCKHAMPTON 
The thing is about BROCKHAMPTON, is that it's a group
But it's a bunch of niggas in there 
It's a bunch of lil' niggas in there
So go up on the names, my man
Okay, let me tell you, It's uh... Kevin Abstract... 
Joba 
Matt Champion 
Ameer Vann 
Merlyn Wood 
Dom McLennon... 
And my personal favorite, 
Rodney Smoothback Tenor 
God damn
Rodney smoother than some motherfucking butter on some toast, let me tell y'all, baby girl
Also, wait, there's one more on the card!
Okay, we got, we got this boy... uh... ah... bearface 
Bearface, yes, that's his name
I don't think he from around here
He sounded like he was from Scotland
One of them niggas from the last Highlander movie
S... where the fuck is Scotland?
I don't know man
What the fuck is a Scotland? 
Or Iceland
He... yeah, he, he not from here y'all, he, he from the, ah... the eh, the, not the America 
The other parts"Who are you?"
"Eh... Me llamo Roberto y... La verdad que no creo que nadie me recuerde después de matarme esta noche."It don't make no difference
What you say about it
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
Summertime, I got my head out the window
Your car smell like weed, it's that good Texas Indo
Back when nobody believed in me except for you
They don't accept you, unless they get to dress you
Technically speaking; it's making me bitter
I'm too high to focus, and more weed got delivered
What could make our life simpler, send it straight to my liver
Send my name out in flames, and then it crash in the winter
I showed up boy and I checked out the same day
I signed in boy, and I logged out the same date
Oh, mmh, mmh, ayy
My OGs told me, "Do it my way"
Texas boys, everything is sideways
Might upload the whole tape to MySpace
I like the music blown out, that's just my taste
Keep the vinyl packed in some blue crates
(Look up at the stars if you start to get lonely
It's crazy this all started with just us wanting some money)
Yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah
What do I want out of life, what do I bleed for?
So many shoulders, I can go and lean my head on
But I still smoke and crave respect from those that cheer on
Wish I could focus more on what I get my cheer from
Who really know you, who really love you? I wanna see
I gotta hit you for a mission and, yes, we outspeed
So many take the high road to let the pain seep
I need to learn a lot in life is a one-way-street
Yeah, the ghost where Waco is, only time for takeout
Not a lot of room in this world, so keep your gate up
I'll meet you at the driveway, call Matt out
With the lights on, bright for real, drive back out
Yeah, jet-lag for pilots, only flyin' to islands
All them taxes filed, money gettin' piled in
Green by the millions, turn to envy by the thousand
Love to bring me down in the depths you drown in
It don't make no difference
What you say about it
No, no, things can't stay the samePadre, gracias por mi familia
Te pido que los bendigas con tu favor
Proveeles sus necesidades
Te pido que los protejas del daño y la maldad
Rodéales con la sombra de tu ala
Ve delante de ellos y prepara su camino
Si su camino está torcido, te pido que lo endereces
Protégelos de las trampas del enemigo
Y evítales del engaño
Dales paz perfecta a sus corazones
En el nombre de Jesús te lo pido
AménAyy boy, 
Ayy boy, calm your ass down boy 
You know what I'm talkin' about?
This that down South nigga music
This that Whitney Houston, museum, movement music
That them niggas ain't used to
I bought a car that I can't scoot in and there's some clothes that I just looked at
Ever since I heard we playin' Coachella
I took a stack and made a rap and I ain't never look back
It make me sad when my parents wanna come to the shows
'Cause I diss 'em in my songs and they know every word
All my niggas get along but their egos berserk
'Cause we finally getting money and the girls wanna twerk
And I love doin' Perc', I had to buy me a Perc'
I gotta purse for my nephew now his classmates stare
"Oh, your uncle a rapper? Is he Lil Uzi Vert?"
"Nah, my uncle is gay and they think he a gimmick"
How the fuck I'm a gimmick if I'm up at the clinic
Gettin' tested 'cause I take dick so motherfuckin' often
Bitches better calm me down before I motherfuckin' toss 'em
Ayy, nigga
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Sleeping upside down, keep you up, I come around
They stay right up on my tail, hopin' it's a fishscale
Human, I see through your eyes
Until my CCC and see blood in my skin
They can see they move my feet like DDR
Hangin' out the car, dreamin' of the tour
They grip three types of the gas, miss the days I can't get back
Hope the dollar kill me last, hate the way they really see me
Christina I move like genie
My nose wrinkle lot like Jeannie
Regal feelings, I steam it
Hop in the four and I’m speedin', bleedin'
She wavin' out the backseat, ayy, gettin' nasty
Killa motion, phone beep for the C4, bitch I'm coastin'
Swimmin' in money, I know that they love me
They pay me in hundreds or pay me in gold 
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist
I feel alone, I sold a piece of my soul 
I don't feel love anymore, where did it go?
I got a heart and then filled it with holes
Dipped it with glitter and gold
I wanna die, but it's some shit I should buy
Feelin' so empty inside 
The more that I get, the less I can feel
The more that I smoke, the more I forget
I hit the road with my bitch in my whip, that's all
Somebody help me now, right now
Oh, somebody check it out, yellow
Please, somebody help me now, right now
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist 
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my bitch
And I got diamonds that's hurtin' my wrist 
I light the spliff when I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Alright, yeah, woo! Now nigga, what's the word?
I got a thousand dollar one-way train to Luxembourg
I'm drinkin' whiskey with no ice, I feel my stomach burn
I made a life I want, I know that make your stomach turn
We sprinting slowly towards our ending, how will you submerge?
I'm drownin' daily in my seat that's why my dreams absurd
I'm noddin' out behind the wheel, don't know 'bout who concerned I'm around you when you answer
I'd feel better if you sent a sign
Lonely when your friends around
Solo 'til the sun go down
I just wish that I could read your mind
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight
Wildin' out 'til tomorrow, could be my only lotto
Kicked out of my momma's house, back when I was suicidal
I ain't even smoke, he taught me how to shoot a gun
Why the fuck you get me drunk and leave me in the road?
I need a way out, so sure that I could get out, ugh
And I'mma hideout, highways I could find out, one
Ride that bank like a 6, you're the reason I lace
My shoes in different ass ways
Call me after midnight
Pull up on your lawn like
Baby boy, are you alright?
Call me after midnight"Hoe, do you ever feel like you don't belong?
'Cause I know sometimes I feel that way."
"Si? O sea... no sé... Hay días que uno piensa
No sabes cuál es tu sitio en el mundo, no sabes cuál es el sitio en tu grupo de amigos, no sabes cómo... No sé... O sea, sí... Hay días que uno no se siente cómodo en su propia piel... Y es duro, es díficil... Pero... No sé... uno..."
"Nice pants."
"Gracias..."Lyrics from Snippet
Listen, you look so different to me
It's like you barely even know me
You was missin' for me
Swear I'm tired of feelin' lonely
Like, field mob song, trill mob boy
She been MIA far too long, so far
Now catch the conversation, change the conversation
Dollars all I'm chasin', ain't talkin' money, fuck is you sayin'?
Non-comprehensive, money finish sentences
No, I ain't sensitive, nigga, just highly offended
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans of that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me 
Every time I tell you differently 
You and him just split, you tryna get with me 
Money be my interest, gotta get the green 
The topic today, be the wallet
My lady be spendin', investin'
Whatever you goin', I wallop
Now I get out departments, wylin'
Why my jewelry looking like tuition to college
Whatever you do, do not stop it
If you wanna salad all up in your pocket
I must be addicted to only the process
Walk up, buy the diamond, the riches
Whenever they hear this, I wonder what this is
Stop in the field like the different to bridges
I feel like, this year we run that shit back, and I better keep hittin'
One of them rings on the finger like Rodman and Jordan and Pippen
I had epiphany, I wanna three-peat
I split the wave and they glisten like 
Back of the truck with the stack like I'm Scooby-Doo
Waggin' that tail like I'm chuggin' Don Julio
Bitch in the back and they starin' like, "Who are you?"
Bangin that Southernplayalisticadillacmuzik, that "Hootie Hoo"
Clutching my
Clutching my
Bankroll, lump up in my jeans of that bankroll
Bankroll, limpin' when I walk 'cause of that
Bankroll, never show all them that green, I keep a
Bankroll, I keep a, I keep a, I keep a
Now I'm on my shit you try to get to me 
Every time I tell you differently 
You and him just split, you tryna get with me 
Money be my interest, gotta get the green

They might give you cancer, shit, shit, shit
Wring your wrist and take a swish, swish, swish
Big hole, flushin' out the script, script, script

You make me feel like such a loser
I don't wanna be sober
So I can lie to my lovers
Got sad and said I loved her
I was high, I ain't mean it
I ain't lyin', I got problems
I'll leave for no reason
Make love with no feelings
I be your nigga for the evening
In between the bridges filled with kerosene
Are words we never said, turned into a routine
My feelings still remain unseen
Can't intervene with anything that's on the screen
When life is playin', they play games and expect me to pick a team
I can't win, I can't breathe, everything ain't what it seems
I played my case and then erase my underlying self-esteem
I know it's awful for my health, I know it all becomes extreme
I can't redeem from this regime that's invaded all of my dreams
From the asphalt to the steam, we found a theme then made a scene
At the moment that the guillotine was the only vaccine don't intervene
Shit ain't been the same since I was 17
Fuckin' up is in my genes, I think I need a quarantine, yeah
Chain-smoking, got twenty things on my mind 
Fake feelings, when I hit it from behind 
Consenting to my heart's demise 
I fall in love and fall in line 
Tip toe-in' in tap shoes when you're sleepin' in the corner 
Leave before I fall in love with you, I'm a self-proclaimed loner 
A novice with a master plan 
Genuine but fraudulent I'm not a hypocrite, I'm human
I make mistakes to make sure I never repeat 'em
Inhaler help me breathe in South Central hot
Smoke like a chimney, I hope I don't get got
And I ain't had no pussy in two months
I been busy man, I been working man
And I ain't called my mom in three days
I hope she miss me, man
I know she love me, man
All these feelings bottled up about to set me off
And most is extra meat that lingering get cut off
Yeah we've been making money, yeah we've been making guap
While you've been walking in the meeting's 'bout to suck some
Dick
I left my bitch in Malibu
I left my smokes up on the roof
So don't forget who you're talking to
If I bring it in existence it gon' come true
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way
I know I make mistakes, I try to not repeat 'em
But I'm still working on it, negotiate with demons
I stop fucking girls the first time I meet 'em
And I don't talk to strangers about my new arrangements
I got big dreams of selling out arenas
They comin' out to see me, white folks in the meetings
And they smiling at me, but I'm the same nigga
Point them hoses at me, send the dogs for me
The matter's over-complicated, oh
But I'm never overcompensating, ooh
Spinning around makes it harder to pave my way
Resting my prize will make me end our love either way
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
I don't got much money
But I'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alright
Yeah we'll be alrightFlip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
I just dropped out, I got my liberty
Acting like hot celebrity, actually I'm a rapper
Please, you a drop out?
No food in your mouth now
No weed in your mouth now
And no you in your mom's house
That don't sound so bad now
'Cause you ain't got no more bed now
And all them niggas you banked on
Is backing out like a ringtone, that's pop, lock and drop it
So I had to take that pot and ziploc it
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
Flip, flip mo nigga
Flip, flip phone
I'm smoking blunts with Barack
Money inside of a sock
Stage diver holding my cock
You busy holding the block
And I've been refining my vision
You make the decision
We flexing in public, you love it
It's bullshit around me
I'm living above it
We too busy getting these buckets, nigga
Higher than the summit for the nuggets, nigga
Work on the canvas like Samo
I'm off the chain like I'm Django
Never been one for the labels
What do you bring to the table?
Nigga, stop speaking in fables
I'm a young misfit looking for the quick flip
Left hook take you out of this district
Watch a nigga's soul leave his existence
Hit a lick then I hop on my nimbus
Vicious
Flip, flip mo niggaYou are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control
You are my drugs, you are what I need
The love of my life, you kiss me, I bleed
At night when I fiend, I'm grinding my teeth
I get high when you speak, if I could jump I could fly
It's so cold in the clouds, but I stay in the sky
And I see you on the ground, I guess it wasn't the same
You know I smoke and you drank, we ain't one in the same
I can't remember your name, but I remember your scent
And I remember your face, and I remember the…
And I remember the days, we wasn't stuck in our ways
Not a subject for change, I'm just a rat in your maze
And your venom’s to blame
You are just poison, I put that on my grave
No need for aggression, I just need to behave
But your love is poison, I put that on my soul
Pull me down with seduction, I know that you want control
Poison, poison
Poison, poisonHey, kids? 
How you feelin'? 
You feel alright? 
I wanna be more like a child, they question everything
Like, "Momma, where is your wedding ring?"
The dust still settlin'
Aight then, I'm settled in
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
I'm tryna go in, I hope you niggas know it
Young boy, I ain't heroic
They hurtin', free they soul bitch
You poor fool, think you know it
My boy got the heater loaded
So I don't trip too often
Reportin' live from Kaufman
These my dawgs for life
Until I see a coffin
Them trees, they got me coughin'
I'm ridin' around, I'm cautious
We yellin', "Fuck the law, bitch"
We finna get it started
We youngin' and we wildin'
That bread keep multiplyin'
That pain just keep on comin'
Bring that Holy Water, we fuckin' underwater
We jackin' off each other on the beach, then cum in the water
That's that Holy Water
That's that Florida shit, that 305, that guala, guala
Might not see tomorrow
Wash the evil from your heart, that's a verse I borrowed
I see y'all boys tomorrow
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out , we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, yeah
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out , we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down 
I'm that nigga from the East side, ready to bang out on your set
I do not care 'bout who in front of me if they ain't handin' checks
Holdin my dogs down to the right and I got my baby to the left
Both of 'em been on high alert for any sign of disrespect
So where your head at player?
You in the mud or you in the clouds
You with your plug when the shit went down
Now you both got blood that you can’t get out
Hope we don't drown, niggas is clowns
But it ain't no ringleader in that circus
Rollin' up dreams, smoke away my purpose
How a nigga hollow with a bulletproof surface, damn
Push start, baby, like she drive a Benz truck 
You ain't got no money, she don't wanna link up 
And if he fuck up, it's one call to the mob 
Pull up 'round the corner and we make the block hot
No reassurance, this here, I burn it
I got insurance for the way I'm 'bout to shock the systems
About that action, blow the pistons
Cut ties, better learn 'bout subtraction
Can't keep up, get it out my system
What we missin'?
Need that boom, boom, boom, boom
Drop it out
We bring the mob out, we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out , we finna mob out
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy
Leave your jaw down, yeah
We bring the mob out , we finna mob out 
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy 
Leave your jaw down, ayy
We bring the mob out , we finna mob out 
Fuck around, leave your jaw down, ayy 
Leave your jaw down, yay
Did it last night I heard you say 
Love 'em all but dying, 'cause I was in the way
Well, if you don't mind 
I think I'll leave 
Leave 'em all together, means everything to meI sold that dope in the dormitory
I know my roommate informing on me
I told my momma she shouldn't worry
Start taking student loans from the country
I will pay that shit off 'til I'm forty 
I don't want to have to make McFlurries
Sellin' students single sacks got boring
My college kids facing keys like both quarters
My thug life to every lad sandstormin'
Set up shop, exhibit product like it's a car show
The shit is pure man, while he sell the Sweet'n Low
Catchin' hell in my BM convertible
Deep Dallas in the winter, place so hard
Put that gold jump rope on the floor

You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
You, you, you
Money dance with my crew
Yeah, you ain't knew
I had bands back in school
F—fuck with the cops, they beating the cases
I see the pistol 'round waist and they aiming
White doesn't fly with carnations, they pain me
Family need a little sleep and serenity
Popping cherry cola like her virginity
Confidence sink on the brink of a better me
I keep an eye up on your bitch in bed with me
Knowing that you will just bet on the death for me
I got the fragrance, throw me the cologne
Sipping so long, they love your cologne
Fuck the percentages, I want the leverage
I want the leverage
I be reserved, I do not blurt
Keep out my face with your petty little urge
Life like a blur, learn 'bout the curves
Skin and my body, I've been insecure

I am from another dimension
Better step to me with nine hitmen
Freeway Ricky I'm a line kingpin
This present moment's a divine vision
Saw my past and took a dive to dig in
Couldn't make myself a pot to piss in
Motivation lacking my decisions
This felt like a holy intervention
I put that pack in my undergarments
Them boys had locked the pharma department
Packing up pills at the base apartment
I didn't taste it, thought it was garbage
Never had figured to ask who grabbed it
Noticed my friends had developed habits
Men and women both reduced to savage
Just to satisfy what needed scratching
MDMA mixed with bad karma
Spliffs from Newport's rolled with marijuana
Someone broke and sold the plug
Sent the law to his moms to put a slug on 'em
Boys woke him with the straps out
They ain't know about the stash house
Couple decades got evaded
'Cause he moved the last piece before he passed out
: Kevin Abstract]
Self, hurtin', hurtin' my
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself, hurtin' my, hurtin'
And I got diamonds that's hurtin', hurtin'
I light the spliff and I float by myself
I need some more time to find more of myself
Hurtin' myself
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing
I keep dancing dancing 
Dancing, dancing, dancingAnyway, I ain't much for the cold
In your car, I felt lost
Cut her legs covered in scars
And erase my doubts for long
But I couldn't lie, you swear and you cry
Your teeth rotting while they fall onto mine
Pouring bleach on the white, won't bring them to life
Pliers twist to the right, pull out your mind
Say you've lost your way and come to ask the way out soon
You always knew
Please don't stay far, I wish for more
With youThrough the quicksand, the wind, and the bush in between
Someone has to shine
The boys of the wild found each other during their time of need
And chose to turn to each other in order to grow
Learn, learn, share, hope
Running away from home, facing the fears of the real world
Maintaining to hold on to the idea that connected them all to this is difficult
Challenging, there's something different in the air
The clouds are changing, weapons, love, heartbreak, and everything in between
Dirty, filthy boys
Don't let this one diePardon the, uh, technical difficulties
Some days I just don't feel it 
Some days I want my days to pass right by and change my spirits 
Your hatin' made me fearless 
If it do not make me happy or bread
Then, dawg, well, I just can't deal with it 
Swear to God I'm 'bout my business 
Got both of these boys kissin' 
These drinks, they got me spinnin' 
B-boy, the way they twistin' up my words
For months they said I was missin'
Man, the world ain't out to get ya
They just tryna dismiss ya, 'miss ya, 'miss ya
They keep twistin' up my words, shawty 
Got me stuck right in the dirt, shawty 
All day, all night, I work

Tell 'em, "I don't give a fuck"
Tell 'em, "It ain't my concern"
You ain't gotta be in my world
Tal'm 'bout this what he say she say
I don't give a fuck
Stay ridin' 'round with my team, we don't give a fuck
I keep my space serene, still don't give a fuck
They don't wanna see me gleam, I been knew wassup
My attention span is outrageous
So invested 'til you come faceless
Where's the finish line that I can work towards?
'Cause otherwise I'm on vacation
My location gone, my dick is long
I'm up and down 'til I make a song
Now tell me what I'm doin' wrong
So I can leave your ass and I make you feel neglected
Paranoid and uninvested
My money's gone but there's a bigger picture I got goin' on
"Who you signin' to? When the album come?
When your next shit drop?
Can you make a song
That goes on the lines of "Going Thru?"
'Cause your new shit's good, but I gotta say
When I heard those chords I was blown away"
Nah, fuck that
My family just wants their son back
Lucky me, I'm just a scumbag
I watch a little TV, then it's back to the lab again
Workin' nights 'cause I wanna compete with producers
Out do these brain-dead losers
Yeah, you hate me, that's excuses, and I hate you too
If we were in the same room I think I'd fuck you too
I'm done with playin' games, you lame excuse of a stoner boy
I'm tired of people weighin' me down
I'm about to drown in this empty void cause
Hey, I'm done with playin' games, shawty
Yeah, she wanna suck my dick, shawty

Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the love
Nobody sees it like we do
Nobody knows what we've been through
It's been a hell of a year, but I know you got me and I got you
Now look at the love, look at the loveYou gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
Bag it up, I keep trapping
Used to not afford no dollar menu, now I be Big Mac, kid
Getting kicked out of PAX, that's a past tense now
When I'm in that bitch, they polite as a pastor
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go back to war
All the things that I said I'd do, I went and did
All my fault, on my own but, kid, I said that shit
Bag it up, on the road
Time to go, every day, do the things that I say
Bag it up, on the road
Gotta go, every day, do the things that I say
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me

My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
My biggest issue is I can't have a kid
Okay, I'm lying, got some other fucking issues, bitch
I always wonder what that's like on the other side
Guess I'll get to see it whenever my mother dies
I'm sorry mom for making songs about the shit you done
You been the greatest, no excuse for a shitty son
Moved to progressive Californ-I-A, I switched up
I was raised where some niggas gettin' lynched up
If you ain't playin' ball or throwin' sets up
Was getting jumped on for trying to play dress-up
I'm tired of seeing niggas that I hate copy me
I'm tired of homophobic niggas that follow me
They're probably same type of niggas that'll swallow me
I know you think that shit was weak but that was tongue-in-cheek
Put the tongue to the cheek, pose for the pic
You all look the same, niggas getting desperate
You want some fucking love?
You want some Instagram likes? You're posted in the club
I'm in the hotel room on tour, man
Set the stu' up everywhere I go man
I liked Wayne when I was in the fucking sixth grade
That's why Ashlan keep the camera on me all day
A young Spike Jonze, movies on my iPhone
This music shit is cool, wait to see what
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear 'em
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
Made me wanna kill me, skin like armadillo
America the new Sodom, feel it in my blood
Let the gold drape my neck, let the silver grip my knuckles
When they ask you who shot 'em
Nobody doing jail time, nobody paying consequence
Silence when it rest, words murder all the time
Now this shit offset, now my bitch upset
Yeah, I creep upstream
I'ma bury till they send me, I'm a gun to the human
I'm a psychopath
I'm a menace, man, with no dentist plan after 27
Offset, offset, I'm a scape rat 
I'm a mallrat with that palm sweat on my white tee 
I'm like sight, see on my CC 
I need us, I need love, I need hope 
To keep me going
I need to keep them doors open
I ain't talk unless the cash there
With denim and cashmere
Crib in Japan, sushi in my hand
Recording everything, bang on the thing
Black everything
You gotta get your head in the building
Y'all gotta gimme your bread just to hear me
My nigga bag it up and he don't ever make me fear him
I ain't tripping, really, let the world do the healing
I don't wanna seem too blunt
But I can't get behind this bullshit
I mean everything you do is a nuisance
And you say you wanna ride with the shooters?
If that's true, forgive me if I'm wrong
But I'ma bet my life on it, you don't even own a gun
Wave hi as I stand outside  with my short-shorts on

When the nigga I was bugging wasn't hitting me for favor
Fifty off the top, the double C was on your backside
Switchin' out positions in the car don't want no tickets
Sneaking undercover, hopping fences in your backyard

And when I was a young one, I walked with a headphone
When I was a young one, they wouldn't let me have one
They said "you no can none", said "you no respect none"
But I do that, ride like an idiot
You can never see me, y'all dumb piglets
I got a feeling, somethin' in your stomach
Your ten toes, bendin' shit like I'm on it
Got my hundreds wrapped up tighter
Than your ass, in them tighty-wities

'Cause I'm a asshole, I'm a wild ass nig', you know
'Cause I ain't really get no attention when I was younger
I don't, ugh, all I ever had was the hunger
And a need for the money
It's late in the night, I had munchies
It don't stop, man, it fuckin' not stoppin'
When the flow choppin, when the beat drop
I can feel the floor drop, I can feel the ceiling rise
I can feel myself high, yeah, and the girls say "Hi"
So please tell me why, that I drop this new, man
All these hits in 5:57
When I'm feelin' fly in a 747
Yeah, I think it's just me and my brethrenReal life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life spent livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films
I'm makin' peace with all my demons 'fore I clock out
It never comes as we perceive it 'til we drop out
I'm too big to burn a bridge that I should stomp out
I got a vision, I ain't quittin' 'til I'm crossed out
And even then, I still be screamin' from the nosebleeds
To let 'em know I never let the pressure know me
You couldn't even hold a candle to the old me
So what I look like letting you try to control me
I'm on a mission to reclaim the times that broke me
The life I took is not the one that fuckin' chose me
And I ain't goin' back, I'm ridin' in the sunset
I'm pacin' between self-awareness and civil unrest
Oh, everything I sign with every label seems to suggest
My fate is pre-determined, I'm for certain that's my success
I got everything I want and I want somethin' else
I try to fill the void and pull the Bible off the shelf
Ashes on my sheets, I find it hard to sleep
I got little problems, I know y'all sick of hearin'
I think I'm missin' somethin' but I can't think of nothin'
Real life, man, wonder what it feel like
Whole life has been livin' someone else life
What life like if I was born
It's Mark Wahlberg in the desert storm
Got a record deal with some braces on me
We a boy band, face it homie
And these boys all chasin' homie
I'm tryna make a dozen films
In the back, in the back
Make it to Jerusalem with my fam in the back
In the back, in the back
The haters still infragrant but that payback is exact
House packed to the max
Niggas in the kitchen, niggas in the back
Nothing in my fridge but my hunger is in that
Niggas havin' visions, layin' they own tracks
Shit been south central, niggas in the back
In the back
When I make it I'ma
I would do it in the dungeon, no barely function
I would do it in the dungeon, just barely function, picking sh-
I would do it from the dungeon, could barely function
Pickin' strawberry with my aunty, with the answers
With the long sleeves, upper ground pool in the backyard
With the bare pull, with the bad luck
Shouldn't wait on me, takes a while 'fore that bed, homie
Dead homiesI'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it
I'm a bad boy, bad habits
If I want it, I got to have it
Plus I'm paranoid, can't stand it
I've been damaged, but I didn't grab it
I spit my heart out, lookin' out for my best interests
He gave me good head, peepin' out while the windows tinted
I speak in tongues and I arrive without a damn mention
It's kinda sick and I was born in 1996 and
1999 the only year that I remember
I slip through the cracks without havin' a damn temper
I bleach my hair because these bitches all about they bitchin'
I say shit when I rap and y'all niggas barely listen
I do the most for the culture, nigga, by just existing
Delete my tweets 'cause I'm ashamed of being a fuckin' Simpson
I told my mom I was gay, why the fuck she ain't listen?
I signed a pub deal and her opinion fuckin' disappearin'
I'm payin' bills for my sister and tryna fund her business
Is it homophobic to only hook up with straight niggas?
You know like closet niggas, masc-type
Why don't you take your mask off?
That's the thought I had last night
"Why you always rap about bein' gay?" 
'Cause not enough niggas rap and be gay 
Where I come from, niggas get called "faggot" and killed
So I'ma get head from a nigga right here
And they can come and cut my hand off and, and my legs off and
And I'ma still be a boss 'til my head gone, yeah
I don't trust nobody 'cause they don't deserve it
Niggas run in your house, they know you doin' dirty
I got my hand on an ounce, so now I got money servin'
I just bought me a fifth and now I'm speedin', swervin'
I took an eighth of them shrooms, now I've been hearin' voices
I took like two of them pills, I can't remember nothing
I ain't under control, I'm losin' motor function
I need an intervention, I need an exorcism
I need a therapist, paranoia and drug addiction
It's very scary, my momma don't even recognize me
I'm goin' crazy, don't need nobody to say they love me
My acts of desperation, I'm on an empty stomach
So fuck the consequences, I ain't runnin' from them
I don't think the monsters ever left my bedroom
I been hiding in the closet, outta legroom
I don't know if that little somethin' ever helped you
All I know is I can't trust what's in my head too
I been running from the words I never said to ya
I been duckin' all the judgement, let me say it through ya
I was fighting till they said I can't defend you
All I know is I'm the one you should've stepped to
Uh, no hands with the stunts
Jump off the roof like I do what I want
All of my life in my past wanna haunt
And my sight of the future beginning to taunt my ambition
Man on the moon, I'm marooned, I ain't trippin'
I'm on a mission, every time that I speak they ain't skippin'
Turned my inspiration to a vision, that's a given, no slippin'
My mom's no alcoholic, she just wanna drown her sorrows
Love her to death and soon enough I'll give back all I borrowed
I took some steps to be a bigger person
I should've thrown ya off the highway to cars swerving
Ain't no burden, ain't no sermon, ain't no motherfuckin' plaque
I hate these hospitals and police and the smell of death, all that
I hate these shady folk that want a ladylike
But don't treat lady right, but they be sayin' like
And, yeah, you mad 'cause she ain't fuck, mad 'cause she ain't suck
Beat your ass before you got time to say "why not?"
Here to catch ya slip up, wish you could just rewind
Time to not fuck up, thought you were just lucked up
Where the respect? Is your ass human?
I look you in your eyes, say "fuck you, are you fuckin' stupid?"
Respect my mother, 'spect my sister, 'spect these women, boy
I get my 9-9, I don't own one, hit the store to blow your brains off
Better hope my aim off, better hope the range off
Better hope my tame off before I blow your brains off, boy
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercover
Bad people knockin' on my door, they don't see me
Been screaming at the wall, nobody hear me
There's two parts of me, one disagrees with the other
I switch sides like I'm undercoverMy decisions, I ain't sure if they the right ones
My daddy used to beat my mommy, I would fight him
But I been thinkin' that I'm kinda just like him
I take a sip and then I go and grab a knife and
I take a drive while I'm high, suspend my license
I'm hanging out the window speedin' on the I-10
I'm headed west, out to Hollywood with my friends
I'm moving out and I don't care if you like it
'Cause I've been sleeping on the roaches, I don't like this
I'm going platinum, then I'm going buy a island
I'm in that water to the creases in my eyelids
I'm out in Austin, I got work on consignment
I met some niggas that was runnin' in apartments
Take the money, take the weed into the darkness
I turned heartless, the barrel barkin'
I break commandments Moses put on stone carvings
I did business with a homie, now he trippin' 'bout some money
Partially, mainly trippin' 'bout percentages he wanted
Made the trip to California, made the album of a lifetime
Fuck this boyband shit, I just want a life line
I just want my mom back, my sister in a Cadillac
The black, she had the rims to match, the Twitter fuckin' pillow mat
I am not an activist, just because I like dick
Nigga, my existence is enough to end all this shit
I be studyin', 'lotta music coming out that I ain't
Fuckin' with, shit that we makin' sound like Southside
Dungeon shit, we the new Motown
Thugs with no guns 'round, friendship is gangsta
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
All my life, I been runnin' with the wrong one
One slip up, and I end up in the coffin
No one love me, no one love me, I'm the off one
Holdin' on my motherfuckin' pride"What effect did the depression have on your marriage?"
"Well, it gave everybody a wonderful new label, 'Diana's unstable and Diana's mentally imbalanced', and unfortunately, that seems to have stuck on over the years."
"Are you saying that label stuck within your marriage?"
"I think people used it. And it stuck."
"According to press reports, it was suggested that it was around this time things became so difficult, that you actually tried to injure yourself. Is that true?"
"Mhm. When no one's listening to you, or you feel like no one's listening to you, all sorts of things start to happen . For instance, you have so much pain inside yourself, that you try and hurt yourself on the outside, because you want help, but it's the wrong help you're asking for. People see it as crying wolf or attention seeking, and they think because you're in the media all the time, you've got enough attention, inverted commas, but I was actually crying because I wanted to get better."
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now

I-I need it, I-I, need it, need it
Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher
Ian, you sexy!
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I’m James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, But hopeful
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Give it to me, Give it to me
Give it to me now, Give it to me now
Give it to me now, now
Give it to me now, Give it to me now, now, nowYou ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
You ain't shit to me
I'll break a nigga head before I leave
I take a sip and proceed to drink
I just want another motherfuckin' victory lap
Coming from a hard place, I'm a resident
What they do right, had my life with embellishment
Representing shit my Instagram I always say
Talking reckless, my brain spin faster than that shit
Find me uselessLyrics from Snippet
One, two, three, and, and

This is that Technical Difficulties
We run streets, every day, all day
Live in Club Kaufman
Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficulties
Call me Cupid 'cause my birthday be up on V-Day
I don't like talkin' much 'cause I don't like saying "Like, like"
Like I got a knife to my throat or the wind blowin' a tightrope
Or someone repeatin' what I'm saying, like, I know 
If I was never wrong I would've been right, right?
Wrong, bitch, if I was right, I wouldn't be here with this long face
Plenty of red flags, I'da skipped and thrown away
Might have made me better or I'm just stupid, who's to say?
Are there some angels in my area?
If I don't like the function, can I post up on the barrier?
Ass so fat, I put my cup up on the derriere
Fashion shit is shakin', I'll be honest, I am very scared
And if I ever die young 
Have Larry David do the eulogy 
And film it on one of those little camcorders where you can barely see
And hire someone to throw up all of my jewelry
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy
Six feet deep, I ain't never gon' die
Four, eight, eight in the passenger side
Tyin' up my shoes, I'm just tryna get by
Ayy, ayy, ayy, I'm just tryna get by
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy
I feel like ain't nobody around me got my back
I feel like there's some niggas gon' turn on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
I do this shit on my own and that's a fact
Go ahead and go where you belong on me, ayy, ayy, ayy
You said I matter
And I know that I said so, I said so
And I know someone, someone better
Uh, someone so better
Pardon the, uh, Technical Difficultie—Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on?
What kind of boys you fucking on?
It's like the same damn sh—fuck!
Fuck! Fuck!
My life on display, I'm always live streamin', always tweetin'
Always doin' some shit that's gon' get me in trouble
It's McDoubles and a Sprite, every night
I used to live a boring life in a suburban cold town, I'm cold now
My family used to think I was useless and clueless
Really I had visions same way that fuckin' Snoop did, shit
Should've never grew up 'cause I found out Santa Claus was fake
And because I realized that I haven't told my family that I'm-
Blah, blah, blah, same shit every song
What kind of drugs Ameer on?
What kind of boys you fuckin' on?
It's like the same damn shit every time I log on
It's a new lame nigga that wanna see us fail
Well we always to the future, I'ma always do it well
I met these niggas when I was 12 and Lord knows, I've seen hell
Probably shouldn't fuckin' be here, sorry to my fuckin' past life
Searching for my dad's ghost even though that man alive
I done dodged a bullet when they caught me with an empty bag
Sixteen, rockin' the system inside my mom's van
Woulda took this shit to Kentucky fast if I had the chance
I put myself before a lot of people and I get nothing back
How y'all always know what I'm thinking, I guess you got me pinned
I bet they know me so well they could draw my fingerprints
See I'ma stay in the sky, I'm like an idle jet
And I ain't worth shit as well, I know I got regrets
My baby bad got me beatin' just like some cardio
I hit the gas on the caddy and then I adiós
Fuck you, fuck y'all, and y'all way back there
I don't like nobody hang around here
Two-faced so they face just to say they been there
I ain't no better, I'm a fuckin' prick
I stay my ass in the house and I ain't left for days
Maybe I should run away and lay away until I'm all okay
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast past my house
How many firetrucks can I count?
They drive real fast pass my houseOne, two

Is it how I make the beats sound like Poltergeist? 
Or when my homies bring my name up is it breedin' spite?
It's all talent, perfectly balanced, young Supreme Kai

Swear some nights I see him 'tween the shadows and the smoke, mane
God could watch me sin, he turned away from all my flaws, mane
.45, he got a .45 and I pray to God he don't bring it, man

I been smokin' nigga, fuck my drug test
Block get hotter, need a bulletproof vest
I been runnin' since I hit my first lick
Seen that chopper turn that dog to a bitch
The money is dirty, these niggas launderin' it
Stashin' the weed, we run from the lawmen again
And the sheriff is comin', he think he caught me again
But the barrel is barkin', he ain't walkin' again
And I ain't playin', I'm in the game like E and A
And runnin' thangs is in my veins and DNA
My flow is colder than eskimos and Himalayans
I speak in tongues but niggas know just what I'm sayin'
I'm thinkin' different like protozoas and atom splittin'
But niggas shootin' and runnin' out of they ammunition
I keep it movin' and only ride if my niggas with me
And we ain't scared, my niggas swang and hang with me
One body, two body, pressed in a room with nobody, body
Grab yo' engine like Bugatti, seen bubbles in Bali, Bali
I was gettin' bald touchin' sands in the moonlight
You was gettin' old, each summer could move right
Lips slide to cheek, last time that I seen ya'
Rugged buck eye walkin' down by the beaches
Hardly acknowledge the fact that I love you
Practice voodoo on me, I can feel when you want it
In another dimension, you're a blip in the matrix
A hat trick, never seen a real life, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasize
Hips sway under each breath, realize I fantasizeWho done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Shotta, shotta
Who be that, the number one shotta?
Put a missile on you when I'm on your blocka
It no be thing, no be issue when I'm off it, off it, I'm off it
I got the magazine for the pistol
For any politician talkin' shit, givin' issue
Another black man in the street, it's official
We riding out the spirit, we go another pistol
Huh, fuck, another cop car
Cop coming on my block for the answers
Bitch, I only got a few questions
Fuck it, pon' mi mommy and mi bredren
I hate the way I think, I hate the way it looms
I hate the way the things I say incinerate a room
I know I’m tryna change, that shit don't ever work
Just end up more broken down than when I started
And that concrete always hurts too
Started thinking I ain’t meant for life; but that’s too deep
Falling up into the ceiling while I’m drowning
In shit's creek of my emotions trying harder to be open
Talking 'bout release dates, I’m trying to make it to tomorrow
Internal honesty could be the hardest pill to swallow
So I need two shots of everything that’s on the fuckin' menu
I’m dancing by myself, setting fire to the venue, motherfucker
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
Who done called the cops on my niggas?
That’s the first one to go, the first shot I blow
Who done called the cops on my niggas?

My old friend fucked my girlfriend, I should’ve shot him
Pray to God about him, man, I hit the lotto
Yeah, my bitch got badder, shit, my ass got badder
And I forgave them bitches, so now it’s off to millions
I been fucking sinning, hit the forehead
Chest, left, right, I’m grinning, asses on the ceiling
And I got mirror feelings, for all you lil' demons
Yeah, you see the chain, 'fore all y'all changed on me
Rearranged on me, suck a dick about it
I hope you get offended, and this ain’t clean shit
This is pissing off the yacht with my bitch on me
Wearin' mink on me, sippin' Cris’ on ya
Bet ya life on it, I came to fight for it
Came in, raided all y'all pockets
And your bitch came in and rubbed up on me
I’m burning rubber, I pulled up on you Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free 
Oh yeah 
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah 
Taking time, faking mine
Let your hair lay on this side
Bless your mind, baby it's over and done 
'Cause I know the way to make-
You know I hate to lie
But you are, you are, you are baby
But you gotta be free
 Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free 
Oh yeah 
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah 
Over eighteen with the windows fogged
Her brown skin with our fingers locked
Feel the air like it's sunny out
But I don't want you to go girl cause I'm tired of the waiting
Tired of waiting 
Tired of waiting, but you gotta be free
 Oh, your love
Won't you come this close to me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Be with me now that you're free 
Oh yeah 
Won't you come this close to me, baby?
Baby, yeah Lyrics from Snippet
Uh, technical difficulties
Me and my niggas been thinkin' about, yeah
Gettin' up out of this house, hey
I've been thinkin' about Enrique
And Davion, man, yeah
I love this song, man, yeah
Iove the brackets, got all my niggas back together
Love to have it, love to see it
How you been? Still dreamin'
European, my daddy texts me a bunch
Am I ever text a nigga back?
Back, back, back in the day
All of a sudden, that's before, 'fore, yeah, back
Stuck in heaven, tryin' peaches just like, hey
Still young, hopin' it is
Feelin' back home, handle my business
I had the vision but hey, man, I guess you can't do the business
Think back to house, still, these are my niggas for real
This is that real, real, real
Sittin' on top of the ceilin'
This is my nigga, for real, those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
This is my nigga, for real
Those are my family, sure
Think I'll marry 'em, yeah
Flyin' through the breezes
Only wind can touch my skin
All these roses that come, back to back in my head
But something's missing
But time still tickin'
And it's breakin' me slow, my Lord
Caught crying in the corner
But something's missing
Give me some free time. Feel like I'm stumbling again
Let me see some red lights 
It's like I'm goin' ninety-five in a school zone
Too fucked up to realize I'm speeding, impacting lives, I jeopardize everybody I run into, what?
No matter where I go tonight, Can't get away I
Just another sleepless night 
Got people crashing around me, gettin' lit up like a b-day candle. Remember when we were five and bein' lit was something that didn't involve no Grey goose handle?
Life changes, man, not for the best. Nostalgia is innocent, something you could never repossess
I still start dancing in the rain. Other times I wish I was a teardrop, though
Maybe a raindrop ain't so bad falling from the sky
Sometimes I think about fallin' from the sky myself, and it's not in the right way
Nobody asked me to be this way, I'm just insideYeah, go sit out
Cold soul through, black know 'em, don't got no tools for now
They both sit out
A-T-L, we grab him 'fore the dawgs come out, bouncin' out
What am I supposed to do when we feel down and out?
Wonderful, hate that a bitch stare'll make me feel so magical, like
You would sit back, hit that three now, got a three and O
Got four and then my Deage come out, weavin' out
Nothing really ever come easy now
Grind it down 'til the world feel unbelievable
Leave you now, I can't even—now, now, now, now
Yeah, that's the downside  of keeping it in
That's the downside  of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
And that's the downside  of keeping it in
That's the downside  of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside
First couple racks, just spend it on some new Chanel 
Caught a whiff and now, ooh, got that new smell
Pushing in that G-Wagen, I wonder how that coupe feel
How is you feel? Uh, grinding too, still
Yeah, that's the downside  of keeping it in
That's the downside  of playing pretend
I'm not shining for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside  of keeping it in
That's the downside  of playing pretend
I'm not shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm working too hard
That's the downside
That's the downside
That's the downside
Shinin' for somebody for a love in the dark
I'm workin' too hardTrip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down 
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
All I do is work and play 
Tryna' find a place to stay 
Tryna' find some food today 
This shit is real hard okay? 
Take that, homie got the Lysol spray, ain’t it? 
You don't wanna see all my bad days, ain't it? 
You don't wanna see what I got to say, ain't it?
You don't wanna see my boys, man, they ain't friendly
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down 
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
It ain't my birthday yet and I'm acting like a bitch
Screaming "motherfuck your set" like I'm 2Pac
Ain't got no ice on me yet, still feeling how I dress
So much Dickies and I got these hoes from Walmart
I just saw my P.O. 
He like me, though 
Clean money, tryna stay up out the streets, though
Seven days a week though,  it's that heat, though
My daddy called me, said he seen my last video
Looking at a younger me, coulda had a heatstroke
In the middle of the summer with my negros
Cool cuts and snow cones, smoking to the ozone
Smokin' 'til it's all gone, smoking 'til my folks come home
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down
Trip a lot, sinned a lot, send em' all down

You don't have to say no more, you don't have to say no more
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think I need a wake-up call, yeah, that might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?
That's what I'm tellin' myself 
Still gettin' high by myself 
Fuckin' these niggas in Dallas 
Still think I'm bi, 'cause she will 
Switchin' lanes, insurance 
Brought down my endurance 
Bounty worth that journey 
See what I heard, changin' my ways
I felt like that new, huh 
You don't have to say no more, you don't have to say no more
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think I need a wake-up call, yeah, that might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?
That's what I'm tellin' myself
I'm getting high by myself , yeah
Arch it up like St. Louis 
I see the curts, made me clueless, uh
Pretty black skirt on the curtain 
She layin' back, watchin' Martin 
Usin' her lips without talkin' 
Y'all like that feeling of marble
A little too cold on the knees, uh 
Shooting in time to one team 
I see the tip through the jeans, huh
Now it gets cold when you speak, huh
Sped up and got in-between, yeah
Love layin' back when I life
I'm in the back for the bitch
She finna ride with a bitch
Speaking, I'll rock with that bitch 
You don't have to say no more, you ain't gotta say no more, yeah
You gon' have to close that door, fuckin' on the hotel floor
I think we need a wake-up call, yeah, it might save us all
Why do we risk it all for some bullshit?
First things, fuckin' with the lights on 
Yeah, I'll be fine in the morn'
Ho-ho-ho, bitch, I'm santa
I just know your girl, I'm at her address
No, these hoe-hoe-hoes, oh no-no-no
She a ho-ho-ho, but her name Merlyn
Heard your dare friend, pulled up in her basement
I went, "No-no-no," ain't no Merlyn
Then she let me in, her backdoor-door-door-door
I'm supposed to see your girl and her anus
She pulled the gift out my pants while I get breakfast
I took her cookies back in Indiana
I been gettin' to the cash bro, you cannot tell
I been eatin' good, why they call it brisket
Oh, that's your girl? Don't ever play yourself
Now my genitals in her, it's in pair with Merlyn
I been gettin' to the cash, like cereal
I'm seriousI'm sorta back, I'll quarterback yo' side chick
Hut, hut, one hike bitch, don't hide her, I'll find it
Hit it once then rewind it, hit it twice, then get blinded
We get blunted, I don't trust em, and I don't act like I love em
I finally finish, she finally famous
I finally did it, I found me a stranger
I took her to dinner, and then I got in it
I told her she ain't shit and then she replaced me
With some other nigga, she told me she hate how I roll
Better than dragging this chick on the road 
Better than taking this chick to my show
Get straight, keep pace or keep space from my face
No taste, a lot of ladies is sixth place
Type to get misplaced, drunk, and throwed
Shawty was getting old, and she ain't know that I was cold
And she always wanted more
Click, clack, boom, bap, goes the beat
When I can't keep shawty on her feet
No more tears
No more fears
No more years
To waste on thoughts unclear

Yeah, you're all I dream about
'Cause you're all I love
Yeah, you are, yeah, you are
Walk before I get in
If my head's down well then my knees grown hair
Walk before I get in
If my head's down then I feel them stare
Oh, every day you got a problem with me
What I do to deserve that bullshit?
Like every bitch wanna fuck on me
I'm gay, what'd I do to deserve this?
Gimme that pussy, gimme that pussy
I wanna love your pussy, but I hate pussy
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay
I know you feel the way, I need you to wait, I need you to wait
Don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay, don't wanna stay
I put it on like god hurt, drowning in all my woes
I never sang my shot, this soundin' like my chores
You won't know if I needed you, 
Got a taste and it just gets lighter
Need that head, then the more I'm broke
But you know that you're not helping
Girl, your body language is 
Got real something, I know that you a virgin
Yeah, why you do me like that?
Probably 'cause I'm feelin' on your booty like that
Gotta turn lights, keep it moving on track
I'm a  like that
It's like a hundred bitches on my phone, nigga, I don’t spend the night
I just left your house and I’m on the way, this my third stop tonight
But you're the first one I call, you could always make it right
All the things I can say, I'm a different kind of nigga
I need Broadway lights, I need eight gold figures
I need money, keep the fame, I need pussy, keep the love
Watered lean, it's the same, I need Jesus up above
I need seven more days and I need fuckin' more nights
'Cause I don't know the right way and my mind ain't right
So I smoke and pray about it, I don't sleep through the night
I need more, I need, wait a minute
Oh, I'm in the zone, give me that flow
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
It's just an illusion, sorry for confusing you
I don't usually do this, I don't want him using you
Get it off my mind, baby 
Mhm, I'm so tired of wasting time, babe
I got so much more to do, yeah
Huh, I'm singing "yeah, yeah, hallelujah"
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, you know I had to go and keep the flow real quick
Jesse get up in the morning and he gotta take the flow real quick
Like phantom on me, like shining on me, so bright all the time
Haha, huh, and it sound like I checked my sight on my right
But I don’t even do that
Jesse be like “Who that?”
Jesse be like “Who that?”
I’m not talking 'bout J. Cole
Jesse sound like a date hoe
Jesse twist sayin' everything
Jesse switchin' like a hundred lanes
Skrt, skrt past the boom, motherfucker
Jesse sound like a fuckin' , motherfucker
Coming straight right out the blue, motherfucker
Brockhampton the crew, motherfucker
Yeah, he's so cute, motherfucker
Like Cupid, like Betty Boop, motherfuckerLyrics from Snippet
I wanna minimize
I want a moment that end with time
I want a friend of mine to visit me like it's the wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
When I was Elio
Trippin’, I'm fuckin' up every code
Holdin’ my niggas 'till every broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary like the dew drops
In gray skies, I need new socks
'Cause I'm walkin' out with no shoes on
Wintertime, wintertime, wintertime
Contrary, platinum ring
One to ten, season feelings, no seasons
Wintertime, wintertime
The sky is fallin'
The sky is fallin’
That’s it
Baby, maybe you should let me go 
When I'm alone, oh, I always feel right
Ooh, ooh, ooh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Ooh, oh, oohNever learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
One more clip for the chamber
I'm gon' live for the labor
I'ma need six hundred lanes
For all of my innovators
Save 'em up for later, pull the gauge up
Cause I'm swinging through the fences
The fire, no consensus
I took a break from college and then became Kanye
They say they throwing three stacks, it make me feel like Andre
I'm losing my archway, coming through the parkway
Never learn my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Never learned my lesson
I just dash from A to B
I just learned to part the weed
I just pack my shit and leave
Baby boy, don't cry 
Where's your sense of pride? 
I laid it on the line
Won't let you fall behind Lyrics from Snippet
Good mornin', we lookin' for a function
I know you niggas love to push my buttons
Tell the Lord to call me back
Tell Ferg to hit me back, and it'll be a rap
I know my niggas still waitin' on “BANKROLL"
And the album almost done, it's on the way, though
It's like the days we was singin' about Waco
Gotta get it right, so baby, wait though
San Marcos, couldn't afford no queso
I praise to Allah 'cause we all got some pesos
Compose the history like Beethoven
I throw in the moon, what's the froze and the fresh
Just be hopin', we golden, yeah, yeah
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song
Look how I'm feelin', shakin' it down like that
Nobody comes close to the spot you used to have
Everyone here wants you, yeah, they want what you have
I know that you don't see it, that's what I like about you 
That's what I like about you 
That's what I like about you 
Are the lights, lights, lights
Are the lights on? I can't find you
This is our song, this is our song
Got my hands up, got my head down
All my tears fall on the dance floor
To our song
All of my– , all of my– 
All of my– , all of my– 
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
All of my– , all of my– 
All of my– , all of my– 
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Taken for weak, taken for weak
Lights offI ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble
I ain't never made of nothin'
I'm always hittin' the change button
My publicist ain't say nothin'
Just to keep me out of trouble 
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah 
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
All these voices on the sidelines
Feel like doubting lies, like what's in my head
Difference is a year ago, they were not there
Difference is a year ago, they did not care
Difference is a year ago, nobody felt like they would have to tell me, "Don't forget where you come from"
But I loved my city when they didn't love me
Ain't it funny when you in that conundrum?
I ain't one for all of your corruption, nigga
I don't move at your presumptions, nigga
Now we ride your repercussions, nigga
Do we look like fuckin' stuntmen, nigga?
I ain't gone, I ain't function, nigga
I was overdue for an eruption, nigga
You ain't even have the heart to face me when your problems changed me
Go fucking figure
Just to keep me out of trouble, ah
Last year we hit a double, ah
Told my niggas add another, yah
Shit was smooth, no fumble, yah
Then I dropped when we tussled, ah
Back then when we struggled, ah
No one cared about the juggle, ah
Can you see me, ee?
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
I woke up on tour bus
I woke up on aeroport
Man I really dropped out
With no promise this would work
Man, I really dropped out
With no promisin', promisin', promisin', promisin'
You an astonishment! You an astonishment!
Look at my conglomerates, look at what we did
They said we was kids, was tryin' to live
Instead we made millions, boy I'm resilient
Boy we made millions, boy we made millions, boy we made millions
Now we ain't gotta wait 'til devil
Big guilt cop over the sinner
To Ruby set black through the canyon
I spit on memory lane
Our lovin' is all that remains
Dust off and I'm keepin' my pace
I'm talkin' to wind today
Chalk it up, it's weird today
My momma pop bottles, it went to the roof
Laughin' and smilin', now keep it on loop
Food for all of my wounds
In times of solitude
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
Elevate, elevate, elevate
They can't hold me down
I'ma work it out in my lifetime
Wouldn't trade it all in my right mind
I'm too drunk tonight, pack a punch, I might take a bullet for you
To be truthful, I'd hate on me too
'Cause no one deserves what I want, no one is worthy
I'm selfish as fuck, I know that it's wrong
At least I admit it, I wish that I didn't
I don't know why I do it, always had the feeling
That one day someone would listen, listen
Maybe this route ain't what it's made out to be
Even though I wanted it forever
Never in my life has it been so hard to be
Maybe I could be better, maybe I would do better
If it wasn't so hard to be myself
When you get to shinin', they'd rather see you dying, nobody likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it
Likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it, likes it

Take in stride, love and devotion
Don't confide, it's the tracks of lost emotion
Let it glide, it's gonna subside
She stole my
But if just she stole my heart
I thought I loved her like Common did
I ain't going for the drama, kid
Niggas moved to the city seeking protection
Everything we do, word, shit got me stressin
Stressed out, let me get it squared away
My boy smoke a square a day, no stress, just lifestyle choices
Everyday I wake up, I get dressed, for who? For what?
The city shut down, a ghost town
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
I love you, I love you, I love you, I love you a lot
Lot, lot, and that's all I got
I got everything, the summer came
 better day
But I still have dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
She stole my heart, before I landed
Stole my heart, hope I understand it
Stole my heart, but I still got dreams of you
I got good dreams of you
Stole my heart
But if just she stole my heartGirl, do you remember this club that opened down the street?
Oh, Club Kaufman?

Or just a lost cause
The medium is cut, burning, bright
I'm the light
Woo-oo-oo-oo-oo-oo...no pressure 
Like a pistol out the top dresser 
My shit bang, I get cash, all hunnid dollar bills, no chingaling
Cool like the other side of the pillow 
Caddy got white walls on it 
Big daddy got ice all on me 
Super clean like Lysol, homie 
You say it’s some , I say it's a shame, but you would give me your body before your name
And I don't know why
And I can’t explain
I, spin around like Michael Jackson 
Reminisce 'cause I'm 'bout that action 
Just wanna give some satisfaction!
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
All my dogs in a pack formation
Niggas say my name when they agitated
Nigga learn better, you can ask yo' lady
Pretty bad thang, wanna have my baby
Nigga I'm rich, I’m just actin’ broke
I don't understand what you hate me for...Lyrics from Snippet

Try and same my name and I'll try and play your game

You ain't supposed to be here, nigga, you don't know us
See, boy, I am focused
In my garage makin' magic, this is hocus
Goin' loco, voodoo, I sue ya
The Devil gon' get ya if it's not the ruler
My black skin made me wanna dress more cooler
Hidin' alcohol inside my family's cooler, I'm tired of life, boy
Last night I had a dream, I put that on my whiteboard
For too damn long my life was McDonald's and white boys
Now it's like white noise, I need me some nice noise
I need me some nice coin, I need me some new clout
The gang niggas turn on you, fame niggas run from you
Laughin', hold my hand, baby, when it's convenient
I need me some street shit, fuck this PC shit, ah
Oh, oh
Yeah, I don't wanna ride

I don't need a gun in my neighborhood
Back when I was, I was on tour with The Neighbourhood
I used to keep guns in my neighborhood
Now I wish a nigga would

I don't need a gun in my neighborhood

Probably gon' shoot me if they see me
Now I'm on your TV, looking for a genie
Told him I was genius, I don't do bleeding
I need another season, they ain't seeing what I'm seeing, no?
You might never wan' be me, no?
Even when my skin greasy, no?
McDonalds would've been the more fire option
The barely famous shit is getting really fucking toxic
I used to wanna be Ali, I tried to be a boxer
Until you told me I could sing just like Mariah
And started—right?

Crank up the volume one time
Peace to all the real DJs out there
Cause I don't send my music to no garbage DJs
They get me
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
Fuck this humble shit, I'm 'bout to run it like a track star
No introduction bitch, I'm 'bout to go that hard
Champion, got the goggles after finals
Sprayin' champagne, askin', "Where the fuck the cork goes?"
Mouths like flamethrowers, down South, all blow
Comin' for the throat like that lil' bitch was down on all fours
Moncler on toes, from the dust I rose
Walkin' on the air, guess the gravity's what I oppose
Hatin' ass dog, gettin' back up on your tip toes
I done seen a lot of y'all worked at Kinko's
I been goin' every night, tryna strike gold
We been itching' for that feelin' like a blown nose
In the kitchen, whippin', flippin' 'til the stove blows
Still a student, I am fluent far as prose goes
Five years ago, nothing, not shit
Five years later, five hundred K, just to spit
And I still can't believe that I ain't done talkin' my shit
I know your ass ain't heard of me
I ain't stopping' 'til I die, just occurred to me
Mo' money, mo' problems, fuck the other ninety nine
Just turned twenty-five and I ain't even in my prime
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything
God damn, here I am with my anxious heart and not again
I can't fly, you just wanted everything
How could I? I couldn't give you everything

Regardless if you fucking know their name or not
BROCKHAMPTON is a household name, my nigga
Like it or not, it don't matter if you like it
I know that, 
Every little sugar
Oh, honeysuckle it
Woo, a crazy expression of happiness
Boy, you couldn't be
If a thousand roses

Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
Countin' all my blessings, and count my dollars
Make it , I'll tell you half way
If you see me at the bar take a upper hour
And I deal my many mans on my daily shower
Now they wonder why I'm trippin', I'll tell you now, bruh
Got my homies on the corner, yeah, they pushin' sour
If you see me on the club, 
If you beat it on the floor, I show you how it works
Show you how, show you–
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
Wonder what you want right now, wonder what you want right now
Used to be 'bout it-'bout it, used to be 'bout it-'bout it
They want the money, power–Still trynna make it to tomorrow
My purposes redefining, but my heart still feeling hollow
I stare out the window of my Apollo
It feels like an Impala when I'm whipping thru' the cosmos, alone
Waiting for the reception from the other side
I built this shit to get away from what I couldn't hide
But didn't think that it could turn into my coffin, so far away from home
That love is foreign to my conscience
They said "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
You taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame
They ask me "do you make mistakes or do you make a change?"
Or do you draw the line for when it's better days?
We taste the wind for when it's cold enough to kill our flame
I wonder who's to blame?
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why
Tell me why
Who got the feeling?
Tell me why I cry when I feel it
Tell me why

I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky

For sure, all for a pretty sky
I forgot my passport
For sure, all for a pretty sky
Phone ringing, never outgoing, homebody
Never outgoing, put my doubts on when these walls up
Tearing at the black tie, finish adding notches to my belt loop
They say help you, I can't help you
Why I can't speak out? Is wide out, wide out
Keep it deep inside my mind, it's off kilter, off kilter
I turn memory to fantasy, for that better pleasure, fuck
Time machine gon' make it better, maybe better for ya
I can't make this up, I can't take it back
Feel like a monster, feel like a dead head zombie
Feelings you don't want me, I ain't giving up, you should set it off

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
And if I had to do it all again
I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more
Now and then I think about you and I want to be your friend
Do you like the sound of that?
Ice cold, I told you I'm ice cold
Find another way to put all these diamonds on
Lookin' through the window like, baby, I'm shinin', whoa
I know that you wish that I could come home
I almost , I wanna , yeah
I like to , you niggas is my , yeah
Fell like if time would froze, I feel like the mind and souls
It's too late and now it's time to go home

I would call you and tell you I loved you a little more

Do you like the sound of that?
Mhh, I do, I do, I do like the sound of thatThis about love or hate
Lately I'm losin' faith
Don't know what happened, there's some distractions that I need to erase
I need to choose the pace
Brother we raise the stakes
Niggas be thinking they makin' a move but they dumb they ain't movin' a place
Don't think I can't be replaced
Probably gon' make a mistake
Missin' the simpler days when no one was around and no one could betray
I throw a gram on a tray
Put all my problems away
I'm sorry, mama, I'm sorry, papa
I told you I step and they want me decayed
Propaganda on display
Leaving rentals in the states
I ain't tryin' to debate, niggas dyin' out and they know I'm right
When they call we generate
Baby calm down, hesitate
They can try to make a plan for me, man, I'ma have to deviate
We be stressin' but ya make
That's when they collaborate
Tryna take away my peace of mind, lost some piece of minds to the state
Nigga I can't take a break
Mental on the dire straits
I'm the greatest still a waste
I just gotta concentrate
Blow hunnids, loneliness isn't new to me
We dunnit, this is not a murder mystery
McDonald's, I was broke, in paradise
I spill Capri-Sun when she said the price
Fuck me right, masturbatin' to my Insta likes
Rappers turnin' boys, boy band turnin' into zeitgeist
Follow me rights, wanna be famous, piracy the price
Merlyn walkin' to you across the screen, like it's redlights
They gettin' all my teams, tell us 'bout that action
I need a white-man Mercedes, I'm a champion
Fifty-six, the browns, two floors, one roof attached
That's why we tighter than her bacon pack
D'USSÉ, makin' hella lo mein
You don't even understand what I'm sayin'
But you just bop your heads and fuckin' listen
Give us a name, give us something, fuck it, give me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
You don't want no problems with me
Let's do it peacefully

Bet she flicking like Tiger the tee
And she make her wanna hold onto me
And she wanna rip my tee
And she wanna do hunting
Ain't see nothing, I don't do no fret

I don't do no, no testing thing
I don't do no best friending--
MERLYN!
I hold my hands above everything
I fuck the world up, a wedding ring
I hold the mic like I'm Heather B
I hold the mic up, let the world let me
See all the things that I want to see
One-two-three, right in front of me
Back in the day when my sister let me watch MTV before I sleep
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
I don't see opposition near
Shoot the frame like I'm Lars von Trier
Won't succumb or run from my fears
For the Melancholia from my peers
Cloud above my head, hide my tears
Hydroplane while I'm shifting gears
Loop-de-loop down Mulholland Drive
Hope I land in a newer life
On a new star, on a new pitch
In a new world with a new whip
Hit light speed when I tap that gas
I won't hide from what's in my past
I don't need you lames in my life
Don't need fame to go shine my light
Bigger picture ain't in your sight
Imma paint a vision, IMAX tonight
I paid for fame, I should've kept my receipts
Sold my soul for a handful of weed
Still got holes in my hands and my feet
I turn pain into Sprite with the lean
Mark of the beast
Real big dog need a bone and a leash
I see demons when I'm fallin' asleep
Shadows leaving like they following me
Sold out show, but I'm still alone
Dress my best when I feel depressed
So I ain't taking no shit tonight
Quarter ounce of that kryptonite
Burn it down and I feel alright
I can't seem to outrun my problems
I get high and I never solve 'em
Roll it up and I burn my sorrow
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
La la la la, la la la, la la la
Front seat, back seat, also in shotgun
Bangin' on the door like we gon' fuck it all up
All these living means they ain't fuckin' with me
Bet you thought babygirl had me down to a T
Take one to the drug spot, one to the bank
One to the summer till ya see what y'all think
Six feet under block, opp need a angel 
Bean bags under my eyes like a zombie 
Someone lift the top like a purple badge 
Weird eye color make ya bug out
When I scroll through, little me in my head, voodoo
Goo goo goo joob, early birdie get the Beatle
Fuck it up, let the meter run 
Life's short, have a little fun 
I don't give a fuck about you, yes, I gotta run
Need a smoke, damn, black lung

Arrive at your front door, I came high, fo' sho'

Tell me what you wanna be, tell me who you gonna be 
Back and forth, no, I can't lie

I know I always gotta leave in such a hurry
Left me in the sink with my face all dirty
Parked outside of Sonic and my niggas got
Got too much shit to think about 
Got too much shit to think about 
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before 
Running from all I know
Hate it when my mama calls 
Her baby boy has lost his soul
The life he lives sure takes a toll
It's all in my head
It's all in my head
They tryna publicate these watered down soliloquies
And wonder why I don't reciprocate the energy
I'm movin' vividly, I ain't for the civility
They check my brilliancy, uh
What's next when you shake up the world within a trilogy?
Become a better human? Check your masculinity?
The Brutuses around you start to move suspiciously
Too many voices around me, I don't need a polyphony
This ain't for dignity
This ain't for principle
It's just the truth that there's nobody that's invincible
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Nothing in my head ever makes sense
Tell me who I am, I don't know
I'm doing dumb shit I did before 
Running from all I know 
Hate it when my mama call
What's heaven look like?
What our brothers look like?
What he look like when he realize that we not alike?
I was younger, I would pretend my toothbrush was a mic
Late to school 'cause I was singing in the mirror like I just got signed
I'm hangin' on by a rope, come on Angelo
Come on, let me grow, let me love, let me glow
Had the TV show, shit let me know
Can't trust people
Cried thinkin' about how I can't help people that put me first
Man, the pride shit hurt 'cause I know ma hurt
Do I help her or watch her hurt?
Bein' petty by the time she ain't put me first
It could be made up 
It's probably made up Lyrics from Snippet
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
'Round the clock, 'cause anyone could be right on your back
No problem, bruh
Life'll never give you that, you gotta corral 'em up
The world don't shed a tear when the past erupt
Shit, you got in any drama, keep my head low
Better build a empire 'till they see me glow
She get money like 
She get money like 
She get money like 
She get money like
Make a band, make a grand
Make a hunnid, middle man
They gon' hate, they gon' style
Take your blessing, bite the child

Baby just want a rich boy
Rich boy, rich boy
Baby just want a pocket full of cash

Why you see me laugh
Pass me plastic bag
You somebody like nobody look back though
They just jealous off the Xannys...Lyrics from Snippet
Pardon the, uh, technical difficulties
Critique signs, critique harsh
Have a barber at my funeral, make sure my niggas cut right
Lineups like they fresh for a flight, my whole life been glamorized
Some dramatized, my sexuality, but baby make it sanitized
Just make the motherfuckers feel it, 'cause it's hammer-sized
Deep in the Atlanta night, we all felt them bama skies
Move my niggas to Montana, only keep a landline
Holler if you feel me, this feel like the night that 'Pac died
Finna hire more niggas that look like us
And when the ones around your city turn against you, who do I trust?
I seen them lined up and loaded, some of the boys even look like us
Man, I love my cup, double up
And I fuck my thugs, that's love 
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, life
Merlyn
Fishing in Nazareth, tryna catch a bad bitch
Burnin' big bushes but they never burn to ashes
Catch 'em with the bass line, bring 'em to my palace
Like how my mind sharper than a Samurai tick
One hit of this make the sky really different
Ran for forty nights but I sting like Cassius
Inside her thighs, that's aurora borealis
That's my favorite memory, missionary secondary
Sorry, baby, baby, know you lookin' for a hubby
But the blue faces only thing I wasn't trustin'
Yes, Lord, give it to me, yes, Lord, give it to me
God made melody so I could make money, money
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control my life, life, life, life
I wanna have it bangin', keep it Southern for ya
I wanna hold it down and keep it comin' for ya right
Tell them motherfuckers they cannot control ya life, life, life, lifeAnd mother, I am sorry, I never pick up, mm-hmm
Because I'm afraid to disappoint ooh, ooh-ah, ooh, no
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
We were sat outside on the Harvard floor
With our feet in dirt, and our hearts in awe
I be losin' sleep thinkin' 'bout missed calls
And I see the names circling our thoughts
And I think about if we lose it all
And I turn to shit that you'd never want
Like the smoke, the drink, anything at all
And I'll say again, "Sorry I don't call"
There's no money on my mind
But my money or my mind
What's the first to fall?
I never wanted this shit, yeah
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Hey, and I've been feelin' like I don't matter how I used to
Sometimes, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when Auntie couldn't decide
Between going to work or church
I've been in my feelings on an island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said, I'll try vacationing, I'll try to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'll trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place and a barbecue plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for you, is that good for you?
My ghost still haunt ya, my life is I, Tonya
A big-eyed monster, only face to conquer
I hated songs about fame 'cause that stuff meant nothin'
Until them headlines came, then first flight I'm stuck in
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
And maybe it means nothing
But I have to say I think about you often
And if you want no part with me
I'll walk away, I know that I have wronged you
I took a plane to somewhere that I've never been
Too many times without my sister and my brother
Dad or mother by my side but they're in spirit
I always hear it, I know they feel it
My mom will always have these dreams
That used to keep her up at night
I smoke to keep them all away and make use of the time
I'm void of feelin'
The reasons I'm so out of touch now start revealin'
But I'm not ashamed, I'm not afraid of who I am
Or how I trust my mental, yeah, it's not perfect
But I guess that's just the shit I'm into
I fantasize about a time when everything was simple
My shelter sheltered me from things I needed to commit to
The way it stands to me
A victim of Stockholm in my friendships and family
What's costin' your time? What's the reason that you whine?
What's in your wallet? Dead whites in mine
So sour, in this light of lime
Daddy said "Study or get that cash"
Mommy said "Your career ain't gon' last"
Loose change, call a cab, move out their pad
I just need a chance to move past my past
Don't think too fast, private jets still crash
And I'll still fly coach, and I'll still hit a roach
And I'll still see roaches at the crib where my folks at
Touch your dreams 'fore you touch me and provoke a man
I will
I will
I will
Can I tell you now?
Can I tell you now?
I willPardon the, uhh, technical difficulties
Pardon the, uhh, technical difficulties
Close my eyes and think about where I was
Before the buzz and the drugs, before the clubs and the doves
Hillbillies running from Texas, we move to the city
South Central was the home, but now my dome feel empty
When them boys tried to press me, made my heart feel itchy
Gang signs so sticky, yeah my boys hit lickies
Man I dare you to tip me
I'm addicted to risky
I'm addicted to corny
Often times it's so boring
Waking up in the morning
See the usual story
I don't wanna keep running from something that 
But it's easy to do, it's so easy to lose
It's a challenge to fight
I'm never done getting 
I'm never done hanging on
I'm never done seeing you
No matter how hard I try
It's always a sequel, sequel, sequel32 hundred on the
My hands up, I let go‚ my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go‚ la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze‚ places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go‚ my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know‚ la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
32 hundred on the jacket like Magic Johnson
Got a couple chains off Slauson
Silhouette lookin' like Charlie's Angels
I loose up with a drip of sangria
Wipe that, smirk life ain't that serious
Love when you're double bunned up, like Leia
Make me wanna check my blood pressure
Am I being too obvious?
I got a crush, it's nothing else; I swear, it's nothing else
Wake up, feelin' like Adriana Lima
Wavin' my feet, yo, right up out the Beamer
Do my dance like ooh, la, la, when she strut like "oh my god"
Make me sweat like exercise, double up, milkshake and fries
I heard a call from the mountain top: "Joba!"
So I put my cloak on and I walked
Coined a peasant in the grasslands with a wand
Cast my spells with some peasants, now we roam
We left our shanties in the village with nowhere to go
Just a group of outcasts with the gift of hope
Well, now we're eating grapes, and the finest cheese
Achieving wisdom from the wizards we were trying to be
Now other people from my village want to come with me
The thing with magic is you cannot have it if you don't believe
You did not believe, they did not believe
You can't tell me things, this was all foreseen
You're not one with me
I bought a horse with the shillings that you took
And then gave back to me
I met the queen that you praise so much, she's into me
I bought a castle in the Shire with the moat and the catapult
I keep it clean with my medieval flow
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Stop telling me that it’s a phase
I can’t tell you to your face, but
It doesn’t matter if Rhys was a catalyst
I would go anywhere, I would go traveling
When I had a girl I felt nothing
No matter how much I wanted to feel something
When we kissed there wasn’t a spark or nothing
When we split I didn’t feel sad or nothing
Yeah I’ve got a fiery temper
2008’s the only year I remember
Your boyfriend sucks, but that’s not my problem
I understand that you need to move on
I sail the seas looking for my crew like
I got some loot but I still look broke like
Despite that I still sing my shanties like
La-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
Martin had a dream for a nigga like me to show up like this
Why you gotta hate? Looking at my pace
With your face screwed; hope it get stuck like this
Never even cared to appear or adhere my career
Trust me, you don't gotta touch my shit
Pulling every card out the cuff, no bluff is enough to discuss
I won't be the one to rush that shift
Couldn't crush my gift even if I'm in a thousand pieces
Listening to menaces that pledge allegiance
To my every weakness, why they spreading secrets?
Called my dreams facetious, bet they can't believe this
Or they act like the world shoulda knew about me
All I know is they wanted to move without me
How they used to doubt me, but you can’t renounce me
Like la, la, la, la
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Ain't no pressure, oh, no
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie
Straight to the fire, right 'til you move on
We ain't got no money, no lie, I ain't gonna rush it, no lie Whoop!
My hands up, I let go, my mouth is getting cold
I know they come and go, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la
My wrist is stuck on froze, places that I can't go
Niggas that I don't know, la-la-la-la-la-la-la-la

Bankroll, couldn't even fold, couldn't stay afloat
Bank broke, now I got way too many bank codes
Fake hoes, and my day rose, walk around my spare rooms
Lamb zoom, lear zoom, sailor moon, silver spoon
But I ain't no oil tycoon
And if I'm gone 'til November
Won't see my ass 'til next June
And it's true, and they broad day-time afternoon
Tryna spoil my mood, I'm tryna enjoy my cartoons, bitch
You ain't have many friends, but you the shit to me 
Every time you at the party it's a scene 
Always had to save you from a sunken thing 
Sunken place, always coming in your dreamsLyrics from Snippet
Feels like there's somethin' between us
Looks like there's somethin' I dreamed of
When I explain what I'm feelin'

Rick James, I get glitter on my eyelids
2 A.M., 85 on the highway
Whole world get a little misguided
Where the spotlight? Put me in the spotlight
Trust no one that put you in the wrong light
High scream when I hit her with the long pipe
Mmm, ice cream when I hit her with the sweet thang
Do my thing, no, I do not do speaking
Get my shot, point it out like whoop, bang
I'ma win a bitch and I got a mood swing
I'm the realest, bitch, now I got a mood swing
I got bipolar confidence

Grab life by the horns when I whip the Lambo
Black on red like I whip the sambo
Clip's so long it'll make you mambo
Watch you tango, dutty wine
She grind on my dick like a hundred times
Shawty love me long when I grip her sides
And slip inside like a Slip 'N Slide
My electric eel do electric slide but—
I just wanna feel the booty
All on me, all on me, all on me
Make it slow clap like Rudy!
All on me, all on me, all on me
I just wanna feel on your booty
Grab the camcorder, we can make it a movie
Bring a friend with you if you like how I do it
Gold chain swingin' and she like how I shoot it

That's so good
I love that
What made you think of that?
It just felt right, coming after Dom's verse, yeah...
Too many, too many times wasted
Wait a minute where my dogs at?
Players who ain't scared of love's at?
What's the point of saying "Fall back?"
Reaper gon' come  and stall that
Karma comin' where your false at?
Let em stunt on us we floss back
I keep my treatment to the sky, let my friend fly
Feel like y'all don't notice how I peace of mind
I got a lot to say and much to think about
Shrugged the haters off my back now I'm relieved of doubt
Lookin' deep into the ocean tell me what emotions that you dream about
I just want devotion from the moments that I  when I'm screamin' now
I'm lookin' for a partner that I'll share my pain with where we gon' do the same shitUse me for your service 
Here am I, Lord
Niggas was in that back room
See, I ain't sitting with that
Niggas was hitting that glass tube
Yeah, I ain't fuckin' with that
Auntie was smoking that crack too
My mama was dealin' with that
Big skies out in Corpus
Them lights was so gorgeous
In the garage, I made a fortune
I'm still tryna fuck every Mormon
It's amazing how I'm still searching, y'all
Still reaching, man, fuck the law
Above the law, she above the law
Close the blinds, let the lights go off
Duck low in case they raid us all
And take it all with speed and ease
He like me on my knees
Generational trauma things
I wonder how far I could bring
This shit to my existence, my nigga
Can I get a witness? I lived it
Turn into a vicious, I spit it
Looked at me and rip it, just get it
You ain't the only one that's searching for that 1-9
You gotta go ahead and let that sun shine
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
Everything gon' be okay
I'm 'bout to steal a whip and drive that bitch to Montana
My feelings roll, that's when I throw tantrum
LA, LA, LA road
I left some ghosts in my mama house
Standing alone with the shell of my past
I probably still should be underground
I know that nobody thought this would last
It's been bigger than the music
When it hits you feel it you don't have to try
Why would I care for your validation
When you couldn't look me in the eyes
Clutching your purse in elevators
But I wrote your income off on my taxes
They don't want a social commentator
They just wanna hear a nigga rapping
You start to feel a bit of freedom
Then they wanna stop and frisk you in the boardroom
Everybody wanna tell you what you're worth
Until you know your worth and then they can't ignore you
Wait a minute for what you pray for
Halle Salassie, Halleluja
Word to Buddha, Insha'Alla
I've been falling back into the void
Somewhere in-between overjoyed and annoyed
And I can't feel a fuckin' thing
Take a moment just to blink
Take a breath, let it think

I used to dream of a dream, you know I'm dreamin' that dream
Now my pockets too deep, I don't struggle these days
Yeah, I'm on TLC
Yeah, I'm stuck in my ways, I'm like a broken LP
Yeah it's most of the ways so we could all be free 
I'm a slave to these ways, dawg
I'm a passer go and wait to hear my plays, dawg
Used to run around the block, with the homies
Ding dong ditchin', takin' rich niggas' money 
Ain't a damn thing funny, used to dream of bein' Puppy
Bein' ugly ain't made me no money yet 
My music was soundin' crazier than 100 gecs
In the tavern, I be dreamin' 'bout gettin' back 
I was a loser, baby, so why didn't you kill me?
The record's dishonest, boy, so that's why they feel me
I'm still in this building 'til we on this motherfucker
Just a lonely motherfucker, I don't trust you motherfuckers 
On the speedboat, lookin' like a cozy motherfucker
So show off all your bodies, I ain't no phony motherfucker now
What's the real?  Why you still here? 
How you still hear?  You boys shoulda been gone 
You thought I'd stop at fifteen, just the fall off

Fucked on my white friends

And the  of a Jordan
They rob my nigga for Jordans
Bleach the BLEACH plaque golden
Need me a check
Nigga I need me a check
See how they puttin' my kin in some checks?
See how they puttin' ideas in my head?
I don't understand, go with the plan
Look at my poems, look at my hands
Look at the set, 
Dreaming is cursed, 
Need me a, need me a, need me a check
Niggas said G's in the front
What should believe me

And corporates dogs, man, they lace the drugs
Just don't be a weirdo unless it's natural
Like my dreads and my bed, so lonely
Thank God for the homies
Thank God for the groceries that you brought through
'Cause we was gettin' hungry, niggas know that I'm a lot to
I got a lot to lose, when the pressure's on, the light's cool
The box is new, ain't nobody watchin' you
So how could we be robbin' you?
I make more thank you think, I think more than you think
If I keep goin' at this rate, I'll be your brain next week
I moved on in my sleep, I got it done in a week
Been possessed by my old self
Fuckin' with the Devil got me fuckin' hella old still
Money that I owed still, my father paid his phone bill
'Cause I ain't seen his crib still, I ain't met his kids still
I'm tryna have a kid still

And we made a song, um, but yeah that's why I've just always loved pools and water."
"Hold on, hold on, hold on! Is that what I think it is? Is this what I think it is!? Is this new BROCKHAMPTON!? Oh, they about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song!? I think we about to play a new BROCKHAMPTON song! Let's go!"Give it to me, give it to me

Sometimes I be mad that I ain't sexy
Sometimes I be shy to show my blessings
Poppin' like a carbonated beverage
The cops poppin' niggas Orville Redenbacher 
Most times I give friends more time than family
You remember when I used to feel like I don't understand me
Now we speakin' the same language
I don't listen like I can be
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
But I'm learnin'
Sometimes I feel like I'm way too sexy
Most the singers found me in the desert
Minimi-, minimi-
Handle my business, don't talk to me directly
No one above me actin' like they all so lovely
Recogni-, Recogni-
They try to pin me down, they try to bind me
And they try to kill me like Anna Nicole
Heels switchin', finger clicking
Kick on me like I’m James Bond on a role
They want the boot of my car
Pussy boy like booty call
Money quick like auctioneer
You need a neutral career
Look what we did in a year
Yeah! Yeah!
Oh, I'm lonesome, and hopeless
But hopeful, but hopeful
What's a boy to do lost in the world trying to find a balance
Sippin' out his chalice with its jewels dancing
Fluid like the potion
That pours when I get down some
Just trying to find a port in the sky where
The sun can shine down some
Jesus is lord, I put that on god
What more do you want from me?
He's in the dark, he's just a child
They turned their backs on me
Nevermind what it was
I see enemies
Don't want what's best for me
Best believe
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful
I'm lonesome
But hopeful, but hopeful
'Times, it be so spot on it hurts
Like when auntie couldn't decide between going to work or church
I been in my feelings on that island in the dirt
I feel like brothers lie just so my feelings don't get hurt
I said I tried vacation, I tried to run away
I deleted Facebook, I'd trade fame any day
For a quiet Texas place, and a BBQ plate
I'll switch my place if that's good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Good for ya
Is that good for ya?
Give it to me, give it to me
Give it to me now, give it to me now

I told the devil that I got him in my sights again
Life's full of cycles and I'm hopping on my bike again
The energy around the light could cut just like a knife my friend
We just some carbon based life forms spitting hydrogen
Sometimes I wind up so the gears inside my mind will spin
Switching lanes, 110, I know they like to pretend
Don't try to sleep cause they might take your dreams and cash them in
Consume the pack and clap for all the ones surpassing trends
My bones are black, my blood is red, my brain a javelin
They play for paper, but I'm safer with my oxygen
Wave like tsunami, with this proxy, everybody wins
Pass on my posse till they start to photocopy them
Life after purpose had me in the game but out of it
So it's no time for folly gotta point out all the counterfeits
I'm counting on this gift to guide me to whatever's right within
I've been divisive, now I try to stay above the fence
Need all my soldiers till we over every wall and trench
You'll have to pardon us for contact marijuana stench
I thought to switch it up but then remembered that this flow is rich
With history. Your come up is a myth to me
My vision monolithic and my aura is a mystery
Step beside the critics with an effortless delivery
My presence is a symbol of my victories
They wrapped inside their misery
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
I keep tellin' ya
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout
Stay rough, get buff, get out, hey, boy
Stay rough, get buff, get out

But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Don't mind me, I'm just killin' time 
But if you've got a lifeline, throw it, throw it
Why the fuck would you share this shit with these people?
I don't know these people, I don't know you either, no more
I'm at war with myself
Every time I see this shit I wanna kill myself
And they coming for my mother, sending bullets for my head
Think they fallin' in love but I'd rather be dead
Please just leave me alone, I don't wanna be read
Yeah, yeah
You don't understand why I can't get up and shout

Let's lose our mind tonight
I'm a slave to my feelings, uh
I made bread with my niggas, uh
I see that man in the mirror, uh
And I've been dying to kill him, uh
I told my nigga I'm good, mm
If you got it, you should, uh
I was addicted to wood, uh
I'm coming straight off the Suge, uh
School had doubted the bosses, ay
Sick of counting my losses, uh
We kept our hands in the closet, uh
I kept my heart in the faucet, uh
He took the train and was off it, uh
My balance stuck in his pocket, uh
Relax and be easy, uh
I taught you, I'm weaker, uh

And wait

Break 'em out again, bombshell to the mouth again, feelings going south again
And wait
Spent the night outside your house
Drunk as ever, can't get better, and can't do better
You say I treat you like a sidepiece
Bought a Beretta, fuck a fella
Dressed in all black tryna find a way back to your mattress
Where I can relax
Where we would just laugh
I could kill him, don't like to play the villain
But I've been feeling bent
I cross my heart and hope to love
What's wrong with that?
Treat me like a kook, the weather getting good
Mans will manifest, they gon' see the way I cook
I said it with my chest and became a different dude
Skrt off in the Hemi
Work hard, not for pennies
Imma make that money if I'm outside sellin' green
Just for Japanese denim
I gotta be fresher than you
Last year I was destitutePardon the uh, technical difficulties
Pardon the uh, technical difficulties
Boys can't keep up with it
I'm like "we shall spit it"
I'm like both wheels spinnin'
I'm like both Will Smith kids
I know both Will Smith kids
I'm so focused this is 2.0 in this bitch
Give me life 
Live and direct from Los Angeles
Niggas ain't talk to you carefully
Niggas wanna harm me 
Ring the alarm class

Niggas in Chateau, niggas got rappers
Hoodie and a capture 
Backwards 
Password 
Fuck it everything in the trick straight miss ay Grey Goose
Vibe in this bitch like niggas ain't shit
You scared as shit, yeah man, doing that really ain't nothing
These people want my lifе, gon' run out of fun shit
Pull up to the function, already zooted
Bungalo on Kubrick, always a studеnt
Always absorbing, I'm already bored
I'm already gorgeous
Look what he importing, it cost me a fortune
Look at my smile, you know I been tortured
Look at my style, you know I'm important
If only the corpses
Doin it for, doin' it for, doin' it for
Woop! Woop! Woop! Woop! Uh!
Shit on your function
Live from the dungeon 
Dont know why you cuffin'
My dick she be tonguin'
You ain't got drip like this
Can't talk like this 
Safety pin on wrists,  Diamond on bliss
Speaking the truth, 2k a tooth 
Maybach Jeep, raise the roof
Know that you envy me but I am hater proof
Talking with Diddy I made me a milli' in about a day or two 
Filled with lust
Wanted to hear what Hype Williams talkin 'bout, bitches that I wanna bust
We supposed to be talking 'bout video treatments and such 
But I'm busy lovin' on the IG
Smut, damn, fuck!
I'm a G.O.A.T. in a  Lamb' truck
Tell a video pan up when you talk to me

Woo!
A little less focus on me?
What they sayin' outside?
Warrior from Corpus, hold the globe in my pocket
My life more predictable than stocks is
We still fighting the same fight that Pac did
Made songs about the neighborhood and then got big
Now I need to give back just like God did
Or more like Hov
Last night when I was stoned I seen an UFO
Thought about how far this shit could actually go
Lord knows all I ever wanted was to be just like my cousin by the stove
Get a rose
I gave you all this music, can I at least get some coze
I told you how I felt and then your mouth froze
Told the world who I was and then my neck froze
Now you acting like a hoe, fuck it, you right, I do
Cause them niggas I was around was the foundation for my crew
That's the foundation for my truth
Turning basements into booths
Termination down the 
That's the reason for the lootLyrics from Snippet
Girl, I can't play it, I'm tryin'
Now you're beggin' me for my time

Start thinkin' 'bout life, now I'm wearin' Prada
And I'm almost dyin'
Is it even worth tryin'
We put up a fight
But I gotta say goodbye
And baby, it doesn't have to be
Baby, it doesn't have to be
Do it to my life
Can you do it to my life?
Baby, it doesn't have to be

Pull to your window and drizzle with that pitter-pat 
G-P to S and figure where you niggas at 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that 
"Where the cash at?" Used to ask that
Break the bank and throw the money in the trash bag
If they kill me, please don't make my name a hashtag
They might steal your moment to set up a cash grab
But it's no way they maintain it if it ain't organic, gain it
No complaining in the business of obtaining what's our maintenance
Stain the glass and tint the windows so they can't see what you making off the top
Milk and honey on the rocks
Never lucky when it drops
Not your buddy or a prop
Y'all talk funny like the cops

Pull to your house and dump like the trash man
All up in your grill, but I'm not a fan
Merlyn, I do no hat trick, just show me where the cash at
Then show me where the hash at, fuck that
Show me where the cash at
I would rather be on acid, rather make investments
They'll come out of that debt, we'll come out of those bedsheets
I'm like the IRS, pull up to your address
I was trying my best to seizure, but pull it like Keisha
Johnny Dang gon' ice my diamonds, up out that freezer

I used to deal with both, now it's black victims

Look I missed my exit, I'm living like a Jetson
I was broke and desperate, leaning on my best friends
Only shot-callers I was around was bartending
Ain't no love in this game-I wanna minimize
I want a moment to remember time
I want a friend of mine
So crazy to me, life is still wintertime, wintertime
Wintertime when I was 
Tripping off, fucking up every coat
All of my niggas that left me broke
All of my brothers, I feel like I'm home
Wintertime, wintertime
Remember when you were a friend of mine?
Remember when we couldn't get in line?
Now we the reason why they in the line

Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things some niggas don't
You are laughing with yo' friends
I keep rapping with my kin
Back and forth, don't let them niggas in
I know some things they don't
I wish you'd stop"—Stem from show business, uh, generally... I mean I have, I started out with many, many desires as far as, uh, as far as this business goes and uh... I so surpassed all of them that I, that I, that it-it's, uh, it's not as meaningful to me anymore. I really love the work itself. I've examined myself on several occasions: Why am I really doing this? Am I doing this because I want to be famous? And I think there was an element of that when I started out; I wanted to be a rainmaker."
"Well, we should talk about that one for a quick second. What does that mean?"
"It means, uh, I think I wasn't necessarily seeing as much or as, uh, apparently as I wanted to be when I was a kid. I had, I had a job, uh... at least in my own mind and that was to make my mother feel better. She was, uh, kind of, uh... very ill in many ways. And that, so it was to make her feel better. And I think ultimately I imitated my father. He was a very funny guy. But also, I felt some need—I, I don't if maybe they created it or I created it—but I had a need to make them feel like their life was worthwhile, that they did something special by the very fact that they bought me into the world. From a very young age, I wanted to convince them that I was a miracle... and then I wanted to convince the world that I was a miracle.""This is Merlyn. This is what the sunset feel like in Malibu."
"My uncle used to have the lake house. We would go there every summer. Every Fourth of July, right after the fireworks. Go fishing, go swimming, take the boat out, all that. Get the whole family together, man, it was the best. I'ma buy that house back one day.""Yo, yo, yo, this is Kevin Cinema. You're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. Ba-ba-ba-ba-ba-bow! When I remember my first experience with a pool, you know? It was in Corpus Christi, I was visiting my sister. I'm telling you, I swear to God, It was either 1999 or 2000—1999, the only year that I remember... Seriously, I mean it. So, I'm standing, like, towards the edge of the pool. There's a bunch of people there, like my, my sister, my brother, I think my mom. It's a pool on this apartment complex in Corpus. I'm just looking at the water, like, I'm telling myself, like, "Jump in, I'll figure it out. I, I know I can swim..." So, as soon as I jump in, I panic and I don't know what I'm doing. I'm just , it sounds like this  and I can hear people, I can hear people screaming outside. Like it just sounds muffled. They're like "Oh, my god! Oh, my god! Oh my god!" and I'm just going crazy underwater. Oh, my God, I'm probably about to die—Looking back, this is how I feel. Who knows what my young brain was actually thinking and, like, processing in that moment? Next thing I know, my brother comes into the pool  grabs me, pulls me out  and like I was scared of the water ever since then, I will never ever get back into the water. But then I learned how to swim. It was great. This is Kevin Cinema and that's one of my earliest memories with water."BROCKHAMPTON LEAKS, seven days a week

Dijo hermano negro, hermano negro, ¿para qué vives?
¿Vas a terminar lo que empezaste? ¿Por qué renuncias?
Me dijeron que Dios me dio una misión
Pero me faltan los suministros para completarlo
No soy el que deberías leer, estoy acostumbrado a ser derrotado
Entonces nigga, hermano, ¿con quién estás parado?
Soy independiente porque estas fiestas nunca planearon esto
Hermano nigga con cerebro, desviándose involuntariamente en cada carril
El sentimiento nunca es el mismo, persigues lo que no puedes ganar
Estoy tan acostumbrado a las llamas que no podría decirte qué es el fuego
La situación es grave, escuche las llamadas del coro
La disposición adquirida desde mi posición en la Tierra
Me dice "¡Decapita todo por lo que vale!"
Cuando muera, estas palabras van a necesitar ataúdes separados y un coche fúnebre
No rimo, congelo el tiempo y dejo que estas manos solo hagan el trabajo
Estoy en tándem con mi maldición, volviéndome loco desde mi nacimiento
Mira el lienzo como un planeta al que mando con mis nervios, ah
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano
Dile al mundo, no tengo miedo de nada
Dile al mundo que no tengo miedo de saltar
Dile a mi chico que quiero una cuna en Londres
Dile al mundo que deje de tropezar, lo haré
Construye una casa diferente con algunas funciones diferentes
Intenta tratar al hombre como a un bebé
Siente los dientes hundirse como la rabia
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Chico, sabes que no pareces volar
Las cadenas de oro te ponen verde el cuello, adiós
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Ah ah-ah, ah, ah-ah-ah ah
Nada diferente ahora  Por todos lados ahora 
¿Con quién te quedas ahora? Eso es un gran reflejo
No me gusta cómo me hablan, ¿por qué caminan hacia mí?
Usa tu mierda en tu manga, deja de proyectarme
El sentido es tu sonido envolvente, ¿cuál es tu opinión sobre mí?
Mata el ego ahora, ¿qué significa eso de mí?
Ángulo de pantalla panorámica, un par de sorbos de Tanqueray
Voy a lanzar un par de golpes, lo haré de todos modos
Anímate pequeño hijo, me deslizo como la macarena
Perder tiempo, escribirlo, estilo condimentado, jalapeño
Supersónico, moverse a través del túnel, ciclo de dos ruedas, ligeramente
Silencio multitud mejor que 9 milímetros con supresor extendido
Bustin 'fuera de la función, muy cómodo
Tengo a Martine en mi cuerpo, hombre, mi sudor letal
Dulces besos como los dulces del carnaval
Voy a llamar mis propios disparos, golpear el audible
La muerte inminente es el único signo de vida
Estoy lanzando Ave Marías hasta que muera
Tíralo, todo lo que tengo es tranquilidad, vomitando
Tengo mis alas cortadas, no las necesito mierda
Aprende a volar de nuevo
Vía rápida al último lugar, lo juro
Nunca he estado arriba pero estoy aquí en algún lado
Aquí afuera, nadie puede decirme mierda
Mierda, no importa lo que hice en ese entonces
Deberías mirarte a ti mismo
Tal vez puedas encontrarte, amarte a ti mismo
Aquí está la salud y la riqueza, todos juntos ahora
Diles chicos, no huyas de nosotros
He estado demasiado tiempo, primo
He bajado demasiado tiempo, hermano

Hoo! Hombre vudú
Mamá me llevó a la iglesia y canté un himno

No voy a la iglesia, pero soy muy espiritual
Saqué mi vida de la tierra, eso es un milagro

Es diferente reconciliarse con esqueletos que no sé que poseía
Busqué la perfección en formas que ya no acepto
Entiendo lo que descuido en momentos en que me obsesiono
Estoy aprendiendo a confesar, este destino es más difícil de digerir
La mayor amenaza a la que me enfrento es a quién enfrento en mi reflejo
La depresión sigue siendo un invitado no invitado Siempre estoy aceptando
No puedo evitar encontrar el sentimiento con un abrazo familiar
Cuando sé que me matará si cedo en mi cerebro
Veo las sombras adentro, miden tres metros de altura sin ojos
Me pusieron la cabeza en el agua y es tan hermoso debajo
El sol se refleja en los corales, colores que no puedo describir

I'm waiting on, uh, pizza right now.""Hi, this is Merlyn Wood and you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio on Beats 1. I think I was about eight when my parents got me a fish tank and some of those fish with the see through skin, so you can see their skeleton. And I also had a blue fish... They're all dead now, um, and I buried them in the backyard. I mean if, if water kills fish, what chance do I got? What chance do I got? I mean, if water kills fish, what chance do I got?"Lyrics from Snippet
Found these versions, making me feel so 
Self-medicating, but I don't think they'll find it
Turns out I found peace in the dark but now I'm waking up on top floors
Morning , the morning and the morning
What am I doing this for? What am I doing this for?
Okay, four in the morning like a ghost
Oh yeah,  the most
Okay, here we go again
Seeing it all, seemingly fall, babe"First experience with, like, a body of water would probably be when I went to the lake with my dad, he rode the Jeff Gordon jet ski that he got on eBay.
"What color was it?"
It was rainbow. Like, it looked just like Jeff Gordon's car. And it said "24." He met Jeff Gordon when he bought it. He loved it, so I rode on it with him in the Lake Havasu probably? Maybe it was in Arizona or something, I don't know, I don't remember. Um..."
"What'd the sky look like, was it bright? Was it sun out?"
"Yeah, the sun was definitely out."Yeah yeah 
Yeah yeah "You know, I don't really remember the first time I got in that water, but I remember one time at my brother's birthday party. I jumped off the edge. I remember, as I was going through the air I looked to my right and everyone was doing GIFs and I just sunk to the bottom of that bitch, just sunk down. And I remember sitting on the bottom of the pool with my eyes open, knowing that I couldn't get up. Knowing that I couldn't swim up. And the craziest part is that I remember that but I don't remember how I got out. I'm still alive and, uh, yeah, man. Wear those floaties if you need 'em! Slow down when you get excited because, shit, you might just die.""And then I had like, um, my mom and dad had, like, nail shops and I would, like, go to my mom's and she would have the pedicure chairs. I would sit in them sometimes and just fill them up and put my feet in the water like this and I would make sure it's really high and then like, sometimes, like McDonald's had, like, their happy meals and their toys. And I remember they had surfs up and I got, like, the penguins and stuff and they had, like, the surfboards and l would like, put them in the water and we'd play with them. The toys in the water. And like, I can't imagine, like, I guess adults, like going in to get their nails done would just, like see this kid playing with toys in the water. And this is Kevin Doan, you're listening to Things We Lost in the Fire Radio."Hey, this is Davy, with, uh, Davy's, uh-uh, Pool Cl—Pool Heater and Cleaner cool spots and I just wanted to throw a little ad out here. Um, when we have a new hydro cleaner and it's impeccable and does great wonders for your pool and spa. I think, uh, well I don't necessarily mean spa, but you know. Hot tubs, and such as that. But uh, yeah go get it. It's on the market. Right now, you can get it at your local Lowe's or your local Home Depot or your local Home Improvement, anything such. Maybe some of the local businesses might have it here in the California area. But, uh, yeah, I'm over here, I'm on, uh, eighty thee Gravy street just waiting to see, but anyway... Uh, thanks for letting me on the show, I appreciate it and hopefully you guys will go get that hydro cleaner and it'll do wonders for you, and it'll-it'll just brighten up the summertime. And I know summer's coming to an end soon, but you know hot tubs are year-round for me..."Back by popular demand

        "Oye, ponte , ¡dale la vuelta a esa mierda, muchacho!"
¿Cómo se dice? No me toques con los dedos
Minimizo todas tus credenciales, maximizo todos mis pesos
Quiero ese baile que pueda hacerlo, dámelo directamente, no lo diluyas
Soy una mano como Odell, adormezco el dolor como Orajel
Arriba y abajo como oso de Gopher, pásame como "Oh, bueno"
¿A qué huele eso, Chanel? Demasiado profundo como las profundidades en el infierno
Necesito un trago humeante de whisky, abajo de esta perra como, oh, están molestos
Hablando, oh, no te pongas boquiabierto, te amo, oh, no me olvides
Viniendo como: ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Llévatelo, ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah
Talkin 'em: ee, ee, ee, ee, no, no, no, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
La radiación está presente, tengo mi reflejo iridiscente
Cada momento que entro, podría cambiar la dirección del planeta
Glitch en el sistema está presente
Es posible que desee verificar la conexión
No me importa una mierda los estudiantes de primer año
No me importan los veteranos
Si su percepción no es ascendente, no hay razón para la extensión
De mi energía, esta mierda solo sucede una vez en un siglo
Es elemental cuando todo lo que hablas es rudimentario
Paradiddles ocultos en acertijos insípidos y accesorios
Así que por favor no se equivoquen, se aprovechan las oportunidades
No queríamos ser pacientes, tuvimos que luchar por esto
No hay ninguna actuación complaciente, la falta de respeto ha sido demasiado descarada
Reclamamos este lugar desde el sótano, así que dime quién eres de nuevo
Oh eras esto, eras eso?
¿Pero ahora te lavaste y lo odias?
Estás tomando disparos con revólveres, tengo dos drones en la estación
Presiona el botón, podrían venir y dejar tu legado vacante
Allanaste un camino que no queríamos demoler con el envejecimiento
Conseguimos dinero, obtenemos masa
Dame más mi princesa lo dice 
Aunque mis dientes no sean dorados
Bebé, conoce nuestros bolsillos pliegues por goteo
Conseguimos dinero, obtenemos masa
Dame más mi princesa lo dice 
Aunque mis dientes no sean dorados
Bebé, conoce nuestros bolsillos pliegues por goteo
Dinero en mi ..., dinero en mi ...
Niggas que yo, niggas que yo

Deja que mis niggas, deja que mis niggas

Ee, ee, ee, ee, woah, woah, woah

¡Cortejar! ¡Cortejar! ¡Cortejar! ¡Cortejar!"Matt has been surfing since he was sixteen, and he taught me how to surf when I was in middle school I think... Maybe freshman year of high school, and we went out. I had my wetsuit on. I was so nervous, because I didn't wanna fall off. I didn't know if I could stand on the board and stay there. I had so much fun waxing the board, and like putting on the leash, and... I knew my dad was good at surfing, so I figured it must be in my genes. Until we went out, and we paddled out... I'd back out and be like "Oh, I'll be ready for the next wave, like okay I'm gonna stand on this one. I know I'm gonna stand on this one... And, I stand up on the wave."
