Small world, all her friends know of me 
Young bull livin' like an old geezer 
Quick release the cash, watch it fall slowly 
Frat girls still tryna get even 
Haters mad for whatever reason

They lose it when the DJ drops the needle 
Getting so gone I'm not blinkin'

New day, new money to be made
There is nothin' to explain

She wants me too, she ain't even in denial 
Wanna make love, she ain't even in denial 
We can get away-ay, maybe to Guatemala 
Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater 
Baby, when you laughin', is it 'cause you feel an excellent vibe? 
That was just a fraction of the good love I provide 
See some niggas talkin' on the side, can you keep that silent? 
Maybe sayin' somethin' but you didn't mean nothin' by it
Took her to the room, in other words, kept that private 
She was my heartbreak, I told her keep those violets

Got me goin' deep, got me all in freshwater 
Flew in on a jet, what's that? Stylish
Take another sip, then get superpowers 
If she got the hots for me, then dammit, I'm buyin' 
I've got more pull than him and him combined 
Pourin' out dreams, 'cause we're really this high 
I just had my hand on her hip, she had her eyes on the prize 
Seen the way you talkin' up my phone last night, on God 
Do it on my jet, let's keep this private
She wants me too, she ain't even in denial

I can't guarantee my heart 
Baby, don't take too, too long 
I ain't ever miss my mark

I believe in miracles 
But I don't believe in waitin' for 'em 
You gotta make that shit happen 
In ways they cannot imagine 
Make them think it's magic 
It ain't your chain or your vehicles 
When you that nigga with the bag 
Just be that nigga with the bag 
So when they say, "Who is that?" 
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag 
They be like, "Who that rolling past?" 
Oh, that's that nigga with the bag 
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo, Yugo
That Yugo, Yugo
You do what you do 'til you disappear
I'll take two whips for souvenirs
She said, "Swae Lee, aren't you a Gemini?”
No, I'm that nigga with the bag 
Say it loud and clear 
It's loud diamonds in my ear 
You took all day at the Gucci store 
You take all day when you in the store 
But, baby, I'm not even mad
We steppin' out Ferrari, matte
I got the vibe of a UFO 
If you ain't spendin', what you in here for?
You see, I had to customize my life 
Always rollin' up in everybody's section
When you that nigga that run with the bag 
You can't help but to leave a good first impression 
Just be that nigga with the bag 
So when they say, "Who is that?"

It don't matter 'bout the ice 
If you can't pay the price 
Just be that nigga with the bag 
Gotta gamble with your life
Look, I'm into taking risk and chances 
Big advances  big expansions 
Hit a lick an' I get the Billy Jean dancin' 
Only time I pick is for the ransom
I work way too hard
To me, work is not a job 
To me, working is a purpose 
If it ain't that, then it's worthless 
And I carry all my burdens
Hardly ever needed help 
I'm the help my family needs
I just cash 'em out myself 
Bitch, I'm on some other shit
I got abducted by the mothership
But came back down just to run this shit
I want the double R, the double M
I take the work, put the double in, game, triple double it, I'm gone
I'm goin' hard for this, I put my heart in this
I'm addicted and it's hard to quit
Started off in them apartments
Now I hang with the stars and shit
Customize my cars and shit
It's her first time in a Lambo
Had to show her how to start the whip
I'm a young nigga with a bag
Watch how large it get, 50K in my Amiri jeans
I fuck around and blow all this shit, Jxmmi got all the drips
You ain't never seen sauce like this, I shop on all the strips
Told shorty to lick the tip, she pulled out all the tricks
But then the insecurity sets in
You ride around like the Jetsons
You're the sun's reflection
You shinin', come on, hello 
You see that watch, that's made of glass 
It's on the wrist that grip the bag 
What was that spaceship ridin' past? 
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag 
He do more prayer hand than brag 
Oh, that's the nigga with the bag

Stuck to the plot, stuck to the script, and I don't even screenwrite
Used to have to eat cold meals 
Now a nigga offin' gold seals 
Countin' up money, gettin' chills 
We some young niggas on for real
Tokyo drift through the hills 
Used to have to walk, no wheels 
Now I'm buyin' whips for the crib 
Young niggas on for real
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real 
Hunnid dollar bills
Young, young, young niggas on for real 
Tokyo drift through the hills 
Used to have to walk, no wheels
Cameras outside my crib 
Young niggas on for real Ear Drummers

Talkin' about your box braids
Five minutes later, I'm takin' you down
Now you're callin' my name
Thinkin' of me when you're out and about
Ooh, pray for your crew
Pray for your crew, make 'em salute
Watch how I move, cash comin' through
Watch what you do and what you choose

Drink so fast, I just done got the hiccups 
Took her shoppin', she think I'm the shoe plug
Come back from the dead, I feel like Frankenstein
Five chains on my neck and they got hangtime 
Niggas rap, but they don't even stay around
Rollin' weed and baby, yes, I hang glide
Bring in them hundreds, end of discussion 
Bad chick blushin', turbo bustin'

Colorblind, I'm seein' blue-green, blue-green? Blue-green 
Blue flame and I tip like kings 
Car got wings, car got speed 
Roll up by the P, I'm T'd

Overachiever, had to let my seat up
Had to tell that girl that it was a one on one
In the spot, she on the bus, at the bank, I'm in a rush
And she followin' me, I'm like no wonder
We should hop off choppers since we got sleeved up
Both my arms, they freeze cuts 
Late night and it's gettin' so uncut
These girls, they don't tease us
I let the cash go, I leave a wet floor
I'm in the Enzo, still a no flex zone

I treat it so special, now ya ho jealous
Freak hoes, got several, they tens or better
I'm a trendsetter, I'm a go-getter!
When I slide down the ave I'm fuckin' trippin' 
Maserati bat black, all I wanna know is where the cash at?
TNT tucked in my 'rillo, hundred racks under my pillow
Different styles, I'm so versatile, nigga you know like I know
Jimmy, Lil Swae, hoes on the chase
Cash in the air make her forget her date
Heard of my plan, she fuckin' with me anyway
If she thicky like Nicki I put that pussy on my plate
How you not notice the flyest niggas in the place?
I hit the liquid and started drippin' into space
Hublot tickin', blowin' kisses at your baby
Have fun, shotkilla like Mike reincarnated
Throwin' out a fuckin' end
I'm blowin' money in the wind
I'm sick of wearin' skinny jeans
I'm more into wearin' Louis V's
These hoes don't fuckin' listen
These niggas don't pay attention
These bitches are not yours
We keep them on all fours
Breakin' down', rollin' up potent
Sippin' champagne like soda, poppin' red bitches like cola
Trunk beat like Eardrummers
Sremm killed the haters, God bless 'em
Mothafuckas still all in my bone marrow
Flyin' through the air like a fuckin' air devil
All these broke niggas just fish in a barrel
Run back up and I turn into a bezel

Pop a Perc', now I'm on lift off
Ass still fat, it's on Rick Ross
You bitches make a nigga dick soft
Bitch, ball like I'm at tip off
Get it, get it wet, then I rub the tip on
Rag and Bone jeans, I can slip off
Bitch, I've been hot since flip phones
Running this game for five years
Guess that's why my feet hurt
Wonder when they bite me, do these bitches' teeth hurt?
Yes, I am an icon, that's me on your T-shirt
Thought you knew better, do your fucking research
You ain’t know, this the no rip zone
This the You Can't Beat Nic zone
Madison Square when the Knicks home
I live next door to Brad Pitt’s home
I like bad bitches, cause they like bad bitches too
I like hood niggas, with a bad attitude
They could never reach Young Nick' magnitude
Even if they had a longitude, latitude
Listen up, ho, this is my territory
You are my son, like an episode of Maury
Like an episode of ER, bitch, I’m hotter than the D.R
When it comes to rap skills, nobody wanna see her
Muhfuckas flexin', muhfuckas actin'
Bitches is my sons and they causin' contractions
Ain’t pushing out, I'ma give them to the clinic
Cah wait, we nuh rate dem gyal and dem gimmick
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone
This nigga keep staring at my phone
But if you’re ugly, it’s a no text zone
It’s a no sex zone, it’s a no flex zone
Wack sauce, I can hear it in your tone

Who ain't waiting on King Push?
Got niggas checking for them new flows
Sold more dope than the old Jigga
Now niggas calling me the new Hov
Let the coupe go, planetarium
Let the roof go like Cesarean
Clear my section nigga, no flexing nigga
Just a hunnid bottles they carrying
Cross the border like I lost a daughter
This foreign nigga, he ain't know better
Him pick and choose where them bullets fly
I lose the plane on this fool nigga
Bought dope with my album budget
Play Cloths was the blueprint
Four million in four seasons
Fuck who care for my fashion sense
Tell a ho come and swim in the money 
Broke niggas just stop at the heel
I could body paint you in them name brands
And put a red bow on the wheels
See I'm just in and out, I call a rent a mouth
Suck the ice out of a bezel
Use my rap persona, fuck baby mommas
Still killin' haters, God bless em'

I blocked your number, can't call my phone
And I'm with some other bitches
She a player like me
Try to leave a nigga on E
Had to keep trippin', OD
Bounce back to the old me
I shoulda listened to the homies
Hit it then quit it then went about my fuckin' business
But I was fuckin' with lil momma, that was my decision
And I don't really listen to nobody else opinion
You tell your girls you done with me
But I know you fuck with me
Cause these other niggas inconsistent
And these other niggas ain't Jxmmi
Of course I want to lie and say I don't miss you
My bitch on the side just told me to forget you
Quit telling them hoes that I chill with you
That's what niggas do, that's what niggas do

Yeah, ice everything, I need a figure skater
Eating five-star meals, tipping waiters
PJ, skip commercial flights, that's no delaying
I had too many guests, my neighbors start complaining
Sun beaming, my chains jingling, I'm chinky 
Bitches so kinky, broke hoes shrink me
B.Y.O.B., can't backwash in my drinks
Missed it if you blink, smell the purp, she wink
Bad bitches R.S.V.P
Yes, I gotta switch the swag four times a week 
Mamma mia, I didn't even see her
New six-seater, see ya, would not wanna be ya
When I land in the sand, where's my greeter?
Nothin' but divas, up in my cocina
Grab a pan, switch hands, don't just linger
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, not a singer
Eating clams, rolling grams
The con man has other plans
Helipad, dizzy by the time I land
Helipad, I'm so done with first class
With a bag and a baddie like Selena
Mamma mia, cash flipping, tortilla
Through the path, to the stash where I post
I go via Sprinter or limousine-a
Get the clout, tuck my shirt, then I leave ya
So much dough, we outdid the pizzeria
It's all good 'cause I'm smoking aloe vera
Next Top Model give me brain like Neutrogena
Don't just tear up, won't scream Ike and Tina
New Pagani and that bitch lime green, ah
Through a smoke screen, they don't even see us
Kick my feet up, if they bust down, hoe, just sleaze up
When we got up out that slump, the grass was greener
Girls cheerleading, when we score, they try to cheat us
Wife-beaters and I'm sippin' Titos
Can't you tell, that she was my niño
New moschino , I'll take that on DeeBo 
Golden boy, I'll hop out like I'm CeeLo 
Pardon my ego , they won't jack my SteeLo 
Bring the divas to the mansion in Encino 
Say she fuck with the Sremms, she want G-Lo 
Marshawn Lynch, bust a play, I'm in beast mode 
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame like Mick Jagger 
R.I.P them but bet, we still counting badges 
Diamond rings on my fingers, I'm a bachelor 
College dropout, got the money, that's my masters 
Mamma mia , tu eres bonita 
Nothing but divas , up in my cocina 
Helipad, helipad, helipad 
I pay cash, I pay cash, I pay cash 
When I land in the sand, where's my greeter?
Nothin' but divas, up in my cocina
Grab a pan, switch hands, don't just linger
Rock & Roll Hall of Fame, not a singer
Eating clams, rolling grams
The conman has other plans
Helipad, dizzy by the time I land
Helipad, I'm so done with first classEarDrummers
Mike WiLL, fuck with me

Go pack up that old lifestyle, baby, my life's too wild
Fuckin' that bitch for a while, diamonds they hit like wow
European size, that's a 42 
Left from the scene being cordial 
European bitch payin' more than you
Young nigga hot, that's scorchin' 
Walk in the store, that's a shoe sale 
And all my bitches get Chanel 
Drop the top and they eyes super glued

European size, that's a 42

It been a while since I  rode around on E
Hol' up, I just caught the wrong beat
I got a long dick, shawty want fo' me to skeet
All I got is cash, I'm gon' buy a new lamb
Hit ya shawty from the side, woo!, wam, bam
I'm on Sway up In the Morning, I just counted one hunnid
All my bitches bad and they drive an H3 Hummer
I can check my wrist, hoo, watch my elbow pop
Niggas hattin' from the side, they know they need to stop
Cash out on a yacht, then I cash out on the crib
In your neighborhood, I make noise like where I live
Please do not disturb, shitting on a nigga, I'm a muthafuckin' turd
All these niggas wanna know what the word
I'm soo fly like a muthafuckin' bird!
Don't freestyle, cuz my style ain't free
I'm tired niggas takin' my swag on the beats
I'm tired niggas walkin' 'round town like they me
I'm tired bitches actin' like they weave ain't cheap
SremmLife comin' soon, SremmLife comin' soon
I thumb through like a hundred K like every afternoon
I'm married to the money, I'm the muthafuckin' groom
I never jumped the broom, my crib got seven rooms
You know what's up with me, I'm geekin' off a pill
I told ya ho fo' real, Mike Will, ay, sign that deal

They treat me like the pope, my flow soo fuckin' dope, ugh!

You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Angry, watching you, watching me
I've been thuggin' for so long tryna bypass
I be doin' so much wrong, I see my life flash
Through the pain, I persevered and I ain't even shed a tear
Overcomin' every obstacle like I ain't got no fear
And don't you know it wasn't easy, ayy
What you thinking when you see me? Yo
Even when the sun goes down, I'm up tryna keep my family straight
I just be holdin' it down and every real nigga gonna gravitate
Every day ten toes down, I swear I ain't never goin' down this way

Go hard, I can sleep when I die

Eh, ever since I came up, yeah, I've been
Living like tomorrow ain't gon' come
Switching girls like my heart can't go numb
Pedal to the floor like I'm on the run
All this shine, all the rain gotta glum
Gotta get mine or it's back to the slums
Back to the crumbs
I don't feel the pain, I need a little luck
And I puff my herb and I sip my drink
'Til my words get slurred
I work that bitch 'til she work my nerves
And then move on to the next city like "word"
What I do is none of your concern
I take my shot, you can wait your turn
Every single thing I got I earned
'Cause every single loss is lesson learned, yeah 
You're the reason why my back is turned 
Only took one time for me to learn
I won't say a thing you don't deserve
I won't do a thing you don't deserve 
I x you out, what for?
Because survival's my only choice
I'm living life like I know it's short
Oh, it's a miracle to find remorse
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired

While I'm still young
Getting stupid top while I'm counting up them hunnids
Imma break your back when I get through thumbin'
Then I gotta dip and get back to the money
She in love with the youngin'
Every time I hit it I be up in a her tummy
Stupid ass head got a nigga lookin' funny
Pin her to the bed cause she'll try to start runnin'
Baby, eat the dick, treat it like you got the munchies
Swallow, don't spit, real bitches do it for me
Uh, Uncle Jxm in this mo'fucka
Bitch! Suck a nigga dick or somethin'
Uh
Pop that pretty kitty 
Pop that pretty kitty 
If you really wit it 
Go and show them titties
I just got up out the bed
Can a nigga get some head?
I just got up out the bed
I woke up to get that bread
I just got up out the bed
Can a nigga get some head?
I just got up out the bed
I woke up to get that bread
Phone ringin'
Off the hook
Who it is
Stupid bitch
I'm countin' all my grip 'fore I leave the crib
 I'm tryna fuck with 
Bands gon' make her dancing, I've got pennies, still
She gon' eat the dick like her favorite meal
Camera on her dresser, make a movie wit her
She gon' do whatever 'cause I'm Uncle Jxm!
She gon' bring a friend and put me in the middle
Eat that pussy up, I never 
Stroke her all night, I bet she gon' remember
Wake up in the morning, she gon' eat the pickle
Uh
Pop that pretty kitty 
Pop that pretty kitty 
If you really wit it 
Go and show them titties
I just got up out the bed
Can a nigga get some head?

Shit boutta get triple x!
Pull up if you got that wet wet!
Lemme pat on that pussy like a pet
If you down, you gon' do it for the setYeah
Something strange goin' on here
Somebody just walked in
Ayy, got your life savings on my table
What a sticky situation 
Reaching out to complete strangers
But only for the labels 
The chauffeur was a Taz angel 
But she don't do no favors 
She drove out to Texas with the players 
Now she's a heartbreaker 
Hit my old girl up just for old time's sakes 
Ended up rollin' up, driftin' off to space 
I'm straight to the paint 
I'm so gassed up 
I'm straight to the tank 
You niggas on the Earth , I'm clean off the face 
Boy, I'm worth a bill, like my first name Frank 
Got a bill of girls like my last name Hank 
But it ain't 
Slammed the Lambo door, I coulda broke the glass 
I cram Huge Boss in my bag 
Glanced at my hand for the glitz and the glam 
I'm out here with my fam , fam
I pull one out the vault, then I put it on them shocks 
Sunkissed hottie that look like Diana Ross 
I ain't got no chill and I'm raw 
I ain't got no wife, but I keep one by my jaw 
Spent a couple bands on your bitch
Now I got the upper hand on your bitch
I pull out the money, she's aroused, holy cow

        Swae lee intro: Yo! Choo choo
Swae lee Hook: Hold The Jet up I just landed 
All The swag baby I don’t plan it 
Smoking gas niggas think I planted it 
Bad bitches get the back stage passes 
I can run through the money the fastest 
I can drive 85 different color classics 
Fire me up the biggest blunts light with the matches
Haven’t I told you once I’m done with her you may have her 
Swae lee verse: Only thing she shopping for is feindi burr dresses
I can do either or when I’m dressing
Went thru an entire store under 60 seconds
Imma be like 54 when I’m done flexing
90 missed messages smoking need a breath mint
Caught my damn blessing now I’m done stressing
I won’t need stressing cause I feel excellent
Keep my vibe protected keep my life protected
Swae lee Hook: Hold The Jet up I just landed 
All The swag baby I don’t plan it 
Smoking gas niggas think I planted it 
Bad bitches get the back stage passes 
I can run through the money the fastest 
I can drive 85 different color classics 
Fire me up the biggest blunts light with the matches
