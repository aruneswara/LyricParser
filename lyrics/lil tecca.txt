On my 'Gram‚ I got fans and they love me
On my 'Gram‚ I got haters, they hate me
They say that "This nigga a fucking nerd"
Wonder why they seeing me lately
Wonder why they bitch wanna date me
Wonder why they cannot escape me
Wonder why some goofy nigga on the internet richer than them with brace teeth
Don't fuck with you, I'm gon' fuck it up
Getting records‚ I fuck with my bucks

And I be thinkin' the world is out of love
So lovestruck, it's fucked up
And she don't really care because
Everybody want the same thing
New chain, new car, and the same ring
I just wanna make money with the same gang
New glass, new frame, but the same lane
Whole team cope different, but the same pain
Rollie, Rollie, Rollie, I just want a plain jane
Bitches fuckin' different niggas for the same fame
I'm committed to myself, nigga, so I can't change
She wanna pop it, lock it, drop it
I'm so up, baby, stop it
Tinted windows ridin' 'round 'cause I'm poppin'
She wanna come, mop it
Showin' no love, toxic
Baby, can't trust, be honest
She want me to hit it, no boxin'
Pass the grip, toss it
Hop in the Bentley, the 'Rari, the Mulsanne
You got a problem with me, you can come say it
Pass the lil' thottie off, I had to relay it
Now when they say my name, they be like, "He made it"
Oh shit, that's Tecca, that boy up in NY
I'm really from Queens, but they say I'm from LI
Sixth grade up in two thirty-one with my fellas

Every insecurity, they do not mean shit to me
Because it is you I adore
And baby girl, I hope you come in history, can't let these niggas get to me
I’d regret if you, I lost
Every memory is searchin' for a long time
Every thing was in my face and I was so blind
I told myself "I cannot just be one of those guys"
I just need some faith, so I'm talkin’ to the most high
Real nigga shit, niggas not how they seem like
Real nigga shit, I'm goin' up and niggas seem tight
Nowadays I walk around, I feel like I got three eyes
Remember seein' through the whole scene, I was knee-high
You get what you want and I get what I want
B for the bitches, same bitches I put my niggas on
I ain't had no plan B, me and A had to get along
I was sixteen, everyone in the room sippin' strong
But you know I'm a leader, my mentality really strong
If you ever diss me, then nigga, you know you really wrong
Remember bitches dubbed me, now all these bitches, they sing my songs
I done had some feelings, I took 'em all to the studio
I done seen some thotties, I took ’em all to my video
If I let you use your phone, shawty better not take no videos
I don’t give a fuck if your friends heard me all up on the radio
Yeah, on the radio, that's the way to go
Gotta be yourself, lil’ nigga, that's the way to grow
They gon' try put you down but you got stay afloat
And sometimes got to put your foot down and start sayin' no
And sometimes got to isolate and just start settin’ goals
Every insecurity, they do not mean shit to me
Because it is you I adore
And baby girl, I hope you come in history, can't let these niggas get to me
I'd regret if you, I lost
Every memory is searchin' for a long time
Every thing was in my face and I was so blind

I just need some faith, so I'm talkin' to the most high
Every insecurity, they do not mean shit to me
Because it is you I adore

These niggas so mad cause they music is trash
Yeah, I be coming in first, they be coming in last

I'ma pull up and skirt off the scene
Riding around with a blicky on me
All these new niggas trading my heat
And my feet Alexander McQueen

Shorty, I'm not like your ex, that boy a bozo
You interfering these checks then you a no-go
I think this bitch trying to line me, I'm a no-show

Only nigga that talked, only nigga got popped
I ain't gon' lie, young nigga got dropped
And I seen shit different when I got on
Why you ain't have my back? Man, I thought you were squad
Put that on my life, that was the last straw
Still think 'bout that situation, I'm like nah
So I distanced myself, they said I switched up
Always have your homies back, that's how I grew up
Can't break the bro code, I cannot fuck up
Stole from me, I guess it's enough
Used to make sure you fly, AP in the cut
I ain't wanna chase that nigga, that's chopped
It wasn't even me, it was my mom
They lucky, I'm meditatin' at the time
My last slime would have been online
She shake it, she shake it, shake it like it's jelly

Yeah
Everywhere that I go, It's a party where I'm at, bitches where I'm at
Money up in the sack, money up in the bag, fuck a pillow tracks
Remember I was on the track
But I can't chase a bitch, I can never lack
I don't really fuck with math, but I count up all these racks, I don't gotta act
Most of these niggas they be cappin', say they gettin' all the racks, you ain't gettin' that
Five digits I was sixteen, up in twenty minutes, they like how you do that?
They don't know what I go through, they don't know how I handle that
And I know that my , they know that I made it yеah
I was counting this money one time
I was fucking thеse hoes one time
I was good with this money one timeLyrics from Snippets
Yeah, I say this 
Oh-oh 
Yeah, I say this, you don't even really gotta say shit
Hate it, yeah, I really hate it when they say shit
Fakin', when I look around, I see they fakin'
Gang and, I just look around and say, "We made it"
I'm not really tryna control her
All a sudden, now she comin' over
If I'm in L.A, I'm eatin' BOA
I just flipped my bankrolls over
And I just hit her up but I'm not tryna control her
All a sudden, now she comin' over

And some of my niggas had to get a grip
Yeah, some of my niggas had to get 'em blicks
And all of my niggas want to get some riches
And all of my niggas want to get rich
Had to grind for this shit, it look like we came up quick
And that lil' nigga ain't part of my squad
And no, y'all niggas not hittin' licks
I'm fuckin' your bitch and I hop in the ride
Lil' nigga, I really do this shit
And I'm up in the stu' if you ask where I've been
These niggas, they likin' my style

Two hoes on me, yeah, I need both of 'еm
Took her off stage right now, hit it real quick
Yеah, please don't cry
Fuckin' this bitch, found out she bi
Hit her one time and then say, "Bye" 
She like, "Who's money is that right there?" Oh, that's mine
You can look, don't touch, you can look, don't touch
If you touch, lil' bitch, that's a fine
All this money in my bank account right now
I could fuck around and change your bitch life
She said she wanna be my girlfriend,

 in my pocket inside of these Ksubi jeans
It's like more money, then there's less friends
And I wonder, will she leave if I set less trends
You never use me for some vibes, just some sex and
And now you wonder why this makin' me in-toxic again

You mad and I'm livin' great
 Gemini, got two 
Just heard 'bout Tecca? Boy, you too late
Niggas mad, go hop on the wave
Turn up the club on a Tuesday
Told that nigga "Get the fuck out my face"
True to my ways, I ain't changing my ways
Dominican homie, he said ""
"What you doin'?" Gettin' money today
He think I'm fly, I think I'm bummy today
 hit a nigga if he think he funny today
He said he smart, I think you a dummy today
Walk in the spot, they like "Hip, hip, hooray!"
He talk shit 'bout me, like nigga, please
I don't even know that nigga, please
Gettin' bread by my lonely
It's why your bitch, she diggin' me
 thots on a niggas phone
And some of them niggas still hitting me
And I keep that ho finnesin'
Funny that you think you trickin' me
It's funny, your bitch, she steady wanna lick on me
It's funny, it's me and you, you know she pickin' me
It's funny, I'm 17, my bitch look 33
It's funny when niggas say they they never heard of me
'Cause I never heard of you, yeah
And every day we workin' to get
This money, boy, you cannot do this
This lifestyle, she say she  this
It's like all a sudden, say she need me
All a sudden, say she want me
Young nigga gettin' money
I had it six times, 'cause I run it
Young nigga gettin' greedy
Young nigga movin' funny
This is all I ever wanted, ayy
You mad and I'm livin' great
 Gemini, got two 
You ain't heard of Tecca? Boy, you too late
Niggas mad, go hop on the wave
Straight up the club on a Tuesday
Told that nigga "Get the fuck out my face"
True to my ways, I ain't changing my ways
Dominican homie, he said ""
