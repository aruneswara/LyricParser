Aren't you somethin' to admire?
'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the glass
I’ll be there to pull you through
You just gotta be strong
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me  
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now 
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me

Years of distress, tears on the dress
Try to hide her face with some makeup sex
Uh!

All Saints for my angel, Alexander Wang too
Ass-tight denim and some Dunks
I'll show you how to do this young, uh!
No papers, catch vapors
Get high, out Vegas
D'USSÉ's on doubles, ain't looking for trouble
You just got good genes so a nigga tryna cuff you
Tell your mother that I love her ‘cause I love you
Tell your father we go farther as a couple
They ain't lose a daughter, got a son

Ooh
Everyone knows all about my direction
And in my heart somewhere I wanna go there
Still, I don't go there
Everybody says, "Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
“Say something that says something”
I don't wanna get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have
Everyone knows all about my transgressions
Still in my heart somewhere, there's melody and harmony
For you and me tonight 
I hear them call my name
Everybody says, "Say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something, say something"
Then, "Say something"
I don't want to get caught up in the rhythm of it
But I can't get help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes, the greatest way to say something is to say nothing
But I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the middle of it
No, I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Maybe I'm looking for something I can't have 
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothing at all
Sometimes the greatest way to say something is to say nothingHey little mama

Dammit babe
Blood thicker than water, right
Fuck bitches, they all alike
Stand up nigga, not the fallin' type
Heart blacker than a Harlem night
Til I met you, they say the devil wear Prada
But I doubt it cause the Lord did bless you
Damn look at that body
Short bus shorty, cause it sure is special
Cole to the rescue, never save a ho
Hoes like to hide their behavior though
Thought you was a down ass bitch
'til I found that shit a couple days ago
I was home alone, next thing I know
That long ass verse from a song called "Control" was on
The room got nearer, the tune got clearer
That's when I seen the shit playing on your phone
Girl, what is that, a ringtone?
Shit, not you too
Man that hype done got you too
Everybody and their momma gassed
Even my momma asked what I'mma do
Decisions, decisions
In case this is war, then I load up on all ammunition
If a nigga want problems, my trigger's on auto
I'll make sure that nobody miss him
Now pack up your shit, you don't believe in me?
I don't need you, I got me, bitch
Same nigga moved to NYC, bitch
Got a record deal and a college degree, bitch
Two gold plaques, I produced all the tracks
And I never ever ever lean on Jay-Z, bitch
And after all that achievement
Real nigga never even went and got his teeth fixed
Now you try to play me, bitch?
You try to fuckin' play me? I ought to knock your ass out

TKO, I don't understand it, tell me how could you be so low damn
You've been swingin' after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
All hail Pretty Flacko, bitch, celebrate it
Had the game on lock, streets serenaded
Now you lame mothafuckas lookin' devastated
Bet you niggas wish you never hated, that's the devil ain't it
Fuck that shit, he rich, fuck that shit, he this, fuck that shit, he that
He black, he don't like blacks, fuck that shit, he wack
Fuck that shit he raps, fuck that shit he spits, fuck that bitch
Fuck that bitch he with, finished talking shit? Get up off my dick
The nonsense is synonymous with comments from the blogs about
Menages with the gossips and the bosses, fuck surprises
I'm monogamous and not to mention, in my closet
Is a model chick, grimey gothic fits, trapped inside of it
Besides it I'd deny the shit shit, y'all should stop the shit
I'm the shit, not just kinda sick, the doc prescribed my shit
Cock it, click-click, opposite, stop and droppin' shit
'fore poppin' shit, from popular to poppin' picks to poppin' tits
She pop her pussy, pop a Xanny, popular for compliments
Make it rain, she pop that shit, it boosts her confidence
Was supposed to stop this shit but spit like I forgot some shit
Forgot the topic, I hope God forgive you, peep my common sense

They keep callin' on King Push, this beach chair, I'm stretched out
My name is my name, bitch, until I'm gone and it's etched out
I been known to blow a quarter brick on baby hairs and a messy bun
If I make her mine, I made her mind, she fall in line and we got some
Memoirs of a millionaire, even better I'm a reallionaire
Alaïa skirt, Fendi work, dress my baby like build-a-bear
Fuck you know about the type of rollie? Fuck you know about blowin' bands?
Bezel on it like a grand circle, diamonds in it, holdin' hands
A1 since day one, I sold dope and my name rung
I sold dope where I came from and it's so dope what I made from it
No lie, know why? Guy Fish in my bowtie

If that's your girl, better watch your back 
'Cause she'll burn it up for me, and that's a fact 
Take it to the chorus, ha
Come here, girl 
Come to the back 
VIP 
Drinks on me 
Let me see what you're twerking with 
Look at those hips 
You make me smile 
Go 'head, child 
And, get your sexy on 
Get your sexy on 
Get your sexy on 
Get your sexy on 
Get your sexy on, ha 
Get your sexy on 
Get your sexy on

You ready? 
You ready? You were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river 
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head 
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
So cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 Cry me a river
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
Oh!  oh, the damage is done
So I guess I'll be leaving
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river 
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Oh, cry me a river

It goes electric, wavey when I turn it on
All through my city, all through my home
We're flying up, no ceiling, when we in our zone
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops 
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine 
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
A feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance

So just dance, dance, dance
Come on
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
I don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock, the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine 
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance

Don't know why, but girl, I'm feeling close to you
Maybe it's this ocean view, I'm so emotional
And all these thoughts been dancing on my head
For too long, too long, too long!
I wrote a song for you, I wanna sing to you
But every time I'm close to you
The words wanna come out, but I forget
It's so strong, it's so strong, it's so strong!
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore
A crowded room anywhere
A million people around all I see is you there
And everything just disappears, disappears, disappears, disappears

Changing up and breaking all my rules ever since we met
I'm so gone, I'm so gone, I'm so gone
Just like the movie shoot, I'm zooming in on you
Everything is extra in the background, just fades into the set
As we ride off into the sun
It might seem like I’m catching something
That’s because it’s true
I can't deny it, and I won't try it
But I think that you know
I look around and everything I see is beautiful
Cause all I see is you
And I can't deny it, and I stand by it
And I won't hide it anymore!

Didn't have to run, I knew it was love from a mile away
But I had to catch you, running through my mind all day baby
They all say I'm crazy, 'cause anybody even when your father say
That I can't be with you, I don't hear a word they say
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
'Cause I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax
Guess what? I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me
Now we didn't have to fall, but we fell in love to the bottom, babe
No one's there to catch us, like when you fell from Heaven that day, baby
People always staring, but I don't care nothing about it, babe
Since I saw your face, I've been staring just the same
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she told me, that she's in love with me
My pretty lady
You'll always be my baby, baby, baby
It's so amazing
How you became my baby, baby, baby
My little daisy
Come here, let me rock you like a baby, baby, baby
Pretty lady
Don't you know, you'll always be my baby, baby, baby

That everybody's got something to say
But I don't pay attention to the talk, baby
And I don't really care if they stop and stare
'Cause they see my number one
My number one girl
I told you I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I'm in love with that girl, so don't be mad at me
I don't care
So what? You're from the other side of the tracks
So what? The world don't think we match
I'll put it down like my love's on wax, guess what
I'm in love with that girl
And she already told me that she's in love with me
I'm in love, yes, I'm in love with that girl
I don't care what people say, people say
Cause I'm in love with that girlAin't another woman that can take your spot, my—
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me 
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular? 
Well, baby, I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl 
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you 
Because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the country side
Sittin' on the grass, layin' side by side
You can be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love 
My love

Ain't another woman that could take your spot
My love 
My love 
My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, girl, my love, my love
Now If I wrote you a love note
And made you smile at every word I wrote 
Would that make you wanna change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team? 
See, what's the point in waitin' anymore?
'Cause girl, I've never been more sure 
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you been waitin' for 
Because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

Shawty cool as a fan, on the move once again 
But he still has fans from Peru to Japan
Hey, listen, baby, I don't wanna ruin your plan 
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girls worldwide throw they hands up high
When they wanna come and kick it with a stand-up guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen with a man so fly
And, babe, with friends so fly, I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle my B.I
They call me Candle Guy 
Simply 'cause I am on fire 
I hate to have to cancel my vacation, so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gon' try 
You don't come, I ain't gon' die
Hold up, what you mean? You can't go? Why? 
Me and your boyfriend, we ain't no tie 
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high 
Well, baby, it's obvious that I ain't yo' guy
I ain't gon' lie, I'll fill your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
St. Bart's, Anguilla, anywhere I chill 
Just bring with me a pair, I will 
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand

My love 
Ain't another woman that could take your spot, my love
Love, love, my love, my loveFrequencies so low
Heart on a string
A string that only plays solos
Rain made of echoes
Tidal wave rushing on and on
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
Shell made out of gold
Found on a beach picked up and you held so close
Rain washed out its glow
Heartbeat steadily leads me down below
Under the water you scream so loud but the silence surrounds you
But I hear it loud and you fall in the deep and I'll always find you
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
20,000 leagues away, catch up to you on the same day
Travel at the speed of light, thinking the same thoughts at the same time
Heartbeat set at steady pace, I’ll let the rhythm show me the way
No one can find us here, fade out and disappear
If my red eyes don't see you anymore
And I can't hear you through the white noise
Just send your heartbeat I'll go to the blue ocean floor
Where they find us no more
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floor
On that blue ocean floorHey pretty lady
This goes out to you 
I said it like a thousand times
But everyday still feels like the first day
This is dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Dedicated to you, dedicated to you, dedicated to you
Pretty lady, when you walk on by
It was such such a mellow, mellow, mellow day
When you walk by, sunshine
It was such a mellow, mellow, mellow
I, I can't deny the way you caught my eye
Then something strawberry filled up the sky
And everything on you intoxicates
It's a mystery, I don't know why
I let you kick in my do not disturb sign
But I guess your mouth in motion got me so high
And I could tell it’s pure just by the taste
And you kiss me
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before
Baby, please don't change nothing
Because your flavor's so original
And it all started when she said
Hey hey hey, smacking that strawberry bubblegum
You really got me when you said
Hey hey hey, popping that strawberry bubblegum
This goes out to you, this goes out to you
So tell me why, we're making love like professionals on the first time
Acting unprofessional but it works out
'Cause you don’t wanna work here anyway
And baby I, girl I'm all addicted and I won't fight
You and me that's the recipe for a good time
And it ain't really nothing but clothes in the way
So tell me you wanna get close somewhere far away, far away
Don't worry about your loving it won't go to waste, go to waste
Don't ever change your flavor 'cause I love the taste
And if you ask me where I wanna go, I say all the way
'Cause she's just like nothing
That I ever seen before

So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end, but I guess I was wrong, uh
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it 
I'm just so sick about it

You said that you were movin' on now 
And maybe I should do the same 
The funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now it's all just a shame and I guess I was wrong, uh
Don't wanna think about it 
Don't wanna talk about it

]
Yep, yep, yep, yep
Let me paint this picture for you, baby
You spend your nights alone and he never comes home
And every time you call him, all you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out that he's doin' to you
What you did to me, ain't that the way it goes?
When you cheated, girl, my heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without sayin' that you left me feelin' hurt
Just a classic case, a scenario
Tale as old as time, girl, you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody 
To cure the lonely nights 
You wish you had somebody 
That could come and make it right 
But girl, I ain't somebody 
With a lot of sympathy 
You'll see, see
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
See, you should've listened to me, baby
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Because 
HahahaSaid all I want from you is to see you tomorrow
And every tomorrow
Maybe you’ll let me borrow, your heart
And is it too much to ask for every Sunday?
And while we're at it, throw in every other day to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Fall, yeah
Now how about I be the last voice you hear tonight?
And every other night for the rest of the nights that there are
And every morning I just wanna see you staring back at me 
'Cause I know that’s a good place to start
I know people make promises all the time
Then they turn right around and break them
When someone cuts your heart open with a knife
Now you're bleeding
 But I could be that guy to heal it over time
And I won’t stop until you believe it
'Cause baby, you’re worth it
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with me
No, I won’t fill your mind
With broken promises and wasted time
And if you fall, you’ll always land right in these arms
These arms of mine
Don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me
'Cause you might fuck around and find your dreams come true with me
Spend all your time and your money just to find out that my love was free
So don't act like it’s a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
It’s not a bad thing to fall in love with me, me
Not such a bad thing to fall in love with meHey, hey, hey, come on
We're having too much fun right here
She's got a secret, but I know
She wanna break it down for me like she tryna get some paper
Who needs a stage with the lights low
'Cause you already dropped the bullet and turned it into something major
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first 
Don't rush, go slow, I-I can't lie, I'm impressed
Standing ovation, encore, when love curtains close

It's a cabaret 
'Cause even though I'm a professional, I like to do my work at home
Cabaret 
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
You giving me everything you got, all I really want now is more
Fantasy play the role
And all these new moves that I'd like got me feeling like a stranger
Say my name, do you know
'Cause I got you saying Jesus so much, it's like we are laying in the Manger
Now can we discuss how fast you just got undressed
Girl, if sex is a contest, then you're coming first

I'm tryna ease your mind, word to Boosie
Pole in my bedroom that was there when I moved in

Girl what difference does it make if it was there, or it's mine

And I'm gonna fuck you like we are having an affair
I swear it's like I'm undercover way I'm cuffing you though

Yeah, okay
Met you out on Broadway on the hottest night in town
We arrived solo but we were being chased around
Saw you being cornered by some guy you used to know
Stepped in between the both of y'all, said "I'm leaving, do you wanna go?"
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I don't know if you 'member this, but I was out of town
Flew in on a 3 AM just to show up and hear your sounds
The multiple times, stop, hit the set
You ain't had it that way, I can guarantee you that
'Cause I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now, baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Can't nobody top it, girl
Ain't no better option, girl 
Ain't nobody stopping, girl
This here when I drop in, girl
I work, work when I clock in, girl 
I'll be the light when you can't see
I'll be the wood when you need heat
I'll be the generator, turn me on when you need electricity
Some shit start to go down, I'll be the one with the level head
The world could end now
Baby, we'll be living in The Walking Dead
Now I wanna know everything
Don't leave a single detail out
I'll get mine later, just fell out
It makes me a generous lover
Ooh, I wanna see everything
So don't leave a single detail out
I want it all on the table
The personal way to, wait
Ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, there ain't no need of stopping, girl
Yeah, okay
'Cause I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-ies
I got you, I got supplie-ie-ies
Supplie-ie-iesI brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
Hey, sugar plum, look at where we are
So tonight, if I take it too far, that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
Been a minute since we've had some time to breathe
So if you see another side of me that's okay because you know
I hear the making up's fun
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light
And girl you know
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
Well, I got your sweet with a twist of lime
And this one's neat, well you know that's mine, here we go
And do it twice 'cause you know we like it
And damn anybody if they disagree
They don't understand you're just like me, they don't know
We do it twice 'cause we know we like it
But then your hands talking, fingers walking, down your legs
Hey, there's the faucet
Someone's knocking like they know
But baby, don't you stop it, yes I'm watching
Your hand slides down the light 
And girl you know
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
How do I ever explain what I've got with you?
I try to find the words but they hide and that's the truth
And nobody ever will understand what we do
There's only one me and you
Come here, hold me
'Cause there's only one me and you
Yeah, there's only one me and you, uh
There's only one me and you
You know there's only one me and you
I brag about you to anyone outside
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I'm sorry baby, you know I try
But I'm a man of the woods, it's my pride
I wrote this to let you know
And I let them feelings show
I'm the man of the woods and you're my pride
Ooh, I can't make them understand
But you know I'm a Southern man
A man of the woods and you're my pride
Ohh, hey, hey
A man of the woods, it's my pride
Now let the beat ride like...Bittersweet thing, could this be a dream
Or just the same nightmare that keeps me awake?
Feel it in my brain, tall shot of pain
Pour a little out now for the love that we've made
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Got that poundin' on my brain, so I drowned it away
When the sun comes up tomorrow, you can find me doin' the same
'Cause I just can't forget, the way we turned out this bad
And now the only thing that sleeps here is a ghost of you instead
I feel it the morning, you're still here in the morning
I see you, but you're gone, telephone the doctor, I'm not okay
The bottom of the bottle to fill this empty heart up
A thousand proof don't change the truth, I dive in, but I can't
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in
Say, now tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Break it down
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
I can't drink you away, away
I can't drink you
No, I can't drink you away
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends
But I can't drink you away
All of these rocks, I can't swim outta this skin, I'm livin' in
Say, so tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Tell me baby, oh yeah, now don't they make a medicine for heartbreak?
Oh yeah, tell me baby, don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
Tell me baby, now don't they make a medicine for my heartbreak?
I can't drink you away
I've tried Jack, I've tried Jim, I’ve tried all of their friends

Bed's way under the ground, under the ground
And I'll be down and throw it at that level
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down
You know that she's a killer
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Watch it get down, watch it get down
Murder...
You dancing around, hanging out the window
Talking real big with your little slim waist
And with all that below your waist
Girl, you know the next scene is murder
Maybe you need to watch out something might go down
Girl, your body is gonna end up
Under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
And even when you dress regular a freak chick
Girl, you complement my taste
So girl don't be stingy the more that you give me the better
You know you killin' me softly but we can go as hard as you want to
Until the bed's way under the ground, under the ground
I would be down to go to that level
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Ooooh, that girl is murder 
Under the lights and sound
Everybody get down, down

Watch it get down, watch it get down

Listen
I kinda noticed, something wasn't right
From your colorful face
It's kind of weird to me
Since you're so fine
If it's up to me, your face will change
If you smile then that should set the tone
Just be limber
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Just remember
Sing a song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
See, people are so phony
Nosy 'cause they're lonely
Aren't you sick of the same thing?
They say so and so was dating
Love you or they're hatin'
When it doesn't matter anyway
'Cause we're here tonight
If you smile, then that should set the tone
Just be limber, baby
And if you let go, the music should move your bones
Baby, just remember
Sing a song with me
Ain't nobody love you like I love you
You're a good girl and that's what makes me trust ya 
Late at night, I talk to you
You will know the difference when I touch you
Yeah, you know I can make ya happy
I could change your life
If you give me that chance to be your man
If you give me that chance to be your man

Because I'm in love with you
Laying here, in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night
Look, I can't even get out of bed
With the thoughts you putting in my head
So I say to myself, "I don't even want to try"
Here, every part of me is paralyzed
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight, just one more night
I know I got somewhere to go
But I'm thinking we should lay here real low 
Ooh, 'cause baby, it's no lie
Ooh, I could watch you 'til the day I die
'Cause I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do is hold you tight just one more night
Yes, I'm in love with you
Laying here in the morning light
And all I want to do
Is hold you tight, just one more, one more nightDo you remember
The 21st night of September?
Love was changing the minds of pretenders
While chasing the clouds away
Our hearts were ringing
In the key that our souls were singing
As we danced in the night
Remember how the stars stole the night away
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba duda, ba duda, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda, badu
Ba duda, badu, ba duda
My thoughts are with you
Holding hands with your heart to see you
Only blue talk and love
Remember how we knew love was here to stay
Now December found the love we shared in September
Only blue talk and love
Remember, the true love we share today
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
And we say
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
The bell was ringing, aha
Our souls were singing
Do you remember
Never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day
Ba de ya - say do you remember
Ba de ya - dancing in September

Dancing in September

Say do you remember
Do you remember?
Ba de ya - dancing in September 
Ba de ya - never was a cloudy day

The bluest water and bonfires
I got on rose-coloured glasses
Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some us time would be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice
And miles on our passes for love
Would you believe we're alone?
So far from home, but you love it though
Set yourself free, in a zone
Ain't got no phone, but don't need it though
'Cause it ain't got no waves 
Waves

Aging like your favorite wine

Battin' your eyelashes
Come on, don't be passive
Some us time would be magic
This is fantastic, and we could get some practice

When we become the animals that were made in the jungle
Why you standing so far away? Minding manners and looking on by
Why don't you come out to play?
And get closer to your animal, inside
Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love 
Baby, you act like a lady, don’t have to cover it up 
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, 
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Show me your teeth, and spread your wings
Down and dirty, you're loving me so loud
Rare breed but you’re out as a stray, sideshow in front of the whole crowd
Baby, I act like the gentleman that your mama would love 
Baby, you act like a lady, don't have to cover it up, things you wanna show me
Make me remember the reason why I wanted your love, 
I think you're ready to try, walk a little closer and...
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Sounds are calm
When we become the animals that were made in the jungle
Deep in the jungle where the creatures meet
The animals come out and make the sounds of the beat
They pull off they skin so you can really see
That you’re dealing with a whole new breed
Now take me to your jungle, I'm not afraid
And if you're looking for your animal, hop in my cage
Crawl in and tear off your hide, don’t taunt
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want
Come in, come in, gimme what I don't know, I want

Hi my name is Bob and I work at my job
I make forty-some dollars a day
I used to be the man in my hometown
Until I started to lose my way
It all goes back to when I dropped outta school
Having fun, I was living the life
But now I got a problem with that little white rock
See I can't put down the pipe
And it's breaking me down, watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Now you gotta understand I was a family man
I woulda done anything for my own
But I couldn't get a grip on my new found itch
So I ended up all alone
I remember where I was when I got my first buzz
See I thought I was living the life
And the craziest thing is I'll probably never know
The color of my daughter's eyes
And it is breaking me down, watching the world spin round
While my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
It is breaking me down, no more friends around
And my dreams fall down, is anybody out there?
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
So can you help me find my way?
Oh my God, please forgive me 
Cause I know I've done some wrong in this life
If I could do it all again, have just one more chance
To take all those wrongs and make them right
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Can anybody out there hear me?
'Cause I can't seem to hear myself
Can anybody out there see me?
'Cause I can't seem to see myself
There's gotta be a Heaven somewhere
Can you save me from this hell?
Can anybody out there feel me?
'Cause I can't seem to feel myself
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
Can you help me find my way?
Losing my way
Keep losing my way
Keep losing my way
So can you help me find my way?
Yeah, yeah, yeah...Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
When a father's love is doin' you wrong
When a mother's love is bringin' you home
When you needed, needed, needed a stone
Someone to lean on
Now I know I could never sit in his chair
And that missin' love left you bare, yeah
But if I'm bein' selfish, that gave me a reason to be there
With my flannel on
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
You see, I've been down that road before
And I wouldn't dare say that my hurt was more
But a little spitfire hurt you, boy
With nothin' to lean on 
It's bound to go down after a couple empty cans
And I knew once I saw that fancy record company man
And in her face, she knew I wasn't staying
I was leavin' with my flannel on
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
The character's in the way you wear it
It takes your shape while you keep it on
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
Now I pledge you'll never ever be alone
And I pledge these arms and chest are here
To hold you in from the cold
Right behind my left pocket
That is where you'll feel my soul
It's been with me many winters
It will keep you warm
Ooh, here's my flannel
The character's in the way you wear it 
It takes your shape while you keep it on 
May we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
And may we live for many winters
Keepin' each other warm
Do you see?
Look at all of it from up here
It's beautiful, it's beautiful
Do you see it?
It's in the air
It's in your blood
It's in your skin
Can you see it from up here?
Can you taste it?
Can you touch it?
It's in the earth
It's in the sky
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?
Do you see me?Yeah, yeah, hey
It's goin', goin', goin' down

Relax, take your coat off, and let me get your name
I love that hourglass shape you got up on that frame
I like the way you talk your game, we might be one and the same
Now I know you got a buzz off that alcohol
I got a house that can entertain all o' y'all
Maybe later on, I'll give you a phone call
About to slide out, but I'll get back at ya, ooh
And when I call, don't give me the runaround
I ain't gon' have ya try to play me like a silly clown
Don't second guess it, girl, there ain't nothin' to think about

My name is Tim, a.k.a. Thomas Crown
I heard you're lost, do you know your way around?
If you got a problem, baby, I can hold you now 
I can be your navigator or your compass
Better yet a genie, baby, make your first wish
You the party, baby, I'm just the guest list
I think I need some Tylenol, you got me restless
So grab your friends and let's take ya back to my house
Let's watch Sex and the City or Desperate Housewives
Simon says, touch yours while you touch mine
Parental discretion is advised 
Y'all can be the star in my freaky spot light
Studio 54 if we get the props right
All we need right now is a little bit of, little bit of act right
Y'all lookin shy, but y'all act like y'all don't hear me

Yeah, see, girl, you stronger then the strongest drug I ever had
You can mix 'em all together, you still would be twice as bad
'Cause you're the worst best girlfriend I ever had
Harder to quit than cigarettes and green bags
Harder to escape than jail cells and bills
Man, ya you had me lost since the minute girl and pig tails
Like Michael Jackson, how you do me this way
Got me cryin' rivers like Timbaland and Timberlake, yeah
They call me Juicy J, straight up out the Three 6 Mafia
Ghetto fab player, all these freaks I'm tryna holler at ya
Quit playin' games, girl, you got my head spinnin' 'round
I ain't gon' chirp your mobile phone and chase you all over town
I just wanna pick you up and take you to a wrestling match
Is it good? Is it good? And have a lil' smack fest
So if you never call me, I'll be somewhere down in Tennessee
Washin' away my sorrows in cold cup o' Hennessy
Little lady 
You got me just 
Off of your melody

Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Grass is greenest when you're here with me, okay, mmm
If what they got is all good then why would they trade
No we are in the zone and we ain't gonna let it go, no way
What we got is solid as oak so you know it'll never blow away

Or trees on the lawn
Wind is always there, what they're saying it's just air
Let it blow through you
Don't let it move you
Now the sun dances across the sparkly waves, yeah
While we're canoeing, stoned as "Tiny Dancer" plays

At times I wish there were two
So I have somebody else that could help me help you

Back on your knees and you’re tryna' soul search, singin'
I'm just a man doing the best that I can
Saint or a sinner, the loser can be a winner with a plan
When you're living off the land
Why you waste what you ain't got
On that power ball

See the easy thing to do
Is the hardest thing for you
You just open up yourself
So the truth could come through
I'll be damned, sometimes it's hard, the backed-up bills on the credit cards
She keeps on threatenin' to leave

Stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness
I close my eyes cause you’ve been gone
Such a long time, I fantasize
You close so long fantasy
Began to see, it altered my mind
Am I crazy
When I open my eyes
The world was gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold
Tell me why can’t I see you
I’m stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness
If I close my eyes and concentrate
You illuminate your brightest slide
And I let you go the worst mistake
It’s clear as day
But I can’t wrap my mind around it baby
And when I open my eyes
The world is gone, long gone, long gone
Reached out when I heard you call my name
But all I felt was cold
Tell me why can’t I see you
I’m stuck in black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness
Tell me why can’t I see you
It’s like I’m stuck in black and white
And you’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindness
Why can’t I see you
In black and white
You’re in technicolor brightness
Why can’t I see you
I’ve been struck by blindnessWhen I wear his shirt, it feels like, like his skin over mine. And the little holes and tears and shreds on it are, are, are the, the memories of the past that I wasn't there for, but, that somehow I, I, I feel like I understand more when it's against my skin. It's an armor, like a barrier from the world. Like, our secret nobody else knows and I like that, you know? It makes me feel like a woman, it makes me feel sexy, it makes me feel...it makes me feel like I'm hisSo give me the hard stuff 
Oohh, yeah

Anybody can turn and run when it starts to rain
And everybody wishes all the skies were blue

So give me the hard stuff
The kind that makes you real
I'll be there when the storm comes

Let's put it on cruise control
Let me take you to the crib, let me ease your soul 
I'm gonna take it nice and slow

I know your favorite song
I hear it every day
Whoever made your smile
Made it to get in my way
And every time you laugh
You make that little sound
It's just the hardest thing
To love you, but not know how
So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid
'Cause I've tried to forget you
But these things just don't go away
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
That we were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me
What good are words
When they always just get in our way?
And it hurts the most just to know
That you don't feel the same, the same
So sometimes, I get down on my knees
And I pray things will change
But life is what happens when things
They don't work out our way, our way
So I spend all my nights in the dark and afraid, hmm
'Cause I've tried to forget you
But these things just don't go away, away
I hate that you're perfect, perfect for me
If I didn't know better, then I would believe
We were made for each other, but I'd know the truth
You're no good for me, I'm no good for you
And I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for me 
I hate that you're perfect, you're perfect for meNow baby, the day you were born

And show this world how to care
And nothing brings more joy to my life
Than knowing my girl will be there
Are you happy, girl?
Knowing that you right near broke my heart in a piece or two
Knowing that I would have walked across the ocean for you
Saying you're young and confused
Well, that's a lame excuse
That's why the only one to blame is you
For last night
Can't believe what I was hearing
Telling me to have a nice life
So tonight
I don't think I'll spare your feelings
You're on your own
I'ma do for me, what's right
In your eyes, Isee a second chance
Maybe I should take another glance
But for now, I'll wash my hands
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe
Pharrell say "Don't do it the same"
But I say ain't playing my games
But for you, my soul still remains
'Cause I love ya babe, love ya babe

It goes electric wavy when I turn it on
And if you want it inside your soul
Just open up your heart, let music take control
I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop
And under the lights when everything goes
Nowhere to hide when I'm getting you close
When we move, well, you already know
So just imagine, just imagine, just imagine
Nothing I can see but you when you dance, dance, dance
Feeling good, good, creeping up on you
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
All those things I shouldn't do
But you dance, dance, dance
And ain't nobody leaving soon, so keep dancing
(I can't stop the feeling!
So just dance, dance, dance, come on
Ooh, it's something magical
It's in the air, it's in my blood, it's rushing on
Don't need no reason, don't need control
I fly so high, no ceiling, when I'm in my zone
'Cause I got that sunshine in my pocket
Got that good soul in my feet
I feel that hot blood in my body when it drops, ooh
I can't take my eyes up off it, moving so phenomenally
Room on lock the way we rock it, so don't stop

When I can't help myself, no, I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
No I can't help myself, no I can't help myself, no, no
Caught up in the rhythm of it
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
Maybe I'm looking something that I can't have
Everyone knows all about my transgression
Still in my heart somewhere, in melody and harmony
For you and me, tonight
Whoa

Everybody says "say something"
Say something, say something

And every time you think of me, I wanna blow your mind
I wanna be your air
So sweet and fair
So when you feel that you can't breathe
Ma, I'll be there
I wanna be your answer, all the time
When you see how I put your life before mine
With no question
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
I wanna hold your hands
Review all your plans
I wanna make sure every one of your dreams will stand
I wanna be your broadway show on review 
So I can act out how God was when he made you
I wanna be your lighthouse when you get lost
I'll light a bright and shining path to help you across
I wanna be your mother, wait
See what I see
And when you see that can't nobody hold you like me
'Cause I love you
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here 
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl 
I'ma take it from here
And when there's no one there to hold
And you realize the world is cold
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here  
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time 
Don't worry, girl 
I'm gonna take it from here 
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Give me one reason why we should not be leaving
This world is so deceiving, the time is now
Let's fly away, speeding 
Through the Garden of Eden
Look at where all the sweet breathing of love surrounds
When all the love feels gone
And you can't carry on
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here
Just as sure as the sun will shine
Every morning, every time
Don't worry, girl
I'ma take it from here 
Love ain't always the way they write in books 
See there's the good guys and also heartbreak crooks
Your heart's the real book; just take a look inside
'Cause it's a colorful illustrated guide
So there you go
Don't worry
I'll be the one
To help you weather the storm
I'll be there mami
No matter what time
No matter what place
You can always count on me
I'll take it from hereWould have given up my life for you
Guess it's true what they say about love
It's blind
Girl, you lied straight to my face
Looking in my eyes
And I believed you 'cause I loved you more than life
And all you had to do
Was apologize
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be, when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me, again
No, no, no, no, no, no
Sadness has me at the end of the line
Helpless watched you break this heart of mine
And loneliness only wants you back here with me
Common sense knows that you're not good enough for me
And all you had to do
Was apologize, and mean it
But you didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me
I wish like hell I could go back in time
Maybe then I could see how
Forgiveness says that I should give you one more try
But it's too late, it's over now
You didn't say you're sorry
I don't understand
You don't care that you hurt me
And now I'm half the man
That I used to be when it was you and me
You didn't love me enough
My heart may never mend
And you'll never get to love me
Again
Again, yeah, yeah
Again, again, again, yeah, yeah, yeah
Never get to love meYou've been alone
You've been afraid
I've been a fool in so many ways
But I would change my life if you thought you might try to love me
So please give me another chance to write you another song And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again
I'm not a saint
I'm just a man who had heaven and Earth in the palm of his hand
But I threw it away
So now I stand here today asking forgiveness
And if you could just please give me another chance to write you another song
And take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again
Little girl, you're all I've got
Don't you leave me standing here once again
'Cause I'll give you my life
Yes, I would, if you would let me try to love you
So please give me another chance to write you another song and take back those things I've done
'Cause I'll give you my heart if you would let me start all over again
..Again
No, no, no
You know I love you
Give me one more chance
No, no, noYeah, come here baby

Rubbing on me
Le, do, do, do, do...The beautiful days are long gone
I can’t seem to breathe
It feels like it hasn't been that long
Since you walked away from me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know I still think of you that way
You should know… that
The beautiful lights, the star filled nights
They don’t mean a thing
'Cause you were my star and so it don’t seem right
Without you here with me
Now I can try to act real strong
But you and I both know it's hard for me to say
You were my soul
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door... for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl, your love is still on my brain
Now when you're in love, it takes time to heal
When someone's broken your heart, it changes how you feel
Girl, I thought that you’d never do me that way
But even after all, I still think of you that way
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door... for our love
And I can tell you I feel It’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl, your love is still on my brain
Now love is a game that we both like to play
But will I win or lose if I go or if I stay? Yeah
Even though I try to hide my broken heart inside
Girl, you know me inside out and I can’t get you off my mind
Now I could say that I don’t love you no more
And I could say that I’ve closed the door for our love
And I can tell you I feel it’s time for us to go our separate ways
But baby, I just wouldn’t be the same
'Cause girl your love is still on my brain, yeahIf I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you up and fly you far away from here
And you’d put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can’t save you from the troubles of the world
And this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could I'd fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you and fly you far away from here
And we’d fly so high up in the sky
Where the stars are so clear
And then I could save you
From the troubles of the world
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol’ pair of wings
We keep getting older, the world keeps getting colder
Tell me when did we lose our way?
It’s so hard not to lose your mind in such crazy days
But if I had one wish, I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that will do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with you
If I had a pair of wings
I’d scoop you up, we’d fly away and disappear
Then you could put your worries upon my shoulders, my dear
Now I know I can’t save you from the troubles of the world
I know this sounds like such a silly thing
But if I could, I’d fly you away
On a big old pair of wings
And if I had a pair of wings
I’d pick you up fly you far away from here
And I could stay right by your side and keep you so near
And then I could save you from the troubles of the world
And all you’d have to pack is your heart to bring
And there we are, you and me
Flying on a big ol' pair of wings
If I had one wish I know what I’d wish for
There’s only one thing that’ll do
I’d fly away on this pair of wings with youStarted off a team

I remember when you used to love me
You used to kiss and hug me
I look into your eyes and get lost for a day
You love me is what you told me
All the time I let you hold me
How I in fear you slippin' away
You were my sun, you were my earth 
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no 
So you took a chance, and made other plans 
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no 
You don't have to say, what you did
I already know, I found out from, him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me, there'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me 
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me

Should of picked honesty
Then you may not have thought it

Yeah!I was just walking that day, aimlessly 
You picked a perfect day to bump into me 
Probably should've watched the stars in the sky the night before
But for some reason, we still met at your store 
Your eyes have a story that they wish to tell
And I have my whole life and I listen well 
Look, I'll be your confidant
Tell me anything
But please start it off with how you tuck your wings
Oh
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
All my friends meet you and say you're the one
And all my meaningless friendships should be done
You had a friend, but he did you wrong
But I'm a God sent sign that reads "Please move on with me"
You taught me to use my heart and forget my eyes
And that's the way to his kingdom of eternal life
Since you're an angel, baby your job's never done
Too bad the world won't see you when they dial 9-1-1
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothing else that I have seen
There's no getting around it or in between
You're out of this world
Except you're not green
Look, you don't know what you mean
To me, to me
There's nothin' else in this world
Like you
So why is it so complicated?
What are you afraid of?
I've been asking everybody what they think
But I don't know why because they don't know you
I'm even asking other guys what would they say
But I don't know why 'cause they don't do what I do
Girl, I say an ultimatum's for you
But you'd probably take that and just run
Now I gotta decide if I'ma help raise your mind
Seems like the ultimatum's on me; that's no fun
I was just walking that day, aimlessly
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, da-dum
Da, da, dum-dum-dum-dum, oh, ooh
Da, da da-dum, ooh, oohI hope this gets to you the right way. It’s the only way I know to do it. Some people may criticize me for the last 3 days. But it was fun, right?? Right?!?! Besides, I’d rather speak directly to all of you. And, who can knock me for having a little bit of fun with it?
Well… No more teasing. Although, it was A LOT of fun. 
*Makes a serious face*
So, here goes:
This year is an exciting one for me. As you probably have heard through the “grapevine,” I’m gearing up for a big 2013
Back in June of last year, I quietly started working on what is now, my next journey with that thing I love called MUSIC
The inspiration for this really came out of the blue and to be honest, I didn’t expect anything out of it. I just went into the studio and started playing around with some sounds and songs. It was probably the best time I’ve had in my career…
Just creating with no rules and/or end goal in mind and really enjoying the process
What I came up with is something I couldn’t be more excited about! It is full of inspiration that I grew up listening to and some newfound muses that I’ve discovered along the way
I’m calling it “The 20/20 Experience,” and it’s coming out this year
I hope you enjoy listening to it as much as I enjoyed making it
That’s all I’m giving you for now… I know, I know! Again, with the teasing!!!
Get ready. This is going to be fun Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby
Got laid off at your job today
You've been working at this place for years
And though you were underpaid
Mami, that place isn't worth your tears
I know that life is hard on you
And you can't seem to find out why
I'll explain, just grab your coat, girl
And just join me on this ride
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay
Girl, you're the best
You could be
An angel among society
But you get crushed
From what you see
You try to hard to help and that's enough for me 
Try to change what you can
And accept all the things that you cannot
I know you wanna fly away from the world
But for now with the time we've got
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away-ay 
We can spend the night, till the morning light
Let's just get away-ay 
Maybe if you consider us just riding
That once you feel like a winner
No more crying
And baby, I know just what you need 
To let your hair down so that you feel free, yeah
It hurts me to watch you sing the blues 
Girl, you're so confused 
And I know what to do
Let's take a ride, on the country side
Let's just get away 
We can spend the night, till the morning light 
Let's just get away-ay 
Let's take a ride
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby 
Hop in the car and go with me
You don't have to pack everything
Don't you wanna feel the breeze?
And forget everything, baby

You hangin' on to every little lyric she say
You bought a big rock hopin' she'd show it off
You tried to go hard but you end up lookin' soft
It took a couple stacks just to make her fall
And when you wasn't lookin' she took it all
She got her nails done red and they're sharp as a knife
Don't turn your back, cause she moves like a thief in the night
Your little plan had a , got held up like a

She took your home account and she don't even care
Not even a dream couldn't save you from this nightmare

Keep your eyes on the road ahead
But if you're feelin' lost in the night
It's okay to cry
Just as long as you hold your head
'Cause we're on our way to better
Better's ahead, better's ahead
It gets worse 'fore it gets better
But better's ahead, better's ahead
Better days are comin' 
Better days are comin' 
Better days, better days 
Better days are comin' 
I know you've been kicked down
Slept on, let down, faith gone
Waited for too long for something to lean on 
You feel weak, just be strong 
Deep breath, stay calm
If you just press on, press on, press on
You gon' see there's a light at the end of the tunnel 
Keep your eyes on the road ahead 
And if you're feelin' lost in the night 
It's okay to cry

Keep goin' higher, and higher and higher and higher

But I always see love that you are giving to me
And I still don't know what led me to you
But I know this, this was meant to be
And girl in your smile I see my everything
But if the words I say
Make the tears roll down
And they find their way to make your heart go down
Your lips can say enough
The tongue controls my mouth
And all that is me is found
In the corners of your mouth
Sometimes I can't believe the things I say to you
But baby every word is true yes it is
And when you kiss me it's all over
You put me under I didn't know that love can hurt so good
And girl in your smile I see my everythingWell I heard there was a secret chord
That David played and it pleased the Lord
But you don't really care for music, do you?
Well it goes like this: the fourth, the fifth
The minor fall, the major lift
The baffled King composing Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Well your faith was strong but you needed proof
You saw her bathing on the roof
Her beauty and the moonlight overthrew you
Now she tied you to a kitchen chair;
She broke your throne and she cut your hair
And from your lips she drew "Hallelujah."
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Maybe there's a God above
And all I ever learned from love
Was how to shoot somebody who outdrew you
And it's not a cry you can hear at night
It's not somebody who's seen the light
It's a cold and it's a broken Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah...
Hallelujah...Dum dum dum dum dum-dum
Do...
Do... Oooh...
You're still captivating even though it's been so long
You used to love me, tell me baby what went wrong
'Cause now you march to the beat of a different song
Try to understand that we needed space
But everywhere I turn I see your face
I've been waiting for you to come home
'Cause I don't want to be alone
I still love you
Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
You are my light
I have changed girl since I last saw you
When you left, you don't know what you put me through
But my heart's still racing just being next to you
I can't escape the magic in your eyes
Is there a way to make you realize
There's no one more special to my heart
But you want us to be apart
I still love you
Why did you take away your love, baby
When did you think to just give up, yea
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
You were my world
You meant everything to me
You're the air I breathe
The song I sing
You were my queen, I was your king
But if we can try to work it
We'll show the world what love is about
Baby come home cause I can't take no more
Of this loneliness
And emptiness
Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on now
Without you
Why did you take away your love
When did you think to just give up
How am I supposed to carry on
Without you
You are my
You are my light5 foot 9
She's got legs for days 
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor 
And when she starts to move
She have you calling your mama saying "You wanna go home"
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running girl?
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby

But I guess love don't love me, no
It's OK to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad 
She will probably be the best thing that you never had
Don't waste no time 
Trying to make her your own 
'Cause what she says goes
And like Boyz II Men said, this is the end of the road
Baby, tell me 
Why can't I have you? 
Why you running, girl? 
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby

But you led me on
Left me feeling strong 
About you
But I can't take no more, so I'm gonna leave you alone
Girl, I'm gone; girl, I'm gone, OH!

She's freaky and I like it
Listen
She grabs the yellow bottle
She likes the way it hits her lips
She gets to the bottom
It sends her on a trip so right
She might be goin' home with me tonight
She looks like a model
Except she got a little more ass
Don't even bother
Unless you've got that thing she likes
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows
She's freaky and she knows it
She's freaky, but I like it
She shuts the room down
The way she walks and causes a fuss
The baddest in town
She's flawless like some uncut ice
I hope she's goin' home with me tonight
And all she wants is to dance
That's why you'll find her on the floor
But you don't have a chance
Unless you move the way that she likes
That's why she's goin' home with me tonight
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows
Now dance
Little girl
You're freaky, but I like it
Hot damn!
Let me put my funk on this one time
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned and I swear she's bad
And she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights seem to cause a glare
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned from everywhere
She's that and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I have to stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
Man I swear she's that and she knows
I think that she knows
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
She's got me love stoned
I think I'm love stoned
She's got me love stoned
I think that she knows, think that she knows, oh, oh 
Those flashing lights come from everywhere
The way they hit 'em I just stop and stare
I'm love stoned from everywhere and she knows
I think that she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
And now I walk around without a care
She's got me hooked
It just ain't fair, but I...
I'm love stoned and I could swear
That she knows
Think that she knows, oh, oh
She knows, she knows, oh, ohYou with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged, oh I realize

In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
The darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small

Can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
This world makes you crazy

On the bottom, on the top
I won't stop until you pop
Girl work it, don't you like it dirty? Forever you told me
I'm the only one who's in your heart
So beautiful how you whisper
We would never be apart
And now things are changing
I can see the way you look at me
The say the eyes are the windows to the soul
So I finally chose it just can't me
Why didn't I see you coming?
Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good
Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true, no
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do
Seduction at its finest
Has stripped away all my dignity
So beautiful how you whisper
Nothing can come between you and me
No I never imagined myself in this state of mind
I'm stuck between a dream and a nightmare
Where the passion has driven me blind
Why didn't I see you coming?
Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you
Be so cold and treat me like you do?
I'm still lost in your every move
It's just too bad that you're no good
Go ahead and tell that you love me
I know that it's just not true
Gotta give it to you
You got me what the hell's a man to do
Why didn't I see you coming?
Now this a vision where you stood
And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do

And I would touch you if I could
But your lips keep sayin what your heart would never do
Someone tell me how can a girl as fine as you

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love

 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl

Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My loveThere ain't nothing
Like the real thing
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
I see your picture
Hanging on the wall
But it can't sing
Or come to me
When I call your name
I realize it's just
A picture in a frame
And I read your letters
When you're not here
They don't move me
They don't groove me
Like when I hear
Your sweet voice
Whispering in my ear
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
No other sound is quite
The same as your name
No touch can do
Half as much
To make me feel better
Let's stay together
Together, baby
Together, yeah
Together, together
I got some memories
To look back on
And though they help
When you phone
I'm well aware
Nothing takes
The place
Of your being there
There ain't nothing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
Baby
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
Oh, oh
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
The real, the real
There ain't nothing
Like the real thing
The real, the real
The real thing
Oh, the real thingYou were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know all the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
And made other plans
But I bet you didn't think that they would come crashing down, no
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him and you know it
Don't act like you don't know it
And all of these things people told me
Keep messin' with my head 
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say what you did
I already know
No chance
And don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you loved me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
So cry me a river
 Cry me a river
 Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You don't have to say what you did
I already know
No chance
You and me
Don't it make you sad about it?
Cry me a river
Oh, cry me a riverHey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were going to make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around

What goes around comes around
Yeah

You should know that
What goes around comes around
Yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?

Comes all the way back aroundI think I heard something, the way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And your ? once around, got my speakers bumping
Your trebble's so hot, but I need to feel your base bumping
So turn the volume up, and shh
I think I heard something
The way your body sounds, it makes me want to do something
And you ? only once, so? it's got my speakers bumping
So go ahead, and let me know you ain't afraide of nothing
So turn the volume up and let your body talk
La la la la, la la la la
And make your body talk some more
La la la la, la la la la
I can make her body talk to me
I can make that thing  jump off her, and walk to me
Baby girl, you're looking like a theam park to me
I mean, you're looking like stars in the dark to me
I feel like I'm on mars, and you're apart from me
Leonardo, making love is an art for me
New Carledo kinda small, but it works for me
Baby doll, I'm at your neck like a shirt button
What you tryna do, twirk something
I can make it feel good when it hurt, honey
Left you alone, the nerve of him
Shsh, I think I heard something5 foot 9, she's got legs for days
Green eyes that cut like a knife
And her own little sexy sway
No, she don't waste no time
Moving to the floor
And when she starts to move she had me
Calling your mama saying you wanna go home
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running, girl?
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you
I want you, baby, I want you
But I guess love don't love me, no
It's okay to be scared
'Cause this girl is super bad
She will probably be
The best thing that you never had
Don't waste no time
Trying to make her your own
'Cause what she says goes
And life points to miss
And this is the end of the road
Baby, tell me
Why can't I have you?
Why you running, girl?
I just wanted to love you
I love you, baby, I love you
I love you, baby, I love you
But I guess you don't have time for me
I want you, baby, I want you

Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about her

Just so confused about her
Feeling the blues about her
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around

You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about her
Don't want to talk about her
I'm just so sick about her

You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you found out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When You cheated girl
My heart bleeded girl
So it goes without saying that you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody with a lot of sympathy
You'll see
I thought I told ya, hey

I've been waiting in the hall
Been waiting on your call
When the phone rings
It's just a friend of mine that say
"Hey, what's the matter, man?
We're gonna come around at twelve
With some Puerto Rican girls that are just dyin' to meet you
We're gonna bring a case of wine
Hey, let's go mess and fool around
You know, like we used to"

Ooh baby why you wait so long

Won't you come home, come home
I've been walking in Central Park
Singing after dark
People think I'm crazy
Stumbling on my feet
Shuffling through the street
Asking people, "What's the matter with you, boy?"
Sometimes I want to say to, to myself
Sometimes I say
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh oooh
Oooh oooh oooh
I guess I'm lying to myself
It's just you and no one else
Lord I won't miss you child
Aaah aaah aaah aaah

Aaah aaah aaah
Aaah aaah aaah aaah

'Cause your shine is somethin' like a mirror
And I can't help but notice
You reflect in this heart of mine
If you ever feel alone and
The glare makes me hard to find
Just know that I'm always
Parallel on the other side
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now
And I'll tell you, baby, it was easy
Comin' back here to you once I figured it out
You were right here all along
It's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me 
I couldn't get any bigger 
With anyone else beside me 
And now it's clear as this promise
That we're making
Two reflections into one
'Cause it's like you're my mirror 
My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Aren't you somethin', an original?
'Cause it doesn't seem merely assembled
And I can't help but stare, 'cause
I see truth somewhere in your eyes
I can't ever change without you
You reflect me, I love that about you
And if I could, I
Would look at us all the time
'Cause with your hand in my hand and a pocket full of soul
I can tell you there's no place we couldn't go
Just put your hand on the past
I'm here tryna pull you through
You just gotta be strong
I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold

My mirror staring back at me, staring back at me
Yesterday is history, oh
Tomorrow's a mystery, oh
I can see you lookin' back at me
Keep your eyes on me
Baby, keep your eyes on me
'Cause I don't wanna lose you now
I'm lookin' right at the other half of me
The vacancy that sat in my heart
Is a space that now you hold
Show me how to fight for now

If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side

Your touch is so magic to me
The strangest things can happen
And the way that you react to me
I wanna do something you can't imagine
Imagine if there was a million me's talkin' sexy to you like that
You think you can handle, boy
If I give you my squeeze and I need you to push it right back
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothin' disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby

And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
So just let me drive my body around ya
I bet you know what I mean
'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic
Everything ain't what it seems, I wave my hands and I got you
And you feel so fly assistin' in me
But now it's my turn to watch you, I ain't gon' stop you
If you wanna crowd my neck, talk sexy to me like that
Just do what I taught you, boy, when I give you my heat
And I need you to push it right back
Baby, show me, show me what's your favorite trick
That you wanna use on me and I'll volunteer
And I'll be flowin' and goin' till clothing disappears
Ain't nothin' but shoes on me, oh baby
All night show with just you and the crowd
Doin' tricks you never seen
And I bet that I can make you believe
In love and sex and magic

'Cause you know that I can make you believe
In my love and sex and magic, ohAin't another woman that can take your spot my...
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My loveO-O-Ovy On The Drums
You're preachin’ to the choir, stop hatin' on yourself
Quit playin' with your mind, you’re spinnin'
If you think that I'm a liar, just try it for yourself
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing
Yeah, I know it's so hard to throw away
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
The other side
Got you stuck in your mind
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain’t always greener on the other side
Hey you, stop stressin’ 'bout what you’re missin'
So blue, just take it easy, take your time
If you think my words are wise, just try it for yourself
I promise the stars will light the path you walk, don't give in
Got a heart of gold, what a shame to go to waste
The clouds will open up, blue skies are willing
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you’re losing your shine 
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side 
The other side 
Got you stuck in your mind 
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
Just take it from me, you'll be okay 
'Cause it don't matter how sweet it tastes 
The grass ain't green, don't worry
Losin' sleep, still wanna get
Yeah, you get
Back on your feet again, lift your head, hold it high
You wanna run it back, but you can't turn the time
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
You start to feel like you're losing your shine
But the grass ain't always greener on the other sideIn all, enthrilling new, living sound
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
She kill me with the coo-coochie-coochie-coo
Baby, every day in training to get the gold
That’s why your body's crazy
But you can’t run from yourself, that’s where it’s difficult
Girl I can see in your eyes that there’s something inside that made you evil
Where did you go, cause it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shh you say
Don't know why it gets to me
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Baby, now I really know what we're fighting for
This rematch sex is amazing
But nobody wins when if somebody’s heart is swole
Cause when I see you move like you got something inside that made you lethal
Where did you go, it just ain't fair
Over here thinking bout the shh you do
Don't know what I got to lose
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO
I’m out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
It's just a TKO
I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
T-TKO
Out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Now, I'm out for the count
Yeah, girl, you knock me out
With a TKO
Girl
See what you doing
See what you doing, girl?
You knock me right out
See what you do
See what you do
Girl, girl, girl...
You knock me right out
It cuts right on my eye, yeah it hurt, won't lie
Still can't see, think I saw you with another guy
Fair fight, knocked down, then I got over you
Can't fight no more, you knock me out
What am I supposed to do?
I don't understand it
Tell me how could you be so low?
Been swinging after the bell and after all of the whistle blows
Tried to go below the belt, through my chest, perfect hit to the dome
Dammit babe
This ain't the girl I used to know
No, not anymore, TKO {Verse 1}
No, I never thought anyone could pull the wool over my eyes, yeah
But you're not just anyone, you're a master of disguise, oh yeah
I swear you put on one hell of a performance
'Cause you were just using me to get what you wanted
And I ain't see it coming, no, I couldn't see it coming
{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, when I'm alone
{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
{Verse 2}
Oh, how you feel my heart, if this is how you do me?
I told you that I loved you, oh
And that's not something I say loosely
That's not something I say loosely
Oh no
{Pre-Chorus}
But you had me fooled thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need, when I'm alone
{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
{Bridge}
Maybe it's karma, maybe it's bad luck, maybe it's all coincidence
Maybe I gave you confidence, maybe
I'll forgive you, already miss you
But right now, I ain't got time for that
No Super Bowl, I ain't running back, no
You crossed that line when you walked outside when I said goodbye
Victim of your crimes, taking back what's mine, when I cry inside
Wish I could rewind, but I know that I can't take back time
I can't take back time, can't take back time, so
{Chorus}
I'm hoping that you learn how it feels to be loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger

        Ladies and gentlemen
It's my pleasure to introduce to you
He's a friend of mine
Yes, yes I am
And he goes by the name...
Justin
Wowoowoooo
All the way
From Memphis, Tennessee
And he's got somethin' special for y'all tonight
He's gonna sing a song for y'all
About this girl
Come in right here?
Yea, come on
On that sunny day
Didn't know I'd meet
Such a beautiful girl
Walking down the street
Seen those bright brown eyes
With tears coming down
She deserves a crown
But where is it now
Mamma listen
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...
Running fast in my mind
Girl don't you slow it down
If we carry on this way
This thing might leave the ground
How would you like to fly?
That's how my queen should ride
But you still deserve the crown
Or hasn't it been found?
Mamma listen
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
And no longer will you ever have to cry
Senorita, I feel for you
You deal with things, that you don't have to
He doesn't love ya, I can tell by his charm
But you could feel this real love
If you just lay in my...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
Ah, ah, arms...
When I look into your eyes
I see something that money can't buy
And I know if you give us a try
I'll work hard for you girl
You won't ever cry
Now listen
I wanna try somethin' right now
See they don't do this anymore
I'ma sing something
And I want the guys to sing wit' me
They go
"It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?"
And then the ladies go
"I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you"
Guys sing
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
And ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Feels good don't it, come on
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?

Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Yea, yea..
It feels like something's heating up, can I leave with you?
Ladies
I don't know but I'm thinking bout, really leaving with you
Gentlemen, good night
Ladies, good morning
That's itHey girl, is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you babe
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
Now girl, I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now
And maybe I should do the same
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, babe
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without ya
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around

What goes around comes around
Yeah

So if the feeling’s right, raise your glass and let’s
Take back the nightA vision of you girl, across the room
A club full of people, all I see is you
You're making eyes
You realize that I'm watching you
It's so hard to believe that you're breakin' me from across the room
I've been trying to push up next to you all night
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys
But what if I never had another chance to, to tell you
Just how you make me feel
And I just wanna let you know
You're softly killing me, with just your mere words hello
This may sound a bit crazy but lately I just wanted you to know
You strangely seduce me with just the way you say hello
This may sound quite forward but honey is there somewhere we can go?
Normally I just can't believe
I don't act this wild
But there's something about the way you smile at me
Feel like a child
And when you said hi, I almost lost my mind from the sound of you
I can tell you're kind
You wanna go outta sight, but you don't wanna be rude
I've been trying to push up next to you all night
But I gotta wait for a moment, for me that's right
And I don't wanna sound like those other guys
But what if I never had another chance to, to tell you
Just how you make me feel
And I just wanna let you know
You're softly killing me, with just your mere words hello
This may sound a bit crazy but lately I just wanted you to know
You strangely seduce me with just the way you say hello
This may sound quite forward but honey is there somewhere we can go?So you had your chance to be my lover
And there's really something more undercover
And you know that ain't cool
So I said in an hour call your momma and tell her she better just come get you
Cause frankly, baby, you ain't worth the gas in my BMW
Thought our love was so strong
I guess I was dead wrong
But to look at it positively
Hey girl
At least you gave me another song about a horrible woman
And that's you, but its trueBefore the line say - me and you
Once upon a time in another episode
We knew every line, but we still didn't play the roles
Now I can rewind - there she goes x3
-
Now I got
No equal for my sequel
All alone in a sequel          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Oooh, oooh, hmmm
Love is lost, where is it to be found?
My heart is still here and we have to go 'round and 'round
And all the time I was loving you faithfully
And you took my love and you turned it around on me
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do 
Don't you leave me like that, I just want my girl back
Can we work it out, or is it over?
 What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
 What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together
It's hard to let go
Girl we've been through so many things
But for you to grow, it had to go and spread your wings
I see your tears, you're searching for a brighter day
Oh, you should've thought it through when you gave my love away
Now, I don't wanna fight with you
I've done everything I can do 
I hate to leave you like that but I thought you had my back
We tried to work it out but it's over
 What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out 
 What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about?
 Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together
Girl it's just too much for me to say, for you to tell me that you love me
And then to watch you walk away
But girl the way we fight, it just ain't right
That's why it's better this way 
Now no what else to say, but girl you know that
 I  still  love  you  Yeaaah
 What are we doin'?
Why can't we seem to work things out
 What are we doin'?
Did we forget what love was about? 
 Feels like I'm losing
But when that was everything to me
But now I realize we are just better not together
I've realized we are just better not togetherYou were my sun
You were my earth
But you didn't know
All the ways I loved you, no
So you took a chance
Made other plans
But I bet you didn't think
That they would come crashing down, no
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
You know that they say
Some things are better left unsaid
It wasn't like you only talked to him
And you know it
All of these things people told me
Keep messing with my head
Should've picked honesty
Then you may not have blown it
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
You told me you love me
Why did you leave me all alone?
Now you tell me you need me
When you call me on the phone
Girl, I refuse
You must have me confused
With some other guy
The bridges were burned
Now it's your turn, to cry
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Cry me a river
Oh! The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
Oh! The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
Oh! The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
Oh! The damage is done
So I guess I be leaving
You don't have to say what you did
I already know, I found out from him
Now there's just no chance
With you and me
There'll never be
Don't it make you sad about it?
Cry me a river…Hey girl
Is he everything you wanted in a man?
You know I gave you the world
You had me in the palm of your hand
So why your love went away
I just can't seem to understand
Thought it was me and you, baby
Me and you until the end
But I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Should've known better when you came around
That you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around, yeah
Now girl
I remember everything that you claimed
You said that you were moving on now 
And maybe I should do the same 
Funny thing about that is
I was ready to give you my name
Thought it was me and you, baby
And now, it's all just a shame
And I guess I was wrong
Don't want to think about it, no
Don't want to talk about it, hmm
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it, uh
Feeling the blues about it, yeah
I just can't do without you
Can you tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry
Now it's breaking my heart to watch you run around
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
That's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah
What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
What goes around comes around, yeah
What goes around comes around
You should know that
Don't want to think about it, huh
Don't want to talk about it
I'm just so sick about it
Can't believe it's ending this way
Just so confused about it
Feeling the blues about it
I just can't do without you
Tell me is this fair?
Is this the way it's really going down?
Is this how we say goodbye?
Shoulda known better when you came around
Shoulda known better that you were gonna make me cry
It's breaking my heart to watch you run around
Now it's breaking my heart
'Cause I know that you're living a lie
But that's okay baby 'cause in time you will find
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around
What goes around, goes around, goes around
Comes all the way back around yeah
Yo, yo
Let me paint this picture for you baby
You spend your nights alone
And he never comes home
And every time you call him
All you get's a busy tone
I heard you find out
That he's doing to you
What you did to me
Ain't that the way it goes
When you cheated, girl
My heart bleeded, girl
So it goes without saying
That you left me feeling hurt
Just a classic case
A scenario
Tale as old as time
Girl you got what you deserved
And now you want somebody
To cure the lonely nights
You wish you had somebody
That could come and make it right
But girl I ain't somebody
I'm out of sympathy
You'll see
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
I thought I told ya, hey
See?
You should listen to me, baby
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Because...Ain't another woman that can take your spot my...
If I wrote you a symphony
Just to say how much you mean to me, what would you do?
If I told you you were beautiful
Would you date me on the regular, tell me, would you?
Well, baby I've been around the world
But I ain't seen myself another girl like you
This ring here represents my heart
But there's just one thing I need from you, say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holdin' hands
Walkin' on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sittin' on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Now, if I wrote you a love note
And made you smile with every word I wrote, what would you do?
Would that make you want to change your scene
And wanna be the one on my team, tell me, would you?
See, what's the point in waiting anymore?
'Cause girl I've never been more sure, that baby, it's you
This ring here represents my heart
And everything that you've been waiting for, just say "I do"
Yeah, because
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
Oh, girl
My love
My love
Alright, it's time to get it JT
I don't know why she hesitates for a man
Shorty, cool as a fan on the new once again
But he still has fan from Peru to Japan
Listen baby, I don't wanna ruin with your plan
But if you got a man, try to lose him if you can
'Cause the girl's real wild, throw their hands up high
When they wanna come kick it with a standup guy
You don't really wanna let the chance go by
'Cause you ain't been seen wit' a man so fly
Baby, friend so fly I can go fly
Private, 'cause I handle mine
T.I. they call me candle guy
Simply 'cause I am on fire
I hate to have to cancel my vacation so you can't deny
I'm patient, but I ain't gonna try
You don't come, I ain't gonna die
Hold up, what you mean, you can't go why?
Me and you boyfriend we ain't no tie
You say you wanna kick it when I ain't so high
Well baby, it's obvious that I ain't your guy
I ain't gon' lie, I feel your space
But forget your face, I swear I will
Same bark, same bullet, anywhere I chill
Just bring wit me any pair, I will
I can see us holding hands
Walking on the beach, our toes in the sand
I can see us on the countryside
Sitting on the grass, laying side by side
You could be my baby
Let me make you my lady, girl, you amaze me
Ain't gotta do nothin' crazy
See, all I want you to do is be my love
 My love
 My love
 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
 My love

 Ain't another woman that can take your spot, my love
