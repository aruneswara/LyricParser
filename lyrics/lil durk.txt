Sex her once then kick her out 'cause I don't nut twice
The way that A$AP died don't sit in my gut right

And I don't fuck with no fuck niggas, so these niggas don't owe me nothin'
Grown niggas act like kids, actin' like they Benjamin Button
Put my own fee down for my lawyer, that shit was twenty-one hundred

I had roaches at my granny crib
Jumped into the streets on accident
Police snatched me up they better not ask me shit
I don't want no Quali I want some Actavis
I bet that nigga won't lack again
Remember I had them 2s for 10s
Put me on child support you better not ask for shit
On my dead body
I remember wakin' up and seeing a dead body
And I can't go back on my word that's on my dead body
Don't come to my funeral crying ova my dead body
And I ain't gon' pick you out I'm talking 'bout everybody
I remember selling weed inside some Ed Hardy's
My homie he the police he might be fed probably
That's on my dead body
You ain't never been in a shootout with yo' homie he ain't shoot back
Niggas don't try me when I'm by myself 'cause I'm too strapped
Always tryin' to fix some shit where its loose at
Couldn't get none to eat where I'm at I sold loose squares
Tryin' tell my judge my story like who cares
Can't explain the love I got in for Dahmir 
Don't come outside when it's war I think you scared
Wasn't in my life I tell my kids you dead
Know some niggas that'll snake their homies for some meds
Know some niggas that don't take care of their homies in the feds
Know some niggas that took some gunshots to the head
No reaction and scream "gang gang" when I'm dead
Please be greater, don't please these haters
When that Bentley paddle, like please these gators
I don't cry at wakings, I'ma grieve later
You don't believe me now, you gon' believe me later
You ain't bleeding now, you gon' bleed later
We don't buy 5s 7s, nigga we take 'em
Percocet eater, I told Rex take 'em
Ain't let money change him

In the trenches, I done did it, I became a voice
See I ain't changed but I was goin' through changes
Pluto'd still be alive if he ain't hang with strangers
Niggas love you when you dead, that shit the strangest
Skylar and Bella my two angels

Spread the love

See I came from shit, know what I'm sayin', so I do what I want
That's why 2Pac was so great, you feel me?
He spoke his mind
Nigga ain't gotta be no gangster
Everybody with me ain't no gangsters

Everybody with me don't get money
You know what I'm sayin', but we gon' make that shit work
We gon' put the money niggas with the money niggas

Bitch, you a rat, never mind, I changed my life, I'm Muslim
I talked to Chops on FaceTime, he say, "Damn, you back smokin'"
He say, "That back door damn near closed," I say, "It's back open"
I say, "These blocks could be back one," he say, "You back hopin'"
You gotta watch them niggas you love 'cause they still backdoorin'
He ain't got no hope in beatin' his trial because he lost his motion
Bro got life, he don't know how pussy smell, that's why he fuck his lotion
I know some real niggas would lose it all for a viral moment
My dreads swing, I feel like Wayne, show me my opponent
You know, I like talkin' to the streets, like
When you say you the voice, you gotta, like, open up, like
Tell motherfuckers, like, what it is, like, you can't hold nothin' back
You gotta relate to them, relate to the poverty, you know what I'm sayin'?
Relate to the trenches
You know what I'm sayin', I can't be talkin' 'bout a Richard Mille all the time, know what I'm sayin'?
Some of the guys don't even know what the fuck a Richard Mille is
Know what I'm sayin'? You gotta relate
All angles, know what I'm sayin'?
The voice
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahYou know what I'm saying, um
The album done
Love Songs for the Streets 2
I got niggas who locked up who niggas lied on
These niggas shootin' at these kids, they shootin' in blindfolds
I got blood in my eyes, it ain't mine, oh
And I got niggas in the trenches who I'd die for
They got a murder that's unsolved, it got my mind gone
And foenem still'd be right here if he ain't take his mask off
Kenneka Jenkins' murder still unsolved, oh
They said I still can't do no shows in Chicago
That's why I'ma charge a hundred fifty for a concert
When I'm done with that gun, clean your palms, oh
I'd rather do 100 years than see my mom hurt
Before you say I left you hangin', get a bond, oh
I tell 'em, Nine coming home, they say I'm lying, oh
I wonder what was in his mind in that Tahoe
Off this ecstasy, I cannot sleep-ay-ay-ay
Wash this gun powder off with some bleach-ay-ay-ay
I'm Lil Durk and I be representing the trenches
Steady ready running from the Jakes, we hoppin' fences
I regret I caught that case, I had a witness
And when I'm talking to the streets I bet they listen
When I was down bad on my dick, they ain't pay attention
Man, I fell down to my knees when the law came
And I can't go like Mitch in the hallway
I'd rather go out just like Rico, snake 'em all, ay
Oh, oh-oh, ooh
I put this pain in this shit, that's why I got the streets
They gotta come see me for that pain shit, bro
Oh, oh, ooh, woah, oh, ohYeah, yeah, yeah, God, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas ain't really with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, main homies turned against me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard the story, think I'm finished
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give my lawyer a hundred and fifty
Ooh-oh-oh
I wish I would turn myself in before I fuck one last time
I wish I would turn myself in before I pour up one pint
I wish I would turn myself in without kissin' my kids, no, it ain't right
I wish I would turn myself in without playin' that shit back that night
I wish I would turn myself in without droppin' my album
I wish I would put trust in a nigga knowin' they goin' sour
I told 'em I wish I would, I fuck her in the butt, go douche
Told 'em put a big bag on my books, make sure my artist get pushed
Look up at the judge, can't look, state makin' up lies for sure
I'm an innocent man for sure, it is what it is for sure
Nobody gon' ride, had a warrant, so I can't hide
India gon' stay by my side, I did a song with Chance tonight
He givin' positive vibes to better my image for life
I turn myself in tonight, head down with these 'cuffs on, just read me my rights
Yeah, yeah, yeah, God, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas ain't really with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, main homies turned against me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard the story, think I'm finished
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give my lawyer a hundred and fifty
Ooh-oh-oh
I got five million followers, I need five million dollars
I scream, "Free Melly," from my cell even though they ain't got 'em
Mmm, free Von, free Zoo, even though they got the same problem
Mmm, false accusation, why they name droppin'?
They wanna know if I'm rappin' or robbin', takin' these drugs for family problems
I get a call, I call my mama, mmm, I'm sorry
I get a bond, I'm givin' 'em property, no, I can't tell, that's part of the policy
If you don't fuck with me, nigga, then fuck you, but I show love for niggas a part of me
I went from Margielas to state shoes, Amiri denims to jumpsuits
Locked in a cell with a curfew, in population, they can hurt you
No PC, commissary and receipts, fan mail, I gotta reread
New rappers wanna be me, can't be me, I'm gangster
Yeah, yeah, yeah, God, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas ain't really with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, main homies turned against me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard the story, think I'm finished
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give my lawyer a hundred and fifty
Ooh-oh-oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, God, can you hear me?
Yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas ain't really with me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, main homies turned against me
Yeah, yeah, yeah, heard the story, think I'm finished
Yeah, yeah, yeah, give my lawyer a hundred and fifty
Yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas ain't really with meHave a threesome with your bestie I'ma chance it
Don't take a pic when we together that's a fed shit
I spent over 4-5 racks on these glasses 
I want that purple with my color just like Kansas
Make sure I'm super fly because the cameras 
Put a mm mm mm mm inside a Tropicana
Sway don't, but the whole hood got the answers 
Black power in my blood my cousin Lee a panther 
Do a buck 50 riding down Lake Shore 
God took away my niggas they don't make more 
You take one of mine we gon' take four 
Bitches screaming fake love like a Drake tour 
We gon' pull up in that truck and it's paid for 
How you flexing with your homie, shit it ain't yours 
Cleaning pots inside the trap but I hate chores 
BJ took mine he catch a case I take yours 
Hitting that dope I gotta take dome 
I'm from the trenches make me hate storms 
How the fuck you on top and you don't make noise? 
I brought a hellcat from the trenches and I made it roar 
We violent, shawty don't be too silent 
She don't like public, all her pages be private 
Before I pay a nigga bills I buy fashion 
I fuck her off a perky pill got me lasting 
Ain't no way that hate can overpower love 
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust 
Used to look up to them niggas they in the back of us
Used to be my brother, show me they color
True colors, yeah your true colors 
True colors, yeah your true colors 
Niggas sneak dissing while you show your true colors 
Even with these shades I can see your true colors
I can't put no niggas over mine, I'ma over grind
Over time, for more chains I'll over shine
I'm screaming free 'em even if appeals denied
Gave 'em guns just to get some lower time
Like drinking lean shit way too cold with ice
Kidnap your son got me like I'm Uncle Ice
Your ass ain't right, keep my strap like a dyke
They shot my brother, we was in it all night
They don't listen you ain't no politician
And I was broke ain't have no pot to piss in
Don't fuck with too many niggas had to keep my distance
When I do come around I swear I feel the tension
I love my cousin Iris man I swear I miss her
Her daughter look just like her I see her and kiss her
My daddy never seen my kids, only through some pictures
At the time I was fighting cases so I couldn't visit
Ain't no way that hate can overpower love 
Ain't no money in the world that can buy you trust 
Used to look up to them niggas they in the back of us
Used to be my brother, show me they color
True colors, yeah your true colors 
True colors, yeah your true colors 
Niggas sneak dissing while you show your true colors 
Even with these shades I can see your true colorsHitta, my niggas drilling, my niggas winning

GANG!I was goin' through that pain alone
I was goin' through that phase alone
We all change, you say I change alone
Sleepless nights, barely changin' clothes
You know damn right you was wrong

Certain vibes, it don't feel right
Plenty nights got me traumatized
Why they lie? I do love my guys
You lookin' crazy, know the trenches raised me
I'm Durkio, but I'm Chicago JAY-Z
And I was scared how that money made me
I caught a vibe today, was lookin' crazy
Money ran low, right? Felons can't vote, right?
I can't even vote for who I believe in, shit ain't goin' right
I didn't drop a tear inside the funeral, I ain't mourn right
And I nut in all the hoes I fuck, I blame the porn site
Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in me
Quarantine what? I'm just tryna make a buck
Talkin' to my dawg, he be actin' like he stuck
Favorite gun a Glock, it slipped up, what a month
Throw it in they face every time I hold it up
Granny ain't feelin' too well
Shootout with the police, I ain't goin' to jail
How you actin' off a case, you'll know if you tell
I know a nigga from the hood, he'll serve with no scale
Watchin' Bands make a play, I seen him score in the mail
Gave him thirty-nine years, I heard him cry in the cell
Even though I'm gettin' big, I bought a MAC through my Zelle
Took a picture on my block, they think I'm back in the field
Please don't turn away from me
I got enough on my plate tryna turn away, tryna turn away
Became the voice of the streets and my people ain't believe in me
I'm supportive of the streets and them people ain't believe in meReal shit, shout out to my squad

If I got it then you got it too, that's the deal
Just don't change on me, my nigga
My life can't get no bigger
I became a big spender
But you still don't get the picture
That money don't mean shit to me
That money don't mean shit to me
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give 
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? 
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
I lost so many niggas, I dropped a tear about 'em
We drop couple of their niggas, you don't hear about it
I tell my niggas I love them to death, that's on my dead body
I don't wanna give up my life to anybody
Think they finessing, Durk will not help 'em out
'Cause I want they ass to win and take a better route
Wish Law ain't take that fifteen, he ain't settle well
They get 'em off the street, they had to set 'em down
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give 
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? 
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
My momma said I don't love nobody but codeine
Trapping like a fool 'til my pockets obese
Real copped to ten murders, on the police
Gave him twenty years, still send him money every week
I feel like, we don't work, we don't care, we don't never speak
Told my team, "Need plaques," so I don't never sleep
I'm forever real, I'm from the mud, believe
Can't struggle when I'm rich, I had to go and cheat
I notice everybody love you when you got something to give 
But what if I ain't have it?
Would you still be my rib? 
If I didn't have nothing to give
What if I ain't have nothing to give?
What if I ain't have nothing to give?

I know one nigga who'll come out a Cut' just 'cause he ain't have no car
I know one nigga who'll sniff a perc just 'cause he ain't got no bars

Do they love us like they say they do?

I went to jail and met Muslims, reason I don't eat swine
Ain't talked to my son in a minute, my mama had told me fine
My cousin had went to the feds and told me that he took his time
I lost my mind, I thought I was trippin', they told me that he dropped a dime, damn
Granny still holdin' up, sometimes she'll lose her mind
Had to catch myself sayin', "Remember?", damn well she don't remember '09
I threatened my homies, know damn well I'm lyin'
Don't switch your story, you know them niggas told on Nine
Can't hang with the mice
So high, I done came in her twice
Know a bitch suck dick for the Mikes
And I'm so legit with the ice
Drug dealer, no family price
I stopped drinkin' lean with the ice
G-Wagon, I lean to the right
I move like a thief in the night
Some niggas don't use they pipes
Stop playin', you'll lose your life
Some niggas ain't cool with a slice
Four-five with a drum, they slide
When they slide, you hide
You get caught, that's pride
'Cause you ain't gon' tell that story

Keepin' it real is the recipe
I let the streets get the best of me
Drug dealers tried to invest in me
I know some people in desperate needs
Gang hungry, I invest in we
Stayed in a home with no type of heat
9 to 5, I had checks a week
My big bro had a block of cheese
My shorty slide in SRT's
Four-five Glock with extended wings
They gon' slide when they off them beans
I ain't gon' lie, I can't be no meme
I still cry when I talk to OG
I see him dead, that shit OC
Two hundred grams and I send 'em OT
Gotta watch niggas, they be police
Rest in peace to Fredo, kill that lean

Big homies not big homies, they ain't tryna give direction
The advice they gave to me, I told them niggas they could've kept it
Could've stayed on the porch, but jumped inside the streets, I had a selection
Ain't no back and forth talkin' on the 'net, we send a message
You want the king, you want that tiger head like the nigga off of Tekken
Put blood, sweat, and tears inside of this shit, you gotta respect it
You ain't did shit for the streets, so how you gon' put a word in?

Ain't hide the guns fast enough, the police rushed in
And since you died for your gang, you got slumped in
You pull up bleeding out that pussy, you got a sucker then
You signed your name up on that statement, you got the best font
You asked me do I love you? Mhm, I'm nonchalant
Went on the 'Gram, seen an opp died, that's when I sparked a blunt
Maybe sipped a lil' lean too, but that's not the point

They'll give you life, but change to a dub if you give 'em names
Yeah, my life for real for real, this not a movie
If a nigga I know support my song, they'll call 'em groupies
And they ain't even meet Lil Baby, but they'll go post his music
And that's my dawg for sure, yeah, that's my dawg for sure
And I be stressed out with my kids, sometimes I don't call at all
And you be actin' like you off Percs, but you off Tylenol

For those who in this system
For those who in the state's system
Keep ya head, keep fighting
Cowards, rats, don't never win over real dudes
So keep ya head up soldier

Career day in school, never be a policeman
Top floor of the Fontainebleau havin' threesome
Look you in your eyes, say they love you, just don't believe them
In the trenches gotta play 'em close like you need 'em
Chest pain, I was sippin' lean by the liter
How you screamin' that you got some killers? You don't feed them
Booka steady trippin' when I say I don't believe in Jesus
Don't ever put your all into a bitch 'cause she gon' leave you
And I know a couple Atlanta hoes that wear her lashes
In the trap, I fuck the baddest bitches on the mattress
Given to the trenches, took advantage of my kindness
I done gave a nigga a lot of pounds without askin'
Government did that shutdown, he got his time in
Damn well, he don't 'posed to be on home confinement
Killers right on standby, go off my word just like Simon
I can judge a nigga by his character off his diamonds
I know a nigga, he shootin' dice with the T's
But how you say that when I give him all he needs?
And even though he ain't show no love, I tried to reach
In commonwealth, he took a dub, nigga, please
Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon' hate on you?
For that check, I'll hire your day ones to lay on you
Is they keepin' it one thousand like they say they do?

Out on 1300, so don't act like you can't find us
Tim-Tim lost his life, I bang the same block he died for
September 18th, ain't that the same shit we cried for?
My lil' niggas got to slidin' when them tears dried up
Made it out the trenches, we young vets and survivors
Learned so much from that corner, bumped my head, but now I'm wiser
Chasin' after trends, I risked my freedom for designer
Almost lost my life, got down, and I was on that timer
Now I hit up Treasures with a hundred thousand on me
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm with blast all by my lonely
Loyalty dyin' slow, you gotta watch out for your homies
If any nigga play, a dead man is what he gon' be
Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon' hate on you?
For that check, I'll hire your day ones to lay on you
Is they keepin' it one thousand like they say they do?

Told on 'em in the station, gave 'em right up
DD did time with no lawyer, it's survival
I'ma cut your ass right off, hang with my rivals
Catch a case while you a felon, I'll say it's my gun
They got my picture in the feds, say I'm a Disciple
They say I switched up 'cause I don't believe in the Bible
First time on the head, I kept my eyes closed
Only nigga I'm scared of is John Doe
And no support 'll make your time slow
Just a real nigga without trying to

That shit be strange when they say they love you
They say I changed when I got a hundred
You can't complain 'cause I been a hundred
Wartime inside the trenches, buyin' different bullets
Hop out a Cutlass right into the bushes
Run right on 'em while them niggas lookin'
Blood in my eyes, they tryna get me

Bullets must be blank cause they keep missing
Face up on that flyer if you want attention
You just want some fame boy you ain't in it

A gymnast in the kitchen, we cookin, we cookin, we cookin, let's get it

Just how he hit it, he gon' make an example of me
Shit, and I gotta case pending 
Cause these hoes steady calling my ho
Had this bitch steady breaking my code
Is it my finger prints from my 5S
Or one of my stuck up ass hoes?
Hold up let me think, let me take a drink
Cause I don't really know if no one care what a motherfucker think 
I'ma go crazy , I'ma go crazy 
And nobody sane 
Sometimes I get the urge to kill a bitch 
And I ain't even violent 
That's why a nigga gotta plead the fifth 
Sometimes it's good to stay silent 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Out of all your friends you the best 
So I won't cheat on you for them that ain't my status 
Fucking with these broke ass niggas , don't know what cash is 
See I just spent like twenty on a car, I got twenty in glasses
What you mad at me for?
Bitch stop tripping like you ain't never had it before 
And you gon' give me that ass, one time you gon' give me that work
Bitch get on my nerve 
I'ma fuck all your friends to get easy , you mad why you tweaking? 
Should've told the judge you gon' let me see my kids every weekend
I do it cause I'm rich, I ain't really gotta reason 
I'm packing my shit and I'm leaving
Sometimes I get the urge to kill a bitch 
And I ain't even violent 
That's why a nigga gotta plead the fifth 
Sometimes it's good to stay silent 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it 
Lord don't make me do it Can't finesse a finesse-a that shit unheard of
Call my squad with the Mac they talkin' word up

We catch a body my niggas gon' catch a body
Catch a homi my niggas gon' catch a homi
Go get that money my niggas gon' get that money
Don't let that sneak diss turn to a murder
Where he stay at
Where he lay at
Oh you got a big crib, lil bro where the k at?
Spit from the clip no latex
In the hood where it ain't safe at
Ask any nigga was I ever on that block?
Only a nigga say no is the hoes or the opps, on my pops
I was in the land with them mops
And I know from my deal what's the lineup
Talking life like a nigga with a camera
Pour a 4 in that Fanta
Grab the lean from the manor
I'm a big ol' nigga 150 with that hammer
Glock for the tears and burnt candles
Coupe roof open like sandals
Homicide on the scene and they wildin'
Like who did this they wildin'
OTF we promote violence
Everywhere I go I hear sirens
RIP Nuski and Iris

You  ever woke up out your sleep like is you gon' die in the trenches?
You ever thought it'd be your dawg when they described the witness?

To  claim that shit that bronem claim, you know that shit a privilege
For  Pat I'll throw them tears, I remember the night they took him

DJ played the opps inside this club, he better not play it again
See dissin' me and go OT gon' get your hood shot

And that shit all facts
I tried to give my dawg a pound but he want all crack

For a homicide when it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin'
Leave his loved ones all traumatized

Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
I'm a young nigga I be gettin' money

Keep your mouth shut in them investigations
You'll be out the station in a day or two
Dedication and a little patience
Lead to domination on my way to greatness

Lil' nigga, we used to roll with some older cats
Had macs in the trenches like shoulder straps
Shoot at me, on your head, put twenty racks
Where your money at? Why you get over stretched?
All my niggas off drugs, on stronger acts
I won't change, I'm  the same, I'm sober 
I just bought a brick and it cost a Patek
And if I say it's smoke, then they know it's stacked
My side, my side, that's Lamron
From the part of the city, they scam hard
You would sell your own momma heroin 
The kids that you raised they’ll blam some
Ran off on the plug through a Samsung
Feds tapping all the Iphones
Goons lurking like a plies song
Get it right before you die wrong
Where I'm from it ain't safe boy it's wild
Keep a gun cuz I gotta survive
Nigga better not come tweak on my side

Nigga know all my niggas gon' ride VVS's dripping down my neck, I'ma drown ho
Smith and Wesson, thinking I'm a game, I'm like Rambo
Came a long way from the trenches and the bando
Now it's me and Booka, Ikey, Doodie in a Lambo
Switchin' lanes, switchin' lanes, can't switch up on my main gang
You will die in the trenches thinking shit a game
These streets don't love you, these niggas don't love you for real
These bitches don't love you, these bitches don't love you for real
You can't run from your problems, nigga, you can't avoid it
They don't believe Rondo can get out, I got a lawyer
I'm from the dirt with my brothers like we came from soil
We too loyal to let this money change us, shit not royal
Get out these streets lil bro, this shit ain't for you
Just know that shit a lie when they say they love you
Gotta watch out for that knife when they come and hug you
'Cause it be the same niggas to come and slug you
I'm product of my environment
Bro a ex-killer, come out retirement
If he go down by himself for that case he'll tie you in
They gon' pull your strings like a violin
They gon' shoot your shit in traffic, no matter what car you in
Went to the streets and asked the dope boys is they hiring?
Gotta shoot something just to be with us, can't sign you in
If you over there and you don't 'pose to, you gon' die with them
Mama told me stay off these drugs, I need counseling
Tryna serve without paying, something gotta give
Always gotta chase a check, my son gotta live
How the fuck you want they custody, you ain't got a crib?
Got a crib, got a crib
Never serve a nigga where you gotta live
Secretive, secretive
Never tell a nigga where you live

Been through so much pain, I'm poppin' drugs with the pills
Yeah, I came from nothin' and I made it, niggas hate me
Bitches tryna have my baby, I even don't understand it
I keep get into it with my family, they keep askin' me for paper when they hear me on the radio station
All I wanted was the money, never wanted fame
Niggas actin' like they know me, they don't even know my pain
Bitch actin' like she know me, she don't even know my name
I'm a son of a king but ain't no crown when we talk reign
I got hoels in my umbrella
If I would've known, I probably would have done better
Put my trust in niggas when I should have known better
Bustin' my pistol, when it's empty, nigga gon' tell it
I'm jealous 'cause these niggas fake but they get respect
They lyin' in they rhymes, I tell the truth and I get neglect
Really sold nicks and dimes, tryna get a check in
Before dinner time, if not dinner, at least breakfast
VVS's dripping down my neck, I'ma drown ho
Smith and Wesson, thinking I'm a game, I'm like Rambo

Now I'm just savin' my money, you ain't gotta deal with me
I go broke, back to the block, ain't nobody gon' feel it but me
These niggas ungrateful
Do something for a nigga, niggas won't even say thank you
Speaking down on me now, that shit disgraceful
When nobody there, I was shackled down to my ankles
Now they callin' me with they problems like I made 'em
If I wouldn't here, who would you call?
If I wasn't rich, who could I call?
My days consist of me and my circle
Even got family members who ain't worthy
They be like let me hold something 'til Tuesday, I'ma give it back
Tuesday come, niggas act like they mad when you go to get it back
Bring up what you did for me then you shouldn't did it, I get sick of that
Everything I ever did was genuine, you would never hear me mention that
Remember that, nigga
So I get to showin' niggas love, like real love  pullin' up on niggas and everything, you know. 
Ain't nobody from our city that made it ever did that for niggas  ,you know what I'm sayin', the trenches.  I tried to be the first one to do that.  Niggas still hatin' on me for that.  Alright maybe niggas just broke and need some money.  I get the passing  cheese around that bitch, you know what I'm sayin'.

I did for everyone
Ungreatful, Ungreatful
Ungreatful
They tell me
Niggas did bids
She made sure you was fed
Let you talk to your kids, so they can love they dad
You wouldn't say thank you
But at the same time, she was trippin' about some taxes
She ain't wanna break bread with her man, she so ungrateful
Ain't cheat just to keep you happy, I wish I was unfaithful
Let niggas hold money Friday to after Friday like I was able
I brought niggas 'round my kids, let them eat at the roundtable
Watch playoff games up at my crib 'cause you ain't have no cable
Jail visits, sending pictures I was by that
You say I'm trippin' but your family who you was mad at
Ì know some niggas who would take you out for some Xanax
Plan B, 'cause Plan A we ain't never plan that
You miss court, I let you lay low
You stole from me and ain't seen you since, I told my OG I'ma give you halo
Got that dog food like we Ralo
And they gon' kill you if I say so
Aye, I'ma tell you the truth, I'ma spit facts, I'ma tell you one time alright. My bank called me and was tellin' me like, someone just forged your, umm, your signature. So I'm like, "Hell naw, y'all trippin'." 20, 30 thousand dollar check ain't nobody, ain't finna know nobody gon' walk in there and do that, you know what I'm sayin'. Whole time it was my family. You know what I'm sayin', that ain't even hurt me, man, I just knew what time it was. That's why everybody I got around me I call my brother or my family, you know what I'm sayin'. It's so crazy but sometimes I put water over bloodTurn the music up, yeah
Feel like every time I talk, they listen, you know what I'm sayin'?
Know what I'm sayin' like, I'm the one they look up to, you dig
Let me tell you a story
A story when I was a shorty
I went to school on a daily
And I was totin' my .40
My homie got pounds on pounds
I go over his crib like a forest
Askin' can he put me on now
Like why you ignoring me
I tell em go pull up a Taurus
At the top shootin a Taurus
I mix up a 8 and I pour it
I left my feelings in storage
Remember I jumped out the Porsches
You ain't no killa, ain't torch it
Don't get caught in the mornin'
We catch you, then we scorin'
Wash that blood with chlorine
You say I'm a hoe, you don't know me
I get you touched with no cheese
Gotta watch out cause I'm lowkey
Niggas be cool with the police
I made a dub off 4P
I'm in the trap with 4 P's
I went and copped me a rollie
I dun' showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again, just gimme yo hand
Them ain't my friends
Y'all my friends
Give me a chance
Give me a chance...
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance
Man I thought you was my dawg but you tricked me
You tryna play me close but niggas know you out to get me
Should've known when I said nah
You cut me off that shit was fishy
I trust you with my secrets but you went and told my business
Wanna be on the Forbes with you
I dun' slept on the floors with you
I dun' went to war with you
And we ain't have no pistols
I tell you stories when we both was dirty
When I was broke I was splittin' the perc'y
When I went broke I sold my .30
Couldn't get by and that shit hurt me
Caught with a gun, that shit was jerky
Called for a murder, they ain't showin' no mercy
Snake yo blood, that shit ain't worth it
At the same time ain't no one perfect
Went on a hit, that nigga was nervous
But I was blind cause nigga too thirsty
Caught me a body, I built my courage
Gotta watch out cause my dog was informin'
I dun' showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end
Forgive me again, just gimme yo hand
Them ain't my friends
Y'all my friends
Give me a chance
Give me a chance...
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

For a nigga, she'll probably kill a bitch
My people's, my people's
I see both
You've been rooting for a nigga for a minute
But to do this here exclusively, I lose you in a second
And your views are independent, but your friends gossip
See even if I kept my nose clean, they'd still claim it's snot up
Ok I love the fact that she loyal, and she love the fact that I get beat
And I love the fact that she huh, cause she love the fact I get beat
See love is making her weak is making her think she maybe need me
But the thought of making me stay is making me think I maybe need to leave
If I told you that I love you would you listen
Probably meant it if said it, yeah I'm sippin'
But that liquor, bring the honesty out a nigga
She got me, then I'mma get her
Look at her in her eyes, can't trust her 'round my guys
That faithful shit don't work, can't let her feed me them lies
But I always represent, for me she killed a bitch
I buy expensive shit, it's me she rocking wit'
Gucci, Louie, Fendi, she deserve all that
Her friends they kinda hate me, cause I think I'm all that
White coupe cloth roof, and the car shaking
It's just me and you, but we could add Franklin's
I represent like lawyers, I ball so hard like Jordan
I take a pic I promise, I'm Range Rover sportin'
She like heaven in my eyes, my bitch in disguise

Bro’nem caught a drug case, he got keys like he Alicia, y'all
Why the ones you love'll tend to leave whenever you need ’em most?
Even though we ain't got no bond like we used to, at least I call
DA gave his ass charge, charge, charge, he beat 'em all
Tried to turn himself when he got caught, but he couldn't see tomorrow
I got dark angels, better hope the alarm save you
I'm a devil wearing Palm Angels, gun hid under the car cable
Tryna get that reward, ain't you?
Sip lean, I pour maple
You my dawg, but you swore I hate you
Raw hoes, we give 'em facials
The ones that ran'll still run
We fell out and I still come
I feel all these tears runnin’
Make me wanna kill something, oh
Pass the water, rollin’
I pop all these drugs like I pop Ibuprofen
I carry my gun 'cause I cannot be loafin’
I miss all my dawgs, I'm sorry I told him
Why they think I'm lying? I carry my Glock inside my Tommies
Why they think I'm lying? When I’m off these drugs, I'm feeling zombie
Long way from designer, I used to be rocking Abercrombie
Muslim, the school ain't never serve me salami
'Cause I was the baddest nigga, used to run around in the grammar school
You turn your savage up and got a check, they gon' inherent you
You gave him a chance and he came back, how he gon' get mad at you?
And you damn near gotta go watch your back whenever they scared of you
Wash your hands with that bleach, wash off that gunpowder
Family never know what I'm doing unless my mama tell 'em
And I was standing in that rain with a Louis umbrella
Tell the truth, I'm not a goofy, but you got me jealous
Police come, I stash the drugs inside my Perry Ellis
I was sipping purple to the bone, I wasn't drinking yellow
And I used to like to sip alone 'cause I could drink it better
And I overslept for real, I wasn't skipping classes
Pass the water, rollin'
I pop all these drugs like I pop Ibuprofen
I carry my gun 'cause I cannot be loafin'
I miss all my dawgs, I'm sorry I told himIf you know me like you know me, I can't get tired of thugging
I choose you over any bitch, and I can't deny it in public
And I can't deny the way I feel, that's why I can't hide the struggle
Felt like I was locked up in immigration when I got denied in London
When I took a trip to the UK, I was thinkin' 'bout us
How I was gon' flip them euros to US dollars to get you a truck
And you ain't gotta worry about none of these hoes 'cause I ain't scared to say I'm stuck
And I ain't gotta clear up none of these rumors 'cause you got my trust
And I like the way your body is, you ain't gotta get shit tucked
Sneak a nut inside while you ain't lookin', I tell you the condom bust
We keepin' the personal business off the internet, that's why they onto us
I won your heart with being real with you, not none of that  designer stuff
Denied in the UK
Got denied in the UK
Got denied in UK
Got denied in the UK
Walk around the crib with your panties on and your toes out
I told her that she doing somethin' right when when she in these hoes' mouth
They tried to get her post some lingerie, can't pay her no amount
I post Atlanta tour, in sixty seconds, that shit was sold out
My cameraman got locked up for some weed, some shit he ain't know about
They told him to knock when you wanna talk, he went to sleep snorin' loud
I asked 'em how long we got left, they say it's gon' be awhile
I'm tryna turn up, I'm tryna go crazy and see the crowd
Got denied in the UK

They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
I go to the hood, they tell me don't come back, I'm starting a riot again
They coming around, they bringing them drugs, I'm starting to get high again
I fell on my back, I was tryna get up, but I had to go try it again
I cheated on you and that is my confession, I'm sorry, I lied again
He ain't accept when I said sorry, that's his pride again
This lawyer money steady stacking up, so his appeal won't get denied again
Why Lil Durk can't do shows in Chiraq? 'Cause he'll start riots again
I know who sell phones and iPads, they tryna get by again
Just keep Chicago in your prayer
Talk to the kids and you don't gotta pay us
I know that you thinking, I probably don't care
I'm willing to change, can I talk to the mayor?
They go off my past, they don't treat me fair
Radio didn't play my songs on the air
I tried to go pop, but the lane wasn't there
I changed my music, they still didn't care
I made the news, I visit schools
They still deny me for my show, I'm confused
I'm tryna talk to the alderman, I'm tryna talk to the mayor
I'm tryna talk to the chief of police, but they don't wanna hear it, they scared 
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
All of my niggas savage, most of my niggas violent
Know a couple niggas ratted, most of mine kept it silent
Little cuz fighting for murder, told 'em chill out gotta keep faith 'til the trial end
Half my city divided, if they can't get no money they sliding
That's why all the young niggas wildin'
That's why they started them riots again
Police ain't doing nothing about it
Violate our rights, tryna whack us again
It was life or death for my best friends
I don't want Glocks, all FN's
I told the youngins be better than me
If I don't try and help 'em I'm less of a man
I can show you how to manage your money 'cause I took a lesser advance
You in a position to be rich forever, but what about the rest of your friends?
Know I changed 'cause I said things that I won't say again
Got to embrace the streets so kids can come out and play again 
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots again
They started riots, they started riots againSonic
Career day in school, never be a policeman
Top floor of the Fountain Blue, havin' threesomes
Look you in your eyes, say they love you, just don’t believe them
In the trenches, gotta play 'em close like you need 'em
Chest pains, I was sippin’ lean by the liter
How you screamin' that you got some killers? You don't feed 'em
Booka steady trippin' when I say I don't believe in Jesus
Don't ever put your all into a bitch 'cause she gon’ leave
And I know a couple Atlanta hoes that wear her lashes
In the trap, I fucked the baddest bitches on the mattress
Givin’ to the trenches, took advantage of my kindness
I done gave a nigga a lot of pounds without askin'
Government, did they shut down? He got his time in
Damn well, he ain’t 'posed to be on home confinement
Killers right on standby off my word just like Simon
I can judge a nigga by his character off his diamonds
I know a nigga, he shootin' dice with the Ts
But how you say that when I give him all he needs?
And even though he ain't show no love, I tried to reach
In Commonwealth, he took a dub, nigga, please
Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon’ hate on you?
For that check, how your day ones gon' lay on you
Is they keepin' it 1000 like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannys
Told you I ain't friendly, it's Only The Family
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Out on 1300, so don't act like you can't find us
Tim-Tim lost his life, I bang the same block he died for
September 18th, ain't that the same shit we cry for?
Mall of niggas got to slidin' when them tears dried up
Made it out them trenches, we young vets and survivors
Learned so much from that corner, bumped my head, but now I'm wiser
Chasin' after trends, I risked my freedom for designer
Almost lost my life, got out and I was on that timer
Now I hit up treasures with a hundred thousand on me
I don't fuck with niggas, I'm with  or by my lonely
Loyalty not slow, you gotta watch out for your homies
If any nigga play, a deadman is what he gon' be
Is it possible they love you like they say they do?
Is it possible, your homies, they gon' hate on you?
For that check, how your day ones gon' lay on you
Is they keepin' it 1000 like they say they do?
They don't understand me, addicted to them Xannys
Told you I ain't friendly, it's Only The Family
Is it possible you gon' ride?
Is it possible you gon' ride?

Twenty one years in the streets with my niggas
And that's to my momma, she know about my brother
She know she playin' for keeps, nigga

My first-week sales, I had like sixty-some thousand, but they don't count J-Pay
How the fuck you don't count the realest niggas, you know what I'm saying?
That's that label shit, fuck that shit 
Got kicked out the crib, put a latch on it
It feel good to sleep all in the trap, don't it?
I be hanging 'round killers with racks on me
I done made me some plays and put tax on it
It feel good to come all the way back from it
When you up, they gon' say that you act funny
You feel cocky, you actually got money
Felt neglected when Chino got snatched from me
If you love the streets more than you love your family, you crazy
They love you more, they adore you more 'cause you made it
They turned they back on me, I forgave 'em, I'm crazy
Them niggas gon' go, them niggas gon' roll whenever I say it
Them niggas some hoes, them niggas some hoes, they don't get attention
You would try to ignore when I'm at my lowest, I don't forgive you
I was at my lowest, I couldn't afford it, I was so miserable
I was ditchin' school, mixing lean and juice, I was off chemicals
I ain't got a choice, I got a voice, this shit difficult
Waking up to three million dollars cash, that shit a miracle
Can't let a bitch put me on blast, I'm too spiritual
They say I gotta let go of the past, I ain't hearing you"I feel good but I really came from nothing I came from the struggle I came from the gutter, you know what I'm sayin'? I came from a house of four, plus my momma and my grandmomma, no daddy you know what I'm sayin' daddy been gone so I ain't really have no choice but to be the man. I've been running the streets since I was 12, 13 years old. You know what I'm sayin' sellin' drugs, you know what I'm sayin' shootouts. I'm thinkin' it's like a good thing, but I'm stressing my momma, my grandmomma out so I ain't really have no choice but to move my family up out the hood, I ain't have no choice to leave Chicago and move to the A and get my own crib. 6, 7 bedrooms, you know what I'm sayin' mini mansion like it feel good to even start like that man. I ain't have no choic, went to jail 3, 4 times and had major setbacks. Get out of jail, it's a whole new wave. Every time, get out second time, it's a whole new wave so I ain't really have a chance but to really like catch up, you know what I'm sayin'? Give y'all this story, you know what I'm sayin' and I feel like by the end of the day, I gotta come out on top, you know what I'm sayin' 'cause all odds is against me, you know what I'm sayin'? Shit, I ain't really have no choice but to feed the streets."

Steady going to funerals, steady going to interviews
Not going too far, so I stick to the wall
 I grew up in the ghetto
Where niggas don't make it out like that
 I grew up in the ghetto
Where my niggas don't make it out like that
I grew up with fam, I grew up with niggas that call me fam

I grew up with niggas doing life in the can
War time, fighting for land
But I grew up in the ghetto
Times I ain't eat nun, go to school just to eat lunch
No kid watching re-runs, wake up doing re-runs
My momma, my opponent 
These millions I'm on it
And I gotta eat nigga
On the corners everyday with the lights out
Walk in broad day with the pipes out
Waking up middle night with the lights out
So why these niggas faking?
I pray to God that I make it
I told my momma I can't take it 
Nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go
People to meet, I'm from these streets
Steady going to funerals, steady going to interviews
Not going too far, so I stick to the wall
 I grew up in the ghetto
Where niggas don't make it out like that
 I grew up in the ghetto
Where my niggas don't make it out like that
C-C-Came up in the ghetto
People tell me keep my head up my whole life
If I didn't have nothing, I'm fed up
B-B-Bitches out here, just shut up
Rest in peace my lil shawty
I promise I wish I could write you a letter
And I miss you momma
I cherish this life, because no one is promised tomorrow
Pray to my father
Lord forgive me for sins I committed
But this is the way that we living
Why can't no one see my vision?
Remember the basement
Remember my aunty would beat me because of the dishes
Couldn't wait to get grown

Even though a nigga tryna make it out I still got love for the 
I can't change, I was raised in the 
Made me who I am and I love the 
Nothing to eat, nowhere to sleep, nowhere to go

When I leave I don't know if I'ma make it back
You don't need nothing to relate to that
The thought of my kids suffering, I hate the fact
Say goodbye to your mom, before you every think of doing me  bodily harm
Even though the war is on, you've got to be calm
It's a time to keep quiet, a time to respond
Nah, you'll never be fly as the Don
I shoot you man in his head, let him die in your arms
It's written inside of the Quran

A story when I was a shorty 
I went to school on the daily 
And I was toting my .40 
My homie got pounds on pounds 
I grow a bitch quick like a forest 
Ask can you put me on now? 
Like why you ignorin' me? 
I tell 'em, "Go pull up a Taurus" 
At the top, shootin' the Taurus 
I mix up a eight then I pour it
I left my feelings in storage 
Remember I jump off the porches 
You ain't no killer, ain't torch shit 
Don't get caught in the mornin’
We catch you, then we scorin’
Wash that blow with chlorine
Say I'm a ho, you don’t know me 
How could you touch with no cheese?
Gotta watch out 'cause I'm lowkey
Niggas be cool with the police
I made a dub off 4 P's
I’m in a tribe with 4 piece

I done showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end 
Forgive me again 
Just give me your hand

Give me one more chance, give me one more chance
Give me one more chance, give me one more chance
Man, I thought you were my dog but you tricked me
You tryna play me close but niggas know you out to get me 
Shoulda known when I said, "Nah," you cut me off, that shit was fishy
I trust you with my secrets but you went and told my business 
Wanted to be on the Forbes with you 
I done slept on floors with you 
I done went through war with you 
And we had no pistols 
I told you stories when we both were dirty
When I was broke, I was splitting the Percs 
When I went broke, I sold my 30 
Could've gone bad, and that shit hurt me 
Caught with a gun, that shit was jerkin' 
Caught for murder, they ain't showin' no mercy
Snake yo blood, that shit ain't worth it
At the same time, ain't no one perfect
Went on to hit, that nigga was nervous
But I was blind 'cause nigga too thirsty 
Caught me a body, I built my courage 
Gotta watch out 'cause my dog was informant
I done showed love to these niggas
But I mistreated niggas who gon' rock with me to the end 
Forgive me again 
Just give me your hand 
Them ain't my friends 
Y'all my friends

Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most 
Hundred thou' I spent it on the  
I copped the Rollie and put down the Mueller
Your bitch like me, she say you a goof 
I finessed the city playin' that old school 
Why they playin' with Durk and he a whole shooter? 
I just fucked your mama, she a whole cougar 
Hot boy, I be turned up off that old Juvie
Trap house, remember days eatin' cold noodles
Calvin Klein, I hold that forty up 
To his stomach, give him a tummy tuck 
I'll rob his ass and don't get nothin' up 
If you don't, he gon' fuck 'round, be in a truck or somethin' 
Bitches want the fashion, she lookin' 'round like where it's at? 
Don't touch me at the door, security know I got the strap 
Three hundred killers with me, tell 'em open up the back 
Got a room in the telly but I'd rather be in the trap 
Shit, took a mic and told 'em I'm a rapper 
Shit, I took my re-up and I bought designer 
Shit, off a perky, I done went to NASA 
Told her wanna suck me through my boxers, I ain't got no manners 
Shit, I took my Ruger, traded it for a coat 
Shit, two of my plugs for a brick of dope 
Shit, I'm hearin' voices so I grab the Ghost 
Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most 
I damn near need a cough drop when I'm off the OG
Twenty-six inch Forgiatos, I done caught it slowly 
Only made eight thousand, I guess it's a slow week 
I just popped two xans, they call that a slow geek 
Upgraded my motor 'case I see the police 
I been up two days, I'm off lean and coffee 
I spent fourteen hundred dollars on a Yorkie doggy 
I had Gigi in that coupe without a car seat 
Two racks on Balmain, they came with rips on 'em 
Me and my bitch feet both got Gucci flips on 'em 
I got that small nine, it's one more clip on 'em 
He got clean codeine, he got that sip on 'em 
Shit, took a mic and told 'em I'm a rapper 
Shit, I took my re-up and I bought designer 
Shit, off a perky, I done went to NASA 
Told her wanna suck me through my boxers, I ain't got no manners 
Shit, I took my Ruger, traded it for a coat 
Shit, two of my plugs for a brick of dope 
Shit, I'm hearin' voices so I grab the Ghost 
Aye, my name Durk so I'ma do the most Thotties, Posse!

Bricks in the fender, bags in the trunk of the Honda
That bitch ain't goin' chasing that money
No I'm not new to this money
I'm so consistent with thumbing
Trap that bitch spot before she get a single buck
That O.J. Mayo like I play for the Bucks
Slam dunking from the A to the Gump
Good clean came in, went and criss crossed them
Hit with the beater watch it come back
You ain't seen a nigga face in the trap in a while
Must've thought I fucked up ain't coming back
I send my shooters come in back-to-back
That's just because of my social status
Bitch mad that a nigga hit the trap all night
Ain't got the time to get the groceries baby
They pull up to the trap like vultures
Longway consistent in motion
Watching the pack just scatter like roaches
The spot on Beta XXX, beat it down, got ghost

And you gotta ride with your gun at time, you outside in the chi
You ain't never had that feelin' in your stomach you gon' die
Don't too many niggas send money to the jail so I try
I know a nigga died with a name, couple of his niggas ain't slide
All these niggas sayin' they gang, they ain't even did shit for the guys
Same way that Pluto died, we gon' do the same shit to the Y
Gotta eat bitch, I trust one of my pants took some cash
How you know a nigga from your hood told you ain’t try to put him on blast
Man, Terry died in his sleep off fake Percs, I know mans
They come around 'bout bodies, gotta go blame niggas who dead 
That same day my cousin died, I couldn't take no more meds
They asked me where I'ma be in ten years, shit, I said, "The feds"
They asked me what I'ma do 'bout Krump , shit, he dead
I went to the emergency room and I seen Pluto on that bed
And they ain't gon' repeat that shit, I said, "In my head"

Every day I'm buying clothes just for a fashion statement
See the nigga you fuck with rap, but me, I actually made it
He shot the club up 2010, he still incarcerated
Plus he corroborated
And you better get away from all them dog hoes
I be in the crib smokin' exotic watchin' Narcos
Had to send a real connect, your connect is really 
Get head in that Benz truck, pull up, it's like a car show
And when you buying a lot of purses watch them bark hoes
I seen a nigga pull a hunnid cash from Wells Fargo
It was crushed pills in my water, gotta drink the particles
When I'm definitely off them drugs I be antisocial too
Ask my brother how the  he had to coast me through
I know too many niggas play with  make local news
Play with us, I'ma put some open wounds on top of open wounds
I was washing gunpowder off from a local pool
Pumping gas for pocket change just to keep a bitch
My side hustle from my job I was fighting 
Fresh in my arm keep my AP on to ice my wrist
You say you love me but press charges, that's a dirty bitch
I broke her spine off that moon, she said that's perky dick
You turn your head, your homie get you, that's how that money get
You ever had that feelin' that you might OD off Percocets
I used to window shop DT now I can purchase shit
I can't make no niggas love me if they in disbelief
You be so quick to jump at me but scared of the enemy
If you gon' rap, just make that money, don't try to be in the streets
Gotta order Uber Eats, we can't go out to eat
You had that feelin' in your stomach you couldn't go home to eat
You putting that cover over the heater 'cause it's too cold to sleep
When you can't run you gotta throw the bundle
I had the whole hood geeked, I walk out 
The whole hood'll turn on you quick if you just break a promise
Yo' ass a goofy you a lame you green like iguanas
My chopper dance for real for real like NLE Choppa
You gotta watch out for them hoes tryna pick your pockets
This weed shit got recommended
A hunnid K layin' around, I had to invest in it
They made weed legal in Illinois, you need a car to get it
So many grams inside a blunt, them niggas made it hard to hit it
Got my bitch so bougie, after me it's gon' be hard to hit it
Them lil' boys can put in work for all I care, we got the city
And we do though
My confession I got some head outside the Louis store
And I pour a four, whoa
This money got me sayin' "ooh ooh ooh"
I'm so elite, I'm like "ooh ooh ooh"
My heart cold, it's like "ooh ooh ooh"
This money got me sayin' ooh ooh ooh"
I'm so elite, I'm like "ooh ooh ooh"
My heart cold, it's like "ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh ooh"Pay attention man

I'm in the studio with killers smoking Cookies
And when I'm deep inside that pussy it get mushy
And she got caught with the swipes I had some rookie
Label me a kingpin, feds tryna book me
And I need 30 for a show, you try to book me
And I be watching for the hoes say they love me
And I be watching for the niggas say they love me
Say they love me
Grew up in the trenches with no leader
Balenciagas, not no Reebok
She said she want her tummy tucked, I told her detox
Walked inside Gucci, spent 200 for these socks
They'll stab you in your back, that's a backstab
Judge give you twenty years off your background
And you can't pay your lawyers 'cause your guys clowns
When a nigga play with my gang, that shit man down
When your homie on that stand, put your head down
You be saying in your head, "Put your hand down"
See, the opps be on my dick, I turned them fans now
Get the whole hood rich, that's the plan now
On a whole lotta gang shit, yeah
And a nigga can't change shit, yeah
And I ride for who I came with, yeah
And I'm dying for who I came with, yeah
Whole lotta money, money, money, money, money
Whole lotta killers, killers, killers, killers, killers
Whole lotta shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters
Whole lotta bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches
You ever got snaked by your day one?
I heard them killers on my ass, he ain't say nothing
And I was chewing on them Perkys 'til my pain gone
And that day that boy got shot, I wish he stayed home
This rap shit who'd have thought I'd get paid off it?
I remember OG going to the head office
And we'd sell our food stamps and get paid off it
He tried that dope and then he turned into a J off it
Niggas say they talk behind my back, I say they stay talking
Police want me down bad, tried to charge for jaywalking
My little homie went outside, let them niggas take from him
'Fore the niggas go outside I can't put my face on it
On a whole lotta gang shit, yeah
And a nigga can't change shit, yeah
And I ride for who I came with, yeah
And I'm dying for who I came with, yeah
Whole lotta money, money, money, money, money
Whole lotta killers, killers, killers, killers, killers
Whole lotta shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters, shooters
Whole lotta bitches, bitches, bitches, bitches, bitchesTouchOfTrent be Wylin wit it
Don't ask why I take these drugs to fight these demons
And I was tired of fightin' over custody agreements
They treat me like an outsider, you should've seen it
And you ain't load the fridge, you'd rather load a steamer
Why the fuck you lie at my face, like you ain't my mud brother
And that bitch gon' tell me whatever whenever a thug touch her
And I ride for the street niggas before my blood cousin
And he was a opp, but he was a muhfucker
Got birthеd together, we was goin' to doctors
Brokе in cribs together, we was stealin' copper
I should've known you was a cop when we was playin' cops and robbers
For example, you told my mama that I robbed the barber
Had him red-handed, but I hope they drop the charges
I'm goin' big, Nikki Parker
I ain't feel my face when I pop Oxycontin
Miss 2012, when they was actually boxin'
It's 2020 when they are actually poppin'
Been in the streets so long, I can see through that animosity
But I'm still hood
Nigga went to jail, he richer than me, I ask, is he still good?
Take away my pain 
Take it when I'm angry 
When I feel betrayed-y 
When I feel no love 
I'ma say it one time, rest in peace Chinx Drugz
Thought about you dyin', I throw my drink up
Thinkin' 'bout who did it, I just think blood
I think about who OD get that drink up
Did three months in the county jail, my niggas ain't pick up
Federal bond different from a state bond, give a crib up
Rumors hurt you 'bout yo' bitch, but you ain't feel nothin'
Then you'd try to kill yourself, you actually still fuckin
When I fell out with French Montana, that shit did me damage
I learned the rules of a contract, but I was plannin' on signin'
He picked me up when Def Jam didn't, he turned me diamond
Now I'm the voice of the streets, perfect timin'
Take away my pain 
Take it when I'm angry 
When I feel betrayed-y 
When I feel no love 
Take drugs
Take drugs
Take drugs
Take drugsAye TM
All the dawgs that watch over you what you gotta play 'em close
All them drugs stacked in one crib, that's what get raided most
I know one nigga who love to kill but he get faded first
You say Nuski name in vain, that's who gon' get it worst
Chasing who? Not chasing hoes, we chase the millions first
I had the hoes in my DMs when I had a Nicki verse
I'll cash you out for a whole thirty, you gotta get 'em first
You mix the ecstasy and Percocets, you itch the worst
Some of my homies played back then and now they still 
Quiet as kept, that door still open
And my nigga on whatеver I'm on and I don't feel 
My mind eighty percеnt in the streets and I'm still focused
Who gave me hope when I need it?
'Nine and 22, gave the streets what they want, got 'em thinking that they beefing
Know what oppositions say, he quick, they think he Jesus
Told him he the only one get a pass, that nigga believed us
How you think you still real? You tricked up on your guys and shit
How you think you still 300, you switched up on your guys and shit
Letter to the opps, y'all niggas tricking on y'all lands and shit
Big teeth and end up in the casket, make 'em slide again
Went in for another bond but he got denied again
Cory Brooks told me slow down, but it's my pride again
Every time a nigga died, they'll blame my side again
And every bitch I fuck, I tell her bring her side a friend
Love me or hate me, bitches say I'm crazy, they don't wanna date me, oh
Love me or hate me, ain't grew up rich, so the trenches, they raised me, oh
I was finger fucking pistols 'fore I ever got a chance to go and finger fuck these bitches, oh
I'm regretting how I was raised, all my niggas went to jail, I had to fuck with different niggas, woah
Fucking fancy bitches, got her dancing with the stars, got it feeling like a groupie home
When I pull up in the trenches, they surround me by some killers, but I know that's how they do me
When I be saying I'm the voice, I don't be tryna like
Tryna run niggas or tell 'em what to do or nothing like that
I just feel that the streets'll listen to me

Til law came and got me
Can't play with them, fuck around I shot you
Came out the hell hole, it's a robbery
War way OTF
? I walked there
? trappin' at 12
Wherever I'm at turn into the trapper
Wherever I'm at they die there
12 years old ? arrest
Wanted me to buy weed ?
Lil ? have me slammin' my momma boyfriend door
Swear anywhere you go I go
Swear everywhere I go you go
And I brought you bro
Where you roll, I roll
We ain't breakin' no codes, penitentiary row god damn
I don't know when they gon' get it, I told em we on
I'm hoping he still in the pen, he ain't came home yet
? keep droppin' these bombs, they makin' bomb threats
Who run the trap, Wallway Pack
They know we happy here
Shootout while the police outside
Yeah we Iraq in here
War, we OTF
Bitch we the mob, we from the bottom here
That hell hole, I swerve round here
Get high in the stu' with my jeans on
Nigga fiend houses, they might go in my pockets
I used to trick all the fiend
I didn't believe anything
Stake ? the bean
It felt like I sleep with the demons
Hell hole, hell hole
Hell hole, hell holeLil Durk - Loyalty Over Royalty
:
Loyalty over royalty real street nigga
Yeah the street love me but the street don't show no love
When it's war in my city we shed blood
All I know is blood, blood, blood
All I know is blood, blood, blood 
I got a feeling a lot of these niggas
Really admire a nigga
I just do me I don't try to be niggas
Niggas be trying too hard
You say you a killer, quit lying lil nigga
Shots get to flying that's when niggas get dropped
Now you looking for God lil nigga
Don't even start lil nigga
I'm about loyalty, I'm not no wannabe
I'm just what you wanna be now you gonna know it's me
Bitch get a load of me ain't no controlling me
I got that bandanna on like I'm Makaveli
Mixed with Hispanic my daddy heavy
Making shit work cause I love my daughter
I don't want her to say daddy left me
Y'all talk about a body count
See your body is a body found
Can't nobody calm me down
My city lost right now
You get knocked off right now
If you wanna live long
Please don't get involved right now
Certified street nigga, but I ain't trying to preach nigga
To any nigga, rich nigga
Mack on repeat, I stay to snaking these niggas
They aim and they plot
I can't relate, these niggas bitches they fake
No love do a drill, east side when we drill
Your niggas ain't real
Pressure I apply, might dress in disguise
We kill when we wild, bruh niggas divide
We never get tired, we always outside
Get caught on my side, like chicken you fried 
Loyalty over royalty
Family over friends
OTF over everything
Lord forgive me for my sinsThey be tryna judge me
I thought that they loved me
But they don't really know me
Please don't judge me 
Don't judge me 
They be tryna judge me
They don't know my story
They be wanting to hate me
Don't judge me 
Don't judge me 
Loyalty was the key to these street niggas 
Chains, cars, cribs, since a kid I used to think I was Meech nigga
Starving, crib full of family I can't sleep without balling
So I watch D Rose play 
Aunty died from cancer so I rap to keep the laugh
I'd rather pray when I'm alone instead of giving shit to pastors
Daddy gone since I was a in pampers
He get out when I'm in pampers
Old and a dead man, hand still on the hammer
Niggas talking 'bout they my mans and we friends
Where you was you at when that man with that lanz offered me ten?
Shackled up, with the niggas that we hit with the fan
Eating shit that we gathered in blan
President still black, I hope he change shit
Niggas out here fifty, doing the same shit
When he say he got my back he ran quick
Don't judge me
I know the streets love me
Dope dealers, cold killers, day 1 niggas told nigga
Half them killers told on em
Had my chopper and road with em
My mouth close though
I can't snitch on a nigga pillow talking to ops and hoes bitch of a nigga
Summer nights, all them drugs made me kill shit
I lost so many niggas if they die I don't feel shit
Been on IG with me man, just to feel rich
Them niggas who snaked, I kept it real with it
And they ain't loyal though
Mind of a psycho twelve posted on light poles
Soul cracked to the light though
Going crazy I might though
RIP who I cry to
Hold my head on cause I got to
Yeah, I'm loyal niggaNBADamn to this day nigga still pray on my down fall
You can't deny good music or a real nigga
For real for real
I used to break in the crib now I got a safe in the crib

I gotta ride around with my heater
Police killing my people
Overseas cause I'm legal
I ain't taking no chances
Masks on for them cameras
On my own no advances
Broken homes for advances
As a kid growing up
I used to be poured up
I ain't never froze up
All I know is drill drill
Put him on a poster
Reward money for the killer
They ain't never found the killer
Don't nobody know nothing
I rob niggas for they tool
Brought guns up in school
Started a war got to move
Free nine boy let em loose 
I used to break in the crib now I got a safe in the crib
Chiraq crime rate build so it ain't safe at the crib

Shooters took him on a cruise
Streets see how I roll
Still trying to get Zoo
Still chasing them millions
Daddy gave me the wisdom
Twenty-three years up in prison
I swear I seen his vision
Seen my son I start tearin'
I took the game it wasn't given
Ditched school hit the hood
Streets love me I'm good
Shed tears if I could
Shed blood if I could
Shared money if I could
Shared guns if I could
Sell coke if I could
Sell dope if I could
I'd rob if I could
I'm getting money cause I could

All fucked up, as a youngin', I had to figure it out
I fuck it up at them stores, I use a 
When I taste them drugs, that shit numb my tongue
I just pulled up, , one on one
Nigga, ain't no rules to fighting, in a one on one
Smokin' out the pound, I just fill my lungs
My kids couldn't come around me, my house full of guns
My kids don't ask for no money, I send it every month
Three, four, five, select these hoes, I don't know which one
Three, four, five, select the fools, they be eatin' me up
I done blew a bag, all one hunnid g's
25 bands on my 300 ring
And I used to fuck with them niggas but they don't fuck with me
Do I like being around that money? Yes in-fucking-deed
If a bitch ask for my bag, get on your fuckin' knees
I could 
You in my hood, you knew you was out here,  fees
Catch a body 
Three, four, five bodies, now my shooter on the run
Million dollar bail, a lil nigga, now I know he stressed
First day home from jail, I'ma rob the coke connect 
I risk my life for my partner, my partner
Turnin' up with my partner, my partner
I can't trade on my partner, my partner
Drop a bag with my partner, my partner
 nigga I'ma fuck it up
Pull up on the opps, I'ma hit 'em with the double drum
Watch them niggas huddle up, scary with the bubble guts
Got my block, poppin' shit, jumpin' like it's Double Dutch
Put my hood up on my back, got my hood up and my strap
What you pussies lookin' at? 
Three, four, five bodies, now my shooter on the run
Million dollar bail, a lil nigga, now I know he stressed
First day home from jail, I'ma rob the coke connect 
Fuckin' hoes with my partner, my partner
And we really havin' lotta, a lotta
Been my brother since a toddler, a toddler

I'm in love, I'm in love, I'm in love with you
You did me dirty

Spend a lot of time on the road, I know you alone, you wish I was home
Been times I ain't pick up the phone, smoke one to the dome, what know what you on

You saw them bitches always ask me and I say don't worry

        Niggas die for attention, I know a nigga caught a body missing Christmas
His momma said them ain’t his friends, he wish he listened
And I gotta open my eyes, they act suspicious
I’ma tryin’ to get this money it not easy
I’m out here 24/7 bust my ass just believe me
I said that time I like hustler music, go listen to Wheezy
And I be off them perky dirties calling cash me a Fiji 
Zay that’s my brotha, Mario and Luigi
Say she don’t call anymore, I broke my relations
And I’m a boss I’ma stand on that
I broke my heart as pieces
And I’ma do what I gotta do make sure my momma decent
Steady, already in the NDS she told me come home
I’m in the trenches with my vultures making love song
I had blood in my eyes ask me what’s wrong
I rolled a blunt filled with biscotti, fuck who die young 
Who am I, who am I, who am I, who am I
I- I don’t know, uh hu-oh, you can’t walk in my shoes it would hurt too much
I got too many damn, friends this shit hurt too much
I lost some of my family, they my closest that shit hurt too much
When I made some real boys then I worked too much
Who would I be till my friends, finally got a hit single
Who would I be to these bitches, if I werent who I am
I’m thinking who I am to have everybody that shit around me listening thinking
Say its time put me on i’ma rapper or a singer
Free my brother’s, say they love me I’ma fuck wit you hard
And I’m walking round and they tell me to move so I can put a lil smile to my momma
My momma still stay in the hood I’m trying to move out the hood as possible
My dad he just got in my life at least I don’t gotta bother him
Niggas put it on the guys over the kids that’s the problem
See my dad back in my life I’ma show love to Obama
See that cancer ate my aunties kidneys, turned me to a monster
I know a nigga coulda made it to the league he beat the bucketSo I move to the neck, to the necklace nigga
Why is you stressin' lil baby? I told you I got you forever
Damn I miss my lil nigga
Damn I miss my lil nigga
Too much pain to deal wit it, gotta pop a seal to deal wit it
Nigga gotta pop the pill to feel different
But it's like the shit just still hit me
Went on skits for him, they got hit for him
Swear to god I still miss him
In the first half we drop 50, dove back on they ass and drop 50
Dope boy slide through in and drop 50
Dope boy slide through and he cop 50
I remember you wasn't on the block with me
I remember you ain't let off shots with me
You wasn't on the block with me
I remember you ain't let off shots with me, so I moved to the neck
Even though shooters on deck, I'm a real shooter in the flesh
Niggas get stretched, we do not put on no vest
God is my only protection
I made it up out, made it up outta them trenches
Just to be here is a blessin', why is you stressin'?
Why is you stressin' lil baby? I told you I got you forever
I was locked up, you wasn't wit me, not no calls, not one visit
No receipts, not no pictures, I couldn't eat, I wanted friendly's
Rest in peace to my niggas, I'll bleed for my niggas
Anything for my niggas 9 P, they fuck with me
I'm with my brothers for lifetime, free my brothers for the right mind
And your brothers ain't like mine, argue don't shoot, won't fight mine
Made out we ain't got no worries, in the jam don't switch your story
While some ain't there not for me
My brothers right here they love me
When he slide for you, gotta get him a lawyer
Real homicide nigga play with my daughter
You was caught in the jam you ain't change the story
Niggas got mad when I went and signed Tory
Different baby mommas gotta take em' to 
Booka tell me every time, niggas ain't for me
Ride around with my gun cause they niggas be on me
Ride with the vultures we ain't gotta be 4 deep
Fuck them other niggas want the main factor
It was crazy when I seen his brain splatter
He was talkin' he ain't make it no better
Vlone like em' mixed with margiela's
He had to move around cause I know he was jealous
Got all them guns like that nigga really actin'
Why you front your move? Choppa make you move backwards
And you showed the streets your word don't matter, yeah yeah
Back of the berry, sweeter the juice, 3500 the bigger the booth
No Iphone addicted to boost
And I drink me a cup addicted to juice, lean
And I'm still the same nigga by any means
You put cap in your rap nigga literally
Nowadays you can't tell a nigga anything
Them niggas gonna try to remember me
 x2
I was locked up, you wasn't wit me, not no calls, not one visit

Fuck the goofysI gotta stop the 'Gram when the opposition DM'ing me threats 
When bro'nem died, he got an opp touch, they said he full of that X
I'm a young nigga who gettin' that check and I don't have problem with sex
I'm a young nigga who pop my shit, they say I'm cocky, aggressive
I get that vibe you turned to snake, I swear I'ma turn to Mely 
Locked up with the nigga who told on his mans, that shit Tom and Jerry
Cartier skeletons on my arm, got my arm skelly
Plus two bracelets say the voice, he got my arm buried
I look out, don't know who trust, I say it's all scary
I'm checkin' up on one of my dawg, he ain't respond lately
I took a bag full of stacks to a bond lady
I gave you drugs, you ain't bring the profits and you say I'm crazy
I don't know
I don't know  
I don't know
I don't know
Is you niggas really with me? I don't know
Do you think these niggas out to get me? I don't know
Man you think you made it out the city? I don't know
Do you bleed a rumor, see who snitchin'? I don't know
And I don't know too many
I heard them rumors that you was tellin'
But I know you didn't
One nigga say he didn't but I know he did
And I know he's shitty
You gon' get snaked tryna hang with different blocks, I know my city
They my brother hopped out the streets, I'm like, "No he didn't"
Headshot, fucked up memory
Perky pill, fucked up kidney

Man you think you made it out the city? I don't know
Do you bleed a rumor, see who snitchin'? I don't knowAyeTM
Wakin' up to gunshots, tonight, I wasn't scared
Cruisin' 'round the trenches, ain't no trappin' if you scared
They gotta see you killin', it won't matter if you see it
It doesn't make a difference if you alive or you dead
If they catch you, eyes on you, it don't matter if you cared
A couple killers in retirement, they gon' do it if I see it
Won't ask them niggas for no money 'cause I'ma do it when I land
I was scared to show my past, I ain't wanna lose a fan
I was stunnin' on my block 'cause I ain't wanna miss the chance
To catch the next nigga, tryna slide then dead
Money on the sеt and I missed this last chance
When I call, you bеtter come, you better slide with the bread
Shootout with a nigga, blick him, take a bleed shower
Ain't no phones when we slide, police tryna ping towers
Can you tell? Fuck y'all bitches, I want my lawyer
'Cause y'all got what y'all got and it's gonna take hours
I don't know shit, I ain't a coward
Juvenile all by myself, I want my allowance
I pleaded insanity to the court, I need cancelin'
I'm the voice of the streets and they vouchin' 
Don't believe no rumor, ain't around them, just stories
I call your phone a million times, I'm just worried
My brother told me a million times that ain't for me
Don't call my phone 'bout no money, I'm recordin'
They talkin' down on my name, they don't know me
You know the world change,  and Kobe
A lotta niggas left my side when I was hungry
They probably love me but they wanna see me moanin'
You know the real change 'cause real niggas sayin' I'm actin' phony
I'm the same nigga you tried to take somethin', I act a donkey
And you actin' real, I told your ass you actin' only
You the type to carry a hundred cash and still go ask for money
You the type of nigga, ain't no rumors, you gon' make one
You the type of nigga to drop a name, make a case come
You the type of nigga to spend your last on a lace front
You the type of nigga to say you slidin', no, you ain't huntin', yeahScribing
Me, I been ceilin' them Hunchos straight to the counter  gun flow
I done been stuck in the trenches, I dance with the devil and I sell drugs to my uncle
And I gave the niggas the lean, the weed, the drugs, I did this shit off the 
All of these niggas be havin', them niggas be claimin' they lovin', I did it with nothin'
You in the streets for nothin', I'm doin' all I can, they ain't need for nothin'
Remember when them people comin', why you gon' 
I'm tryna do lit, I hop in the jeep for weeks, I couldn't sleep for nothin'
I like to preach and I am signed to the streets, like I gotta kill somethin'
I take drugs when I feel lonely
Ride with my gun when I feel lonely
I sleep around killers when I feel lonely
I smoke all my bitches when I feel lonely
Told my brother we fuckin' with no condoms but we havin' babies
I used to be around niggas I love for real but they have the hate on their shoulder
I was in the kitchen, niggas water-whippin' and I feel like they was hittin'
And it was boolin'  hittin' the coke
From the K to the crib, told him to get no room 'cause niggas can't sleep on the sofa
I was taking percocets, he was off the water, that nigga was deep in the ocean
I gotta get it in motion, I study, look up over my shoulders
I'm beatin' my kids with emotion, pass me the Tesla, I'm rollin', rollin', rollin'
Wake me up 'cause them percs callin', Mikey-ikey, yeah, thats my doggy
He know I'm straight that whenever he call me, keep it strict, what you mean he saw me?
I fell asleep with the , these whole  aquafina on 'em

I take drugs when I feel lonely
Ride with my gun when I feel lonely
I sleep around killers when I feel lonely
I smoke all my bitches when I feel lonelyYou turn me on when you be shavin' off your pussy
Makin' that macaroni sound with the gushy
She gon' give me the sloppiest head with her good teeth
And she love when I be off the Percocets when I'm munchin'
Snatch the condom off, goin' raw sex with it 'cause it feel better
Put my finger in her, when I take it out, we just gon' lick it together
Audacity to ask you when I'm done with bitches, like when we gon' get it together?
Why don't these niggas bе lovin' these bitches? Mе and Runny hit 'em together
I'ma go buy the lil' bitches Celine bags, shit, same cash
When we sat down, she told me that it's more cash than it's more ass
She told me her ex-nigga ain't had no cash, she worked DoorDash
He ain't even cash out on her birthday, he gave her store credit
Every day, you know I think about you
Can somebody tell that girl I love her? 
I'ma tell 'em I can't be without you
Can somebody tell that girl I love her? 
I'm just comin' clean, I was bein' mean, I ain't 'posed to be mean
I'm just comin' clean, I was bein' seen, I ain't 'posed to be seen
I'm just comin' clean, I know you ain't cheat, I was just bein' mean
I'm just bein' clean, I had another phone, I was just bein' clean
Drug, sex
I ain't even had water, I ain't pop it yet
Drug, sex
She callin' daddy, I ain't her father yet
Drug, sex
Rich sex, puttin' diamonds on her new Patek
Cross check
Goin' in the stores, I ain't know the stat
Oogy, took down my number, you ain't even call me yet
Durkio, I ain't even gon' cap, my real hoes call me that
Sad bitches, I ain't even gon' cap, I buy 'em all new baguettes
Them , I ain't even gon' cap, I ain't hit the Tooka yet
Every day, you know I think about you
Can somebody tell that girl I love her? 
I'ma tell 'em I can't be without you
Can somebody tell that girl I love her? She's only 17, her whole life's ahead of her
She hates school because the people there discredit her
Her boyfriend tries to show her that's not how it seems
But everyday she just gets lowered with her self-esteem
He let's her know that every night will have a brighter day
She even tried to overdose and take her life away
She's feeling hopeless there just sitting down beside her bed
Then he takes his hand and places it beside her head
He tries to hold her but with every touch she still resists
And then he sees the scars that bury deep within her wrists
She's feeling numb, he tries to beg and plead and ask her, "Why?"
She says this way she has control of the pain she feels inside
He's asking her, "How long it's going since you've felt this?
Way because you got me here, just feeling so damn helpless."
She says, "It's been a while. I guess I needed better luck."
And then he screams at her and tells her, "Baby, never cut!"
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen, pretty lady, you don't have to be alone
So, baby, don't cut
Baby, don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
The next day at school she's feeling better than the day before
Even cracked a couple smiles as she walked the corridor
But all that seemed to end: she dropped her books when she walked into class
And every student in the room just seemed to point and laugh
She couldn't take it anymore, she sent her boy a text
She said, "I love you with my body, heart and soul to death."
He thought nothing, typed "I love you", then he sent it
By "death" he didn't know that she had literally just meant it
She ducked the next class, ran home into the bathroom
Thought to herself she wouldn't break her promise that soon
One cut... two cuts... three cuts... four
The blood just started dripping from the tub to the floor
Her boyfriend had a feeling in his stomach that he hated
He followed it right down to her house he never waited
The front door was open, he heard the water running
He stormed into the bathroom and his heart just started gunning
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen pretty lady you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut
Baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
He puts her arm around his shoulder, he's just tryna lean her back up
Yelling out her name as he lays her beside the bathtub
Feels his whole world just took a hit from a big avalanche
Screaming out so heavily, "Somebody call an ambulance!"
Feeling mad angry like somebody's led her onto this
Her eyeballs are rolling, drifting out of consciousness
Thinking to himself why the hell did she just stop at will
The tears just keep on rolling as they head to the hospital
Paramedics rush her in, the doctor calls emergency
She's lost a lot of blood the place looks like a murder scene
An hour later, the doc walks over with a sour face
And says, "Excuse me for the words that I'm about to say
I'm sorry for your loss, " the boy just starts collapsing
His own world, his own girl just took a crashing
Saying to himself that it's his fault and that he let it up
"Baby, I thought you made a promise you would never cut."
Nobody seems to get you, you feel you're on your own
But listen pretty lady you don't have to be alone
So baby don't cut
Baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut
I know your heart is hurting, you think the road has end
You may just feel that blade you're holding is your only friend
But baby don't cut
, baby don't cut
You can do anything, just promise baby you won't cut

I like Audemars and the Pateks
You can't play with him...No snake can snake me
Man I feel like I lived this life before
Like I seen this shit happen
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can’t jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I’ll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
When I be gone off the ecstasy, shorty she gone get the best of me
And she know I be with killas, so family is not accepting me
I nutted all in her and left I told her I got vasectomy
Why them getting to @‘ing me?
Said they catching me they stretching me
Bronem be watching my back they know I be gone off the medicine
My cousin had died on cam, the police got footage and edit it
Big facts, on god, I can't get shit snatched
Can't leave I need that get back
Fuck shot I need you kidnapped
Suprise that the Glock come get frown
I tatted all my dead homies In my skin
Foenem cracking them BOA's, they need yo pins
Gulp a cup of my lean just to wash off my sins
Made my tri-state hoes buy me all my timbs
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can't jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I’m just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I’d do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I’m that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
Yo homies say they on me, i be with killas and parolees

You be rapping about that trap but ain't never sold nothing
I hold a grudge back in 09 you ain't let me hold nothing
You cheat on me I swear I beat you like you stole something
Pillow talking to these hoes, yeah you cold blooded
How you follow me on the gram and you don’t like pics
I fucked a bitch she like all girls she don't like dick
Cum on my night sheets, they don't like this
Bad bitch a Pisces, I keep a night stick
I swear I'm at my nicest been through my crisis
We not to be played with, they on they night shift
Niggas try to stick me up, they can never show no love
That petty shit let go I told you i ain't got no grudge
I don't give a fuck I'm addicted to these drugs
When I was down and gone them niggas ain't send me nothing
Sip red, i ain't fucking with tussin'
Wipe down, I'm bussin'
Shoot first, you clutching
You mad I pressed yo button
You know we read yo mind, my niggas ain't ducking
You know you play with mines ain't no discussion
We ain't got the same blood
We just brothers from the mud
Grew up in the same hood, and the violence so fucked up
A nigga can't jugg
We gone sleep around each other till we neighbors
I'm just tryna wonder when this feeling in my pain stop
How you say you love me you my brother but got my name up
You must be crazy thinking I changed up
I'd do anything, plus give my fame up
You know I'll give my fame up
You know I will never change up
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuck
You know I'm that dude but you let a lame fuckMet a hoe at duck threw
Got money from your main hoe
Shot a 22.8 revolver for safe keeping
Done robbed another safe  for safe keeping
I'm run this holidays up
Shorty down to fuck like a quite duck
Plenty charges cases pending on me
Robbing wall mart was a thing to me
Living behind them apartments showed me i had enemies
Had to give up a little  bit of money because people trying to rob me
I don’t give a fuck about you
I'll turn you to a quick duck sauce too
Play with me about my money i dare you
Rolling dice on them late nights on them corner blocks
I got so much money i can take off
Cut the prices of my birds there feathers in the coop
Trying to buy that new bend coop
Got fired from last job as a clerk
Found out my baby mama was cheating on me
Left me cold heart when i first met the dudeNoneLyrics from Snippet

Grew up in poverty shit was so difficult
They look at you different if you was a criminal
Rich in the trenches then that shit a miracle
Killers the killers the robbers that's fearin' you

And if I love you, it’s for you, it ain’t about no money
I can be fucking, I get up & touch yo tummy
Touch yo tummy, whole boy bump inside yo stomach 
It saved me from who I am, black red blue white or tan
