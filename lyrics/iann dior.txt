I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' 
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
Tell me what it is, made my heart break
Saying that it's me, but you know it ain't
Took a few pills, I can't feel a thing
Got me in my feels, sippin' on drank
Tryna keep it real, girl, you really ain't
You know what's the deal, you can't get a thing
Saying that it hurts, tryin' to the game
Saying I'm a joke, laughin' to the bank
I need your love
I need your touch
I need you right now
I need you right now
I fell in love, same time that you're fallin' apart
I should've known, thought I saw a sign in the stars
But I was wrong, fucking with you ain't last that long
Now you gone, now you gone, now you gone, girl
I just want the love, baby, not the lust
Caught up in a daze, man, I need your trust
All up in a maze, left you in the dust
Gone in a wraith, see the stars in a wraith
You see the stars in the day, bitch
Have you been to Mars on a date, bitch?
I can take yo ass to Mars in a day, bitch
I can take yo ass to Mars today, bitch, yeah

You did me wrong
And I can't forget that
Tell me what you want
I know it's a lie 
You broke my heart
And you cannot fix that
You can't erase what you've done to me
But certainly, all you do is burden me
It's hurting deep
Our past is like a blur to me
It's hard to see, but look what you have done to me
What you want?
What you want from me?

So you can see how far I doveI've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house 
Lately, I know I've been a punk and I need to sober up
Double cup, it got me stuck, I think I'm losin' it 
'Cause every time that I've been gettin' stuck 
There's a line inside my head 
Of all my friends, that they've been dead since I made it out
It's every time that you cross my mind
Remember the times, but I know that you won't ever change
I'm not sobering up, sick and tired of love
If you draw that line, bae, I hope you know I'm crossin' it
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend
Over and over again, it's like I never win
Why you puttin' me down? It don't make any sense
I'm not sober again, but I'm tryna pretend
Like everything's alright but it's over with
I get drunk and interrupt, and my eyes look red
Because I'm mad at myself, I stab the openin'
Lately, everything I say you just tell me is wrong
I told her I won't be here long, I can't hold it in
Every time you cross my mind
I burn another memory to keep yours inside
I saw us drown like high tide
And everything is nothing if you're not here tonight
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in a drought, I guess I'll start again
I've been losin' my mind tryna figure it out
But I'm stuck in this house, I am my only friend

Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash
Addicted to poppin' them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch callin' back
Saw me come up out the random
Didn't wait long, now that bitch throwin' tantrums
Her friends fell in love when I fell into fame
In my DMs talkin' bout, "Hey, handsome"
I know that they hate me and want me for ransom
It's nothin' new, I won't give into that
I eat the hate up and spit it right back
My lyrics like bullets, I'm shootin' your ass
Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the back 
I'm a prospect, not from Earth, I feel like a martian
'Matter fact, bitch, I came from a starship
My bed feel like a coffin, not wakin' up
If I run into opps, I'ma off 'em
I don't know if you think that you stoppin'
What I got goin' on, got a semi with auto on
This ain't no auto-correct, bitch, this a threat
Now I'm comin' at your neck
Niggas act cute like a pet
Soft like a Pop-Tart, act like they got no heart
Y'all be the ones that's pretending
Insecurities, they always offended
Mad about a bitch I already been in
That bitch for everybody, we ain't spoke in a minute
Niggas still in the picture, and I'm still leavin' with her
It ain't nothin', I'm a rebel
I can't conform, I ain't fallin' back, no
She need more, she got too attached, huh
Addicted to me like I'm on one
Three thousand for that new Rick Owens
Walk around, look like a mummy
Psychedelics hurt my tummy
Swipe, swipe, I'ma get it all 
Nowadays, I get what I want
Lately, been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash
Addicted to poppin' them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch callin' back
Saw me come up out the random

Women come and go with the cash
You gon' learn and learn that shit fast
They gon' fold, fold under act
I get my medicine straight out the bag 
Brand new Corvette, come through smashin' the gas 
They made me mad, now I'm back in my bag 
I hope my main and my side never crash
Wide-body 'Cat, tryna dodge my past
We catch that boy, then we robbin' his ass
It's the principle, I don't need the cash
Expensive bitches, half a million on lashes
I could kick it, but I don't like to brag
Ho, they done made me mad, I'm 'bout to turn up 
I got my glizzy, wish a nigga run up
You can come get your bitch 'cause I don't want her
I ran my millions up from off the corner
I'm the one out here doin' what I wanna
My lil' bro ran it up off marijuana
Grind in the winter, turn up in the summer
Trackhawk with sport, I press it then I launch it
I'm thankin' God, ain't no more free lunches
Got suspended, me and greeny hundred
House up on the hill, I used to want it
Now I got it, I don't even stay there 
I get even, I don't play fair
Probably spend me a million on haters
On they top, make 'em drop
And I don't give a fuck 'bout no cops 
Nowadays I get what I want
Lately been spendin' the bag
Addicted to gettin' that cash
Addicted to poppin' them tags
Money was made for the sad
Now my ex-bitch callin' back
Saw me come up out the random

Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
Cutthroat, swear these bitches, they be cutthroat
I'm so low
Cruising through the city with my eyes closed
'Cause I'm losing my brain
Gotta keep on moving straight
Over, when you say it's over I'm not sober
Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
They want to see me live
And I cannot forgive
Think I'm really going psycho
Thinking that I might blow
And I can't let you in
Baby, I can't forgive
Got me hanging on a tightrope
It's time for me to let go, 'cause
These drugs got me thinking that I need you
But I don't really need you
It's hard for me to see through
But now I see the real you
Like glass, I see right through you
Now why you acting new new, we both know what you wanna do
Shorty in my phone
But where you at?
Run off with my love, like you was a running back
But now I got you running back

Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same

Loner, she left me so lonely with no closure
Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insane
They know we them niggas
And that's why they hate us
Only worry 'bout the money
So no you can't phase us
I can't never fall in love 'cause love is full of danger
You were my other half and now you are a stranger
Now I'm hard to reach, hard to find
In my line, all the time, every night
We living in a trippy life, I'm sad inside
So I really don't care to fight, enjoy the high
And now you want back in
But I can't let you in
Now you get to watch where I go
Got you going psycho
And no we can't be friends
And we can't make amends
Now it's time for you to let go
I'm just someone that you used to know
I know, got a feeling that I might blow
Even though this industry is cutthroat
Now I don't feel the same 
Think these drugs drive me insane 
Cutthroat, swear these bitches they be cutthroat

Now I don't feel the same
Think these drugs drive me insaneBack at home
Why should I try? When I know you'll choose the other guy
You a lie, on your fifth and probably switchin' sides
With a guy, that ain't gon' do shit for you but apply
For that nine to five, and you satisfied, why?
Hi, I'm that nigga that you won't forget, such a threat
See me up and now she wanna text
LAX, I just landed, I left all my friends
Back at home, feel alone
Making love, said she want my trust and that she ain't get enough, 
You ain't gettin' none, bitch
I said we done, this shit not fun
And I'm not the one to be messin' with
I'm not the one you been flexin' with
I'm not the one, that's the end of it
Ain't no questioning
If I do, where was you
There's no end of it

Moving to a different state

Stop fuckin' with my head again
My heart is yours to break again
Don't want you in my bed again
Things aren't the same, let's not pretend
The way we always scream and fight
Always been the one for the crazy type
Our love feels like I'm underwater
Hold me down just a little longer
I know I can't help myself
I love girls that are bad for my health
I can't stop, think I'm really addicted
I don't know what it is I'm missin'
And if I gave you my world, would it start falling apart?
I don't wanna wake up without you in my arms
Stop fuckin' with my head again

I won't lie, I can't fly, I'm not afraid of falling
You asked for my love, I can't do it
If my heart was enough, I would prove
I blow my smoke and pop my pills
But everything I've done can't numb these feels
And I wish that all my demons go away
All the money for peace, I'd throw away
'Cause lately I've been too wrong
I only seem to do wrong
So, baby, won't you stay for a while?
Baby, won't you stay for a while?
I just wanna feel your touch
'Round me, not a soul I trust
So, baby, won't you stay for a while?
Baby, won't you stay for a while? 
Don't you lie to me
Don't you lie
It feels so wrong, but I can't seem to let you go
And I've been up for four nights, I've been messy
Say you never love me just to test me
I hit you in the morning just so we can do this again
Again and again
'Cause lately I've been too wrong
I only seem to do wrong
So, baby, won't you stay for a while?
Baby, won't you stay for a while?

'Round me, not a soul I trust
So, baby, won't you stay for a while?
Baby, won't you stay for a while? Oh, oh, ohh
Oh, oh, ohh
She say I'ma loner, she say I'ma stoner
She say she gon' come through, will you be here when it's over? 
Nothing leaves me closure, 'cause I can't do this no more
Last girl let me down, so I can't trust, my trust is over 
This lesson's taking over, now women act like dogs 
You can't tell 'em shit 
How you trust that nigga when that nigga fucked your friends? 
But it's cool though, out there chasing who knows
Living two lives, now I know you not down to ride
But I tried with you 
What you did to me, that's not what I would do
Keep it real, you know I'd never lie to you 
Nothing's worse than having to say bye to you
But you ride for me
If I lost it all, would you stand by for me? 
And never lie to me
Keep it real, girl, don't go switchin' sides on me 
Would you ride for me?
If I lost it all would you stand by for me?
And never lie to me
Keep it real, girl, don't go switchin' sides on me 
'Cause if you are not down to ride, just tell me you're not down to ride
I can't seem to make you mine, and that keeps me up late at night
Treat it like it's do or die , treat it like it's do or die 
In the end, it's you and I, and if not, then it's suicide
Now if you're worth it, I know I'm not perfect
No, I am not perfect, but one thing's for certain 
Nobody's perfect
We live and we learn when you live in the moment
So I gotta own it, not on my side, girl, you're the opponent , you can't sugarcoat it
She say I'ma loner, she say I'ma stoner
She say she gon' come through, will you be here when it's over? 
Nothing leaves me closure, 'cause I can't do this no more
Last girl let me down, so I can't trust, my trust is over 
This lesson's taking over, now women act like dogs 
You can't tell 'em shit 
How you trust that nigga when that nigga fucked your friends? 
But it's cool though, out there chasing who knows
Living two lives, now I know you not down to ride
Hard to find the reasons why I want you mine
See through the lies, see the disguise, and what's inside
But now it's my time, I'm running through your mind, I push you to the side 
You're full of lies , and full of cries , a waste of time 
Cannot pass hard times
Keep running through my mind
Keep running through my
Running through my

I've been running from the monsters in my head
Ain't nobody here to save me from my death
I'm feeling alone
I'm feeling like we've grown apart
Don't you know that you're the monster in my head
Can't forgive you all the things that you did
Thinking 'bout you when it's somebody else
You're bad for my health
No running from the hell that you bring
You suffocate me
Thinkin' that I'm better with you
I ain't better with you
No longer got these sober thoughts in my head
It never seems to finish with you
The hell we went through
Nobody here to save me from my death
'Cause ain't nobody here to save me 
I think I'm going crazy 
And girl you know I'm better than him
You played me again, the reason
Why I sin and I sin, we've come to an end
You know you cannot change me 
You know you can't replace me 
I've been dancing with the devil all along
Let me down and you'll forever be what's wrong
Lately you've been on my mind like all the time
Can't seem to get you out my head
Said it like a hundred times, I'm sad inside
Feeling like there's nothing left
Why you gotta waste my time? I wanna shine
Put me in the shadows instead
I hate it, why you gotta lie? Stay by my side
Take you away from all this mess
I've been running from the monsters in my head
Ain't nobody here to save me from my death
I'm feeling alone
I'm feeling like we've grown apart
Don't you know that you're the monster in my head
Can't forgive you all the things that you did
Thinking 'bout you when it's somebody else
You're bad for my health
No running from the hell that you bring
You suffocate meI've been by myself, I think I'm better without you
I can't find myself and I don't think that I want to
You've hurt me so many times, how can I forgive you?
I'm so sick of these games that we play in your bedroom
You only care about yourself 
Where were you when I needed help? 
You only care about yourself, care about yourself

Where were you when I needed help? 
You only care about yourself, care about yourself

Love it when you cry, wish that you feel inside
I'm riding all alone
Been sipping heavy but I love it when I'm gone
When I'm gone, when I'm gone, yeah
Love me or let me go
I don't feel comfortable
I'm tired of playing games
I'm gonna lose control
I think I lost my mind
I'm tired of "I don't know's"
You're just a waste of time
And I have to let you go
You only care about yourself 
Where were you when I needed help? 
You only care about yourself, care about yourself

And now I'm rocking all this ice, goldI'm stressed out, think I need a blunt or five
To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shine
I'm stressed out, think I need a blunt or five
To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shine
Go-o, look where I'ma go 
And I let you get so close
With a heart blacker than coal 
But I thought this shit was gold
Why you acting like you know? You don't know
Yeah, yeah not enough, no
You're not even close
Think I'm getting closer, when I'm in my zone, leave me alone
Yeah, yeah, what you want?
Why you always bugging? When I say I need my space
Get the fuck away
Go, go where'd you go? It's so hard to find you
After everything you can pack your things and leave
I won't need nobody else, I'll be fine without you
Money in the bank, give a fuck 'bout what you think

To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shine

To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shine
Heart is beating out my chest, I'm sick of this pressure
I'm upset 'cause if I don't control this stress I'm dying young
I'm sick of hearing you talk down when I'm being myself
And I can't think 'cause there's no peace and quiet whenever you're around
So I roll another fucking dart just to get me high up
One after another 'til I feel alive
And I could find somebody new before the end of the night
So keep talking like you do, like I'm trash
You got me rethinking love
When I put you before me, look where I ended up 
Sick of hoping my time is enough
So packing and leaving, don't need you no more 
I'm stressed out, think I need a blunt or five
To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shine

To get me through the rest of the night
This pressure is weighing on my mind
Not enough time to shineI can't let you lie to me

Never going back home 
Never going back, no 
'Cause there's a lake full of snakes and a ocean full of girls
That already been around 
Got a tour, so I'd rather see the world 
Than be chasing a girl 
One of many mistakes was when I didn't break you off 
Falling for you wasn't soft, so I had to cut it off
Being 'round you I'ma relapse, why we never chill 
But I always keep it real with ya, that's the only way I go

Your feeling's change like the seasons, but I still play my part
You left me broken and bleedin', now
But I can't let you go
Oh, baby, I must let you know
Don't you know that you're far from the usual?
I do the dash on the freeway, I don't care if I crash
Takin' drugs for no reason, but the feeling won't last
Got me stuck in the deep end, can't forget 'bout my past
My unforgettable past, you are my first and my last
You are my love, thought it was everlastin'
You gave it up, I swear this love is tragic
I'm not enough, but you still can’t look past me
So tell me what you askin' for
Round and round in my head
I've been dead since you left
Laying down in my bed
I'm surrounded, surrounded
Round and round in my head
See you everywhere I go, I feel surrounded
Wanna throw me out your life, it doesn't make sense
I was there for you and all of your crisis
They comin' after me
It's comin' down to nothin', more than apathy
You said you wouldn't leave, and that's a tragedy
I know I got issues, but all I needed was you
You are my love, thought it was everlastin'
You gave it up, I swear this love is tragic
I'm not enough, but you still can’t look past me

Woah-woah, you make me fall apart
And I don't know where to go
You ran off with my heart
I got a hole in my chest and I've been livin' like that 
What you want, baby? I don't even know anymore
Hit me up, late at night , girl, I know you just bored 
Still beat it, beat it, girl, come here, you're all that I want
I never gave a fuck about her, but girl, I wanted your love
Woah-woah, you make me fall apart
And I don't know where to go
You ran off with my heart
I got a hole in my chest and I've been livin' like that
Seasons change, but I know people never do
I believed , that I was really right for you 
But you make me feel different, I've been on a mission 
To find me somebody , to take care of my heart 
Ooh, breaking my heart , knew from the start
That you were not the one for me, but I played my part
And you let her put me underneath, burn in the fire
Now I got no company, I'm all alone
You make me fall apart
And I don't know where to go
You ran off with my heart
I got a hole in my chest and I've been livin' like that 
What you want, baby? I don't even know anymore

And I don't know where to go
You ran off with my heart
I got a hole in my chest and I've been livin' like that
And I've been livin' like that
Into this rockstar lifestyle, I'm livin' too fast
My teachers never liked me, now I'm rich, so bitch, do the math
In the Caddy with my brother, and three bitches in the back
Gotta leave my feelings in the past, but I feel too attached
Nieman's and Saks, spend that bag, I know I'm gon' get it back
She want Chanel, I tell that bitch that I'm financially embarrassed
I'm a loner off the Henny, I get down and I get sad
Tried to get you off my mind, oh-woah
Woah-woah, you make me fall apart
And I don't know where to go
You ran off with my heart

I got a hole in my chest and I've been livin' like thatTired of all the drugs that I've been takin' 
Tired of all the drugs that I've been lacin' 
Tired of all these girls that I've been chasin'
I can't take no more
Tired of all the drugs that I've been takin'
Tired of all the drugs that I've been lacin'
Tired of all these girls that I've been chasin'
I can't take no more
Diamonds on your wrist, I can make it glist
Shine like superstar, 'cause my time's what it is
Don't know who you are, but somehow you've gotten in
Oh so unexpected, you're the monster in my head
Who needs love, I can't see anything
You were my high, with drugs, every day
Tired of feelin' low, bleedin' slow
I feel cold from head to toe
Rented out my love but you ain't ever pay out
So why we gotta talk, tell me, what's to say now?
Pray for better luck 'cause I'm really feeling stuck
Everyone want someone that just do not give a fuck
Careless, if you want me, I won't let you take a dub
I can never get enough, girls are drugs
Tired of all the drugs that I've been takin' 
Tired of all the drugs that I've been lacin' 
Tired of all these girls that I've been chasin'
I can't take no more
Tired of all the drugs that I've been takin'
Tired of all the drugs that I've been lacin'
Tired of all these girls that I've been chasin'
I can't take no moreI got drank in my cup, at the party rollin' up
In my brain when you told me it was never really love
I got things on my mind, gettin' geeked up, I feel stuck
In my head all the time, really thought that you were mine
Dior chain, it shine, it gon' make you blind
Baby, you were fine, but I don't got the time
You just wanna fight but I don't wanna fight
It's a lonely night and you can't stay the night
I'm in Balenciagas for the night 
Every time we fuck you talkin' in spite
Hated 'cause I know how to get you right
Got you comin' over every time
I just don't get it, girl, I just don't get it
Know how you feelin' so we can re-live it
After that, you know I'm taking my feelings 
Bottle them up and I turn 'em to lyrics 
But lately, I been feelin' different
I know you hate that I'm going through change
Exposing them things that we never name
We go back to bad, but it's not the same
No, it's not the same now 
There's no one to blame
I been on the road, I don't feel alone
My heart turnin' cold and it's all because 
I been on that drank, on that drank, sippin' heavy 
Sippin' heavy 
I don't know where the fuck to go or what the fuck to do
It's all because
I got drank in my cup, at the party rollin' up 
In my brain when you told me it was never really love
I got things on my mind, gettin' geeked up, I feel stuck
In my head all the time, really thought that you were mine
Dior chain, it shine, it gon' make you blind
Baby, you were fine, but I don't got the time
You just wanna fight but I don't wanna fight
It's a lonely night and you can't stay the night 
You can't stay the night
You can't stay the nightWhen I'm cruisin' down ocean
My mind is producin' thoughts of you
Hearin' these rumors, prayin', hopin' that they not true
Sayin' you different, but knowin' that you fuck with the crew
Drinkin' this liquor, tryin' to forget about you
These sober thoughts made me realize that you broke many hearts
And I can say "You the reason why I turned into a dog"
Time is the only solution to mend a broken heart
You may be down for the moment
But trust me, don't lose focus
But can you tell me why these dreams are something I'm provokin'?
And while I think about it, there's some other nigga out there strokin'
You give them everything they ask, then they leave you broken
They use you for a game, like an arcade token
So many hearts is broken and so many words are spoken
I lift one finger to the sky, I hope this prayer's workin'
My mind's been playin' games and I can see the devil lurkin'
I want the money and the fame, so when they sleepin'-

Who can you love?
Who can you trust?
Twenty seventeen
You hate the fact that he played you, I feel he sold your dreams
One day he love you, the next day that nigga switchin' scenes
But you stick with him 'cause you convinced that it's meant to be
He say he love you, he want you, and that's all you gon' see
He played you good, no he's not who he pretends to be
On different teams but you convinced that we all the same
You wanna love him but you remember 'bout all the pain
He fucked you over and lately you just don't feel the same
Drinkin' all night 'cause when you sober you feel nothin' but pain
I know you tired of givin' love to these fuckin' lames
Seems like no matter what I tell you, you think I'm the same
Been through a lot so I'm not really into playin' games
Know how I felt from the beginning, I won't ever change
I took my shot with you, I missed but girl I'm here to stay
I'm workin' day and night to make sure that I'm gettin' paid
I be workin'
I be learnin'

The lifestyle I been livin' got you lovin' me
And I'm not down for the fake love
If you ain't wit' it, then just take off
You talkin' to me like I don't understand what you been through
Fallin' for you so bad, I know now that the devil sent you
There's not enough, I want the money 'cause then I'm the issue
Sad inside, full of lies
Cross my heart and hope to die
Started out from nothin', I got ice on me

Heartbreaks and heartbreaks, they take my brain
I'm feelin', I'm feelin' so insane
So I smoke, want all the smoke, smoke all the dope
Full of hope, but you made sure I lost it though
I don't fuck with these bitches now, I want the money
Truth is, you were never for me
Let you go, now I'm feelin' funny 
I hope you hear me when I'm speakin', 'cause I'm speakin' to you
I can never trust a soul, they've never been in my shoes
We can sit and talk about all the shit you been through
But I think it's safe to say that none of this has been new
You been runnin' through my head

You switched on me out the blue
Tellin' me all the things that we gon' do
Then you gon' sit here and tell me that your love for me isn't true
Happened so soon
Had you for dinner, then you gone by noon
Sit here and tell me that this isn't true
But I know that you fakin', 'cause you don't love me like you say that you do
So let me give what you ask for

You should really be ashamed
You were always full of hate
But you knew how to play
Lyin' straight to my face

It was really hard to face
First taste and a fake
Now it's Henny to the face

Had me thinkin' that I need to change
But you were a liar

You did what you had to do
You switched on me like a fool
Tellin' me one thing, and next thing I knew
You were messin' wit a nigga that you told me that you never knew

Gave you all I had, and you left me by surprise 
A big surprise, when you left me for the one who only made you cry 
Now it's you I'm seein’ everywhere I go, and I hate it 
I want you, but you playin' 
Don't you hear what I'm sayin'?

All the lies that you wanna try wit another guy
Never get what you give, he only want you for this 
Takin’ Xannies ’cause I'm sad inside 
You were never really down to ride 
If it’s true then it takes some time
Hope to see you back in my life

We can rock designer together
Put ya in the Gucci, in the Prada forever
Thinkin' 'bout you really got me under the weather
And I remember all the days in school
Used to walk you to your class, actin' like a fool
Then I saw you with that nigga, and I lost my cool
How you could do me like this? Girl, I'm missin' you
And I want you forever
We're better together
We're better together 
And that's why I need you around me
And I want you back in my life now, yeah, ayy
And that's why I need you around me
Oh, I want you back in my life now
And I need you like, about right now 
Feelin' good when I'm rockin' Margielas
We can rock designer together
Put you in the Gucci, in the Prada forever
Thinkin' 'bout you really got me under the weather
And I remember all the days at school
Used to walk you to your class, actin' like a fool
How you could do me like this? Girl, I'm missin' youI fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure
A quick deal, I need bills, fuck how you feel
Can't trust her, she a fuck up
She a pretty little thing, but ran the luck up
I hope you get a taste of your karma
I know that it will not be much longer
'Til I trust her, and I fuck up
I can't let you play me for a sucker
Now that it is my time she gon' show love
Now that it's on my time, I give no fucks
And this shows
When you act like you don't know me
Can't get close
'Cause if you do I know your homie
I fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure
A quick deal, I need bills, fuck how you feel
Fuck how you feel, got a new thrill
Living life with no level, fuck your life up
Blue-face bills, chasing after mills
Writing 'bout how fucked up my life was
I just wanna chill, give me something real
Something I can feel, I can feel the devil near
Light one in the air, live without a care
Where the plug at? I need some more bud in here
And this shows 
When you act like you don't know me 
Can't get close 
'Cause if you do I know your homie
I fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure
A quick deal, I need bills, fuck how you feel
Can't trust her, she a fuck up
She a pretty little thing, but ran the luck up
I hope you get a taste of your karma
I know that it will not be much longer
'Til I trust her, and I fuck up
I can't let you play me for a sucker
Now that is my time she gon' show love
Now that it's on my time, I give no fucks
And this shows
When you act like you don't know me
Can't get close
'Cause if you do I know your homieThere's something I've been—
Something I been meaning to tell you
I couldn't find the words, but I knew I had failed to
There's something I've been—
Something I been meaning to tell you
I couldn't find the words, but I knew I had failed to, failed to
You the first to say "I love you", and the first to take it back
First to say you want me, you ain't have to do all that
Don't wanna hear excuses, never cared about yo past
Did me like them others, and I cannot take you back
I got plans to make it out, don't ask me where I'm at 
Had yo chance, then blew it, whatchu gotta say to that? 
Turned me to a monster, and there ain't no turning back
Gave you all that had, you gave me all, accepted that
Yeah, I know
That you want me, and you love me, let go
I ain't who you fell for no more
Open up that door, and let go, just let go
Yeah, I know
That you want me, and you love me, let go
I ain't who you fell for no more
Open up that door, and let go, just let go, just let go
Girl, don't you lie, I know that you miss me
Up late at night, I know that you can't sleep
Voices in yo head won't let you forget me
But you cannot change me, so you must replace me
See you in public, I know that you hate me
I'm not the same, so just please do not chase me
There's something I've been meaning to tell you
I couldn't find the words, but I knew I had failed to
To fall in love, to fall in love
To fall in love, to fall in love
When you say it's over, I'll never be sober
When you say it's over, I'll never be sober
Yeah, I know
That you want me, and you love me, let go
I ain't who you fell for no more
Open up that door, and let go, just let go
Yeah, I know
That you want me, and you love me, let go
I ain't who you fell for no more
Open up that door, and let go, just let go, just let goSo alive

To feel the vibe 
'Cause you make me feel , oh so alive 
Everything's perfect
We vibin', it's workin'
These demons keep lurkin'
You're picture perfect, so I am not worried
We're not in a hurry 
Smile so pretty, I love when I see you
And, when I'm with you, it's like I'm really being who I wanna be
I want you to see that you're right for me 
'Cause I am for you, and maybe it's true, but baby it's new
So won't you come through? 
I'm under the stars, chillin' with you
To tell you the truth, when I look at those eyes I get lost in the room
I get lost in the room
You wanna move slow
I am about it
But baby just know 
You got my heart and I'm losing control
Of my emotions
Hate feeling alone
Alone
You make me feel , so alive 
Your beauty, it kills , those gorgeous eyes
I don't need the pills 
To feel the vibe 
'Cause you make me feel , oh so alive Woah, woah-oh

Inside
It was hard to look away from you
I still haven't looked away from you 
Remember when I used to pray for you
I could never say I hated you
All I ever did was chase

Ended up in last place
Threw it back in my face

You would rather lose me
This is how you do me
But why?

I’m too drunk, I'm too slump I need adderall
Need that up, put that down now I'm feelin' perfect
Sober, sober
I cannot be sober
I cannot love that girl 'cause love in her made me a loner
A stoner, wish it'll be over
But she can't seem to wrap her head around the fact it's over
Quick, take off like an astronaut
I’m stackin’ my pants and my pants fall off
Scoop, pull up in a bentley coupe
Money on me it could change the mood
Soon you know what I'm finna do
Blue faces, two faces in the room
Trust, like metal it rusts to dust
Soon enough no one will give a fuck
True shit, these bitches are ruthless
Tryna play you for stupid
I knew this, I already been through it
We’ll hop in again, I'm not that stupid
I'm dreamin', I’m lucid
Psychedelic, I'm movin'
My brain on that new shit
You ghost me, you foolish
Sober, sober
I cannot be sober
I cannot love that girl 'cause love in her made me a loner
A stoner, wish it'll be over
But she can't seem to wrap her head around the fact it's over

Need that up, put that down now I'm feelin' perfectLyrics from snippets
...it's true
There's a place that I go in my head
When I don't really wanna be here
There's a door I unlock with my mind
And that's how my dreams fly
Yeah, I like to be lonely sometimes
'Cause nobody tells the truth anymore, anymore
I got no love, in my veins it's cold
Diamonds in my chain, it's froze
They won't fill that space you left me
I fear it's too heavy
They say "when it rains, it pours"
But I know you won't cry no more
I did you dirt, now karma got me
I fear it's too heavy
I fear it's true
I fear it's trueI'm drinking straight out the bottle
I had to hit the unfollow
'Cause if I see you with someone else
I'll be hitting the bottom
It was a Tuesday in the morning
You took a one way and never called me 
Now it's too late for "I'm sorry"
Ooh-ooh, yeah, ooh-ooh, yeah
I had it all so wrong, thinking I'd be fine
And now it hurts like Hell, when you're on my mind
I should've chased you down, when you said goodbye
I don't know why, why
I had to lose somebody to miss somebody
Had to lose somebody to miss somebody
Lose somebody to miss somebody
I don't know why, why
I guess it's true 
I'm missing you 
This time it's safe to say, I did you wrong
I know and now I feel it
I can't sleep, where are you?
Heart don't beat, without you
Next to me, I'm lost
I'm lost on heartbreak island
I had it all so wrong, thinking I'd be fine
And now it hurts like Hell, when you're on my mind
I should've chased you down, when you said goodbye
I don't know why , why 
I had to lose somebody to miss somebody
Had to lose somebody to miss somebody
Lose somebody to miss somebody
I don't know why, why
These things they come and go
I just can't let this one free
The only love I'll know 
Without you I feel ugly
It was a Tuesday in the morning
You took a one way and never called me 
Now it's too late for "I'm sorry"
I had it all so wrong, thinking I'd be fine
And now it hurts like Hell, when you're on my mind
I should've chased you down, when you said goodbye
I don't know why , why

Nothing’s ever good enough for you and I know
Never satisfied, even went and got you clothes
Broke my heart, fixing it'll cost a soul
So repetitive, always had to let you know
What you mean to me, and all the things that you see
What else will you want from me, I’d give you anything
But it’s like you won’t change
Been a minute since I seen ya, but you’ve been on my mind
I don’t wanna fall in love
I don’t wanna fall in love, with you
I don’t even wanna trust

Wanted love, it was lust, I can't do this no more
Is it weird I can’t be me unless I'm on the drugs
Wanted trust, broke me off, what the fuck was that for
Is it weird I don't feel free unless I’m on the drugs
Damn, VG, you made this?
I can't do this no more
Damn, I think they onto us
Loesoe going crazy
Yeah
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs

Baby, you been in my head
Thinking ’bout what I said
Tripping off the shrooms

Look at how I move

This some shit, yeah, this some shit
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs

Loesoe going crazy
Is it weird I can't be me, when I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see, when I'm on the drugs
And if not, just let me be, 'cause I think they onto us
Yeah, wanting love but got no love
I've been going under a lot of stress, lot of pressure
I've been fucking on these thotties, I need something wetter
I've been stashing all the drugs in my fucking dresser
Hope my momma don't find 'em, if she do
Leave me alone
I be all alone
I been in my zone, but not really in my zone
There's a lot to understand
It was hard for me to see, all the things that I could be
But now I'ma let it be, 'cause I'm destined
Keep a Smith & Wesson if they testing me
I guess you can have what's left of me
But just know that I'm lost in another one
Cannot think of you and me if I thinking 'bout me and her
And that's facts, let's just run it back for the hell of it
Thinking 'bout the future, but there is no telling it
I just took some shrooms, now I'm saying how I feel
Maybe I was better with you, well now I don't know now
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah

You make me feel like I'm fucking up
We were just kids when we fell in love
And you never pick up the phone
You never see what I'm on now
I tried to pick your brain, pick your brain 
But I still can't find out what is wrong with you
No sé lo qué pasa contigo, tú corazón frío
Jugaste conmigo, adiós amor mío

My ex bitch was a disaster
It's too hard to leave those feelings in the past, baby
Fuck me up and then fuck me over

It's hard to break and not lose composure

Girl I can feel the...

Never meant to hurt you 
Never meant to make you cry...Big heart on me
Which means I walk around with lots of pain
I don't expect you to change
You fuck up my membrane 
But fuck it, I fuck with you anyways
I'm on some shit you don't see every day
She play with me anyways
I know she's faking the love 
And that's why I can't get enough
Searchin' for a minute, she my four-leaf clover
Feelin' lucky, oh, I feel like something special
Home run derby when I'm hittin' , yeah she give it up 
Up in Cali, living, smoking Maui, gettin' rich as fuck
Listen up, I got a story to tell
These bitches, they wishin' me well
But I am not wishin' 'em well 
I'd rather get money for bail
My bro had got locked in a cell
18 and 19 was hell
20 be full of the riches
I don't got no time for these bitches
Fell for it once, that shit hurt, had to dismiss it
I don't know, what you want, but, I know that I'm finished
Don't wanna play your games, anymore
Supercut type of nigga that you fuckin' with
Fell in love with the bitch, but it's over with
I'm so over it, turned me down, I wouldn't shine
I know you a dime, but I won't even change
Big heart on me
Which means I walk around with lots of pain
I don't expect you to change
You fuck up my membrane 
But fuck it, I fuck with you anyways
I'm on some shit you don't see every day
She play with me anyways
I know she's faking the love 
And that's why I can't get enough
Searchin' for a minute, she my four-leaf clover
Feelin' lucky, oh, I feel like something specialI got issues, I can't trust nobody 
Keep it on me, dare you to come try me 
Livin' up, you can meet me at the party 
Say "what's up" but you're one of many Barbies
Ayy, I just- I just took a XO, I be up until the morning 
I just hit the jackpot, big bank, yeah, I'm scoring
Buy her some expensive just to make her feel important 
But she not important to me, no way 
I call all the sauce, make her do the role play 
When she comin' over, open up and I slay 
Leavin' her on read 'cause the energy was fake
And then hit it so hard that it make the ground shake
Okay, okay
Guess I'm full of myself, yeah
Don't play, don't play
I know no one really cares
Off the Rosé, Stoney, that's a mixture that'll help me
I know no one wants to help me
Okay, okay
Guess I'm feeling myself 
I've been drinking all night
Throwing ones up in the air 
Like a free throw, I hit
Every time she come around me 
Now she never come around me 
Whoa, I got issues, I can't trust nobody 
Keep it on me, dare you to come try me 
Livin' up, you can meet me at the party

I needed the most when you couldn't change 
Gave you my heart when everything

Gave you my heart 'cause you fill the space

Cool shawty, heard you was a cool shawty

Ducati 
Switching lanes
Switching, swerving lanes in a 10 speed
Skrt off on your bitch, she dusty
Hit it once and she was lucky
Never twice, that shit funny
Snow bunny,  straight honey
Talking a lot, no no, don't do that
Let's keep it a stack, hunnid
I'm talking them facts, I'm talking them stacks
Fat, just like that ass
Tap like some water, stacking taller
I'm going further, further away from all you lame niggas
I get the fame quicker, quick on the first night
Too litty might throw up, we pouring them 4s up
Don't care if they know us, but they finna know us
She say that she like me, her man wanna fight me
And that's okay 
Everything my way, that's how I stay
Don't do them plays,  make 'em plays
She gettin' played, in every way
I feel ashamed, but anyways
Tomorrow's a new day, I'm starting a new wave
I'm chugging that deuce, ay
While sipping that D'USSÉ
Wavy, all this wax it got a nigga lazy
One night's all it took to drive her crazy
Two times, I don't do that ever maybe, just maybe
Let's take a trip, outer space
Palms are sweating as I start to get a taste
Of the fame, of the fame, I can't wait
Everything's gonna change, won't be the same
RSK, let it play, boy
Too litty, want Fendi, feel shitty but I'm still moving
I'm still flipping the patty, McDouble 
If not I'm in trouble 'cause I need it quick
Feel like the shit 'cause I am the shit, bitch 
I'ma get rich quick
Karma like hit, dip
Harder to hit, stick 
Lay down and that's it
Snooze, that's when you lose

I can never let a bitch take control of me
Hell nah, can't love these hoes
You're the reason why I'm fucked up, I can't trust nobody
It's too late for your apology, don't want your sorry 
I replaced the bitch that broke me with a red Ferrari 
A red Ferrari, all on my dick when I get to the party
Leavin' with me, she gon' suck on the posse
I get too lit when I'm off of the molly
Sorry, but I am not sorry
Gettin' the commas, my momma don't worry
Haulin' my bag, you know I'm in a hurry
And when I pull up, I just splash like I'm Curry
Baby, don't you know who you fuckin' with?
I am on some other shit
Show me how you shake that ass low to the floor
Is you on some other shit?
That's what I am fuckin' with
But after this I gotta dip
And you say I got you goin' crazy, yeah
I got all I want, so I don't really need you here
Got no time to talk so we do not communicate
Have a heart when I'm with you but when I leave it's dead
Please don't call my phone when I get home

'Cause I don't lose no
Try to run off on my sauce and got lost in it
It don't matter what it cost, if I want, I'm coppin' it
We could keep it in the dark rather talkin' itNo more
Need something
No more
Need something
No more
Cause you only hit me up when you want some
When you need some
Girl don't you remember, don't be a pretender
My heart froze like the winter
And I cannot see straight no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
How come you can't be who you wanna, when you wanna
If I wanna, I'm gonna act right how I'm gonna
Though you out my life
Cause I've been riding so long
So long, So long, So long
Yeah, I don't know why I get like this
Or why I feel like this
But I have been like this for too long
Am I so gone?
So gone, So gone
I just want your company
I'll never put you underneath
Like why you gotta run from me?
Haven't seen you in so longs
Now I'm falling, falling
Sky falling, for you
Now I'm nauseous
I've lost it
I can't take no more
Cause you only hit me up when you want some
When you need some
Girl don't you remember, don't be a pretender
My heart froze like the winter
And I cannot see straight no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
Cause you only hit me up when you want some
When you need some
Girl don't you remember, don't be a pretender
My heart froze like the december
And I cannot see straight no more
No more, no more, no more, no moreMhmmm

'Cause I got a little money now so I flex
Really think I'm going through it again
Fell apart in the dark, broken heart on my chest
Anxiety, I feel it taking over, it's inside of me
Drowning for a minute, I can feel it from the inside out
Say you want me, but you know it's time to go
Drivin' on a different road
Fucked it up, now you can't go
Fucked it up, now imma show
Even went and chased ya
What was I doing?
Look foolish for a bitch so clueless
Hate the feeling, but I knew what you gon' do
Say you coming with the truth
But I knew that that's a lie
Yeah, rule number one, ''You can't trust these hoes''
They gon' make you feel like shit
In my thoughts, goin' crazy
Bitch you turned me to a trip
Back break her, 'fore I give her Scoliosis when I hit
Toolie on my what? 
Feeling broken all the time
You don't even know that you're mine
So I gotta tell you time after time
Just to give you confidence to leave
Feels like I'm losing it again
Don't know anybody, ain't nobody my friend
She gon' put me through it again
Fakeness all around me, I can't even trust my own friends

So how low will you go? 
So how low will you go?
Just to see me fall?
Yeah, how low will you go?
I don't know
What you want from me, is it the company? 
Is it the luxury? 
Tell me why
Yeah, I don't know
Don't know how much more of this I'll take before I break
Lookin' back, now you were a disgrace, a big mistake
Thinkin' that you're perfect, but you were never worth it
And now that I am earnin', I see that you been lurkin'
You get what what you give , and I cannot live the same
I wish you would change, I know some cannot change 
So who's left to blame? I'm going insane 
For your lovе
Crazy if you think you'd catch a dub off me, I can't love a ho
Now the doors arе closed, and you're locked out for sure
I'm better off alone, tellin' stories 'bout my health
Feel like I been in a cell, I been trapped inside your jail
For way too long, got me feelin' kind of strange
The type of strange, well, I cannot explain, so I refrain
From showin' my emotions 'cause I know you never cared
Don't tell me that you're scared, just tell me
How low will you go?
Just to see me fall?
Yeah, how low will you go?
I don't know
What you want from me, is it the company? 
Is it the luxury? 
Tell me why
Yeah, I don't know
I don't know what's left to say, but I pray through the night for a better day
'Cause life keep gettin' tougher in every way
Still, I wish you stayed
But Lord knows that you're bad for me
When you left, was a tragedy
Now tell me, why you mad at me?
It's hard to move on happily when everyone's attacking me
But that's as far as I can see
Thought you were a masterpiece but you're just a catastrophe
Now back the fuck up 'cause I just need some space
Gave you my time and you put it to waste
Hate that I'm gone, tell me, how does it taste?
A taste of your own medicine, I wanted you, rejected it
Now look at you regrettin' it
Praying that I let you in
But now there is no lettin' in
These doors stay locked like therapists
So how low will you go?
Just to see me fall?
Yeah, how low will you go?
I don't know
What you want from me, is it the company? 
Is it the luxury? 
Tell me why
Yeah, I don't knowWhen I get low I hate myself
Can't think, can't breathe, can't find my Hell
When I look in the mirror
Don't know who I am anymore
Find a whore just to fill the holes indoors
I just keep on living life
Can't stop, gotta go
Words you say cut like a knife
Got me bleeding slow
What can I say, I'm in love with your type
I can't get enough
It feels like a drug at night
Fiending for your love 
So where should we go?
'Cuz I want to get out of here, I don't care no more
Stuck in my head, feel like a maze
I'm lost and now i'm gonna go get high
I, don't miss the lows, don't miss you either 
'Cuz you a cheater, Jeffrеy Dahmer, heart eatеr
Break me down, smoke me up
I'mma fiend for love but don't tell anyone
'Cuz I know that you're bad for my health, and you kill me slow
But, I hope that you don't, it's too hard to let go
When I get low I hate myself
Can't think, can't breathe, can't find my Hell
When I look in the mirror
Don't know who I am anymore
Find a whore just to fill the holes and doorsI fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure
A quick deal, I need bills, fuck how you feel
Can't trust her, she a fuck up
She a pretty little thing, but ran the luck up
I hope you get a taste of your karma
I know that it will not be much longer
'Til I trust her, and I fuck up
I can't let you play me for a sucker
Now that it is my time she gon' show love
Now that it's on my time, I give no fucks
And it shows
When you act like you don't know me
Can't get close
'Cause if you do I know your homie
I fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure
A quick deal, I need bills, fuck how you feel
Fuck how you feel, got a new thrill
Living life with no level, fuck your life up
Blue-face bills, chasing after mills
Writing 'bout how fucked up my life was
I just wanna chill, give me something real
Something I can feel, I can feel the devil near
Light one in the air, live without a care
Where the plug at? I need some more bud in here
And it shows 
When you act like you don't know me 
Can't get close 
'Cause if you do I know your homie
I fuck up, if I trust her
Can't let her, get any closer
Not over, until I say it's over
Slowly I'm losing myself
I fuck up, if I fuck her
It's over, kick her out the Rover
No closure, leaving with disclosure

Can't trust her, she a fuck up
She a pretty little thing, but ran the luck up
I hope you get a taste of your karma
I know that it will not be much longer
'Til I trust her, and I fuck up
I can't let you play me for a sucker
Now that is my time she gon' show love
Now that it's on my time, I give no fucks
And it shows
When you act like you don't know me
Can't get close
'Cause if you do I know your homieYeah
I got a lot on my mind
All I ever seem to think about is money and time
Reminiscing back when momma said the world could be mine
Now I'm seeing that there's more to life than just you and I Lyrics from Snippets
Baby ain't no surprise
I fell in love with your vibe
Feelings I have to disguise
Baby you run through my mind
All the timeWoah, woah-oh
Woah, woah-oh
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
Started off with nothing, so a nigga started trapping
That money ain't enough, so a nigga started rapping
I ain't giving up, 'til I make this shit happen
And if he talking down, then my niggas get to clapping
'Member back in high school I ain't never had the fashion
Now I'm hopping in my whip and they say that I'm swagging
I ain't 21, but I'm feeling like a savage
Addicted to this money bitch you know I gotta have it
That girl had some ass, so you know I had to grab it
Met her on the Xan, and she started callin' me daddy
Hit it once, then I pulled off in a Caddy 
Diamonds shining on my skin, they keep looking at me
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
I remember back in high school, used to show you lot o' love
You chose another nigga, girl you made me look dumb
So now when I got problems, fuck it I just start to run
'Cause I'm tired of leaving her, girl I thought you were the one
I'm tired of all these niggas talking shit they never done
I'm tired of all these women telling me that I'm the one
I'm tired of people talking down the city where I'm from
Ain't no one and done, make it out and have 'em sprung
I'll make it out and have 'em sprung, yeah
I ain't no one and done, make it out and have 'em sprung, yeah
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
I'm a young nigga, and I'm loving how I'm living
Question of the day, will I have a wife and children?
Will I ever see the day my actions are forgiven?
Got a big heart, but somehow I keep sinning
Oh, somehow I keep sinning
Money got me thinking how much better I'd be living
Hate me all you want, but I always stay winning
Classic is the plot, and oh you know we mean business
Yeah you know we mean business
Mama say she proud, but she hate the way I'm living
Put my city on the map and y'all stand back and witness
Put my city on the map and y'all stand back and witness
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night 
Through the late night 
Yeah through the late night 
Oh through the late night 
Yeah through the late night, through the late night Woah

Be alone

I don't wanna feel no more, I don't wanna be in love 
When I do, it's like a relapse, now I'm on the drugs
I don't wanna give a fuck now, I just wanna live it up 
'Cause you only get one chance, I won't let you fuck it up 
Now I drill without a Cajun
Smokin' on Jamaican
Can't focus, took a Addy my heart racing
Time is money, steady pacing
Lately, I been blazing
Got my eyes real low, misplaced them
Facing with reality
Too messed up, won't feel anything
Can't trust so I won't do wedding rings
Don't say all the things I wanna hear
Every time I gеt a taste, you disappear
I'm low-ow-ow, hold on , you left mе here 
And I know you are holding on to the past in the fast lane
I don't wanna feel no more, I don't wanna be in love 
When I do, it's like a relapse, now I'm on the drugs

Fuck all the phonies and the lies, I do this 'til I retire
They wanna kill my dreams, they try but they couldn't find them
Going up like a balloon, it's bulletproof you cannot stop it
I do this for my team, never been the one to switch it up
Niggas nowadays, be schemin' and picking pockets
Pull up in space city, like I play for the Rockets
Niggas see something new, try they hardest to jock it
First thing that I see, if it fit me I cop it 
If I like it, I rock it 
When you see me, I’m popping 
Getting high, I'm on a plane 
Since you left ain't been the same 
My niggas said they wouldn't change 
I watch these niggas switch they lanes 
I've been swerving through these lanes 
Pain flowing through my veins 
And I ain't do it for the fame 
Don't try to come when I got change 
Nah nah nah nah nah
I watched you switch up, yeah I watched you switch up
She gon' break down like a swisher, don't try to at me on Insta
I had to go turn myself to that nigga

I had to chase my dreams, they got bigger
Hope that they come true, I wake up then I get up
Head to the sky, asking God to forgive us
Woke up today and asked God to forgive us
I got so high I saw God in the distance
Don't fuck with these niggas, so please keep your distance
Done tried everything, nothing new in my system
I hit it once, then it's on to her sister
I think she love me, get harsh to your Twitter
Make a mistake, I send dudes out to get ya
Been blowing so much, I get lost in the vision
Getting high, I'm on a plane 
Since you left ain't been the same 
My niggas said they wouldn't change 
I watch these niggas switch they lanes

        New kid on the block ran away from home, I ain’t going back
There ain’t nothing for me there I swear
Nowadays my style like who cares anymore
I got in my bag and now they want me to break 'em off
I been searching for my ticket now I got it I'm selling
I’m never going back home, never going back no
'Cause it’s a lake full of snakes and an ocean full of girls
That already been around, gotta tour
So I'd rather see the world, than be chasing a girl
One of many mistakes was when I didn’t break you off
Falling for you wasn’t soft, so I had to cut it off
Being 'round you I'ma relapse why we never chill
But I always keep it real witcha, that's the only way I go
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at night
I just can’t help it, I don’t do it on purpose, no
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at night
I just can’t help it, I don’t do it on purpose, no
I’m gone with you, you can have your way
I’m done with you, you gon' have your way with me
I'm gone with you, get out my way, get out my face
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at night
I just can’t help it, I don’t do it on purpose, no
I get high sometimes, it gets lonely at night
I just can’t help it, I don’t do it on purpose, noI just wanna say, hello, girl
I just want a chance, to talk to you, girl
I really want you and I know I just saw you
But baby girl you cannot say that you sauced up
'Cause I go all out and you know I'm a baller
So hop in the whip and we skrt to the mall yeah 
I've been through it all, I've been through it all
I've been through it all, I've been through it all
Now that I'm on, I'm writing this song
Baby I promise, I'ma give you my all
Now I'm cruising, I'm vibing, I'm thinking of you
Cruising down Ocean, I'm riding with you
You tell me 'bout all the shit you've been through
And I swear I relate 'cause I've been through it too
Can't talk about it like this shit is new
See I know you want me and you know I want you

You back in my life and I know it's a testLyrics from Snippets
There's something in your eyes
I can't, let no one too close
The world, seems so full of ghosts
Fucked up, the love I'll never know
, to just be
Paranoid, paranoid
Paranoid, paranoid, paranoidFeels like I'm losing it again
Don't know anybody and nobody my friend
She gon' put me through it again
Fakeness all around me, I can't even trust my own friend
Lately ain't nobody been the same
I know why, 'cause I got a little money now, so I flex
Really think I'm going through it again
Fell apart, in the dark, broken heart in my chest
Anxiety, I feel it taking over it's inside of me
Drivin' for a minute, I can feel it from the inside out
Say you want me but you know it's time to go
Drivin' on a different road, fucked it up, now you can't go
Fucked it up, now I'm in show, even went and chased ya'
What was I doing? Lookin' foolish, fool, I been so clueless
Hate the feeling but I knew what you gon' do
Say you comin' with the truth but I knew that that's a lie, yeah
Rule number one, you can't trust these hoes
They gon' make you feel like shit, and my thoughts goin' crazy
Bitch you turned me to a trip, backbreaker
'Fore I give her scoliosis when I hit
Toolie on my what? toolie on my-
Feelin' broken all the time
You don't even know that you're mine
So I gotta tell you time after time
Just to give you confidence to leave
Feels like I'm losing it again
Don't know anybody and nobody my friend
She gon' put me through it again
Fakeness all around me, I can't even trust my own friend
Lately ain't nobody been the same
I know why, 'cause I got a little money now, so I flex
Really think I'm going through it again
Fell apart, in the dark, broken heart in my chest
Feels like I'm losing it again
Don't know anybody and nobody my friend
She gon' put me through it again
Fakeness all around me, I can't even trust my own friend
Lately ain't nobody been the same
I know why, 'cause I got a little money now, so I flex
Really think I'm going through it again
Fell apart, in the dark, broken heart in my chestYou're overthinking everything
Yeah yeah, I'm feelin' low
You don't even know
Cross my heart and hope to die
You can look me in my eyes, never tell a lie
It get lonely at the time, might do suicide
I just wanna be a star, it's like do or die
Cross my heart and hope to die
You can look me in my eyes, never tell a lie
It get lonely at the time, might do suicide
I just wanna be a star, it's like do or die
I just wanna ball-all-all-all
And she just wanna call-all-all-all
I'mma fuck the whole team and I do not need a stylist
I rock Dior jeans, Saint Laurent in my environment
Blue faces, two faces out in LA
I'm on some shit you don't see everyday
Don't give me no time today 
Say that I been on your mind 
Don't forget, you were playing with my soul
When you left me alone, so lonely
I'm a stoner, loyalty is hard to find
Left me blind, now I tell on what you did
But it's okay, cuz I'm better anyway
Cross my heart and hope to die
You can look me in my eyes, never tell a lie
It get lonely at the time, might do suicide
I just wanna be a star, it's like do or die
Cross my heart and hope to die

        Take a shroom
Wanted love, it was lust, I can't do this no more
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Wanted trust, broke me off, what the fuck was that for
Is it weird I don't feel free unless I'm on the drugs
Damn, VG, you made this?
I can't do this no more
Damn, I think they onto us
Loesoe going crazy
Yeah
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
Wanted love, it was lust, I can't do this no more
Wanted trust, broke me off, what the fuck was that for
I can't do this no more
I can't do this no morе
Baby, you been in my head
Thinking 'bout what I said
Tripping off the shrooms
This the shit I do
Look at how I movе
Everything look like waves, everything go my way
If it don't, I'm upset, 'cause I like to shoot smooth
This some shit, yeah, this some shit
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
Is it weird I can't be me, when I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see, when I'm on the drugs
And if not, just let me be, 'cause I think they onto us
Yeah, wanting love but got no love
I've been going under a lot of stress, lot of pressure
I've been fucking on these thotties, I need something wetter
I've been stashing all the drugs in my fucking dresser
Hope my momma don't find 'em, if she do
Leave me alone
I be all alone
I been in my zone, but not really in my zone
There's a lot to understand
It was hard for me to see, all the things that I could be
But now I'ma let it be, 'cause I'm destined
Keep a Smith & Wesson if they testing me
I guess you can have what's left of me
But just know that I'm lost in another one
Cannot think of you and me if I thinking 'bout me and her
And that's facts, let's just run it back for the hell of it
Thinking 'bout the future, but there is no telling it
I just took some shrooms, now I'm saying how I feel
Maybe I was better with you, well now I don't know now
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
Is it weird I can't be me unless I'm on the drugs
Is it weird I can't be free unless I'm on the drugs
Can you see just what I see? Damn, I think they onto us
They onto us, yeah
