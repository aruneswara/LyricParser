What would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawin' me in and you kickin' me out
You've got my head spinnin', no kiddin'
I can't pin you down
What's goin' on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me
But I'll be alright
My head's under water, but I'm breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I'm around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing
In my head for you
My head's under water, but I'm breathin' fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-oh
Give me all of you, oh
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it's hard
'Cause all of me
Loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginnin'
Even when I lose, I'm winnin'
'Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh-ohTale as old as time
True as it can be
Barely even friends
Then somebody bends
Unexpectedly
Just a little change
Small to say the least
Both a little scared
Neither one prepared
Beauty and the Beast
Ever just the same
Ever a surprise
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh-oh
Hey
Yeah, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh
Oh-oh, ever just the same, oh
And ever a surprise, yeah
Ever as before
And ever just as sure
As the sun will rise
Oh, oh, oh
Tale as old as time, a-a-ay
Tune as old as song, oh
Bitter-sweet and strange
Finding you can change
Learning you were wrong, woah
Certain as the sun
Certain as the sun
Rising in the east
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Tale as old as time
Song as old as rhyme
Beauty and the Beast
Woah 
Beauty and... 
Beauty and the BeastI... Yeah
You fix your make-up, just so
Guess you don't know, that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes a half hour ago
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know
Out of all the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
Spotlights on, everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys, they're wasting their time
Stop standing in line, 'cause you're all mine
And this evening I won't let the feeling die
I never wanna leave your side
Out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, you make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you're what I'm wanting
You don't even have to try
Ooh, you don't have to try
Don't try
Don't try
You don't have to try
Ooh, out of all the girls
You’re my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars, they don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I10 A.M., it’s Ransomnia
She see the dust, it's so obvious
Run from home, after tonight, we up out of here
Don't go home, 'cause they just ran me up out of there
All of those drunken nights, then fuckin' every night
She run her mouth but can't eat right?
Don't read between the line and figure out how to be white
She smelled the line, baby you know you don't need white
Now look what we did now, the cops behind us
Ran that red light, did you have to be mindless?
SMH, we all know that cocaine killed Abel
From the scholar, letters devour this
She stepped into hell, 'cause winter got cold
Don't look in her eyes, you might see straight to her soul
Don't say yes to that good, 'cause you'll never know
'Cause we lost in the city where sin is no biggy
I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
Here is where her heart
I beg for mercy today
They won't take me away
Take me away from you
Don't know what I would do
Don't let us die in vain
Don't let them see our pain
Wash these demons away
Wash these demons away
You are all unwelcome to Sin City
Yet the population still increases its density
And that increases its intensity
Which increases the propensity
To complicate your simplicity
No matter your ethnicity
All for the sake of publicity, in this city
Huh, bad bitches with ass shots
Use a house as a stash spot
Lexus coupe with the rag-top
I'm in the loop, boy I'm tied like an ascot
I used to run with the have-nots
Kept the ave hot just so we could have knots
A lot of niggas see they dreams in a glass pot
Until the judge throw you in that box and watch your ass rot
We broke all the commandments
Authentic, I'm hand-stitched
Come spend a day in my Hamlet
My city lost, some say it's Atlantis
I went to Cannes with a tan bitch, Francis
She rode the broom on the beach, that's a sand witch
So I ate her like it, haters hate to like it
Sex, drugs, and playin' dices, those are our favorite vices
But this life'll take a toll on ya
Well I guess you gotta pay the prices
I know who Christ is and he never hung with the saints
It makes no sense to save the righteous
By the age ten, we were caged in
Now they raise men in the state pen
Fake friends, forgive 'em for they sins
God bless the city, amen
I'm here with open arms and I got her
Here is where her heart belongs
Her heart belongs with me
Here is where her heart
I'm here and I won't go without her
This is where her heart belongs
It should be here with me
And now I'm one of the residents
They walk with none of the repercuss but all of the decadence
And all the fuckin' debauchery
Adult film star, somebody's fuckin' watchin' me
I always feel like, I'm almost Phil like
'Cause I could feel it in the air tonight
I did some wrongs I wouldn't dare to right
And wrote some songs I wouldn't dare recite
But I am willing to share tonight
In the city that is as unfair as lifePulling me further, further than I've been before
Making me stronger, shaking me right to the core
Oh, I don't know what's in the stars
Never heard it from above, the world isn't ours
But I know what's in my heart, if you ain't mine I'll be torn apart
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Love me now, love me now
Oh, I want you to love me now
Something inside us knows there's nothing guaranteed
Yeah, girl, I don't need you to tell me that you'll never leave, no
When we've done all that we could to turn darkness into light, turn evil to good
Even when we try so hard for that perfect kind of love, it could all fall apart
And who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone?
Oh I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
And I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
Love me now, love me now
Oh, love me now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now
Love me now, love me now
Love me now
Oh I don't know how the years will go down, it's alright
Let's make the most of every moment tonight
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I want you to love me now
I don't know who's gonna kiss you when I'm gone
So I'm gonna love you now, like it's all I have
I know it'll kill me when it's over
I don't wanna think about it, I just wanna love you now
Love me now, love me now
Oh, oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh
Love me now, love me now
Love you now
Oh, love you now, oh, oh, oh, ohI was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love
You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love
Oooh, I've never seen anything
It's much more than you and me
Extraordinary machine
Oooh, I've never loved, I've never loved
Never loved someone like this
All I know is...
I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love
You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love
All made for love, we were made to love...
I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love
You were sent for me too
We were made to love
We were made to love
Oooh, have you ever known
We laid your eyes on
The perfect work of art
I knew right from the start
Oooh, I was never sure of a God before
But I know he must exist
He created this...
I was sent here for you
We were made to love
We were made to love
You were sent for me too

You were sent for me tooOh, oh, oh, oh
Girl, I'm in love with you
But this ain't the honeymoon
We're passed the infatuation phase
We're right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehaved
And you made your mistakes
And we've both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie, no
No fairytale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day, oh
Sometimes it's Heaven sent
Then we head back to Hell again
We kiss, then we make up on the way
I hang up, you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, yeah, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay
Maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe another fight
Maybe we won't survive
Maybe we'll grow
We'll never know
Baby, you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah, hey
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey, hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah
'Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh-oh, this time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, oh
This time we'll take it slowI don’t know why I keep moving my body
I don’t know if this is wrong or if it’s right
I don’t know if there’s a beat, or something’s taking over me
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight
I don’t know what your name is but I like it
I’ve been thinking ‘bout some things I wanna try
I don’t know what you came to do, but I wanna do it with you
And I just know I’ll feel so good tonight
Oh, if we keep on dancing
Take our rhythm to new heights
Feel the heat of passion, baby
Light up the night
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
I just know I feel so good
Tonight

Lets get reckless, tear this place down to the floor
Turn the music way up loud
Can’t nobody stop us now
I just know I feel so good tonight
I just know I feel so good tonight
We could start a fire
Come on, let it burn baby
We could start a fire
Let the tables turn baby
We could start a fire
I just know I feel so good
Don’t you know I feel so good
Don’t you know, don’t you know?

Your eyes are seeing straight right through my core
It’s kinda strange, but I like it
Ain’t no reason tryna’ fight it, yeah
Might be Déjà vu
First time we met, but I remembered you
We were creepin’ in the night time
Maybe in another lifetime
Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel right now
Whoo, it’s written all over you
Don’t tell me you don’t feel what I feel somehow

Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and then the breaststroke
Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the bed's broke
So what we gonna do now?
Fuck it, round two now
Work it out, then we cool down
Cool down
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
Luda! Listen
You ain't even gotta text me
Knowing me and you got that mental telepathy
Me be up at the spot, I'll be sending over the chauffeur
Rich nigga, bread stay popping like a toaster
Nobody come close to me and you together
Step under my umbrella
We’ll make it through any weather
Except when I make it storm
Sex in the greatest form
And hibernate under my body
Yep, I keep it warmer than a chinchilla
She know I beat it up like the Thrilla in Manila
Flying my private jet to villas in Anguilla
Then throw you on a grill
Cause seven days a week you’re my five course meal
Baby, tonight's the night I let you know
Baby, tonight's the night we lose control
Baby, tonight you need that, tonight believe that
Tonight I'll be the best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever had
I don't wanna brag, but I'll be
The best you ever hadWhen was the last time we got to be 100% real, ya'll?
I don't want ya'll holding back nothing!
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
We made a lot of magic
It’s the only way we know
Let’s trip the night fantastic
Light it up, tell me more, explore
We love, we love, we love the stars
We could fall so hard
The drinks, the minks, the jewels, the house, the cars
Why’d we ball so hard?
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
We’ve got a lot of nerve, girl
We walk around here like we own this place
See my jewels dripping on my Timberlands
Stepping like a criminal, success is so imminent
Pink champagne, black Rolls Royce
Eggplant double breasted suit from Tom Ford
Bon voyage, left haters in the fog
Look up in the sky, bet you recognize a boss
Look into my eyes as I fantasize for us
Still actin’ shy like this is summer class crush
Money comin’ fast, I’m never in a rush, no
Plus another twenty in the tuck
Semi in the truck, another forty on the wrist
Quarter-mill on my mind got me livin’ like I pitch
Dodging Robin Givens, balling like I’m Roger Clemens
Still in the game, uniform all linen
She get Chanel, ski trips to Vail
Only the highest grade, like trees that I inhale
Yeah, I’m not afraid to fly
Here we are, in the air, barely breathing
And we’re not afraid to die
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Baby, tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
I don’t know about y’all, but I feel good tonight
There’s something in the air tonight
You know, everyone needs someone to look up to
Why shouldn't it be us?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
Who do we think we are?
Tell me, who do we think we are?
This is our song – our song for the futureOoh baby, the day you stepped into my world
You noticed I'm that kind of girl
Who loves her diamonds and white pearls
Oh-whoa, oh-whoa-oh
So tempt me
To jetset away in London, to sip on some tea
You surprise me with gifts from Tiffany
Ohhh 
I love the way we livin' boy
But my daddy say, "You don't need that boy"
So let's run away, let's run away, way-way
Momma say I'm too young for love
And lovin' you is all I'm thinkin' of
My heart tells me that you're the one
It's the feeling you give, it is
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby it's as good as it gets 
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure bliss
I remember, when the pilot closed the door
He said, "It's time for lift-off"
You said, "What'd you choose me for?"
Don't ever wonder, cause you deserve the best
Once you reach the top, you'll never question why you left
Ohh, my world is yours
What you waitin' for?
Let's run away, let's run away!
Our friends, say we're crazy
But we can't listen, baby
They've never had it like this
They don't know what it is
Pure bliss
Like you've got the key to my heart
Simple as a touch and a kiss
Never knew a feeling like this
Pure bliss, pure bliss
Nobody can tear us apart
Baby, it's as good as it gets 
Loving you will never be hard
This is pure blissTalk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you
And you say that you're not worthy
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep forever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you
And you say that you're not worthy
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
When no one seems to notice
And your days, they seem so hard
My darling, you should know this
My love is everywhere you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you 
I will always want the same you, same you 
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart 
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely 
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me 
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
Ooh
Ooh
I won't break your heartHey
I had no intention I would get fucked up tonight
When I looked in your eyes and they went through me like a knife
I came here with my crew, I lost them
Came with my cool, I dropped it
And if I'm being honest, I'm being honest
I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that 
I'm so weak and I'm never like that
Light-speed and I think I might crash
One trip down and I'll never go back
But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 
Maybe it's the music or the red stain on your lips
I wonder when the right time is to go in for a kiss
But I'm thinking past that lover, I'm ready to meet your momma
If I'm being honest, I'm being honest
I can't think when you're looking like that
Can't breathe when you're moving like that
Tell me when you're gonna do me like that 
I wish you knew what I’m thinking right now
I don’t know if I can say it out loud
I don’t know if I can say it out loud
But everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 
Baby, baby, baby
You got me talking crazy
I figure if I say it
You just might be my lady
Baby, it's you, yeah
Baby, it's you, yeah
And oooh, I feel like something good is 'bout to be going on
And baby it's you, yeah
And baby it's you, yeah
And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 
And everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife 
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wife 
Everything's gonna be alright
I think I just met my wife
I know it's gonna be a good night
I think I just met my wifeCan you just stay through the night?
Turn down the bed and the blinds
Before you turn around
Can you just stay through the night?
Let me breathe you in 'til gravity bends
And we fall through the hole in the light
Make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides
Cause I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire, yeah
Know that we're surefire, yeah
Can't keep this bed warm on the left side
When something is cold as a goodbye
Why don't you turn around?
Ignore all that shit from the outside
The world is a nightmare
Wake up and stay here
Let me be on your side
We'll make this our kingdom
Somewhere where good love conquers and not divides
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
Know I won't let the blue flame die
We can't lose hope just yet
'Cause it's once, just once in a lifetime
And we're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefire
And oh my, oh my, oh my, oh my God
I'm so, I'm so, I'm so tired of fighting
Let go, give in, let go and give up, oh
I may not know a lot of things but
I feel it in my chest
If we just let the blue flame die
The devil wins this bet
Oh it's once, just once in a lifetime
And you're scared to love but it's alright
I may not know a lot of things but
I know that we're surefire
Know that we're surefireI really can't stay 
I've got to go away 
This evening has been 
So very nice 
My momma will start to worry 
My daddy will be pacing the floor 
So, really, I'd better scurry 
But maybe just a half a drink more 
What will my friends think? 
If I have one more drink?

It's too good but we never could last

And now we know, life on overload, love, love...
Don't we always make a show of love , love, love, love, yeah...

You'll ever spend alone
Couldn’t wait, did it in the living room

Plans to do it 'til we have a baby

Pick some names, boy or girl
Then we’ll change, change the world
So after you change your clothes

All this shit going down
When will they focus, on this?
Streets ride up with the TV crews
Look ma, we on the news
But they didn't notice, before this
They float above the city lights
Forget the truth, inhale the lies
Just enjoy the show
They see us reaching for the sky
Just ignore that you survive
Maybe we should go
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, they can't keep us out no more
Go to the penthouse floor 
Penthouse floor
All that bubbly, all that wine
Oh man, look at the times
Didn't they notice, notice?
Only future I can see, ain't what it used to be
And I didn't know this, I didn't know this
Once you're above the city lights
Won't want to spend another night, down there on your own
The whole world on display for us
The altitude is dangerous, but we ain't going home
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
Can't keep us out no more 
Penthouse floor
I heard this old joke once, it was like, uh
Knock knock, who there, it's us, us who?
Just us, who dis? Just playin'
Just me, new phone, new hair, new era
I'm in the penthouse, baby
Handpicked from bad apples and bad eggs
Held back, I had to grab crab legs
And then there were only but a few
Conversations held with patience, what a party, what a view
What a dress, what a song
What a beautiful time
My folks downstairs still waitin' in line
They never been in these rooms
Never stayed with these folks
Never laughed at the news, never hated these jokes
So as I fly in my suit, in a group, undercover
Forcin' a new smile, he tells me another
He said "What happened to the boy that climbed up the trunk?"
Then he pushed me off the top and said "Jump, nigga, jump!"
Oh don’t bring me down I need a room up in the clouds
I wanna get there babe, I wanna elevate
Oh my favorite mix, a little ignorance and bliss
In the penthouse babe, go to the penthouse
Go to the penthouse floor 
Go to the penthouse floor 
Let's ride the elevator, it's what we've been waiting for
We'll tear down those penthouse doors 
Those penthouse doors
We'll tear down the penthouse doors 
Baby, I'm in the penthouse floor
Baby, let's ride the elevator
Til we can rise some more
Go to the penthouse floor, penthouse floor Roll Jordan roll

Now if he made you cry, oh, I gotta know
If he's not ready to die, he best prepare for it
My judgement's divine, I'll tell you who you can call

Call up your priest, have him warn ya
Won't be no peace when I find that fool
Who did that to you, yeah
Who did that to you, my baby
Who did that to you
Gotta find that fool who did that to you
Now I don't take pleasure in a man's pain
But my wrath will come down like the cold rain
And there won't be no shelter, no place you can go
It's time to put your hands up, time for surrender
I'm a vigilante, my love's defender
You're a wanted man, here everybody knows

You better call the doctor, call the lawyer
I chased him all away to California
Did my best trying to find that fool
Who did that to youI always believed that love was surrender
And I wouldn't go down without a fight
I always left room for other contenders
'Cause I might change my mind
Damn, I used to be so cold
Would never ever get too close
Didn't ever wanna lose control
But from the moment that I tasted
I knew that I would have to chase it
You said hold up, I want you to be
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
Want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All your loving
All or nothing
Won't you be
A one woman man 
A one woman man, oh 
You made me believe that love was forever
And love could sustain us through every fight
I let go of all of the other pretenders
They were wasting my time
I never thought that I would say this
But I can see us having babies
I could see it from the start
That I might give you my heart
From the moment that I met you
Knew that I would never let you
Slip away, it's okay
You can make me
A one woman man
A one woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing
I can be
A one woman man 
A one woman man, uh 
I could never say I loved you

But you broke in my house
You've stolen my heart
Now I've given you the key
Got all of you for all of me
But baby, I promise to be
A one - woman man, oh
I want you all to myself
Don't want nobody else
All my loving
All or nothing

A one woman man 
A one woman man, uh A little trouble in the city

But these dreams I have of you ain't real enough
Started bringing up the past, how the things you love don't last
Even though this isn't fair for both of us
Ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are
Ooh, these minefields that I walk through
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Ooh, these minefields keeping me from you
Ooh, what I risk to be close to you
Close to you
I didn't notice what I lost until all the lights were off
And not knowing what you're up to, tortured me
Now this might be a mistake, we're broken in so many ways
But I'll piece us back together slowly, oh
Ooh, maybe I'm just a fool
I still belong with you
Anywhere you, anywhere you are

But these dreams I have of you ain't real enoughEvery day I wake and everything is broken
Turnin' off my phone just to get out of bed
Get home every evenin' and history's repeatin'
Turnin' off my phone 'cause it's hurtin' my chest
Hey
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah
But what can I do?
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
All I hear is voices, everybody's talkin'
Nothin' real is happenin' 'cause nothing is new
Now, when all this tragic, and I just feel sedated
Why do I feel numb? Is that all I can do? Yeah
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless, yeah 
But I'm only human
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
Fallin' to my knees, and though I do believe 
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach
And Heaven knows I'm not helpless
But what can I do? Yeah
I can't see the use in me cryin'
If I'm not even tryna make the change I wanna see
I can't sit and hope, I can't just sit and pray that
I can find the love when all I see is pain
I try to do the things I say that I believe 
I can't just preach, baby, preach
Woah-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
I can't just preach, baby, preach

I'm showing you all the cards
Giving you all my heart
This time I'll take a chance
This time I'll be your man

Looking to score a good time
Its not like I planned it
But left empty handed

You're goin' left and I'm goin' right
Its crazy
But I'm still waiting
If I play my cards right
My lucks gonna strike
Until then there's a night
All I wanna do
Is dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream, dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Oh, I dream
Yes, I dream
Dream, dream
Dream, dream
They say that dreams they sometimes do come true
Your star shines so bright
You're the queen of my night
In the daytime not quite
But I'm so glad that I
Can dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
Like lovers do
And it might come true
If I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream, dream
It just might be the only time that I'm with you
When I dream, dream, dream
Dream, dream, dream
Of youSay that you'll stay a little
Dont say bye-bye tonight
Say you'll be mine
Just a little bit of love
Is worth a moment of your time
Knockin' on your door just a little
It's so cold outside tonight
Let's get a fire burning
Oh I know I'll keep it burning bright
If you stay, won't you save, save
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? 
This just might hurt a little
Love hurts sometimes when you do it right
Dont be afraid of a little bit of pain
Pleasure is on the other side
Let down your guard just a little
I'll keep you safe in these arms of mine
Hold on to me, pretty baby
You will see, I can be all you need
If you stay, won't you save, save
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me? 
Oh c'mon
Make time to live a little
Don't let this moment slip by tonight
You'll never know what you're missing
'till you try, I'll keep you satisfied if you stay
Won't you save, save
 x2
Save room for my love
Save room for a moment to be with me
Save room for my love
Save a little, save a little for me
Won't you save a little
Save a little for me 
(Won't you save a little
Save a little for me?)Is that music in my ear
It's like I heard nothing for a thousand years
My eyes were closed, locking in my tears
I was so surrounded but still all alone
A great big house but so far from home
How'd you breathe life in this heart of soul
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
I'm electric, finally exposed
You see through me, strip off all my clothes
If this is falling, then let me go, oh
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
I'm finally awake and I can feel my heart
It's beating like a drum when I'm right here where you are
I can feel it, I can feel it, oh
Can you feel it
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first time
It's like I can feel, it's like I can breathe
It's like I can live, it's like I can love
For the first time, for the first time
For the first time, for the first timeBroken hearts rain on our heads 'til it floods
But I won’t run, I’m with you, that’s enough
Kiss me now so you won’t run
Out of breath underwater
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Girl you can hold on longer
Long as you want
Oh, oh, oh, oh

Swimming and try not to drown

Maybe I should rob somebody
So we could live like
Whitney and Bobby
It's probably my fault
My bad, My loss
You are above cost
All I could do was love you
Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you
Anything you asked me to
But I'm tired of living this lie
It's getting harder to justify
I realize that I just don't love you
Not like I used to
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Holla, holla, hollaaaaa 
Oh! I used to 
Love you 
Oh! But I don't - not you 
Love you

Baby when I used to love you
There's nuttin that I wouldn't do
I went through the fire for you

You're gonna miss me now...cause I
Oh! But I don't - not youIt gets harder everyday
But I can't seem to shake the pain
I'm trying to find the words to say, please stay
It's written all over my face
That I can't function the same when you're not here
Calling your name and no one's there
And I hope one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows
I don't care what people say
They're probably lonely anyway
Baby don't fill up your head with he-said, she-said
It seems like you just don't know. 
The radio's on, you're tuning me out
I'm trying to speak, you're turning me down
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knows
Oh I wish you would understand
Just an ordinary man
I wish that we have known
That everybody knows, that nobody really knows
And I know one day you'll see nobody has it easy
I still can't believe you've found somebody new
But I wish you the best, I guess
Cause everybody knows, that nobody really knows
How to make it work, or how to ease the hurt
We've heard it all before
That everybody knows just how to make it right
I wish we gave it one more try
One more try, One more try, One more try
Cause everybody knows, but nobody really knowsBaby, since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasy of love could really be

Walking on cloud 9

Love in the Future
Not the love I lost

No no no no
Not the love I lost
No noWake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war, and poverty
Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
Cause they're the ones who's coming up, and the world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them the very best you can
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away
Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me
It's the God hour, the morning I wake up
Just for the breath of life I thank my maker
My mom say I come from hustlers and shakers
My mind build-ed on skyscrapers and acres
He said take us back to where we belong
I try to write a song as sweet as the Psalms
Though I'm the type to bear arms and wear my heart on my sleeve
Even when I fell, in God I believe
Breathe the days in
Weave through the maze and the season so amazing
Feed them and raise them
Seasons are aging: earthquakes, wars, and rumors
I want us to get by but we're more then consumers
We're more than shooters, more than looters
Created in his image, so God live through us
And even in this generation living through computers
Only love, love, love can reboot us
Wake up, everybody
Wake up, everybody
Need a little help, y'all
Yes I do, need a little help
Need a little help, y'all ay

Oh Lord, forgive us, honest, we've lost control baby
Nothing can stop this love, nothing can stop this love
Never gon' get enough, nothing can stop it, oh
Darkness and light, streaming, the end of our life beginning
No longer alone, my will become gone, we melt into one
Both hands on the floor, you go low
Who was I before? I don't know
And who am I now? Your body shows how
The past just has no meaning
Don't stop, I need it

Everybody's leaving we'll have some fun
Or maybe it's wrong but you're turnin' me on

Creep to the bedroom while your mama's out
Maybe she'll hear it when we scream and shout
But we'll keep it rocking until she comes knocking

Girl what you playing for, come on

Oooh, know you miss that
What’s wrong let me fix that
Twist that
Baby tonight’s the night I let you go
Baby tonight’s the night we lose control
Baby tonight you need that
Tonight believe that
Tonight I’ll be the best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had
I don’t want to brag but I’ll be
The best you ever had
I hit you with the best stroke
Freestyle and the breast stroke
‘Til you blowing cigarette smoke
And now the beds broke
So what we gon’ do now
Fuckin' Round Two now
Work it out then we cool down
Might not pull your chair out
Calendars I clear out
No relaxers, I pay to grow your hair out
His and her everything pull ‘em pairs out
Them pink pink Louboutin's, pull them reds out
Never sweat air fare when the lear's near
Through the clouds sky blue like a care bear
Your first time you a virgin to these airlines
I don’t mean to brag but compare mine
Roadsters, chauffeurs, take your pick
Have ya kickin’ either two, baby make a wish
Anything you ever wanted you could make a list
The only reason you ain’t got it ‘cuz it don’t exist
Took a chance, hit or miss
Homerun, friends with benefits
We fight and make love I like you better mad
Truly yours, "the best you ever had"They say sing what you know
But I've sung what they want
Some folks do what they're told
But baby this time I won't
When I look through that door
I know the truth from lie
Some things I've done before I can't justify
There are kings in my past
Things no one can be proud of
But I stand in the light I've cast
And turn away from any lack of love
Oh, when I walked through that door
I say here I go
You see me and nothing more
I'm singing what I know
I know better
I know better
Legend is just a name
I know better than to be so proud
I won't drink in all this fame
I'll take more love than I'm allowed
I won't hide or cut it off from where it came
My history has brought me to this place
This power and the color of my face
And I know better
Oh, I know better
Oh, I'll rise from the floor if I don't win
I'll bust open that door so let me in
And if music chooses me to sing I let her
I'll sing what I know, yes
I know better, oh
I know better, yes
I know better
I know betterAhh, Yeah
You fix your makeup just so
Guess you don't know that you're beautiful
Try on every dress that you own
You were fine in my eyes, a half hour ago
And if your mirror won't make it any clearer
I'll be the one to let you know
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world but you
You stop the room when we walk in
The spotlight's on , everybody's staring
Tell all of these boys they're wasting their times
Stop standing in line cause you're all mine
And this evening, I won't let this feeling die
I never want to leave your side
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
You make them shine like they were ours
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
Ain't nobody in the world
You keep wondering if you're what I wanted
You don't even have to try
Ahh, you don't have to try
Don't try, don't try
You don't have to try
Out of all of the girls
You're my one and only girl
Ain't nobody in the world tonight
All of the stars
They don't shine brighter than you are
Ain't nobody in the world but you and I
You and I
You and I
Nobody in the world tonight
Ain't nobody in the world but you and ISo we did it again
Knowing we should quit it, but we simply won't admit it again
Oh it feels good, it's so good, but I won't do it again
It's so dramatic again
After we go at it, we get mad then we go at it again
Oh I love it, then I hate it, she's my favorite
Again I'm wasting time
I can't help it she's so fine
Oh I like her style
And I love the way she talks and I smile
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime, I guess we say bye-bye
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again
So we fake it again
I think we're gonna blow it, and we know it
But she's naked again
We get wasted, then I taste it, then I waste it again
I can't invite her again
Cause she'll go from a lover to a fighter
And I'll fight her again
So it's over, but I told her to come over
Again I'm wasting time
But she's always on my mind
I can't let her go
Oh, she's not the best, but she's all that I know
As much as we may try
Can't quite see eye to eye
So in the meantime I guess we say bye-bye
Oh, and then, we do it again
We do it again and we do it again
Oh, and then, we do it again
We want it again, and we want it again
So I've got a new friend
I wish I could forget you
But I miss you, wanna kiss you again
She's like you, but she's not you, gotta find you again
So we remember again
The middle of December and I took you out to dinner again
Oh I love her, it's not over, just another again
Oh, it's another again-
I love her, it's another again...Yeah, you wanna be loved, yeah
Oh, come on, come on, come on, come on, come on
You wanna be loved, yeah
Listen
Everywhere I go, everywhere I’ll be
I see lonely hearts and falling leaves
Where do those hearts go, do they find their match
Or do they drift away, it’s time to bring them back
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
They wanna be loved, yeah
They wanna be loved, they wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
They wanna be loved
But everybody knows it don’t always last
But if I can’t have it for long, then I want it fast
Better love for now, than for never at all
So baby, if you’re down, give me a call!
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
I wanna be loved, yeah
Alright, c'mon
I wanna be loved, I wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
I wanna be loved
Yeah
La la la la
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved
Yeah, sing for love, yeah!
Yeah, don’t you wanna be loved?
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
Come on, it’s simple enough
You wanna be loved, yeah
Alright
You wanna be loved, you wanna be loved
A little piece to the heart
You wanna be loved, oh yeah!What can you buy with the ultimate sacrifice
If you don't believe in the afterlife?
Oh I still grieve rememberin' what you were like
Now what good is a dream when the dreamer dies?
Some are better than good
Greater than great
Some are misunderstood
And they get told to wait by
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
We're chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark
What if your life was just in the day to day
And after you're gone the world stays the same?
Why should you love what you're gonna lose anyway?
Oh I've imagined one hundred ways
Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
We're chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark
Oh Heaven knows where we are
Chasing the fading stars
Heaven knows where we are
Motioning to the dark
Some are better than good
And greater than great
Some are misunderstood
They get told to wait
Some are just no good
Some will let it just fade
Some are misunderstood
We'll just have to wait, 'cause
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Wanna know who
Who'll be the latest
The latest to fall?
We're marching into the dark
I wanna go marching into the dark
All of the greatest
The greatest of all
Were chasing their fading star
Were chasing their fading star
Who'll be the latest
Latest to fall?

Not afraid that the cold of the winter
Would keep me inside, hey
Ever since mama left me at home
I had to search for a class of my own
And go there in my mind
I had a dream like dr. king
I had a song I had to sing
And I knew it wasn't make believe
When the teacher said to me
Baby, who do you wanna be
Said I don't know but I know that I'm a gonna leave
I'm so gone 
All I do is walk alone 
I'm so gone 
I can make it on my own 
Alright
Everybody wanna follow the crowd
But I belong in the front singing loud
And I'll go solo, hey
But the fame is a hell of a temptress
Not my wife but I guess she's a mistress, oh
Can I let her go
She can play tricks on your mind
Have you leave your soul behind
She's turned some niggas out
But she can't keep her spell on me
She can't keep blackmailing me
I'm free to leave, to be just me
I'm so gone 
All I do is walk alone 
I'm so gone

Better late than you don't get there, do the math
Oh you oughta be grateful
For what you have
Well what if I refuse to learn?
I see a flame, I wanna get burned
How can I blame you
For showin' up at the party?
Lookin' through me in that way
Saw somethin' inside of me break
Saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you
Why's it hard for a man to be satisfied?
Oh, I got one glimpse of the green grass on the other side
'Cause it's all been comin' to this and goddamn I won't be denied
Oh I'm gonna take one more chance tonight
Oh, what if I refuse to learn?
I see the flame grow, I gotta get burned
How can I blame you
For showin' up at the party?
Lookin' through me in that way
Saw somethin' inside of me break
Saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you
Did I know my weakness?
Did I mount all my defenses?
Did I tell you to leave me alone?
How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you?
You saw somethin' inside of me break
You saw me wanna make a mistake
How can I blame you
For takin' over my daydreams?
I wanna scream it, I'm sorry
But I can't 'cause I'm long overdue
Oh I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you
I wanna blame it on you, yeahI may not always love you
But as long as there are stars above you
You never need to doubt it
I'll make you so sure about it
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without you
If you should ever leave me
Though life would still go on, believe me
The world could show nothing to me
So what good would living do me
God only knows what I'd be without you
Oh, oh, God only knows what I'd be without you
Ooh, God only knows
God only knows what I'd be without you
Oh, God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows 
God only knows what I'd be without you
God only knows what I'd be without youOh, yeah
We got a good thing, babe
Whenever life is hard
We'll never lose our way
'Cause we both know who we are
Who knows about tomorrow?
We don't know what's in the stars
I just know I'll always follow
The light in your heart
I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
We know how the story ends
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
It's more than a good sensation
It's more than a passing fling
You are the explanation
Of what love really means
It's bigger than you and me
It's one plus one equals three
When we talk about forever
Then forever's what we mean
So I'm not worried about us
And I've never been
No matter what may come our way
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Stronger than the pain
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah never
We will never
Nah, nah never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No
The world is dangerous
Throw it all at us
There's nothing we cannot take
We will never break
We will never break
Built on a foundation
Strong enough to stay
We will never break
As the water rises
And the mountains shake
Our love will remain
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, nah, never
We will never
Nah, never
We will never
No
We will never
No, never
We will
NoYou don't have to cry yourself to sleep at night with wet pillows
Girl, I know you're hurt
Did you know that you can dry your pillows with your dreams and smile
It really works
Lay your head back in my arms, oh, I know your worth
So just reach inside your heart and pack your bags
And let's leave this earth
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
Let's aim high
You work so hard for your boss, to him it's just work
Never considers your dreams, selfish and mean
Damn, that's gotta hurt
Just lay your head back in my arms, girl
I know you're worth
So allow me to abduct your mind with these words
Open your eyes, you're now a bird
Let's aim high, oh girl
All you gotta do is close your eyes, inhale the sigh and visualize
Let's aim high
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
If you just believe that it's true
Please make no mistake, I'll be there too
You possess the power to do
If you concentrate, mountains will move
And if you just believe that it's true
Make no mistake, I'll be there too
Let's aim highWe've been together for a while now
We're growing stronger everyday now
It feels so good and there's no doubt
I will stay with you as each morning brings sunrise
And the flowers bloom in springtime
On my love you can rely
And I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you
Though relationships can get old
They have the tendency to grow cold
We have something like a miracle
Yeah, and I'll stay with you
Oh I'll stay with you through the ups and the downs
Oh I'll stay with you when no one else is around
And when the dark clouds arrive
I will stay by your side
I know we'll be alright
I will stay with you
And there will be heartaches and pains, yes it will
But through it all, we will remain
In this life, we all know
Friends may come, and they may go
Through the years I know
I will stay
And in the end I know that we'll find
Love so beautiful and divine
We'll be lovers for a lifetime, yeah
And I'll stay with you
I will stay with youHeaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Last night was the worst night
Beginning of the end
Or maybe it began before and here we go again
Things got so dramatic
Things got out of hand
We said words we couldn't imagine
I don't understand
There you go with the same old thing
When things go wrong you always seem to blame me
Now I would like to find what secrets hide in your mind
Where the end will go?
Will I ever know?
Heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Let's make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we can start to dance
Sometimes when we're talking
Words get drowned out by the sound
Let's get back to touching and we'll get back on solid ground
Let's hold hands
Like the young romance
Let's first kiss like the moment we first did
Can we make love like way back in the day, love?
We can lose control, baby don't say no
Heaven only knows
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Will you come back to me? Will you come back to me?
Make this night the best night
It's time for second chance
Turn the beat up on repeat and we could start to dance
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only know
Heaven only know, heaven only knowI've got something new for you
When it hits you won't know what to do
Relax let me move you
Don't resist it's in the air
Just one taste will take you there
Let it flow right through you
I know your getting tired of the same old thing
But I'm gon' break the rules gonna change the game
You'll be screaming my name
And I'm gonna take you places that you've never seen
You couldn't picture this in your wildest dreams
Don't fear cause you're here with me
Let's get lifted
Ohh I'm gonna get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind
We'll get lifted
Your gonna feel it in your soul
And baby you will lose control
We'll get lifted
And once you take a hit of this
You won't ever wanna quit
You'll be so addicted
Then I'll have you spinning round and round
Crazy making freaky sounds
You won't want to come down
And then I'll have you seeing things and hallucinating
Even walking funny 'cause your legs are shaking
All night we'll be blazin'
I'll take you for a walk to the other side
We can get high and enjoy the ride
Hold tight and we'll be alright
We'll get lifted
Ohh I'm gonna get you high
I'm really gonna blow your mind
We'll get lifted
Your gonna feel it in your soul
And baby you will lose control
We'll get lifted
So come and go with me
Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you there
I will show you
Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you there
I will show you
Yeah I'll take you there come on let me take you thereWill you live like me, in a world run by desire?
Will you wake from worldly dreams and not be tired?
Will you work like me to lift the conversation higher?
Will you be cool like water putting out the fire?
How can you be free from all this sorrow?
Will the ones you love today be gone tomorrow?
And if angels don't have answers to your prayers
Oh, I will be there, oh I will be there
And if who you love don't want your love, well then...
Do you cut a deal with love and run again?
You see, love contains the meaning of despair
Will you think like me? Will you  have your mother's fire?
Maybe the way we are will not be how you're wired
Will we do right by you? Will you have what you require?
To make your days on this Earth be not so dire?
Can you choose to lead if no one follows?
And if we fell today, must you tomorrow?
Sanctify your answer not your prayer
Oh, I will be there, yeah, I will be there
Yeah, I will be there
And even when it all becomes too much
When you're growing old and feeling out of touch
Listen to this song and just take care
And know that I will be there, yeah, I will be there
No, I swear that I will, yeah, I promise I will
Little girl, I'm cryin'Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I dont wanna lose a moment
I dont wanna miss a kiss
If i could plan the perfect day, love
Then i would start it just like this
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning
Now baby how can i convince you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love
And i won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning
Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
So warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be
Before We Start The Day Dear
Im Whispering in your ear
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
Was morningNobody's buying
There ain't any truth to it
The fact is you're lying
But I'm getting used to it
Promising we'll stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
I know what I lost before it's gone
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again
Oh, say I'm overreacting
As if you believe in that
But you answer questions
That nobody even asked
Although we may stay together
Down in your heart, you know better
You pictured all the ways that you'll move on
But you just tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old story
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again
I will try to pull the wool over my eyes
You thought it would keep me warm
You said it was cold outside
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Same old stories
Over and over again
Tell me slowly
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Over and over again
Oh, over and over again
Oh, say it again, yeah
Keep on, yeah
Over and overI won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
The first time I slept on the couch, was our first New Year's Eve
I heard words come out my mouth, that I still can't believe
Broken hearts and shattered champagne
We both don't wanna feel that again
The second I apologized, you said, "Boy, I don't know"
I said it 'cause I meant, but you still wouldn't let it go
So I swallow my pride, see it from your side
I promise I'll do the best I can do
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
If I could build a perfect world I'd only make you smile
I'd hang the stars, the sun, and moon outside this room, but I'll
I'll never be perfect, though I'm gonna try
Oh, I'm gonna do better, I swear that I
I won't say I'm sorry over and over
Can't just say I'm sorry, I've gotta show you
I won't do it again, I'll prove my love is true
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry to you
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
The last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry
No, oh, oh-oh 
No, oh, oh-oh
To you
No, oh, oh-oh
No, oh, oh-oh
I hope the last time I said sorry
Is the last time I'll say sorry, to youWe don't have to explain it
The beat is way too loud
Even though the lights faded
I still saw you in the crowd
When I put you in my arm
Feel it all through me
When you promise me nothing
You give me everything I need
She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger
No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
You need somebody too
I need somebody
Don't even know what your name is
When I taste your skin
I don't wanna sound shameless
I just wanna bring your body in
Wanna put you in my place
Pay to hear you scream
You don't even have to stay
Oh but I don't think you wanna leave
She comes over
We're both not sober
It's like we're losing our minds
We kiss like lovers
And Cupid hovers
Like he's just learning to fly
And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless
I'm falling for a stranger, stranger
No need to justify
Looking for a little bit of love tonight
I need somebody
You need somebody too
No need to justify
All I wanna be is your drug tonight

And even though it's dangerous
It's temporarily painless

I'm calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation

Searched for a melody
Searched for someone to lead
We've been looking for the world to change

No more call to war
Unless it's love and peace that we're really fighting for
We can destroy hunger
We can conquer hate
Put down the arms and raise your voice
We're joining hands today
Oh I was looking for a song to sing
I searched for a leader
But the leader was me
We were looking for the world to change
We can be heroes

We should be the change that we want to see

And you're ready now
Say it loud
Scream it out

Sing along with me

If you hear this message, wherever you stand
I'm calling every woman, calling every man
We're the generation
We can't afford to wait
The future started yesterday and we're already lateI just bought a new car
One where the top goes down
So we can see the stars
I wanna take you so far
Out past the Saturn rings
And into my heart
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
I wanna love you
For miles and miles
We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
Lay on the passenger's side
Tell me how fast you want
We'll get there tonight
Oh, oh, oh, fire
You set me on fire
I swear you're the only one
I'd take on this ride
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
I wanna love you
For miles and miles
We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
Yeah
Wanna love you, wanna touch you, wanna drive you 
Oh, wanna love you, wanna touch you

We can go slow
We don't need to rush
I'll take the wheel, make you feel every touch
I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wild
Yeah, I wanna drive you
Wild, wild, wildWhat if I told you
The dreams on the other side
The dreams on the other side
Go there with me tonightThe first time we ever got a chance to be alone we knew
That it was wrong to do
I guess that's why I was drawn to you
The second time leads to the third, the fifth, the seventh time
I feel so alive, it won't last but it's alright
Fleeting joy and fading ecstasy, here it goes again oh
Sneaking fruit from the forbidden tree, Sweet taste of sin
And I'm doing it again; Yes I'm doing it again, oh I'm doing it again I said it would end but here it goes again
This time you told me you saw me at the same hotel
You said you knew me well, and I had a familiar smell
You asked me how am I ever going to put my trust in you
Like you want me to, cause I know what you're prone to do
Accusations fly like bullets do, here it goes again oh
You know me because you're doing it too
The cycle never ends, never ends
Oh you're doing it again
Yes you're doing it again
Oh you're doing it again
You said it would end but here it goes again
And again, and again
Damn I love you, but this is crazy
I have to fight you almost daily
We break up so fast
And we, we make up so passionately
Why can't we just trust each other
You can't hate me and be my lover
Passion ends, and pains begins, I come back...
And we're doing it again
Yes we're doing it again
Oh we're doing it again
We said it would end but
Here it goes again
Each time you call me home in a sweet refrain
Saying things will change, you'll take away the pain
Then we flashback to the first time you put your spell on me
You envelope me, you feel good as hell to me
One moment leads to another few
Here it goes again oh
Oh leaving you is oh so hard to do
I just can't pretend, can't pretend
I keep doing it again, oh I'm doing it again
Yes I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh,oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end, oh,oh, oh
Oh I'm doing it again
I said it would end but here it goes again
AgainIf I could, I'd give you the world
Wrap it all around you
Won't be satisfied with just a piece of this heart
My angel, oh angel
You're my angel, oh angel
Oh, dreams are dreams
Some dreams come true
I found a real dream, baby when I found you
You're so strong but tender too
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angel
You're my angelWhen you’re down, I’m the first to know it
You turn around, then you take aim on me
Scream and shout, I’m not afraid to take it 
We’ve gotta be stronger than pride
We can’t bruise as easily
Hey
Won’t you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
You don’t have to hide your tears from me
Hey
You know I’m gonna
Swear I’ma prove it
Dammit, I’ll do it
Never gone lose it
I know you’ve had it hard
You’ve seen it fall apart
Love is never easy
But, I swear to God
I know I’m gonna
Dammit I’ll do it
I know I can drive you close to crazy 
You’ve seen me battle my demons too 
A beautiful life isn’t always pretty 
But I’ll fight for this love as long as I’m fighting with you 
Hey
Won’t you come and sit down next to me
Put your head on my chest, baby breathe
I’ll give you a reason to believe
Hey
You see I’m gonna
Swear I’ma prove it
Dammit, I’ll do it
Never gone lose it
I know we’ve had it hard
You’ve seen me fall apart
Love is never easy
But, I swear to God
You know I’m gonna
Dammit I’ll do it
All this broken glass is the evidence
We’re not innocent, we still make perfect sense
In the aftermath, I’ll be here after that
And after that
You know I’m gonna
Swear I’ma prove it
Dammit, I’ll do it
Never gone lose it
They’ve never seen before
Two hearts that bleed, it’s true
A legendary love, this I swear to you
I know I’m gonna
Dammit, I’ll do itOh stealing moments just to be with you
Though its wrong its hard to tell the truth, oh no
She don't have to know she don't have to know
When I meet 'cha, I got my shades on to cover up my eyes
I'm hoping that nobody sees me passing by
Through my disguise I still know you recognize
But you I know you got a little secret of your own
Sneaking out with me while your mans at home
You know your wrong but its so strong still carrying on
I go to the other side of town and so I
Never risk the chance will catch her eye
Oh no, she don't have to know, she don't have to know
Oh girl I know your doing the same thing too
But I won't tell your man the things we do
Oh no, he don't have to know, he don't have to know
Someone's watching we got to be careful next time or we're through
But damn it's so stressful doing that dirt we do
So sad but true, and I know one day I'm gonna pay
Then he ask me to sneak out of town for just a day or three
Go to DC and hold hands publicly all through the streets
Cause they don't know you and they don't know me
And oh I'll feel sorry for mistake we've made
There's no reason that we should tell her today
She don't have to know, she don't have to know
Girl oh, though you give a lot of love to me
Girl I know I'm not the only one you see
But he don't have to know, he don't have to know
Oh its getting crazy and I don't want to hurt my baby
And I'll know its supposed to be the last time for you and I
But let's not end this way just wait another day
Oh, I don't want to let you go and I
So I just can't let her go
She don't have to know, yeah, yeah
Oh I told you're doin' the same thing to her
Oh he told, they don't have to knowI realize as I lay down to sleep
We haven't spoken in weeks
So many things that I'd like to know
Come have a talk with me
I need a sign, something I can see
Why all the mystery?
I try not to fall for make believe
But what is reality?
Where do we go?
What do we know?
Life has to have a meaning
Show me the light
Show me the way
Show that you're listening
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Guess it's funny how I say thanks to you
For all you've given me
Sometimes the price of what you gave to me
I can't stop questioning
O God of love, peace, and mercy
Why so much suffering?
I pray for the world, it gets worse to me
Wonder if you're listening
When people go
Why do they go?
Why don't you choose me?
But someday I know
I'm gonna go
I hope you're waiting for me
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over me
Maybe we'll talk
Some other night
Right now I'll take it easy
Won't spend my time
Waiting to die
Enjoy the life I'm living
Show me that you love me
Show me that you walk with me
Hopefully, just above me
Heaven's watching over meOh, I remember this
Ooh yeah
Yeah, yeah
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Where we talk, touch, and each word leads
Back to love that's evergreen
At least that's how it used to seem
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Do you?
I'm a patient man, but in these times
Where we can't dance or compromise
I miss your laugh, I miss your eyes
They're still there in the back of my mind
I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
Ooh, we loved without borders
Ooh, we broke all rules
Ooh, but gravity caught us
Oh, let's go back to the moon
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
Sometimes love can be like this
Sometimes life turns and twists
Through every hit and every miss
You're the one I can't forget
I still remember this
Hold on to every kiss
Some days I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
Ooh, we loved without borders
Ooh, we broke all the rules
Ooh, but gravity caught us
Oh, let's go back to the moon
Oh, I remember this
Yeah, I remember this
Some days, I sit and reminisce
Oh, do you?
Oh, we melted the winter
Oh, we tasted the fall
Oh, but sweet turned to bitter
Oh, like there's no season at all
Oh, I remember this
Say you remember this
Oh, I remember us
Do you?
Do you remember us?
Oh baby
I remember us
Yeah
Yeah
I remember you and I was like lightning and thunder 
Remember that night you met my daddy and mama 
Got drunk for the first time, we laughed all summer
Laughed at Martin, we starved, it was part of the come up
Actin' juvenile to Juvenile, backin' it up
Actin' a nut in the Acura, the number one stunna 
I remember you the same
You made me laugh 'til we cried
Had knots in our stomachs
You remember parties, nights up at the skating rink? 
Goin' crazy, watchin' Kobe win another ring 
We would argue, kiss and make up, then fall asleep 
You went to church with me, singing Kingdom Melodies 
Uh, date nights watchin' old movies 
Halloween, I was Kim, you was B.I.G. in Coogi 
I remember how you laughed when I tripped and fall
Give you the side-eye like, "Baby, that ain't funny at all" 
Then I crack up 
You and I, you know we always had to act up 
Let's back up
My mama didn't like it when we shacked up 
You packed up
Remember love takes practice 
Shootin' in the gym like Kobe and Shaq was 
That's a fact, bruh
Yeah, I remember what Nip said 
Ten toes down, you hit me up? "Hey big head"
I miss your visits 
I still remember your home phone digits
'Cause I could always call on you 
And I hope you remember me too, love 
And I hope you remember me too
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Don't wake me, don't wake me
Oh no, baby, uh
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Don't wake me up, I'm in this dream
Oh, baby, uh
I want to remember us
Oh, do you?You were here, now you're gone
Didn't even get to say, “So long”
Left me here, now I'm ‘lone
You took wings just like a bird, now you gone
Still I can sit here and say
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, we did
 We did, yеah
 And I smile
 As I reminisce
 When we did it big
Me and Philant done kicked the shit in Milan
Wander ‘round six or seven in the mornin'
Remember you said, "We so above and beyond
Don't nobody be on what we on"
Man we gon' be on, I'm second guessin' my songs
You be like, “Man, that shit gon' be gone”
And you were so right, remember they tried to rob you for my bike
We put fire in they life
Man, they were the days
When you played football for Doug, we beat the shit out of Maine
Man, we were so young
With Man and Stanley and Quint, tryna get out of the slums
Knew you so long
For runnin' the halls, with crack in our drawers
It's attempt tryna roll up some weed in your yard
Couldn't even smoke it, we chokin' so hard
Cut to us smokin' in London, Japan
Dropped Urban Legend, we did it again and did it again
I was so mad, phony valet, got you for my C.O
Still you tell me, I laugh
Damn, you went for that one
You say, “Why you laughin'? I bet you, I catch you”
Man, we were so cool
In Hawaii, your fat ass, shirt off, eatin' fruit at the pool
Man, you was so funny
Yellin' we were the shit, we were poor, nigga, fuck up some money
It hurt me so bad
‘Cause I miss you so much, can't say it enough
And my memory just keep takin' me back to a place I hate
I had to give that shit up
But through all of the pain, I smile
Just thinkin' ‘bout how we were doing our thing
Man, we did it big
You were here, now you're gone
Didn't even get to say, “So long”
Left me here, now I'm ‘lone
You took wings just like a bird, now you gone
Still I can sit here and say
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, we did
 We did, yeah
 And I smile
 As I reminisce
 When we did it big
So much I can say about my nigga Cap
Life as I know it, it started that day
I pulled up when you totaled your deuce in the corner
You say, “I was winnin' the race though”
Fifth of Hen' to the face, a four-fifth on your waist
Caught a body, spent millions appealin' your case
While I'm fightin' my own, somehow got you home
So drunk in LA, end up pissin' on Drake, shit
Fuck it, that's still my brother
Since back in the trap house, we had was each other
No fathers, no mothers, just choppers and hustle
Runaway teens, chasin' our dreams
In poverty, servin' these junkies and fiends
Lookin' back though, it wasn't as bad as it seemed
We was a team, me, you and KT
And Day and Jareuse, C-Raw and the 'caine
Remember you repped with JR and got threw from the car
When Dugg shot the pump through the floor in the car
And five-five, not traffic, shootouts with revolvers
Reloadin' in front the police
Still escaped on your feet, folks don't believe it
I tell ‘em, “And neither would I if I ain't seen it"
The shit that we did, faced all our problems head-on
Never ran from it 'fore did a year
Since we was kids, couldn't get a deal
Said we just gon' trap 'til we Master P it
And tears in my eyes, thinkin' right now
'Bout the convo we had the day ‘fore you died
My memory just keep takin' me back to a place I hate
I had to give that shit up
But through all of the pain, I smile
Just thinkin' ‘bout how we were doing our thing
Man, we did it big
You were here, now you're gone
Didn't even get to say, “So long”
Left me here, now I'm ‘lone
You took wings just like a bird, now you gone
Still I can sit here and say
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it, we did it big, yeah
We did it big, yeah, we did it so fuckin' big, we did
 We did, yeah
 And I smile
 As I reminisce
 When we did it bigHmm...
Hey yo nephew check this out man
Now I know you got that bad chick right there
You ain't even tripping off of her
But she doing all of that for you
She got this, she got that, man she's off the hizzle
I mean when you find one like that
You got to make that change man
Cuz they don't come too often
And when they do come
You gotta be smart enough to know when to change
Like Sam Cooke say, change gon' come nephew
And you better believe that
As I look back on all that I've done to you
My biggest regrets, the things that I never could do
I see the light now baby it's shining through
Gotta give up the game, yeah I got some changin' to do
I won't get high if you want it, get that straight
9 to 5 if you want it
Keep my ass home at night if you want it
Whatever you need me to do
When you talk I'mma listen
Give you all that attention you missin'
Girl I swear I'mma handle my business
Just like a real man should do
I can change, I can change 
I can change for you 
I can change,  I can change
I can change for you 
I'll give up all the places I used to go
Stay out the club, stay home because I'm with you
I'll give up all those girls that I used to know
They don't compare, baby I swear it's the truth
So I'm through with the women
Yeah that's right, I give up on the pimpin'
Girl I'm gonna repent from my sinnin'
If that's what you want me to do
I'll get right if you want it
Go to church
Get baptized if you want it
Girl you opened my eyes and I'm gonna
Be much better for you
I can change, I can change 
I can change for you 
I can change,  I can change
I can change for you 
Take me to the river and baptize my soul
I'm so outta control, needing someone to hold
Man it's cold
I ain't been clubbin', drinkin', or smokin'
I'm focused, bowin' down every night prayin' and hopin'
I'm trying to figure out a way
But I just don't know how to say
But I'm rearranging', hopefully I'm changin'
And you can see that baby cuz it's hard for me
Kinda sorta odd for me, but ain't nothing to it
If you need me to do it I guess...
 + 
Yea, I'm willin' to make that change baby
I'm willin' to make that change
I mean, outta all the people in the word
Who would've thought that the big boss dog
Would be willin' to make that change?
Yea you special baby, you real special
You get in the pimp and leave this minks and his cat links and all that behind
All for you, nobody but you
I'm so serious about it, I can change
But only for you
Cause you the type of female, that, you know what I'm sayin'
You bring that out of a playa
Make me wanna lay down the pippin' and step my love game up
Can ya dig that? Yea, on some Romeo and Juliet, ha ha
I can change baby, gimme the room
I can make your zoom zoom go boom boom!
This is legendary shit right here, baby
Gotta believe me 
Gotta believe me 
I'm telling the truth
Get baptized if you want it
This time I mean it
Gotta believe me 
Gotta believe me
I'm telling the truthHave ah piece of body wey every good gyal deserve
But I won't allow this girl to mess with my nerves
Blessed figure, not to mention the curves
Through the corner of her eyes she slowly observe 
Any time she come around
Something is about to go down 
Listen to the siren sound
Wake up, wake up right now
'Cause if I was to go to sleep
Might catch me dreaming of a way to creep
Trouble always seems to follow me
Oh, don't follow me now
I tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go
So I had to walk on by 
She's flashing me them pretty brown eyes 
Though there's green grass on the other side 
All I can say is hi , listen, listen right now
Any time she hear the beat
She be dancing right in front of me
Trying to lure me in-between the sheets
But I'm a man and I still get weak
But I'll be damned if I lose my girl 
But I'll be damned if I don't touch her 
Curiosity, it killed the cat
Oh, and I don't want that, so
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
She said nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go
So I had to walk on by 
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes 
Though there's green grass on the other side 
All I can say is hi , listen, listen right now
I couldn't let you pass even if I try
Have a bird in the hand, why chase one in the sky?
Sexy female refuse to comply
Plus she is an empress who want ah stand-by
Been receiving love but she can't satisfy
Would like to have my cake and even enjoy the pie
Politely decline like me shy
Honey say me soft, come on, give it a try
Look in ah me eyes with seductive eyes
Filled with deception, trouble and lies
And I don't want no more problems in-a me life
Asked me fi me number so that we could enjoy the night, she wanna come over
Tried to tell her no, no, no, I already have a friend
Oh, nobody has to know, but I've got to let her go
So I had to walk on by 
Flashing me them pretty brown eyes 
Though there's green grass on the other side 
All I can say is hi , listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right now
Listen, listen right nowI don't wanna be what you want me to be
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
It's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
In the back of my mind I question why I keep calling
I guess I'm just used to getting my way I'm spoiled
I don't wanna be what you want me to be 
So when I call you're just yelling at me
I'm sorry it's my fault
Oh, the clothes I bought you could still wear 
Did you store the cards and teddy bears 
See there I go again sticking my nose
I'm sorry it's my fault 
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Girl talking to myself in the mirror is strange enough 
So you gotta know sharing this with you is painful, yeah 
You know we used to talk about our future
It ain't just all my fault 
So say goodbye to the way the leaves would fall 
The way we stand in the rain and we would bawl 
Just say goodbye
To the walks and talks and the dark in the park
And it ain't just all my fault 
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
We lost a four leaf clover
Don't ask why shorty be over
News flash shorty we over
We like Def Jam and Hova
We like Bobby and Whitney
Except without the kiddies
Like Pamela Anderson's career
Except without the titties
We had some good times didn't we
I know I won't forget that
But we had some bad times and
That's time I wish I could get back
We coulda had it all
But I guess we'll never know
You been around me long enough
To know that now it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Now what do you keep calling for
It's over, it's over
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh hey
Nothing we can do with it
So we might as well forget it
Like we never ever did it, oh heyHey, yeah
La-da-da, da-da
La-da-da, da-da, la-da
La-da-da-da-da, here I go again
With another love song that I wasted
Just another love run out of patience
She don't want it, she don't need it
Every other word coming from my pen
She throw back in my face, saying, "Where you been?"
I sound so poetic, but it feels like I let it slip away, slip away
I wanna show my love is strong
Make her feel it when I'm home
No fakin', no mistakin'
She can feel me when I'm gone
That actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong
La-da-da-da-da, here we go again
Just a couple of friends with some benefits
She gave me all of her love, then I waste it
I wrote a new song, then erased it
Oh, every other thing that I've said before
Said she don't wanna hear about it anymore
I feel so creative, but it feels like there's nothing left to say to make you stay
I wanna show my love is strong
Make her feel it when I'm home
No fakin', no mistakin'
She can feel it when I'm gone
That actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than, speak louder than, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrong
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da away
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, word I say
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da-da away
La-da-da-da-da, la-da-da, all day
She don't wanna hear, don't wanna hear a word I say, word I say
Actions speak louder than love songs, speak louder than love songs
The melodies, they carry on
Actions speak louder than love, woah, speak louder than love songs
I've been doing it all wrongWhen you're weary
Feeling small
When tears are in your eyes
I will dry them all
I'm on your side
Oh when times get rough
And friends just can't be found
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
When you're down and out
When you're on the street
When evening falls so hard
I will comfort you
I'll take your part
When darkness comes
And pain is all around
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me down
Like a bridge over troubled water
I will lay me downWhat goes underneath your armor
Underneath your clothes
Do you know?
Let's find out together
Let's find what we're looking for
We'll explore
Leave your house of mirrors, hear me out
Fear no consequence, forget your doubts
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, start
Fall into the sea of possibility
And hope
We're letting go
Float away with me
Until we can't see any coast
That we know
Hold on tight until we become one
Find our island underneath the sun
I don't know where the road leads
You don't know if I'll break your heart
And we don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah
Our beloved beside us
All you want to give up
Only happens if we let it live
And I don't know where the road leads
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
You don't know if I'll break your heart
We don't know how the winds will blow
And we won't know
We won't go unless we start
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, start, yeah
Oh unless we start
Ooh, oh, let's start, yeah
Unless we startRemember when I caught your eye
You gave me rainbows and butterflies
We did enjoy our happiness?
When our love was over
I was such a mess
I smiled at you
And you smiled back
That's when I knew
Theres no turning back
You said you loved me
And I did too
Now though it's over
I still love you
You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start
I tried to fight it
I tried so hard
And every day
I pray to god
That you and me were meant to be
But you had another
You had a lover
And now is gone
I don't know why
I feel like crying
Just want to die
I can't look at you
And you know why
No, I tried so hard
To catch your eye
You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the start
You're in my mind
You're in my heart
I wish I knew right from the start
All my friends said you break my heart
A heartbreaker right from the startYeah-yeah, ooohhhhhhhhh
So many hard times
Yea-yeahhhhhh, ooohhhhhhhhhh
Yeahhhh-yeah-yeah-yeah, yeah-yeahhhh
YEAHHHHH, yeah-yeah
YEAHHHHHHHHHH
Cold, cold eyes upon me they stare
People all around me and they're all in fear
They don't seem to want me but they won't admit
I must be some kind of creature up here having fits
From my party house, I'm afraid to come outside
Although I'm filled with love, I'm afraid they'll hurt my pride
So I play the part I feel they want of me
And I pull the shades so I won't see them seeing me
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found
Yeah, yeah, yeah
In my party house I feel like meeting others
Familiar faces, creed and race, a brother
But to my surprise I find a man corrupt
Although he be my brother, he wants to hold me up
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found
Check it out, seventeen years and counting
Of tryna climb up the rough side of the mountain
Friends warned me I'mma have to do it without them
No problem really, it was never about them
So my house, I never come out from
Cause every day a drought, then a shadow of doubt come
I'm down to do whatever if it betters my outcome
The city's like the Audubon Ballroom waiting on Malcolm
Cause people wanna see my blood flow like fountains
I got nowhere to go and still feel like bouncing
I'm looking for the closest window I can rap from
Or for the highest speaker-box that I can shout from
And I'm hoping to feel like something is real
But it's no hope when you are but a spoke in a wheel
A brick in a wall, tryna find an opening still
Having hard times, tryna climb over the hill
Yeah, so many hard times, yeah, yeah
Sleeping on motel floors, yeah, yeah
Knocking on my brother's door
Eating Spam, Oreos
Drinking Thunderbird baby, yeaaaaaaahhhh
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found
Having hard times, in this crazy town
Having hard times, there's no love to be found

Gabrielle, that was her name
Everyone was smiling, dreamin' through their tears, under a spell
But in Gabby's eyes, nothing
I asked do you not like the music?
She says it's alright
But she dances to her own sad tune, she said
Take me away from here
Take me somewhere where love is like breathing
I don't care where we go, long as I'm there with you, baby
Long as I'm there with you
I could tell, she's been through pain I could only dream
Nightmares to live where you live
Tears well in her eyes, but she wouldn't let them fall
I'd give the world to know where her smile is
I asked will you dance with me now
Let me try to figure out
The fastest route out of town and she says
Take me away from here

All my niggas in the front say
All my bitches in the back say
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah!I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much difference
The end will come, everyone shut down, pageantry, and parade
Stripped of all its significance
Your brothers eyes, were in disguise
As she agonized, trying to live just beside you
When someone finally tells you when
Your final home will lie
You step out, look around, and see if true love's still inside you
I'm not singing much, you don't already know
I just hope I'm giving voice to a song that's worth singing
Melody and harmony can electrify your soul
Give you all that you need
When the judgement bells are ringing
I'm drawing lines from your home to mine
Making up for lost time
Cause there's not that much differenceOoh, in the winter's chill
Let the candles light the night up from the windowsills
Ooh, as I draw you near
And we whisper all the sweet sounds only we can hear
On the coldest evening in this December
I hold you in the heat of the glowing embers
Let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywherе
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Ooh, let thеre be peace on earth
Let the lonely join together, let them know their worth
Ooh, let the children know
There's a brighter day ahead, let's hold on to hope
And on the coldest evening in this December
Let us pray the spirit of love will linger
Oh, let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Glory, glory, glory I'm so glad to have you here
And may this Christmas moment last for years
Let the world stand still, the church bells ring
Silent night as the angels sing
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Let the magic warm the moonlit air
Hear the choirs join in singing everywhere
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah
Hallelujah, Hallelujah
Hallelujah, HallelujahYeah

Won't ever give it up 
We got a one-way ticket love
We ain't going no place but up
Nothing can stop this, uh

We got a bigger love 
I don't wanna think about nothing
The world feels like it's crumbling
Everyday, another new something

Don't seem like my old lady
Let's go and play the song we used to play
Can we reignite the flame
'Cause things just ain't the same
We can talk about the baby
We can talk until we're crazy
We can focus on it now
Or we can focus on it later
We can start another fight
We can argue and fuss all night
But I propose that we go to the floor
And we slow dance
Tonight I wanna dance
Can you do that with your man yea
Tonight I wanna groove
And let the music make you move
Move, yeah

On that old school radio
Let the music soothe your soul
Forget about the world

I pray that I would see the sun
Cause life is so burdensome
When everyday is a rainy one
But suddenly there's no more clouds
And I believe without a doubt
That heaven sent an angel down
Then she turned my life around
You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...
Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war 
Just love and grace
Baby you restore my faith
I know the struggle's not in vain
You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cause
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cause we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright, it's alright
Oooh...

Baby baby we can get so high
So high yeah, so high yeah
You so conscious and self aware
I'm next you, I hold your back
And you express pure ecstasy
Its more than just the sex to me
Cause mentally you take me
Yo, I pretended to be unaffected
You intended to be respected
I commend your focus, you did fear to be rejected
So you approached me while other men remained intimidated
Glad you did cause once you came
You got much more than anticipated
And its true
I got the mind of a genius
And every time we kiss
We feel the magnetic field we got between us
I think its something to witness your vulnerability
The definition of a real man he can acknowledge how he feels for me
I'm fascinated with your manhood exploration
You transparent language, how you articulate the situation
And I can see it in your stare, in your air
I love the texture of your hair
Statuesque black and beautiful like classical architecture
Yeah
Baby since the day you came into my life
You made me realize that we were born to fly
You showed me everyday new possibilities
You proved my fantasies what love could really be
Let's go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of a cloud we're floating away
Ooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Maybe later we could go up to the moon
Or sail among the stars before the night is through
And when morning comes we'll see the sun is not so far
And can't get much closer to god then where we are
We'll go to a place where only lovers go
To a spot that we've never known
To the top of the clouds we're floating way
Ooh this feels so crazy, oh this love is blazing
And baby we're so high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
So High
My shoes are scraping the sky
So High
You got me up so high
Oh
My shoes are scraping the sky
Oooh, yeah
Ooooo-ooh oh
Oooh this feels so crazy, how this love is blazing
Baby we're soo high, walking on cloud nine
You got me up so high
You got me up so high
You got me up so high

So highOh, do you remember 
When the family was everything? 
Oh, do you remember? 
It was so long ago and so much has changed 
I wanna go back 
Wanna go back to those simple days 
I wanna go back 
But now we've grown and gone our separate ways
Times is hard 
And things are a-changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change
Do you remember 
Back at Grannie's house on Christmas Day? 
Help me sing...
Do you remember 
How we'd gather 'round and sing all day? 
And I wanna go back 
To playing basketball and football games
I wanna go back 
To yesterday but it's not the same
Times is hard 
And things are a-changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to change
Times is hard 
And things are a-changin'
I pray to God
That we can remain the same
All I'm trying to say is our love don't have to change
No it don't have to changeMy grandmother suits was tailor made, Sundays Mahalia played
Simple familiar ways, like how she kneeled and prayed
Wailin', master forgive us, our trust, pastors had us real afraid
I never listened yet I still obeyed
I got to see how Philly played at such an early age
What my father was into sent him to his early grave
Then moms started chasin that base, like Willie Mays
My childhood was all of 40 nights and 40 days
Trouble was my ball and chain, shorties would call me names
Humble beginnings but a star is what it all became
My journey from a dirty hallway, to the Hall of Fame
Music my therapeutic way to cope with all this pain
Was headed for the drain, soakin before the rainwater came
And chaos, into the order came
I started doin' what I'm 'sposed to do in life
Tryin to move out of the dark, and closer to the light
They say if you get a chance to do it, overdo it right
Tomorrow isn't promised every time, you say goodnight

A mother prays for his return
I just called to see
If you still have a place for me
We know that life took us apart
But you're still within my heart
I go to sleep and feel your spirit next to me
I'll make it home again
I pray you'll fall in love again
Just say you'll entertain the possibility
I learned enough from my mistakes
Learned from all I didn't say
Won't you wait for me
It may be long to get me there
It feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that I'll be coming home
We fight to stay alive
But somebody's got to die
It's so strange to me
A new year, a new enemy
Another soldier gone to war
Another story told before
Now it's told again
It seems the wars will never end
But we'll make it home again
Back where we belong again
We're holding on to when
We used to dare to dream
We pray we live to see
Another day in history
Yes we still believe
It may be long to get me there
It feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that I'll be coming home
Coming home 
Coming home  
You know that I'll be coming home
Coming home 
I'll be coming  
You know that I'll be coming home
I'll be coming home
Won't you lift me?
Won't you pray for me? Yeah
I'll be coming home
It may be long to get me there
It feels like I've been everywhere
But someday I'll be coming home
Round and round the world will spin
Oh, the circle never ends
So you know that I'll be coming homeWhat would I do without your smart mouth?
Drawing me in and you kicking me out
You got my head spinning, no kidding, I can't pin you down
What's going on in that beautiful mind?
I'm on your magical mystery ride
And I'm so dizzy, don't know what hit me, but I'll be all right
My head's under water but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges both
All your perfect imperfections both
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
How many times do I have to tell you?
Even when you're crying, you're beautiful too
The world is beating you down, I’m around
Through every mood
You're my downfall, you're my muse
My worst distraction, my rhythm and blues
I can't stop singing, it's ringing in my head for you
My head's under water, but I’m breathing fine
You're crazy and I'm out of my mind
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you
Cards on the table, we're both showing hearts
Risking it all, though it’s hard
'Cause all of me loves all of you
Love your curves and all your edges
All your perfect imperfections
Give your all to me
I'll give my all to you
You're my end and my beginning
Even when I lose, I’m winning
Cause I give you all of me
And you give me all of you, oh, of you

I'll dry your eyes. Fulfill your heart's desire
Let's go in. Try again
Careful this time. Broken promises linger in our mind
I'll give in completely. Hearts break so easy
I know. Believe me. Oh, I've tried
But my arms can hold you. My kiss console you
I'll come and love you tonight
And I...
I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes
But this feels right
You...
You love, you love, you love
Though you've been burned
You still return
Come and share my house, my home, and all I own
I'd love to give to you
Aren't you tired of going along this lonely road?
It takes its toll on you
Give me your emotion, your heart's devotion
Give anything you like
And I'll give understanding. Life's so demanding
I'm all you need to get by
And I...
I love, I love, I love
Love hurts sometimes
But this feels right

Hey, hey

Always reaching out in vain
Just taking the things not worth having
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
You say your style of life’s a drag
And that you must go other places
But just don’t you feel too bad
When you get fooled by smiling faces
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
When you get off your trip
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry bout it
*scatting*
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the side when you check it out
When you get off your trip
Everybody needs a change
A chance to check out the new
But you're the only one to see
The changes you take yourself through
Chorus:
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout a thing
Pretty Mama
Cause I'll be standing on the sides when you check it out
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don’t you worry 'bout a thing
Don't you worry 'bout it

Now here's a happy ending to believe in
You're always there for me, now you're with me in my dreams
It's got me wondering if you ever dream of me
I don't wanna risk losing everything
But I'll take the chance and tell you what I'm thinking

Let me love you nightI wish I knew how it would feel to be free
I wish I could break all the chains holding me
And I wish I could say all the things that I should say
Say 'em loud, say 'em clear for the whole world to hear
I wish I could share all the love that's in my heart
Remove all the bars that keep us apart
And I wish you could know what it means to be me
Then you'd see and agree that every man should be free
I wish I could give all I'm longing to give
And I wish I could live like I'm longing to live
And I wish I could do all the things that I can do
Though I'm way overdue I'd be starting to move
Well, I wish I could be like a bird up in the sky
How sweet it would be if I found I could fly
Well, I'd soar to the sun then I'd look down at the sea
Then I'd sing cause I'd know
Yes I'd, sing cause I'd know
Sing cause I know
I know how it'd feel, yeah
Yes I know how it'd feel
Oh, I know... {*fades out*}Oh news said it
Oh yea
If I had twenty million dollars in a vault somewhere baby
It wouldn't matter anyway
'Cause the doctor told me that I'm dying slowly
So I guess I got to love you while I'm here baby
Did you know?
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country warring
Leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower, baby
Nowhere to go, oh I
I know we just met but baby
Could you love me quickly? Quickly!
I, want you to love me like you know
The world's about to end baby, Quickly!
]
You said you didn't even know my name, but
Told me that we might as well make ours the same
What do you think baby? 
Vegas might as well be light years away, oh
We just better land on the stars
Before they come crashing down
Cause I heard the news said
]
The news said that the sky is falling
The globe is warming
My country warring
Leaders are lying
Time is running
Lower and lower, baby
Nowhere to go, oh I

, oh oh yea, like the world's about to end baby
Love me 
The news said the sky is falling
Quickly now, 
Love meWhat a wonderful world
I see trees of green, red roses too
I see them bloom for me and you
And I think to myself, what a wonderful world
I see skies of blue, clouds of white
The bright blessed day, the dark sacred night
And I think to myself , what a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin'by
I see friends shakin'hands, sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying "I Love You"
I hear babies cryin', I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself , what a wonderful world
What a wonderful world
The colours of the rainbow, so pretty in the sky
Are also on the faces of people passin' by
I see friends shakin'hands sayin', "How do you do?"
They're really saying, "I love you"
I hear babies crying I watch them grow
They'll learn much more than I'll ever know
And I think to myself , what a wonderful world
Such a wonderful world...Love the lie and lie the love
Hangin' on, with a push and shove
Possession is the motivation
That is hangin' up the God-damn nation
Looks like we always end up in a rut
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Slaughterhouse is killin' hogs
Twisted children killin' frogs
Poor dumb rednecks rollin' logs
While tired old ladies kissin' dogs
Hate the human, love that stinking mutt
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
The President, he's got his war
Folks don't know just what it's for
Nobody gives us rhyme or reason
Have one doubt, they call it treason
We're chicken-feathers, all without one gut
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Church on Sunday, sleep and nod
Tryin' to duck the wrath of God
Preacher's fillin' us with fright
Tryin' to tell us what he thinks is right
He really got to be some kind of nut
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Tryin' to make it real - compared to what?
Where's that bee and where's that honey?
Where's my God and where's my money
Unreal values, crass distortion
Unwed mothers need abortion
Kind of brings to mind ol' young King Tut 
Tried to make it real - compared to what?!Frogs gonna leap
Gators gonna bite
A gray wolf pack is gonna rule the night
A mountain lion's never been afraid of heights
But it's better when you can fly
 gonna play
The rooster can cock-a-doodle-doo all day
Catfish can swim, but I bet they'd say
It's better when you can fly
The view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape
I'm not sly like a fox
Don't sting like a bee
A grizzly won't ever run away from me
I think of all the things they could never see
It's better when you can fly
The view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape
I'm not sly like a fox
Don't bite like a flea
A grizzly won't ever run away from me
I think of all the things they could never see
It's better when you can fly
Oh, the view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
The blues come 'round, they won't get me down
I can make my escape
Oh, everybody sings
But not like me
The air's much better here above the trees
Look up in the sky, I'm a sight to see
It's better when you can fly
Oh, the view from the blue sky
It looks so good when you're up high
Oh, but when I'm down, won't you come around?
Help me make my escape
No matter how high a crow can go
There's gonna come a time when he's brought down low
Oh, hit rock bottom, and I just don't know
If it's better when you can flyHere we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
We'll find a love to hold our hand through the cold
We'll find an angel lying out in the snow
We'll see a light to lead us all the way home and
Wherever we go, we will know
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
Let's raise a toast to all the good days to come
Let's celebrate the season, come everyone
Let's save a kiss for us when the night is done
Oh my love, I'll keep you warm
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars
All the lost and lonely
All the lovers holding on
All of us, no matter what we've done
We are not alone although we're far apart
We are one, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Here we are, under the stars
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Heaven is not so far
Under the stars

I'll write a song
I thought about it for far to long
But I never had someone to sing about
Until I met her and each days get better

Nobody else understands me like she
Now there I know what true love means
I Just hope she stays with me
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go

I just can't leave her, no
She wants to breathe
She wants to be where the grass is green
She wants to know how love supposed to be
She wants it better
I want to let her know
She belongs right here with me
She's heard it all but I'll make her see
I'll make her fall
Make her believe
I promised her that I'll never leave
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go
Oh no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no
Each kiss gets sweeter
I just can't leave her, no

Tell her I don't wanna leave without her
Tell her that I would build my world around her
Deeper and deeper
Sweeter and sweeter
I'll never leave her alone
Where do we go
Who knows
But each day gets better
I just can't let her go

Oh, oh, ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh
I miss you most of all
When autumn starts to fall
When the sun sets early
When nights are getting long
And I hear our favorite song
Playing each memory
I'm trying to fall asleep
Just to see if you'll keep me company in my dreams
You, you've been out of reach
All the letters I send keep coming back to me
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me
Please reach across the sky
Take the early morning flight
I haven't moved since you've gone
Hope you still remember how
To get back in my house
Hope it ain't been too long
Oh, I'm trying to fall asleep
Just to see if you'll keep me company in my dreams
Oh, if you find a way to me
I can find some ways to make you never ever leave
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me
Ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
Ooh
La-la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la, la-la
I'm ready, I'm ready
If you want me, come get me
I'm ready, so ready
If you want me
Ooh, ooh, baby
You know that I'm ready, baby
What do I have to do?
Oh, you know where I am
Baby, come on over now
Come on, ooh, come onI happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
You should've seen the way she wore her dress
And her white stiletto shoes
You should've seen the way they looked on her
Just like the ones that I bought you
I searched for days on end to no avail
'Til I found them in Peru
She must've been to Lima just as well
Because she had them too
You should've seen her eyes, her lips, her face
She looked as sweet as honeydew
You should've seen the way she walked away
Oh, she swayed her hips like you
I was only several steps from her
But she never noticed me
I took another sip of fine liqueur
It was quite a sight to see
I happened to notice a girl in a light shade of blue
I happened to see her, the sight of her leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
You should've seen the way he stroked her hair
And the smile that lit her face
You should've seen the way he kissed her lips
Did it have the same sweet taste?
Though my mid, it might be running wild
In constant search of you
It's funny how my eyes keep seeing things my heart
Would not believe are true
I happened to notice a man in a dark shade of blue
Who happened to be with a woman who leaves me confused
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
She may not be you
But she looks just like you
Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, she looks just like you
Maxine, MaxineBaby, I can't wait for late December
The smell of cinnamon and pine
But we'll be taking out the Christmas timber
And hanging up the fairy lights
We can have a party, you can sing the carols
We're not going out at all
I got everything I need right here
There's no one else I need to call
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down 
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
La la la, la la la la
La la la, la la la la
Cozy up right by the fireplace and watch our favorite movies play
Cooking up a feast for kings and queens
Our castle is our sacred place
And we can have a party, dancing to the carols
We're not going out at all
I got everything I need right here
I know we're gonna have a ball
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down 
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Make a Christmas vow 
All we need is now 
All we have is us, we're more than enough
Now we made this house a home
A beautiful world of our own
Do this every year, we're not leaving here
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Let the snow fall down 
We're snuggled up inside
We got love with us, it's a good Christmas
'Cause there's no, no place like home at Christmastime
Oh, no place like home at Christmastime
Yeah, no place like home at Christmastime
Sing it with me, y'all, come on
Hey, no place like home at Christmastime
No place like home at Christmastime
Oh baby, feels good to be home
Feels good to be home, yeah
There's no place like home, there's no place like home
Cooking meals, baby, yeah, oohI wonder, wonder wonder
Why your eyes they wander?
I wonder, wonder wonder
About the spell that you are under
Tell me its some hocus pocus
Made to lose your focus
I wonder why the cold kiss and you think I wouldn't notice
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do  you do
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you
I wonder if it's over, middle of October
I don't know why in autumn, she keeps giving the cold shoulder
She knows how much I love her don't know what I could have told her
I wonder why she makes me think I didn't even know her
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do  you do
Why don't you give me 
Give me your love 
Is that too much to ask you can I
Get some satisfaction from you
You don't love me like you say you do
You don't want me the way that I want you
You don't love me like you say you do  you do
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
Can I get me some satisfaction
That's all I'm asking you, you, of you
Give me the magic back, that's all I ask of you
Can I get me some satisfaction

Tu zafacón, de besos escondido
Y prender el alba
Y amasar la noche
Y salir contigo
Disfrazado de horizonte
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, quisiera
Quisiera ser el asa de tus ojos
El calcio que te dan tus vitaminas
Tu ruta cuando cruzas la neblina
Y el cordón umbilical de tus zapatos
Y contar contigo y doblar las calles
Y sembrar guayabas
Y soñar con mil detalles
Revelar tus ojos
Celebrar tú nombre
Y salir contigo disfrazado de horizonte
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera, quisiera
Oh, Quisiera, quisiera
Whoa, oh, quisiera
Ooh, ooh, quisieraWhere did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon 
I'm searching for the lover I knew
Have you seen her?
Where did she go?
Feels like I've just lost my only friend
Flames subsided, colors faded
Love just got so complicated
Wish that I could see her smile again
So if you see her out there, tell her I'm still here
Waiting for the day when she will reappear
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon 
Maybe I was wrong and I
Ignored her for too long and I
Didn't even notice when she slipped away
Maybe while I lay fast asleep then
Out into the night she creeps
I'll leave the light on, so she'll come back someday
So if you see her out there, tell her it's not fair
That life's just not the same when she's not here
Where did my baby go?
I wonder where she ran off to
I miss my baby so
I'm calling but I can't get through
Please tell that girl if you meet her
That someone's longing to see her
Where did my baby go?
I wish that she would get back soon Shake, shake, quiver, quiver
Been awakened by a cold shiver
Winds blow and change, change
Sweet rushing through my veins
Good lord, I just might die
Taken over by the high tide
Feel the rain against my skin
Drown my soul in the water again
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Let the water make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me, mmm
Shake, shake, shoulda learned
Get too close and I might get burned
By the sweet heat, the sweet lies
So betrayed by the look in your eyes
Good lord, I know so well
I wanna get to heaven with a taste of hell
Still on my lips and down within
Quench my soul in your water again
Oh, in your water again
Come on and move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
Let the water make a move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me, mmm
Give me two hands I can hold
I'll tell you things I've never told
If you move on me
If you move on me, oh ah
I need something I can feel
Something pure, something real
Move on me
Make a move on me
Make a move on me
Won't cha make a move on me
Won't cha make a move on me, yeah
Make on move on me
Move on me
Move on me
I think you oughta make a move on me

Not like she used to
Everything that she don't do
That's what I want, what I need
Sinking rapidly
And that's when you sail through
Let me sail away with you
Everything that she won't do, you do for me
Say what you say 
Floating away 
Baby, I was drowning in my sorrow

We're floating away 
Now I see the solemn of horizons

It's all left up to us, to change this present situation 
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake 
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate
Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look what happened to the Indian and the brother
 {*3X*}
Hope of the world is in our generation 
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation 
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for 
If they want people killed, let them fight the war!
It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace
Our generation 
It's all left up to us 
Our generation 
Let's do just what we must
And straighten it out! 
Gotta straighten it out! 
Straighten it out! 
Yeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!
As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless - can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do
Our generation 
It's all left up to us 
Our generation 
Let's do just what we must, and straighten it out!
Our generation - straighten it out!
Let's straighten it out - and straighten it out!
Heyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!
C'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out
Hey hey, we'll straighten it out
We'll straighten it out - straighten it out
New York City, better straighten it out
Atlanta, better straighten it out
In Los Angeles, you better straighten it out
We can straighten it out, we can straighten it out
{*fades out*}{*23 seconds of instrumental to open*}
They wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Ooooooohhhhhhhhhh
Aowwwww
So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on  let 'em shine, on
Ohhhhh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, ohhhhhhhhhhhhhh
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em live  let 'em shine on
Let 'em be loved  let 'em shine on
Let 'em growwww  let 'em shine, on
C'mon let 'em love  hey
C'mon let 'em love  hey hey hey yeah
C'mon let 'em love  YEAH-HA-HEAH
C'mon, YEAH-HA-HEAH-HA-HEAHH
Hold 'em close, let 'em know
That they'll get through the night
Ordinary people could, be a hero
Don't put out the light!
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on {*2X*}
Yeah
Yeayyyyeahhh
Let 'em shine onSoftly they fall, where do they go?
Cover the ground, without a sound
Fall from the sky, before your eyes
Blankets of white, brighten the night
They seem to say, that our love is here to stay
We'll be cozy and warm until summer flowers bloom
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
Drifting on air, without a care
Cover the ground, without a sound
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you
Yeah, the snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Here in our midst, we're surely blessed
Over the heat, gee ain't life sweet?
Drifting on air, without a care
Cover the ground, without a sound
I'm sure that snowflakes, fall from the gloom
I will always remember this night here with you
Yeah I say snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
Pretty purple snowflakes, snowflakes, pretty purple snowflakes
I got you here in my armsMerry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Merry Christmas pretty, baby
You sure did treat me nice
Gave me a diamond ring
For Christmas
Now I'm living in paradise
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, woo
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure did treat me nice, woo
Gave me a diamond ring
For Christmas
I'm living in paradise
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine y'all
Got good music on my radio
Well, I'm feeling mighty fine
Got good music on my radio
I wanna kiss you, baby
Standing 'neath the mistletoe
Well, alright
Ain't that the truth now
Santa came down the chimney
About a half past three
He left these pretty presents
That you see before me
Merry Christmas, baby
You sure been good to me
I haven't had
A toddy this morning
But I'm lit up
Like a Christmas tree
Hey, Merry Christmas 
And a happy new year 
Merry Christmas 
And a happy New Year 
It's so nice being with my baby
It feels so good being with you
Said, merry Christmas and a happy New Year
Now, now, now, now, merry Christmas  
Give love on Christmas day
Even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Give love on Christmas day
There's no greater gift than love, love, love
Merry Christmas babyStreet cars always get in the way
Daylight interrupts our starry gaze
She goes seems we ran out of time
But the memory left a picture on the canvas of my mind
So I'll wrap myself in the thought of her smell
Wish of our lips
Locked in a kiss
She floats in to my bedroom every night
Close my eyes
She's alive
Here comes the morning but I'm all alone
Dreams of a love I'll call my own
Dreams of a love I've never known
New day, same hot sun on the street
And I say I wonder if we'll ever meet
There she goes
Taxi steals her way
I keep tellin myself I'll find her love
I come back everyday
I still wrap myself in the thought of her smell
Wish of our lips
Locked in a kiss
She floats in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes
She's alive
Here comes the morning but I'm all alone
Dreams of a love I'll call my own
Dreams of a love I've never known
Dreams of her love
Will they ever come true?
Am I a fool to dream of you?
You float in to my bedroom every night
I close my eyes and your alive
Here comes the morning and I'm still alone
Dreams of her love I'll call my own
Dreams of her love I've never known
Dreams of her love I'll call my own
Dreams of her love I've never knownGood morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Before you get into the shower
Before you worry about your hair
Baby give me one more hour
I want you to stay right there
I dont wanna lose a moment
I dont wanna miss a kiss
If i could plan the perfect day, love
Then i would start it just like this
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning
Now baby how can i convince you
I'll make it so you can't resist
Whatever else you have to do now
It can't be half as good as this
I'll chase you underneath the sheets, love
And i won't let you get away
The day won't be complete, love
Unless we get a chance to say
Good morning
Good morning love
It's my favorite love song
I waited all night long
Good morning morning
Good morning love
Before we start the day dear
Im whispering in your ear
Good morning
Open your eyes
See my son rise
I feel you're skin
So warm inside
Day breaks so sweet
When you're next to me
So stay each night
So each morning will be
Before We Start The Day Dear
Im Whispering in your ear
Let's get lost together
I will smile forever
Was morningWhen I think about the messes I've made
Think about the rest of my days
I wonder if you'll stick with me or walk away
I think about all of my faults
Will you love me just because?
Do you believe that we could last forever, babe?
Why don't we go all the way? 
All the way 
All the way
I hope we go all the way 
I hope you do too
I do, I do, I do, I do 
I hope you do too
Oh, I hope you do too 
I do, I do, I do, I do 
I hope you do too
Ooh, I hope you do too
When I think about every time 
That your eyes light up like mine 
I know I want that feeling every single night
Am I crazy to think that you
Could ever want it as bad as I do?
I need it more than you could ever realize
Why don't we go all the way? 
All the way 
All the way
I hope we go all the way 
I hope you do too
I do, I do, I do, I do 
I hope you do too 
I hope you do too 
I do, I do, I do, I do 
I hope you do too 
I hope you do too 
Do you, do you, do you?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
Do you, do you, do you?
'Cause I do, I do, I do
I do, I do, I do, I do 
I hope you do too
I hope you do too 
I do, I do, I do, I do
I hope you do too
I hope you do too
Why don't we go all the way? 
All the way 
All the way
I hope we go all the way 
I hope you do too, ooh          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        I made them laugh, I made them cry
But now the rain clouds all on the inside
They don't know how it feels to know how I feel
I try to escape from everything that is real
Hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing
Day by day creating in my imagination
The well has run dry of all my ideas
Silence so loud, have to cover my ears
I'm closing the door, it's hurting too much
I'm runnIng away from everything I can touch
To hide in my imagination, there is always magic waiting
Never counting time, always on my mind
There's a place that only I see, far away from all that I see
Inch by inch creating, in my imagination
I can stop it all from hurting
With this mind, I can stop the world from turning
Don't know how it feels to know how I feel
I try to escape from everything that is real
I can hide in my imagination, safe inside my contemplation
Never out of time, somewhere in my mind
There's a place where I'll be landing, far away from where I'm standing
Day by day creating in my imaginationYou know you ghetto boy, when you got a face, with a scar
And yo' highest aspirations is a place, and a car
Shorties pull out and bussssst, like a money shot
Now he on the run, he hot
And he hurtin his Granny and she the only one he got
The hood so shady
You give up hope, of ever even tryin to find a sunny, spot-
-light, they caught him at the stop-
-light, but if he woulda run that yellow
Then he coulda, run the globe
But insteed, with speed
They put one in the middle of his frontal, lobe
Like a unicorn
I'm just tryin to keep you, informed
To my little ghetto soldiers in they, gold
Green, red, and blue uni-forms - chuuch!
But I'm feeling like the loneliest monk
So I pull me a Thelonius Monk and blew, the horn
And we don the monikers of goons and gangsters
And are trained to conduct ourselves true, to form
So we add a Shorty, a Money, a Mack
A Lil', a Eazy, or a Young to our name
So all the big ballers grab rims and hung, in the game
And there's a degree, of difficul-ty
To make it from the ghetto boy into the man-hood
Especially when you know that yo' fresh greens
Will help eliminated a canned, good
Can, good, and bad co-exisssst?
In a place with plenty of off ramps but no ex-itsPeople making lists, buying special gifts
Taking time to be kind to one and all
It's that time of year when good friends are near
And you wish you could give more than just presents from a store
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
People you don't know smile and nod hello
Everywhere there's an air of Christmas joy
It's that once of year, when the world's sincere
And you'd like to find a way to show the things that words can't say
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, the man on the street and the couple upstairs
All need to know there's someone who cares
Give love on Christmas Day
No greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, every little child on Santa's knee
Has room for your love underneath the tree
Give love on Christmas Day
Oh, no greater gift is there than love
What the world needs is love
Yes, the world needs your love
Why don't you give love on Christmas Day?
Oh, even the man who has everything
Would be so happy if you would bring
Him love on Christmas Day
No greater gift than love, love, love
Merry Christmas, babyOoh-laa, ooh-laa

Draped in your finest clothes and accessories
I notice you've been focused on the stress of the week
But it's Friday tonight
Spend the night out with me

No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You look you're ready and right

Our hands are sky high
From left to the right
Don't look that the time
Just let it fly by
We live the good life
And we'll do it right right
We'll do it right right
Ain't too fast or slow, it's just enough to get down
Might be from the country but were going to town
This weekend we can freak a leek all on the floor
First get low, then come close
Let the music control, oh
Let's hit the party tonight
That will be out of sight
No matter where we decide, it's gon' be on tonight
You look you're ready and right
You showed me out of sight
We're coming home late tonight

It's the end of the night
Now it's just you and I
It's time for us to take this party back home
Let's hit the party tonight

Yes, we'll live the good life
And we'll do it right right
Then we say bye bye
Then we say bye bye
Bye bye
Bye bye
Bye byeAll through the year we've waited
Waited through spring and fall
To hear silver bells ringing
And winter time bringing the happiest season of all
Chestnuts roasting on an open fire
Jack Frost nipping at your nose
Yuletide carols being sung by a choir
And folks dressed up like Eskimos, oh
Everybody knows a turkey and some mistletoe
Help to make the season bright
Tiny tots with their eyes all aglow
Will find it hard to sleep tonight
They know that Santa's on his way
He's loaded lots of toys and goodies on his sleigh
And every mother's child is going to spy
To see if reindeer really know how to fly
And so I'm offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas to you
And so we're offering this simple phrase
To kids from one to ninety-two
Although it's been said many times
Many ways, merry Christmas merry Christmas, merry Christmas to youWhen the night has come

So darlin', darlin', stand by me

And sometimes you see a little mad
Can always be an angel
When every things goes wrong you seem to be bad
I'm just a soul who's intentions are good

With a joy that's hard to hide
Most of the time

Life has it's problems and I've got in more my share
And that's one thing I never mean to do

Won’t you come right over?

And I ain't got nothing to say
Come on in the morning
I go to bed feeling the same way
I am nothing but tired
Mand I'm just tired and bored of myself
Hey there baby
I could use just a little love
You can't start a fire
Can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for fire
Even if we are just dancing in the dark
Messages keep getting clearer
Radio's on and I'm moving around the place
I check my look in the mirror
Want to change my clothes, my hair, my face
Man, I ain't getting nowhere
Just living in a dump like this
There's something happening somewhere
Baby, I just know there is
You can't start a fire
You can't start a fire without a spark
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You sit around getting older
There's a joke here somewhere and it's on me
I'll shake this world off my shoulders
Come on, baby, the laugh's on me
Stay on the streets of this town
And they'll be carving you up, all right
They say you gotta stay hungry
Hey baby, I'm just about starving tonight
I'm dying for some action
I'm sick of sitting around here, trying to write this book
I need a love reaction
Come on, baby, give me just one look
You can't start a fire
Sitting around crying over a broken heart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
You can't start a fire
Worrying about your little world falling apart
This gun's for hire
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Even if we're just dancing in the dark
Hey baby!I'm a thousand miles away, it's not snowing in LA
But I'm falling just the same, I'm sorry
All the flights have been delayed, I've got nowhere to stay
But if I can find my way, I'll hurry
Just hang up the Christmas lights, and I'll do the rest tonight
Just tell the kids I'm coming, I swear that I'll be running
And under the Christmas tree, together, yeah, we will be
I promise
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas Eve
And I know it's all on you, keep it together like you're glue
And everything you do, I notice
So I'll bring presents, I'll bring wine
The mistletoe for you and I
And I'll be there just in time to show it
Just hang up the Christmas lights, and I'll do the rest tonight
And tell the kids I'm coming, I swear that I'll be running
Under the Christmas tree, together, yeah, we will be
I promise
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas Eve
Whoa, I'll find my way back to California
I'll follow the map, yeah, somewhere warmer
I'll carry my bags just until I can hold you again
I'm gonna walk, if I have to run
I'll stand on the highway and stop someone
I'll cross the deserts and oceans, a river that's frozen
I'll follow the stars just to find where you are
You can count on me
Make a wish, close your eyes, and believe
I'll be home, home, home, home, home by Christmas EveHey girl, I love you so
And it's so sad that we can't even talk, no, we can't even talk, no

Nah, listen, we can't talk no more, blood
'Cause you never ever really understood, blood
My heart was open but you stepped right on it
You never saw that I was up for being number one, but listen

Never the type to give you brain, I'm givin' you knowledge
We be like old school, I seen you fucking with some other birds
Yep, I let you roll right through

And nah, and all the time I was wondering what was wrong with me
Because you left me a mess like I was bored silly
I would've done anything to see you smile at me
But all you did was treat me like a stepchild, really
I could've done a lot of shady things in the slide
Like cut your car tires, put a hit out on your life
But, uh, something said don't do it, something said give him a chance
Said love will go through it, so now I say in advance
Please don't talk to me, please don't call my phone
You have no idea how I'm feeling, so
Let's keep it bygones, we ain't good for each other
We're not friends and I regret that we was even lovers
Uh uh, so don't be shocked when you see me
Thinking that we're cool to talk, now I'm on the TV
Calling up my mom and asking her if she seen me
But you ain't real enough to see me

And It's so sad
That we can't even talk no, we can't even talk no

Oh, all these things and more, darling
That's what Christmas means to me, my love
Oh yeah, yeahThey wait to plead their case, unknown cast aside
I love to see their face, can we spare the lie?
Are we afraid to see them, prisoners of history
These beautiful minds, trapped inside, bring them back to life
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine, let 'em shine on
So dark when I see sparks, if we don't snuff 'em out
We've gotta let 'em flame, let 'em speak their name
Let 'em reach up to the clouds
Can't eat if we don't feed 'em, can't read if we don't teach 'em
There's no light if we just hide 'em
Don't just let 'em die
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Oh let 'em shine on  let 'em shine on
Let 'em shine on  let 'em shine, on
Oh sparks flicker, in the distance
Lonely out in space
They sing out, but we're not listening
Cause we don't see their face
We can't let 'em die we can't, make 'em hide
All the little miracles that live inside
Let 'em shine, oh
Let 'em shine  let 'em shine on
Let 'em live  let 'em shine on
Let 'em be loved  let 'em shine on

But what have you added to this world so far
Check out your mind, and see what the answer is
And tell me how much did you give
Ah don't give in

In the air there's a feeling of Christmas
Children laughing
People passing
Meeting smile after smile
And on every street corner you'll hear
Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling,  hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day, ah
Strings of street lights
Even stop lights
Blinking bright red and green
As the shoppers rush home
With their treasures, yeah
Hear the snow crunch
See the kids bunch
This is Santa's big day
And above all the bustle you hear
Oh they're playing
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling,  hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas day, ah
Soon we will come together
We'll learn to love each other
Just like those silver bells playing
And people around the word can dance to the sound
Of Christmas day
Silver bells, silver bells 
It's Christmas time in the city 
Ring-a-ling,  hear them ring 
Soon it will be Christmas, come on now
Yeah, soon it will be Christmas, woah
Christmas, Christmas day, yeah
Soon it will be Christmas day, yeahBells will be ringing the glad glad news
Oh what a Christmas to have the blues
My baby's gone I have no friends
To wish me greetings once again
Choirs will be singing "Silent Night"
Oh, Christmas carols by candlelight
Please come home for Christmas
Please come home for Christmas
If not for Christmas by New Years night
Friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
Oh this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of year to be with the ones you love
Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
Because I'll be happy, happy once again
Oh there'll be no more sorrow, no grief and pain
And I'll be happy, Christmas once again
Mmm, yeah, ah, ah, yeah
No more sorrow, no grief, no pain
Because it's Christmas, Christmas once again
Oh, friends and relations send salutations
Sure as the stars shine above
Oh this is Christmas, yes, Christmas my dear
The time of the year to be with the one you love
Then won't you tell me you'll never more roam?
Christmas and New Years will find you home
There'll be no more sorrow, no grief, no pain
Because it's Christmas, Christmas once againAll the trees alight, all the holly streaming
The town has come to life, waiting for Christmas
I still feel low, searching for some meaning
Until you come home, I'm waiting for Christmas with you
Christmas without you, a long, dark shade of blue
I feel like I've been waiting here forever
All the gifts arrive, all the children singing
Gathered 'round the fire, waiting for Christmas
I could sing along, but I can't find the meaning
The melody feels wrong, I'm waiting for Christmas with you
Oh, when I see your face on this Christmas day
I'll know the light of love brought us together
But until that hour, my eyes will be wide open
I'm like a little child, waiting for Christmas
When that morning comes, we can count our blessings
It was worth it all along, waiting for Christmas with youYou with the sad eyes
Don't be discouraged
Oh, I realize
It's hard to take courage
In a world full of people
You can lose sight of it all
And the darkness inside you
Can make you feel so small
But I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow
Show me a smile then
Don't be unhappy, can't remember when
I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You can call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
And don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbow
Can't remember when I last saw you laughing
If this world makes you crazy
And you've taken all you can bear
You call me up
Because you know I'll be there
And I see your true colors shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let it show
Your true colors, true colors
True colors are shining through
I see your true colors and that's why I love you
So don't be afraid to let them show
Your true colors, true colors
Are beautiful like a rainbowWrap me up in your love, wrap me up in your love
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
Let's enjoy the holiday, be here and now, this time and place
Laughter while the children play
These memories, they'll never fade
Let them open every gift, and while they do, we'll sneak a kiss
And, baby, when the day is through, my only gift is you
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas
Wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hoping I've been good enough
Oh, you know just what I want, yeah
So wrap me up in your love
Ayy, we don't need no mistletoe
I'll kiss you, love, everywhere you go
There's nothing left here but the tree
The fireplace, and you and me
We'll pour another glass of wine
It's almost midnight, this is our time
And we won't even feel the cold, we can let it snow
Wrap me up in your love this Christmas, wrap me up in your love
You've been at the top of my wish list
Hoping I've been good enough
You're the only one I want, yeah

So I went hard like Medusa staring at me
I told her, "Let's go, let's blow this lame nigga factory"
She said, "What kind of girl do you think that I are?
The kind that you meet in a bar?
You think you can get whatever you want 'cause you some kind of star"
No, I'm a comet; I just want you woman
Hey, if I were you then it would be me that I'd go home with
Three, the one and only, one thing you ain't considered
I heard you when you told your girl, "Ooh, he can get it" - admit it
You did it! Let's hop a cab, and split it
I'm kiddin'! We both going to where you livin'!
HAH! I got you giggling like a piglet - oh, that's the ticket?
I hope you more like, Anita Baker, than Robin Givens
No, I don't know that lady, so let me quit it

Bright copper kettles and warm woolen mittens
Brown paper packages tied up with strings
These are a few of my favorite things
Cream-colored ponies and crisp apple strudels
Doorbells and sleigh bells and schnitzel with noodles
Wild geese that fly with the moon on their wings
These are a few of my favorite things
Oh
Girls in white dresses with blue satin sashes
Snowflakes that stay on my nose and eyelashes
Silver white winters that melt into springs
These are a few of my favorite things
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad
When the dog bites, when the bee stings
When I'm feeling sad
I simply remember my favorite things
And then I don't feel so bad

Love right now, love brother
Love right now, love...I pray for better days to come
I pray that I would see the sun
Cuz life is so burdensome
When everyday's a rainy one
But suddenly there's no more clouds
I believe without a doubt
That heaven sent an angel down
And then she turned my life around
You know and I know
Friends come and friends go
Storms rise and winds blow
But one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright
Oooh...
Now peace is so hard to find
We're terrorized and victimized
But that's when I close my eyes
And think of you to ease my mind
You take me to another place
There's no more war 
Just love and grace
Baby you restore my faith
I know the struggle's not in vain
You know and I know
Through all the battles
Baghdad to Israel
There's one thing I know for sure
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz
I'm so warm inside
You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Alright it's alright
Oh...
When it's cold outside
There's no need to worry cuz

You give me peace
When the storm's outside
Cuz we're in love I know
It'll be alright
Alright it's alright
Oh it's gonna be alright

In the middle of the storm
When it's cold you're keeping me warm

I'm never gonna leave
You give me what I need
It's alright, alrightQuisiera ser el canto que te anima
Quisiera ser el rizo de tu pelo
Quisiera ser tu séptimo sentido
Quisiera ser el sueño de tu ombligo
Oh, oh
Quisiera, oh oh, oh oh
Quisiera
Quisiera que me hablaras cuando callas
O al menos ser el nudo en tu garganta
Quisiera ser la silla que te aguanta
Tu zafacón, de besos escondidos
Y prender el alba
Y amasar la noche
Y salir contigo
Disfrazado de horizonte
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, quisiera
Quisiera ser el asa de tus ojos
El calcio que te dan tus vitaminas
Tu ruta cuando cruzas la neblina
Y el cordón umbilical de tus zapatos
Y contar contigo y doblar las calles
Y sembrar guayabas
Y soñar con mil detalles
Revelar tus ojos
Celebrar tú nombre
Y salir contigo disfrazado de horizonte
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera
Quisiera, y tantas cosas más quisiera, quisiera
Oh, Quisiera, quisiera
Whoa, oh, quisiera

We could fall in love
Let's fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love
I see you, know you see me too 'cause you're slowin' down
Put some extra pep in my step now
I'm tryna be cool, make you turn around and check me out 'cause
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, the thing is
We should fall in love
We could fall in love
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love
Let's go slow, we got all the time we could ever need
We could catch a movie and probably
We could get together more frequently
I still believe that
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, the thing is
We should fall in love 
We could fall in love

Who the king of New York? And don't say Trump
Nas the name, I used to holla at dames
Let 'em ring the bell at the stock exchange
Put 'em in Chanel, her Reeboks were lame
Had her front row at the boxing ring
What happened to you, girl? You're not the same
Top floor , we're not playin'
Feelin' better than I ever did
Nothin' negative, ****** talk rhetoric
I'm a soldier of love, 
More life, Frank, only do it my way
It don't matter what the blogs say, I go hard like ain't nobody signed me

We should fall in love 
We could fall in love 
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in loveI know you think I'm like the other man
You let him in and then he breaks your heart again
But this thing is more than physical
I free your mind and I bless your soul
Tonight we're gonna lose track of time
Body and spirit will intertwine

But the fire is so delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought some corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
When we finally kiss good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you really hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying
And, my dear
We're still goodbying
As long as you love me so
Let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
He doesn't care if it's in below
He's sitting
By the fires glossy glow
He don't care about the cold
And the winds that blow
He just says, let it snow
Let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
Ooh, wee, goes the storm
Why should he worry
When he's nice and warm?
His girl by his side
And the lights turned low
He just says
Let it snow, let it snow
I don't care
Oh, the weather outside is frightful
But that fire is, mmm, delightful
Since we've no place to go
Let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
It doesn't show signs of stopping
And I've brought lots of corn for popping
The lights are turned way down low
So, let it snow, let it snow, let it snow
Let it snow
When we finally say good night
How I'll hate going out in the storm
But if you'll only hold me tight
All the way home I'll be warm
Fire is slowly dying

We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love
I see you, know you see me too 'cause you're slowin' down
Put some extra pep in my step now
I'm tryna be cool, make you turn around and check me out 'cause
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, I'm thinking
We should fall in love
We could fall in love
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Let's fall in love
Let's go slow
We got all the time we could ever need
We could catch a movie and possibly
We could get together more frequently
I can't believe it
We walk by each other daily
Something 'bout today says maybe
The street signs, the city lights
All the stars can lead me to you
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, I'm thinking
We should fall in love 
We could fall in love 
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Just fall in love
Ohh, let's fall in love
I said let's fall in love
Ohh, just fall in love
In love
Stars, moonlit sky
And you know, if it's okay with you
Let's go, go to some place that we don't know
Don't need a reason, baby
It might be crazy, I'm thinking
We should fall in love 
We could fall in love 
We could fall in love
Beyond the stars and the moonlit skies
Just fall in loveWhoa, oh, yeah
Time is gettin' harder and harder
More and more each day, yeah
Still I am determined that I'm never gonna change my way
Thinking 'bout love the way it should be
You gotta open your eyes and you will see
About love the way it should be
You gotta make up your minds and you'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa
What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
Coming from out of their mouths
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
We gotta open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa
Whoa, yes, yeah!
What happened to the love
That they are all talking about?
It's nothing but useless words
That are coming from out of their mouth
Talking 'bout love the way it should be
Open our eyes and we will see
About love the way it should be
We gotta make up our minds and we'll advance humanity
Humanity, humanity, humanity, whoa

YeahVerse 1:
I think I messed up this time
I let you go and I can't get no sleep
The thoughts going through my head
What I should have done instead
I'm trying to be free
I thought I'd get over you
I'm finding its hard to do
And I'm so confused
I don't know
Chorus:
Why does it hurt so bad
How come I just can't let you go
Cause I shouldn't feel this sad
But I can't help it, I miss you so
Verse 2:
But I had to run around
I couldn't settle down
I was chasing my dreams
And I sit here by myself
And now you're with someone else
When It should be me
I thought it get easier
I said I didn't need you
And I can't believe I was wrong
Vamp:
Said it hurts so bad 
Said it hurts me so bad 
Hook:
I wish you would come around
I wish we could work it out
I wish you were here
But you're goneIf this world were mine, I would place at your feet
All that I own, you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
And you'd be always beside me, be all that I need
If this world were mine, I'd give you anything
If this world were mine, I would make you a king
With wealth untold you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
Oh baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, all you gotta do is call me
Oh baby, you are my constellation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me
The way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me more
The way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me
Every sky would be blue as long as you're loving me, baby
When I'm here in your arms, life is so wonderful, my love

If you believe...Pennsylvania! Some of you know I spent my formative years right here at the University of Pennsylvania. I'm a proud Penn alum, but don't hold me responsible for the behavior of all of our alumni. Some of them, you know, they slipped through the cracks.
Anyway, we've got to get down to business Philly. Tomorrow, Pennsylvania will determine not only who becomes the next President, but who we are as a county. This has been a difficult year. So many of us have experienced pain and struggle and loss. We've lost friends and family members, jobs and paychecks. Just last week we lost another black man, Walter Wallace Jr., right here in Philadelphia, to police violence. A man with mental health needs, who just like so many other Americans wasn't able to get the care he needed.
So yes, we've lost a lot, but Philadelphia, what we haven't lost is our ability to decide what happens next. In this election, you vote will decide whether we're a country that allows this pandemic to continue indefinitely or one with a plan to end it. A country where the president can go to court to kick 20 million people off of their healthcare or one where healthcare is a right for all Americans. A country where the president actively encourages police brutality and cannot bring himself to condemn white supremacists or neo-Nazis or one where we hold our police accountable and begin to root out the systemic racism in our society. A country that is small, mean, selfish, and divided or a country that is big, generous, kind, and decent. A country where we remember that while we may have different politics and different beliefs, we are all Americans. And that's why I already voted for Joe Biden and Kamala Harris.
Joe Biden will be a president who doesn't take pleasure in dividing us, but one who works hard to bring us together in common cause and common effort, a president guided not by wishful thinking, but by belief in science and a commitment to justice.
Now, some people see the meanness, the bullying, the selfishness of Donald Trump and they mistake it for strength, a kind of twisted masculinity. Some see his greed and they mistake it for being good at business. Some of your former favorite rappers have been taken in by these lies. I think they've even founded a new supergroup. It's called the Sunken Place.
But Trump's Platinum Plan for black folks is nothing but fool's gold because you can't bank on a word he says. Ask the students of Trump University. Ask all of the contractors he stiffed. Ask the people his charity was supposed to help before it was shut down for being a fraud. Ask all the black and brown Americans who are dying from this virus and losing their jobs under his watch. The president isn't strong. He's a coward and his career in business and in government has been failure after failure after failure.
We need a president we can trust. That's the kind of president Joe Biden will be. And he won't only reverse the damage of the last four years, hand in hand with Senator Kamala Harris, they will build back a  better economy and country than ever before. But Joe can not do this alone. He needs your help, and tomorrow he needs your vote.
Go to iwillvote.com right now to find your polling place and figure out where, when, and how you're casting your ballot if you haven't done it. And if you've already voted, make sure your friends and family members have a plan to do the same thing. Remember you have two options in Pennsylvania, you can vote in person tomorrow between 7 AM and 8PM or you can deliver your mail in ballot in person-in person, don't put it in the mail-in person- to one of the drop boxes or election offices located in your county by tomorrow at 8 PM. And make sure you read and follow the instructions. Put the ballot in a small envelope. Don't be caught out there naked. Then put the whole thing in the big envelope and sign it. That's the only way it will count.
Remember the other side would not be trying so hard to stop you from voting if they weren't so scared of what your vote could do. Don't let them take away your vote. Don't let them take away your voice. Philadelphia we have the power to put an end to this nightmare. If we win this state, then Donald Trump will be gone and Joe Biden will be the next president of the United States. This is more than an election. As Joe says, "it's a battle for the soul of our nation." And together, with our voices and with our votes, we will win.Alright, turn the music up
And my vocals, listen
I packed up all my bags and then I hit the door
I landed in the land of whatever goes it goes
I gave you guys my heart in each and every show
And I sing, yeah I flow, yeah I sing, yeah I flow

I landed in the land of whatever goes it goes
I gave you guys my heart in each and every show
And I sing, yeah I flow, yeah I sing, yeah I flow
I never used to say a lot but now I'm sayin' everything
Used to let 'em chat me, thought I got the bigger win
But every now and then, you gotta get into the dirt
Get out of your way and let these fuckers know the work
This the real work, yeah
I can't take the fake in
Plastic ain't the movement, you think I'm playin'
Think I moved a entire country for my family
And got these little anythings out with no hand to me
Yeah, I'm in the mood, I gotta tell the truth
Yeah, I'm in the mood but that ain't nothin' new
They linin' up to shoot and still I play by the rules
But trust me, you be in the mood if you were in my shoes
You thought you'd ride me like a train? But I bet you don't
You thought you'd play me like a game? But I swear you won't
I brought ya' down a hundred times, always come up dope
But baby, I survive and watch these others choke
I packed up all my bags and then I hit the door
I landed in the land of whatever goes it goes
I gave you guys my heart in each and every show
And I sing, yeah I flow, yeah I sing, yeah I flow
I packed up all my bags and then I hit the door
I landed in the land of whatever goes it goes
I gave you guys my heart in each and every show
And I sing, yeah I flow, yeah I sing, yeah I flow
Hey, dreams of a grown up kid
Small town, buddy, think big
Combination of the power and the passion
Fly high, not afraid of crashin'
Vroom, vroom, keep movin'
Vroom, keep doin' what we're doin'
Can't tell me nothin' now, turn my music way loud
I never knew I'd make it
Never knew I light the sky like Vegas
There's somethin' in my heart, somethin' in my heart
Said lady, I think I'll buy ya' a as a new ride
Move up to the east side
We out of here, let's go, my dear
Yeah, and so I packed up all my bags, I moved up to the hills
I took it to the stars, now that's the way we live
I'm lookin' at my life, I love the way it is
'Cause I flow, and I sing, yeah I flow, and I sing
I packed up all my bags, I moved up to the hills
I took it to the stars, now that's the way we live
I'm lookin' at my life, I love the way it is
'Cause I flow, and I sing, yeah I flow, and I singHope of the world is in our generation *
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation 
Take caution from our elders, don't make the same mistake 
Let's fill the world with love, and get rid of all the hate
Our elders taught us one thing but, practice another
Just look what happened to the Indian and the brother
 {3x}
Hope of the world is in our generation 
It's all left up to us, to change this present situation 
Our leaders make us fight, and we don't know what for 
If they want people killed, let them fight the war!
It's gotta end somewhere, this killing's got to cease
If no one were to fight, we'd all live in peace
Our generation 
It's all left up to us 
Our generation 
Let's do just what we must
And straighten it out! 
Gotta straighten it out! 
Straighten it out! 
Yeahhh we gon' straighten it out, yeahh!
As long as there's a you, there's a better me
It's why we're together and stronger than they ever thought it could be
A world motherless - can health care cover this?
A love for all people no matter what the culture is
Our generation, is makin huge strides
A self-empowering movement that's on the rise
The more the door is open, the more the youth can see
A fair chance means a greater opportunity
To have a brighter future, deeper insight
Work hard to be anything you want in life
It's what it's all about, the longevity
Educated enough to know what's ahead of me
Need to straighten it out, seek and you'll find
They can cage your body, but not your mind
We lay it all on the line in the struggle
We grew, but together here's what we gotta do
Our generation 
It's all left up to us 
Our generation 
Let's do just what we must, and straighten it out!
Our generation - straighten it out!
Let's straighten it out - and straighten it out!
Heyyyyyyyyy we can straighten it out, YEAHHH!
C'mon yeah! Our generation - let's straighten it out
Hey hey, we'll straighten it out
We'll straighten it out - straighten it out
New York City, better straighten it out
Atlanta, better straighten it out
In Los Angeles, you better straighten it out
We can straighten it out, we can straighten it out

        Talk, let's have conversations in the dark
World is sleeping, I'm awake with you, with you
Watch movies that we've both already seen
I ain't even looking at the screen
It's true, I got my eyes on you
And you say that you're not worth it
You get hung up on your flaws
Well, in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
On Sunday mornings we sleep in 'til noon
Oh, I could sleep forever next to you, next to you
And we, we got places we both gotta be
But there ain't nothing I would rather do
Than blow off all my plans for you
And you say that you're not worth it
And get hung up on your flaws
But in my eyes, you are perfect as you are
As you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you
I will always want the same you, same you
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
When no one seems to notice
And your days, they seem so hard
My darling, you should know this
My love is everywhere you are
I won't ever try to change you, change you 
I will always want the same you, same you 
Swear on everything I pray to
That I won't break your heart 
I'll be there when you get lonely, lonely 
Keep the secrets that you told me, told me 
And your love is all you owe me
And I won't break your heart
Ooh
Ooh
I won't break your heartSleigh bells ring
Are you listening?
In the lane
Snow is glistening
A beautiful sight
We're happy tonight
Walking
In a winter wonderland
Gone away
Is the bluebird
Here to stay
Is a new bird
He sings a love song
As we go along
Walking
In a winter wonderland
In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he is Parson Brown
He'll say are you married?
We'll say No man
But you can do the job
When you're in town
Later on, we'll conspire
As we dream, by the fire
To face unafraid
The plans that we've made
Walking
In a winter wonderland
In the meadow
We can build a snowman
And pretend
That he's a circus clown
We'll have lots of fun
With Mr. Snowman
Until the other kids
Come knock him down
When it's cold
Ain't it thrilling
When your nose
Gets to chilling
We'll frolic and play
The eskimo way
Walking
In a winter wonderland
Walking
In a winter wonderland

He was walking along the road
And I asked him where are you going
And this he told me
I'm going on down to Yasgur's farm
I'm going to join in a rock 'n' roll band
I'm going to camp out on the land
I'm going to try an' get my soul free
We are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Then can I walk beside you
I have come here to lose the smog
And I feel to be a cog in something turning
Well maybe it is just the time of year
Or maybe it's the time of man
I don't know who I am
But you know life is for learning
Oh, we are stardust
We are golden
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
By the time we got to Woodstock
We were half a million strong
And everywhere there was song and celebration
And I dreamed I saw the bombers
Riding shotgun in the sky
And they were turning into butterflies
Above our nation
We are stardust 
We are golden 
And we've got to get ourselves
Back to the garden
Ooh, ooh, ooh...
Hmm...Yeah we used to flirt with freedom
'Fore everybody knew our names
We became their favorite secret
Love for love and not for fame
Oh, when I was your user, your FaceTime abuser
Dose after dose 'til we crashed
Now they bet on our game, say we'll go down in flames
It's too good but we never could last
But oh, we were undercover 'til it overflowed, overexposed
Oh, chained our love together, never took it slow
And now we know life on overload, 
Don't we always make a show of love, 
Let that cellphone ring, let that bluebird sing, let that message say unread
Let them talk about us, let them talk too much
While we rule the whole world from our bed
And oh, we were undercover 'til it overflowed, overexposed
Oh, chained our life together, never took it slow
And now we know life on overload
Don't we always make a show of love?
Life on overload, must we make a spectacle of love?City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
There's so much that I can't see
Who knows?
Is this the start of something wonderful and new?
Or one more dream that I cannot make true?
Barefoot, she smiled
And leapt, without looking
And tumbled into the Seine
The water was freezing
She spent a month sneezing
But said she would do it again
Here's to the ones who dream
Foolish as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that ache
Here's to the mess we make
She told me:
"A bit of madness is key
To give us new colors to see
Who knows where it will lead us?
And that's why they need us"
So bring on the rebels
The ripples from pebbles
The painters, and poets, and plays
And here's to the fools who dream
Crazy as they may seem
Here's to the hearts that break
Here's to the mess we make
City of stars
Are you shining just for me?
City of stars
You never shined so brightlyMother, mother
There's too many of you crying
Brother, brother, brother
There's far too many of you dying
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today, yeah
Father, father
We don't need to escalate
You see, war is not the answer
For only love can conquer hate
You know we've got to find a way
To bring some lovin' here today
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Talk to me, so you can see
Oh, what's going on
What's going on
Yeah, what's going on
Ah, what's going on
Mother, mother, everybody thinks we're wrong
Oh, but who are they to judge us
Simply because our hair is long?
Oh, you know we've got to find a way
To bring some understanding here today, oh
Picket lines and picket signs
Don't punish me with brutality
Come on, talk to me
So you can see
What's going on
What's going on
What's going on
I'll tell you what's going onGirl I'm in love with you
This ain't the honeymoon
Past the infatuation phase
Right in the thick of love
At times we get sick of love
It seems like we argue every day
I know I misbehave
And you made your mistakes
And we both still got room left to grow
And though love sometimes hurts
I still put you first
And we'll make this thing work
But I think we should take it slow
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
This ain't a movie no
No fairy tale conclusion y'all
It gets more confusing every day
Sometimes it's heaven sent
Then we head back to hell again
We kiss then we make up on the way
I hang up you call
We rise and we fall
And we feel like just walking away
As our love advances
We take second chances
Though it's not a fantasy
I still want you to stay
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
Maybe we'll live and learn
Maybe we'll crash and burn
Maybe you'll stay, maybe you'll leave
Maybe you'll return
Maybe you'll never find
Maybe we won't survive
But maybe we'll grow
We never know, baby you and I
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go, yeah hey
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow, hey hey
We're just ordinary people
We don't know which way to go
‘Cause we're ordinary people
Maybe we should take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow, slow
This time we'll take it slow
Take it slow
This time we'll take it slowI wrote this song as a tribute to  relationship and the fact that love can get us through all kinds of tough times, and we know that the world is going through tough times right now.
We know that Joe Biden personally has experienced so much tragedy. And what I think he's taught us and what he brings to this job, this idea of being the leader of this nation, is the fact that he's resilient, that he has empathy, that he understands what it is like to feel serious pain, that he's able to lead this country out of a serious, dark time in our history. And that's why I'm here today.
This song is called "Never Break."Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
No more backward thinking, time for thinking ahead
The world has changed so very much from what it used to be
There is so much hatred, war, and poverty
Wake up all the teachers, time to teach a new way
Maybe then they'll listen to what you have to say
'Cause they're the ones who's coming up
The world is in their hands
When you teach the children, teach them thе very best you can, hey
Thе world won't get no better
If we just let it be, woah
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me
Wake up all the doctors, make the old people well
They're the ones who suffer and who catch all the hell
But they don't have so very long before their Judgment Day
So won't you make them happy before they pass away, ohh
Wake up, all the builders time to build a new land
I know we can do it if we all lend a hand
The only thing we have to do is put it in our mind
Surely things will work out, cause they do every time, hey
The world won't get no better
If we just let it be, woah
The world won't get no better
We gotta change it, yeah, just you and me
Oh, yeah
I need a little help
Put your hands together y'all
Come on
I need a little help y'all
I can't do it alone
Come on
Wake up everybody, no more sleeping in bed
Wake up everybody
Oh, I need a little help
Can't do it alone
I need a little help
Come on, come on
Hey, ohhh
Wake up everybody
Woah, I need a little help
I can't do it alone
I need a little help
Come on, come on
HeyAs days go by and fade to nights
I still question why you left
I wonder how it didn't work out
But now you're gone
And memories all I have for now
But no, it's not over
We'll get older, we'll get over
We'll live to see the day that I hope for
Come back to me
I still believe that we'll get it right again
We'll come back to life again
We won't say another goodbye again
You'll live forever with me
Someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
I heard someday might be today
Mysteries of destinies
They are somehow and are someway
For all we know they come tomorrow
For today my eyes are open
My arms are raised for your embrace
My hands are here to mend what is broken
To feel again to walk on the face
I believe there is more to life
Oh, I love you much more than life itself
I believe I can change your mind
Revive what is dying inside
And someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
Someday, someday
We'll be together
We'll be together
We'll be together somedayIf this world were mine, I would place at your feet
All that I own, you've been so good to me
If this world were mine
I'd give you the flowers, the birds and the bees
And you'd be always beside me, be all that I need
If this world were mine, I'd give you anything
If this world were mine, I would make you a king
With wealth untold you could have anything
If this world were mine
I'd give you each so sunny and blue
And if you wanted the moonlight, I'd give you that too
If this world were mine
I'd give you anything
Oh baby, you're my inspiration
And there's no hesitation
When you want me, all you gotta do is call me
Oh baby, you are my constellation
And I feel so much sensation
When I'm in your arms, when you squeeze me
The way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me more
The way that you do
Ooh, the way that you love me
Every sky would be blue as long as you're loving me, baby
When I'm here in your arms, life is so wonderful, my love

If you believe...Yeah yeah, alright, yeah yeah
Uh uh ah ah
Outta love so many suffer
We, all ask why, as they fight for their lives
Can we try, though it may seem impossible, change it
Oh we just can't sit by, love can't just let them die
How long till we get it right, how long will it take
Oh we should come together and we should start today
I know that we can do it
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
All we need is L.O.V.E. love
Love is the right solution
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love, all we need is love
Yeah yeah, alright
If you with me say alright tonight
Yeah yeah, alright, it's L.O.V.E. love
So many voices, so many mothers cry
Can we take the time to listen
Can we try in this time of trouble
We know, oh love's the only cure
Is what we're waiting for
How long till we get it right, how long will it take
Oh we should come together and we should start today
I know that we can do it
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
All we need is L.O.V.E. love
Love is the right solution
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love, all we need is love
Yeah yeah, alright
If you with me say alright tonight
Yeah yeah, alright, it's L.O.V.E. love
Alright, release the love inside
Release the love inside
It's L.O.V.E. love
We can turn the light in the darkness
We can make it right where it's wrong
It's time to conquer hate before it's too late
Show them what we needed for so long
I know that we can do it
There ain't nothing we can't rise above
All we need is L.O.V.E. love
Love is the right solution
Love is the answer we're all in need of
It's love, all we need is love
Yeah yeah, alright
If you with me say alright tonight
Yeah yeah, alright, it all comes back to love
Yeah yeah, alright, release the love inside
Release the love inside
It's L.O.V.E. love
Yeah yeah, alright...
