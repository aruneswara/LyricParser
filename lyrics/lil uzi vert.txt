I knew you were fake from the jump 
You know I can spot it from the cut 
'Cause you know Lil Uzi in the cut 
All we want is money and the drugs 
Man, I had your girlfriend all in love
Told her that she fucking with a thug
Swept some money right under my rug
Not 'bout money, please don't say, "What's up?"
Girl, you think you low, girl, you wanna go 
That mean you a ho 
All that talk that you don't cheat, that shit right there for show
Cause he had you at 3:30 I had you at 4:00
Anyway, I might pull up Bentley truck
Girl, this is not a rental
Fox coat, extra mink, when I get cold, won't shiver
But without me, girl, you know that it's gon' be a cold winter 
You went with a loser and you left yourself a winner 
Can't believe you started this when I'm the one to finish
You was just pretendin', everything I said, I meant it 
My new crib got ten bedrooms and all don't got a tenant 
My new car, this shit too nice, fishbowl, I can't tint it 
I knew you were fake from the jump 
You know I can spot it from the cut 
'Cause you know Lil Uzi in the cut 
All we want is money and the drugs 
Man, I had your girlfriend all in love
Told her that she fucking with a thug
Swept some money right under my rug
Not bout money, please don't say, "What's up?"
I'm so used to pain, it's part of my day
It's part of my rage, I can't see your face
I can't see it, I can't see it, I can't see it
From what you did, everybody told me, "Leave that"
I can see that, matter fact, I might keep that
Tell me how you love if you lost your soul
She saw everything when I left my phone
You can't find no better, they are all my clones
Same niggas standin', did it on my own
I knew you were fake from the jump 
You know I can spot it from the cut 
'Cause you know Lil Uzi in the cut 
All we want is money and the drugs 
Man, I had your girlfriend all in love
Told her that she fucking with a thug
Swept some money right under my rug
Not bout money, please don't say, "What's up?"Lyrics from Snippet

Bust the AP, gotta turn to the team
Dirty diamonds on me, huh, got my money out the streets 
Ridin' with a brand new Tommy gun, two thousand bullets if I squeeze it
Two hundred, huh, huh, huh, for a feature, huh, huh 
You can't pay for these goods  'til you turn into a preacher, uh, uh 
Smokin' Anthrax , might cough back

Swag, swag, swag disease
...Where other people stop, I accelerate
People say they're gonna do shit and they don't do it
I'm going all the way with it
The ultimate rock and roll sacrifice is death
When I die I don't die, my soul goes on
It's another invention
A bottle of death is exciting
Why do I wanna get old and be nothing?
Why do I want to be a poor human being?
I wanna do what I wanna do
And get everything done as quick as I gotta do it
And get the fuck out of there, go on
And then I can accelerate into the next life
And still leave my blood here
To be the blood of rock and roll and still be here
I'll never go away
But when I'm dead I will become stronger on Earth
And I'll become more powerful in the next life
There is no death
If I kill myself that doesn't solve the mission at all
The mission goes on and on and on
And people are so fucking stupid they don't understand that
They don't understand
They think "Yo, okay, you're gonna kill yourself, well that's stupid" Well you're fucking wrong
You're stupid for getting fucking old and boring and ignorant
Just like people on the jury that convicted me
I don't wanna be like you
I don't wanna be part of your fucking boring world
I wanna do what I wanna do
When I wanna end my life I'm gonna fucking end it
And I'm gonna be more powerful for it
And, and, all you people who say what I'm doing is wrong
You're just so fucking insecure
That you don't have the fucking balls to do it
You wanna say you're bad
But you don't really wanna fucking be bad
You just wanna pretend you are
Well I'm really gonna fucking do it
And that's what separates the real rock and roll underground
From the people who wanna just be pretend
You know bands
They come along and follow what I do and imitate what I do
I'm not just—Listen, bro, listen

It cost more than hers, it costs more than hers 
I spent eighty-thousand, that was just on hers
Spent two-hundred thousand, that was just on jackets
Rockin' that mink, rockin' chinchilla, rockin' that brown jackrabbit 
But only, 'cause if I ruin that bitch once, and then, nigga, you can just have it

Back then I saw no one but you
Gave you my racks and I splurged too
Calling my phone and I curved you
Hope this song really don't hurt you
AP froze , time so slow, yeah, hit reverse
Margiela all on my coat 
Got buttons, but leaving it open 
So they can all see my shirt , Rick Owens all on my shirt 
I can't believe I made it out the dirt
That was back then when my pockets was hurt
Pockets so stuffed that them shits still be hurtin’
Walk with the Goyard, they say its a purse
Louis scarf on me it look like a curtain
My main girl a doctor, my side girl a nurse
They keep on talkin' 
They keep on talkin' 
All these girls up in the club, why you lookin' at Vert? 
I am not worried because when my niggas come
They gonna need a white curtain
Your boyfriend hate my "Bad And Boujee" verse
She gave me head so I called her a nerd
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel, yeah
I can't feel
My body's numb
Baby because I am so hurt, yeah
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me, what's my time and worth? 
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round yeah
Living life just with a curse
Before I go in a hearse
Told you that I love you first
Told you that I love you first, oo
Nowadays I gotta swerve you
I took you out of the fur boots
I'm doing fine now , I'm doing fine now
No, I do not need nobody now
No, I do not need nobody now
No girl don't make a sound
You don't wanna argue about body count 
You don't wanna talk about body count
You don't wanna talk about body count
What is all this fighting all about
It's the bodies that I'm finding out 
It's the bodies I don't know about 
So many bodies like a murder trial
You used to say that it's word of mouth
But I love you so you're bondin' out
But I love you so you're bondin' out 
Grandma and Mom love you now
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
I'm so high I ain't comin' down
Hate me then, but they love me now 
Love me then, but they hate me now
It don't matter, got the paper now
I'm so numb
I can't feel, no
I can't feel, I can't feel 
I can't feel, my body's numb
Baby because I am so hurt 
I feel the pain in the rain
Tell me, what's my time and worth? 
Not my first merry-go-round
Not my first merry-go-round, yeah

Nowadays a lil' nigga all the way up
Well respected and I'm well protected
Don't make my boys come all run up
You know I stay clean like fuzz
This is fox, lil' bitch, ain't fuzz

And I called your phone a hundred times before I even came to this conclusion
And you think I don't understand, but
I'm on a whole 'nother level, you the one that really don't understand
Nothing that I got going on
I don't have time for none of these games
Don't understand why you wanna keep playing
I got lots of war wounds and a lot of stains
And in my three years, a whole lot done changed
And in these three years, a whole of pain
I looked at my shirt, had a whole lot of stains
They tried to jack me, don't know where it came
Dracula niggas tryna usе they fangs
In my three years, met a wholе lotta lames
I met some good people, forgot all they names
And my girl like a Backwood that come with the veins
I don't really want it but I can't explain
I go to the back of this girl and I can't lose my pace
Vibration always be breaking the vase
She unbuckle my BB like I'm Lil Wayne
Her bandana tied just to keep her hair laid
And my bandana tied 'cause you know what I bang
Bandana santana, I can't feel my face
I close my eyes, close my hands, pardon my face
But you know Uzi not talking T. D. Jakes
I told the jeweler don't flood out the face 
Factory time when I look at the date
Okay, you gotta go, gotta get out my place

Oh 
She don't know what she mean, she don't know what she mean 
She don't know she a queen, she don't know she a queen 
I love when you stay, I hate when you leave
That girl, she lied just straight to my face
In twenty-two hours I finished the case
No, don't switch up, better stay in your lane
She took a sword right through my heart, penetrate
I'm the one that deserve a new upgrade
If I don't get it, I'm all on my own
I took her to dinner, want shrimp with no steak
I couldn't find it, they call them shits prawns
Only vane vines I knew you too long
Now what is the problem? Girl, what is you on?
Made her fall in love with the scent on my cologne
On the flights, you keep calling, it's different time-zones
Yes, my buzz got ginormous and this girl I know
I do not know what's right, don't know what's wrong
And I got her wet, I need to get a boat

They don't understand how I spit somethin'There's some times when I get lonely, I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning
See the light, hide and seek
See the light in ivory
Over  carry nights and pain inside in silently
Unable to speak on the way in which she required me
Choking on the smoke, it was the pain inside is firing
See thе light, hide and seek
See the light in ivory
Over  carry nights and pain insidе in silently
Unable to speak on the way in which she required me
Choking on the smoke, it was the pain inside is firing
Silence, baby I am tired of your requirements 
Choking off a lot of smoke because I got a lot of stress
She gave me that dome and she need some time to find her neck
Money off retirement remind you of your father's check
Now come on baby, follow directions, I call that Simon says
So X-rated we always hit the floor, can never find the bed
Let’s go baby, let’s do it some more till I’m out of breath
Yes I hate it you’re not here at all, and you don’t exist
I be gone by the midnight
I be gone when it’s midnight
In the Audi R8 running red lights
You don’t really have to say what you really like
You don’t really have to talk you don’t have to lie
All your negativity messing up my vibe
And she know that I’m a beast got that appetite
I don’t want your girl gotta deal with mine
But I’m known to put her on the side
Prophecy they know that that’s a lie
20 years that’s 20 times 20 eyes
Watching me these boys want me to die
I just brung an FN on a G5
Making hits and I'm busting off the meter
That'll show you that I really don't need her
I see the light, now I see, what she is requiring
Waiting for a leader so I show her the entire me
Running through the wild we arrive at home entirely
Running from exactly what we are, the empire me
I know you need me baby, I know you need me baby
I promise I'll be right back right after this message baby
You and I could tell them all together in a letter, oh
Better we can just tell them the truth, it's that I know I can't stop
Now you see, when she calling me, yeah she fine as me, why I'm fine as hell
Where you finding her where honestly somewhere overseas, thats international
That's your bro you know his cash is low I seen the inside green, outside pistachio
If they can match the flow and they can match the dough, it's something like a myth because the chance is low
Me in one big room, I'm known to act a hoe, and I can't talk to her she shop at fashion nova
I said she keep yelling and she keep tripping I don't understand because the ass is ?
She call me a snake I'm known to pack a cobra we go through it then we laugh it off
Yes I'm smooth like a casanova, imma be this way till my tax is over
If you stay aligned I can give advice that'll keep you going that'll get you right
And I got the cheese don't see many mice, she keep tryna leave don't see many nights
All I do is think you just keep on writing, diamonds out the sink this is not a brightener
Keep a patek clean cause I'm bout my values this is balmain I don't have a stylist
That is chump change that's sad silence
That's a mustang what are you, in college
Meet the upgrade to a new ferrari come on baby put you right in parking
And I must say I was wylin' wylin', and I must say change with perfect timing
And I must say that's a lot of shining for a pretty woman call her Julia Roberts
There's some times that I get lonely I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
There's some times that I get lonely, I get lonely
When I take my time, know I always end it with the motions
When she calls my line, you know I am mourning, I am mourning
I be gone by the midnight

Twenty bitches dick riding a nigga
Twenty niggas standing beside of nigga

Now they all wanna ride with a nigga
Where was you when I was off in the beginning
Ain't take three stripes for a nigga
Took me out but now a nigga winnin'
Took me out but now a nigga winnin'
Y'all just be hatin' on a youngin'
Want collab from a youngin'
But a couple months ago
Wasn't thinkin' bout a youngin' 
What you know about trappin'
On a God damn Monday
Half an hour got rid of a onion
I'm finessin' and I'm stuntin' 
You niggas fakin' and your bitches bad
And I don't like you, like your bitch's dad
I'm from the city where everybody wanna be from the north
Cause they think that's just where the winners at
And I swear I wanna be where the women at
Overseas with my team sippin' gin and jack
And most these rappers ain't feelin' that
Then again most these rappers be really wack
And you talk about juugin', but you really trap
Got nicks and dimes money barely stacked
And a bitch I fucked over nigga barely tapped
And I thought you had bars where the coffin at
'Cause you a dead motherfucker, dressed all in black
I'm still a lean head and I'm off the act
Well not right now I ain't off the act
Cause this too crazy to be off the act

Standing up with my feet where her knees be
Begging please when she eat me

Make her my situation 
Fuck her on vacation
In her jaw like a spacer 
Overseas, looking for my new ho
Man, I feel like it's taken
Come on, baby, let me make it
No eye doctor, they can't check it

Your old man was so broke
So that means you was tasteless 
Masked up like I'm Jason 
Frostbite in the Rollie 
Big diamonds in the jacket 
Fuck your bitch, she can't take it 
Maybach on my Wraith 
She tried to act like she taken 
Fuck a bitch with my greatness
Gettin' strong from the pot

Yea! I woke up, remained a G just like I'm post tuh
I got post up look at my neck diamond choker
Girl you got scared of me movin, and she a little bit older
Count my bands then I’m hitting my shoulder
Drive in a lamb not a lotus 
This not a rental, I own it
I cannot hit it you know it cause you is a fan and you know it
But just in case wanna know it if I hit it you get to moaning
Hit it from night from the morning {?}
I’m still right in my moment
{Chorus}
Now my bands up
I won't be no random
Don’t trap off no iPhone
They can’t tap my Samsung  I tell that girl that I've gotta slaughter it
These niggas mad, These niggas mad
I met that girl right up in my show
Left her man in the crowd on the floor
Out of town never saw her before
Tell her baby we don't got that long

This my world so you know I got the juice 
And all these girls the same, I feel like Juice
And every time I see you, why you rude?
So tell me why you got this bad attitude?

Go, go, go, go
Go, go, go 
I think I could see in the dark 
These niggas, they ain't got heart 
Everything blow up in sparks 
These niggas talk to the narcs 
I ain't say that the shoe fit, yeah 
But the description fit the part 
I just be geekin' on Mars 
Somethin' like two in the mornin' 
Now she gon' notice me
I fucked your girl this mornin'
So why was she over me? 
My main girl still mad at me
Because I went overseas 
And every time that I come back to the space
She know that it's no one as cold as me 
That's when my lifestyle took off
Go, go , go 
Yes, it took off 
Go , go , go 
I'm gonna keep it a G 
It ain't any nigga out here in the world that's as froze as me
And they might look ready, got on my diamonds
But that shit he got on look too cheap
I can tell that your girl don't wanna go
But she know she just gotta leave
Double R, big body, my Rolls
Rolls, Rolls, Rolls, no one slam doors
Ain't no way I lose control
And I was on 
Now I got a two-tone 
I might pour up a four, slow
She a ho, she on go, touch her toes
What about tattoo on your asscheek, make it go
Pull right up in a spaceship, I got butterfly doors
I think I could see in the dark 
These niggas, they ain't got heart 
Everything blow up in sparks 
These niggas talk to the narcs 
I ain't say that the shoe fit, yeah 
But the description fit the part

Yeah
This is not going platinum, this some street shit
It's crazy how she kiss a baby right after she eat dick 
It's crazy how my nigga made a million off of three bricks
Break it down the middle and we made it even-steven 
Everybody tryna say that I believe in demons 
You believe in demons if you think I am a demon 
I got so much money that the extra you can keep it 
I stopped fucking avеrage ho's 'cause they can't keep a sеcret 
I be calm in every situation 'cause I'm leanin'
That boy, he a jackass 'cause his money weiner 
My bitch got a fat ass, biggest ever seen 
If I didn't love her I would let my whole damn team hit
Okay, I hit with the semen , drippin' on her cleavage
Fuckin' is too easy 
Doggystyle, I'm sleepin' 
No, they can't believe this
These niggas, they heated
I can kill this fucking beat, no I don't need to remix
Yeah, holy moly
Bitch, I crushed the Rollie
Yeah, I crushed the Rollie

Do you love me? 
Do you really love me? 
Do you really love me? 
Do you really love me? 
Yeah, do you love me?
Do you care about me? 
Do you fear a life without me? 
I won't doubt you, would you doubt me? 
I know I lie but do you lie too? Yeah 
I know I'm mad but that's your type boo 
All the arguin', make up and then we fight too 
You know I'm toxic, I'm inside you 
I'm won't leap out far but I got height, boo 
Lovin' you on top and you gon' ride too 
And I'ma beat that, beat that up like it's my rival
I can't lie, you got that good and girl, you fly too 
All I can say is, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" 
All I can say is, "Yeah, yeah, yeah" 
Come on, baby, tell me, do you love me? 
Come on, baby, tell me, do you trust me? 
If I fuck up, baby, don't ever say fuck me 
And you know sometimes times get ugly 
All these hatin' bitches hatin' 'cause they want me 
Yeah, young nigga rich and I'm stunting 
Yeah, I'm not on the surf, no, I'm not haunting 
But sometimes I get scared of cuffing 
So, now, look me in my eyes, say that you love me 
We both think it's not real so it's nothing 
Yeah 
So, if love isn't real, why we fuss about it? 
And if your touch isn't real I feel good at night
You love every time I kept your vibe 
And if I say slide," she gon' slide 
Yeah, I love it when you ride 
Yeah, better look me in my eyes
Yeah, do you trust me?
I got one question for you, baby girl, do you love me?Lyrics from Snippet

Okay, you hip but I'm hipper 
Shoot with that...You know life isn't fair and I have a couple questions

I've been on my own, I'm just living off of pleasure
And when I do wrong, will I still make it to heaven?
Hold on, woah,  hold on, woah-oh
Hold on, woah, hold on, woah-oh

I said even when I'm sad, I'ma get off the jet, yeah 
And when I get old, and I die, turn into a plant, yeah 
But I can't get old, I'ma stay how I am 
Don't want my old bitches that's why I am not with them 
Okay, if you call my phone and I don't answer, then I'm ballin'
Maybe I ain't answer 'cause they-they u-used to stall me
Maybe I ain't answer 'cause I'm depressed, man, I'm 
My cousin in heaven, I wonder if he can call me
I, I, I know you can hear me, I'm lovin' my voice
I know that I sound like I am kinda hoarse
Shootin' at the opps, I think they want some more 
Bitch, we got the shells like we at the shore 
Yes, I make a rapper hanging out the door
But I ride when I bang, nigga, that's of course
And if they want the clan, then we bringin' war
Gotta see it, only way I'll believe it
And I'm doing a handshake like I'm really from 
And you know that it's murder, believe it
If we killing forever what's the reason? 
You know life isn't fair and I have a couple questions
I was only six, you didn't see me turn seven
I've been on my own, I'm just living off of pleasure
And when I do wrong, will I still make it to heaven?

Do they really like me?
I don't know, I don't care
If she really fucked me, I don't know, like to share
Do them by the two's, Uzi ooh, in a pair
I stayed in my booth, I'm so cool, I'm too rare
Yeah,  she's too scared

My vision was blurry, nowadays it's way too clear
My house is too big like the chairman, I'm the mayor
Yeah

        Woah, and I got the racks
Yeah, I'ma get it back
Know I keep a bag 
Oh I think she love me, okay cool, okay cool
I been getting bitches ever since I was in school
I can't fall in love, 'cause I know that you fold
I can't let no broke nigga fuck up my mood
Oh I think she love me, okay cool, okay cool
I was on the block, in the trenches with the goons
I stack up my knots then I put it on my jewels
Ever spend five thousand on some brand new shoes?
Might spend a day in the trap house, couple bodies then you cool
Bitch I got that medicine that's sitting in the spoon
I been gеtting high, higher than a damn balloon
I just bought an AP, and I bought a Patek too
Swear I makе your bitch get mad at you
Had a Lamborghini way before you had a coupe
Red Lamborghinis, bought her ass an addict too
Fucked that bitch one time then let her run right over you
Bankroll on me, thumbin' through these blues
Water all up on me, been wetter than a pool
I was on the block, it was hotter than June
Whip it in the pot, same one on me brought a spoon
Whip ain't got no key so how you get it started?
My bitch ass so fat, swear she the extra largest
Outtatown my buddy, cuz I'm smokin' Marley
Movin' military, I feel like the Saudi'
I been pulling strings, I don't play guitar
Yellow diamonds it look just like Marge
Yeah I been the same nigga since the fucking start
All these damn backends, don't know where to start
Oh I think she love me, okay cool, okay cool
I been getting bitches ever since I was in school
I can't fall in love, 'cause I know you gon' fold
I can't let no broke nigga fuck up my mood
Oh I think she love me, okay cool, okay cool...Lyrics From Snippet

Lil Uzi Vert, yeah
I hit my bitch, you can't copy moves
I'm on the top, but I got the loot
She made a mess, that's a sloppy move
Aim at your bitch, boy, I'm tryin' hit you
Lil Uzi, ain't no one hot as you
Been rest for some time, but 
You think I'm so fake, I'm tired too
I'm rockin' that Prada, ain't proud of you
I look at the world, yeah, I'm ready for change
I get so angry that things not the same
All white diamonds like they're cocaine
Every time I go up, I throw X on my chain
I don't talk, only sweep my cheese
I can tell these niggas don't like me
Don't make sense 'cause they look like me
Plus I make your bitch wanna have my seat
Don't make sense if you don't make rent
Crouch on your bitch, yeah, that boy, he a simp
Sweep this Swisher, think she tryna throw me a hint
Foreign pound weed leave more than a dent
I  get your ass spent
Every day and night, know a nigga gettin' rich
And instead a nigga beefin' with the whole damn city
Yeah
He don't even know who motherfuckin' sent him
He don't give a fuck, kill a opp good
I trap  yeah, man, that's a
