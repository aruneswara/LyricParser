Yellow model chick, yellow bottle sippin'
Yellow Lamborghini, yellow top missin'
Yeah, yeah, that shit look like a toupée
I get what you get in 10 years in two days
Ladies love me, I'm on my Cool J
If you get what I get, what would you say?
She wax it all off, Mr. Miyagi
And them suicide doors, hari-kari
Look at me now, look at me now 
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now , look at me now 
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Lil' nigga, bigger than gorilla
'Cause I'm killin' every nigga that can try to be on my shit
Better cuff your chick if you with her, I can get her
And she accidentally slip and fall on my dick
Oops, I said, "On my dick"
I ain't really mean to say, "On my dick"
But since we're talking about my dick
All of you haters say hi to it
I'm done
Ayo, Breezy
Let me show you how to keep the dice rollin'
When you're doin' that thing over there, homie
Let's go!
'Cause I'm feelin' like I'm runnin'
And I'm feelin' like I gotta get away, get away, get away
Better know that I don't and I won't ever stop
'Cause you know I gotta win everyday-day 
See, they really really wanna pop me 
Just know that you will never flop me 
And I know that I can be a little cocky 
You ain't never gonna stop me
Every time I come, a nigga gotta set it
Then I gotta go, and then I gotta get it 
Then I gotta blow, and then I gotta show that
Any little thing a nigga think that he be doin' 
'Cause it doesn't matter, 'cause I'm gonna da-da-da-da 
Then I'm gonna murder everything and anything
A ba-da-boom, a ba-da-bing, I gotta do a lotta things
That make it clearer to a couple niggas
That I always win and then I gotta get it again and again and then again
And I be doin' it to death
And now I move a little foul, a nigga better call a ref
And everybody know my style and niggas know that I'm the best
When it come to doing this and I be bangin' on my chest
And I bang in the East and I'm bangin' in the West
And I come to give you more and I will never give you less
You will hear it in the street or you could read it in the press
Do you really wanna know what's next? 
See the way we on and then we all up in the race
And you know we gotta go, don't try to keep up with the pace
And we strugglin' and hustlin' and sendin' in and gettin'
And we always gotta do it, take it to another place
Gotta taste it, and I gotta grab it
And I gotta cut all through this traffic
Just to be at the top of the throne, better know I gotta have it 
Look at me now, look at me now 
I'm gettin' paper
Look at me now , look at me now 
Fresher than a muh'fucka
Man, fuck these bitch-ass niggas, how y'all doin'?
I'm Lil Tunechi, I'm a nuisance
I go stupid, I go dumb like the Three Stooges
I don't eat sushi, I'm the shit, no, I'm pollution, no substitution
Got a bitch that play in movies in my jacuzzi, pussy juicy
I never gave a fuck about a hater
Got money on my radar, dressed like a skater
Got a big house, came with a elevator
You niggas ain't eatin', fuck it, tell a waiter
Marley said shoot 'em, and I said okay
If you wanted bullshit, then I'm like, "¡Olé!"
I don't care what you say, so don't even speak
Your girlfriend a freak like Cirque Du Soleil
That's word to my flag, and my flag red
I'm out of my head, bitch, I'm outta my mind
From the bottom I climb, you ain't hotter than mine
Nope, not on my time, and I'm not even tryin'
What's poppin', slime? Nothin', five
And if they trippin', fuck 'em, five
I ain't got no time to shuck and jive
These niggas as sweet as pumpkin pie
CîROC and Sprite on a private flight
Bitch, I been tight since Guiding Light
And my pockets right, and my diamonds white
And my momma's nice, and my daddy's dead
You faggots scared 'cause I'm too wild

*Woman moaning*
If you leave this time, I fear that you'll be gone for good, so
And I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Said her father left her young and he said he'll be back
With that same tone that you just said you'll stay forever with
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
It seems that you're the only reason for it
I've been bleeding in your silence, I feel safer in your violence
I hold on like leaves in fall to what is left
Before I sleep I talk to God, he must be mad with me, it's karma
I'm confused who I'll spend my forever with, oh-oh-oh
Ooh
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
So the iceberg never broke
And I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked at it and I poked 
And I poked at it but it stayed stagnant
Then I poked at it some more 
And in my notepad, man, I wrote 
If I don't have it, if I don't grab it
If it don't chip, then a toe tag is one last, I'ma hope 
So iceberg don't float 
If I do manage to do damage to you, dammit
It'll be grand as, ten Grammies on my granite, still standin' with a note 
That read, ''Granted, don't you panic''
When you make mistakes the most 
One day, it'll make you grow 
When you outlandish and you lose manners, to God you shall consult 
When the bright cameras are still crammin' in your face and it provoke 
You to act mannish, just stay planted 'cause you reapin' what you sowed
Keep  positivity in your heart and 
Keep a noose from 'round your throat and 
When you get mad and when you poke at it
When you poke it at just note, man
The iceberg is a reflection of you when you renew your vision
Just think if it had sunk Titanic, the fuck it would do to a critic, my nigga?
Yeah, yeah
Tell me, when thugs cry, do you hear 'em, Lord?
Do you hear 'em, Lord? Do you hear 'em?
And if my ship go down tell me who will abort?
And they won't let me live, even with remorse that I give
When they gon' rejoice and forgive, tell me how I stay positive
When they never see good in me
Even though I got hood in me, don't mean he won't redeem me, Lord
It seems that all the autumn leaves are falling
Ooh-ooh-ooh
I feel like you're the only reason for it
Ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh-ooh-ooh
All the things you do, all the things you do, all the things you do
Ooh
Ooh-ooh

Pretty, with a face full of scars
All they did was build me up, tried to take me apart 
They ain't ever wanna celebrate like you have a label
Call the doctor, heard the chopper make 'em do the Macarena 
All you niggas sweet as candy, chocolate chip and Now and Later
Jolly Rancher, stick of bubblegum, it's watermelon flavored 
Get the paper, I'ma  on the corner
Heard you niggas got the juice, but I got Corona
Got a little Spanish bitch, I call her maricona
Joyner Lucas, bitch, I'm hotter than a fuckin' sauna 
Yeah, I make you niggas 
All you new niggas don't do it for me, look 
Bitch I'm the professor, you a student to me, woah
Designer shades on, like you cooler than me, wait 
All we do is win, you a loser to me
Rappers wanna talk about battle me 
You can't give me neck with a mouth full of cavities
Bunch of lil' niggas tried grabbin' me 
Five foot five, boy, you niggas like half of me
You don't wanna see the other side of me 
Hard to make 'em happy, all these bitches stay mad at me
I just might take her out to Applebee's 
Give her long dick and a strawberry daiquiri
Order Cheesecake Factory, bubblin', why you mumblin'?
What you utter? Stop stutterin', what you spend? Let me double it
Lime green 'Rari, two twins, call 'em double mints
If all you pussy niggas my kids, I'm in trouble then
Shut up 'fore I spank you for actin' up
Now I'm wakin' up in cabanas 'cause she bad as fuck
And all gorillas don't want bananas 'less your chain is tucked
You wiggity-wack with the strap, you cross Chris, make you jump
I criss-cross with the pump, ain't no bricks in the trunk
Leave that shit for the chumps, I still get what I want
Don't wanna believe in my mind, but you believe in my dump
I'm takin' a knee for my side, could give a fuck 'bout the owners
Nigga look at my eyes, you 'bout to give me my bonus
And every motherfuckin' record, that's a hit, I record it 
And e'ry motherfuckin' snitch up in this bitch, they report it 
You paid your way for this fade and can't even afford it
75 mil', look at me now 
And all these bad bitches can't keep their feet down 
You don't really wanna see Brown
Need to stop all that shit talkin', put the seat down
Joyner, I don't really feel these niggas
Hol' up, I ain't gotta pay to kill these niggas
Time is money, need to fuck around and bill these niggas
Vet, so I'm finna good will these niggas  
I'ma kill these niggas, I should grill these niggas
Take flex, Fresh Prince, Uncle Phil these niggas 
Oh shit, I'm the shit, you could smell me, nigga
Break ribs, yeah, you don't want no real beef, nigga
I say As-salāmu ʿalaykum when I tear apart some bacon
Hoe, you actin' like a pig, you fuckin' filthy, nigga 
Now the police tryna lock me in the prison, said, "I'm guilty"
I said, "Da da da da da, come and kill me, nigga" 
They must have forgot that I'm psycho 
Oh, you want war? Say no more
Turn your fuckin' block into a light show 
You better be sure, better be sure
I'm the realest nigga that I know 
And I'm so bored, I might switch cars
I saved a lotta money on Geico 
The neighbors knockin' on my door, what the fuck you want?
Bitch, I'm alright 
Listen, nigga, mind your business, I'm so sick of niggas
Tellin' me how I been livin' my life 
Sick of bumpin' shoulders, now I'm runnin' over
Every motherfucker who ain't wanna get in my ride 
I was watchin', you was shoppin'
Ain't never had the shit in my size 
Now I'm poppin', I'm poppin'
And your bitch keep hittin' my line
It's complicated, fuckin' up with my main bitch
Givin' it to the side bitch at the same damn time
Puttin' my face in it, never wastin' it
I'ma lay in it, hit it, hit it one more time
And I'ma proceed and play with the pussy
You know I don't keep my cape on a hoodie
But I keep a Uzi, it's a doozie, make a movie if you're actin' stupid
So Oww!

I know she playin' both sides, that bitch tellin' lies
But my dick give her a high, she down for the ride
Them hatin' bitches kill the vibe, fuck it, live your life
Bad bitches in Hawaii, umbrella with ice
10 bad bitches on my side, make 'em all my wife
Smokin' on the finest ganja, she like China white
Poppin' all these pills she said she used to it
She wanna go way up, okay baby, if you used to it
And I know that you a grown woman

Really wanna be faithful but this shit hard, baby
Yup, I got the pussy first and then I ignored you 
You fucked another nigga, you ain't loyal 
I told you bring a friend, this shit gettin' borin' 
She asked me what we are, we just cordial
I'm a gangsta I can make a wet, wet turn into a pool 
She help me count the money in the trap then she go back to school 
If a nigga ever play with bae, shit it's breaking news 
She got 50 pointers on her neck, Pateks that's matchin' jewels
Wet, wet, wet, wet
Wet, wet, wet, wet 
Wet, wet, wet, wet 
Wet, wet, oh oh baby 
Oh-oh baby

Baby, you can take it off, I'm that nigga with the sauce 
Whole lot of Saint Laurent, can't remember what it cost 
Bitch, I'm feelin' like a boss, spit on it and lick it off 
You know we can run it up, tell me what you really want
I know I can break you off, come here lemme break you off
If you ever wanna fuck, can I be the one you call?
If you wanna be a star, I can tell you what it cost

Got my own lingo, I can change your whole lil' ego

 Oh-oh babyYou ain't the girl that you used to be
You say you're done, you're moving on
This ain't the world that it used to be
Looks like you've won, looks like you've won
Sick of leaving messages on your cell
A true lover, but when I’m not there
Girl, you had somebody that really cared
How you fuck it up, girl, it's not fair
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh, yeah
Seems like ain't nothing cool about being real
No one's honest about what they feel
Take a hoe and try to treat her well
She'll be back up at the club again
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
'Less I know for sure that you're vibing with me
You do what you want with somebody else
I'm gone, baby
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side, I've been there
Oh yeah, I've been there
That grass ain't greener on the other side
Oh yeah
My homie said I need to stop it
My momma said bitches be watchin' you
They gon' put their hand all in your pocket
For the credit card that's in your wallet
Drinkin' liquor when we celebratin'
Calculatin' all my funds
Tryna get a nigga take the condom off
'Cause she want that tax every month, woo
I know what you want, but you're not gon' get it
Take my kindness for weakness when you act sadity
Keeping it 100 ain't your forté
You used to be
You used to be the one to talk to on the side
Waiting for my love to break up
It's crazy how your ass can walk through every night
Acting like you been a player
That grass ain't greener on the other side

Flyin' in my 'rari like a bat that just flew outta hell
I'm from the east of ATL, but ballin' in the Cali hills
Lil mama booty boomin', that bitch movin' and she standin' still
I know these bitches choosin' me, but I got 80 on me still
I'm tryna fuck, who tryna chill? 'Cause I'm just tryna pay some bills
I'm multi millionare LaFlare, this watch here cost a quarter M
Just look at me and look at them, I smashed her on my first attempt
Like Scarface bitch, the world is mine, you should read the blimp
So either you gon' take a ride, or you gon' stay with him
'Cause I got places I can be, I get yo ass on the scene
Gucci, CB VIP, so fuck them niggas, look at me, Wop

All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture 
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck
And now I'm finna throw them deuces up
What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan
Ayy, look at what we livin' in, here we go with this again
I just keep on talkin', but I guess that you ain't listenin'
Rather run around with them nothin'-ass bitches then
Go on, got me hot, smokin' like a chimney
We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch 
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout
According to my old bish, I be on some new ish
She was on some oldish, now I got a new bish
Think I give two-ish? You ain't gonna do ish
Meet my two fingers, intro-deuces
If you knew better, you'd do better
Wanna get the middle finger, but I got two better
So you gonna diss me
Even though you know it’s wrong
Know you gon' miss me a little when I’m gone
Drizzy voice
Now I'm ghost, baby, four-door Rizzy Royce
Tryna work it out might be a bad business choice
I'm 'bout my business, boys, plus I make paper
Come on, that's old news, yesterday's paper 
Oh, you talkin', what about?
If it ain't how I kept you studded out
You might as well shut your mouth
You'll never score another me, I'll shut it out
Act like there's gum in your hair, girl, cut it out!
Got a pocket full of hundreds, she the only one that's missin'
Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it 
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame 
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to herThere can be one only you, whoa-oh 
And baby, God could never make two, whoa, na-na-na 
And I know you came here with your crew, whoa-oh 
But I promise you that it feels like it's just us two, uh-huh 
Oh, I don't know what you had planned to do tonight 
But I just wanna be the one to do you right, right 
When we're standing here, looking at each other, baby, eye to eye 
And I'm hoping that you're thinking 'bout leaving with me tonight
Who said you can't find love in the club?
'Cause I wanna tell them they wrong
Come on, just, baby, try a new thing
And let's spark a new flame
You gon' be my baby 
Love me, love you crazy 
Tell me if you with it 
Baby, come and get it
Baby, try a new thing 
And let's spark a new flame
Breezy, let me holla at her
Yeah, man, listen
I can't believe you came here all alone
Baby girl, where's your lover?
Oh, it don't really matter
'Cause I got plans to get to know you better, yeah
Baby, baby, baby, baby
Let's make what we got here last forever, uh
Girl, 'cause I don't wanna let you go, never 
I don't know what you had planned to do tonight 
Girl I just wanna be the one to do you right, right 
When we're standing here, looking at each other, baby, eye to eye  
Baby, I hope that you're thinking 'bout leaving with me tonight

She know what time it is, Chris, yeah
Home plate, World Series, how a nigga slidin' in her 
Baby, I'm a boss, I'm talkin' George Steinbrenner
Panamera, Yogi Berra, my two-seater, Derek Jeter
Got more stripes than all these niggas
Babe Ruth ballin' in a Beamer 
Collar on my Polo , kisses on my necklace 
All my diamonds watchin', now my watches gettin' jealous 
Smoking on a bomb in my autographed LeBron's
Yeah, she told me I'm the one, that's when I only hit it once
M-M-M-M-M-Maybach Music

Always hoping for the worst
Waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
That knows just what I need, she know just what I mean
When I tell her keep it drama free
Chu-Chuckin' up them deuces

No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye to her 
Uh, used to be Valentines, together all the time
Thought it was true love, but you know women lie
It's like I sent my love with a text two times
Call 'cause I care, but I ain't get no reply 
Tryna see eye to eye, but it's like we both blind
Fuck it, let's hit the club, I rarely sip but pour me some
'Cause when it's all said and done
I ain't gon' be the one that she can always run to
I hate liars, fuck love, I'm tired of tryin'
My heart big, but it beat quiet
I don't never feel like we vibin'
'Cause every time we alone, it's a awkward silence
So leave your keys on the kitchen counter
And give me back that ruby ring with the big diamond
Shit, it's over, what you trippin' for?
I don't wanna have to let you go
But baby, I think it's better if I let you know
I'm on some new shit

You made me wanna say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye to her, yeah 
Look, my shawty always on some bullshit like Chicago
So I flip that middle finger and the index finger follow
Deuces, we ain't got no future in tomorrow
I'm a dick, so it shouldn't be that hard to swallow
The other chick I'm with never complainin'
She make me wanna leave the one I'm with, Usher Raymond
Prolly didn't register, don't trip, later on it will
Shorty full of drama, like Gangsta Gri-zills
I finally noticed it, it finally hit me
Like Tina did Ike in the limo, it finally hit me
I got a new chick, and she ain't you
She Paula Patton thick. she give me déjà vu
And all that attitude, I don't care about it
But all that shit I do for her, you gon' hear about it
Breezy rep two up, two down
But I'm just puttin' two up, chuckin' up the deuce now 
I'm on some new shit
I'm chuckin' my deuces up to her, oh-oh 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better

You made me wanna say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye 
Say bye-bye to her , deucesI thought we were great
You took your love back and ran us off track
I counted all the days
'Til you would come back, how stupid was that?
Now you're missing what we used to have
Guess the vodka brought the feeling back
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned and run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
That’s how many fucks I give, oh
Wake up with a dime
Get up to no good, get up and you could
Go out, free our minds
Like you never would, never understood
Now you're missing what we used to have
You been creeping 'round my Instagram
I was caught up in the aftermath
But now, if you really wanna know
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
That’s how many fucks I give
Broke back then but a nigga rich now
Got dollars, got euros, got yen, I got pounds, zeros, zeros
Calling me up cause your bad check bounced
My new chick one hundred, and she got her own dinero, zero
You think I'm thinking 'bout your ass?
Ask how many nights I've been thinking of you, zero, zero
Gave a hundred percent but all I got from you, zero, zero
I thought you were the one, then you turned to run
Found somebody better, like I never met ya
Ask how many nights I’ve been thinking of you, zero, zero
That’s how many fucks I give
That’s how many fucks I giveIf I'm out at the bar havin' a night on the town
Life of the party, pourin' shots of the brown
And you see me from the street but I don't turn around
Would you say, "Hi"? Would you keep going?
If I told your family that you didn't mean nothing
If you posted about it and I didn't even comment
If the songs weren't true, but you still feel something
Would you still come looking for me?
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
Your head and your heart won't feel the same
Even if it feels like it every time
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Might run across your mind but don't worry 'bout me, no
My heart is back in one piece, it ain't skipped a beat, no
Feeling rested up, I ain't missing sleep, no-oh
Don't take it personal if I can't reply now
I'm distant 'cause I don't wanna be reached now
Won't let the ghosts of our past weigh my future down
I'm liberated
Energy's like a circle, it comes back around
Reciprocated
Don't shed no more tears
Won't gain no empathy from me
In the upcoming years
Oh, I don't need your pity
Don't check on me
Oh, don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
And it looks like winter for you
Ain't call you back 'cause I let it go
I had to focus energy and just let it flow
And when we ride low, we were already gone
It wouldn't mean anymore to me now
I know it hurts you so bad just to see me happy
That I finally moved on, and you thought it wouldn't happen
At times I used to cry when the world was laughing
But I act like I didn't notice
Oh, don't go reaching out
'Cause you can't have everything
You can't kill a flame with gasoline
Even if it feels like it every time
No matter how hard you try
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in June
Don't check on me
If we're not together, then it's probably for a reason
Every heartbreak has its season
It ain't always summer in JuneI don't think they know the truth

You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online

'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you

Ain't no choice to me but loyalty still means a lot to me 
Some niggas'll gon' chop my arm right off and still reach out to me
I know you probably want that
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
They don't revive a nigga then bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right  I don't die
That's why a nigga ride with a weapon
Better that than me lyin' on a stretcher
Gunshot 
Applyin' all the pressure
Potato on the chopper
Shootin' through the pillow, blood on the feathers 
Rollin' dice with ya life, all I do is roll 7s 
Eagle on my lap when I walk with the devil
Hit a bitch from the back like I don't know better
Man, I swear to God you better talk to the reverend 
Yeah, I'm on a weed high, dehydrated
Her booty fuckin' skin-tight, Levi made it 
Yee-haw, yee-haw, put her in a stable
Keep my cards in my pocket, never put 'em on the table 
Leave her bra on the floor, put my dick up on her navel
Do what I say, don't give me no ultimatum
Ride around or die, get your life taken
Shit, already went half on a baby 
All these broke bitch ass niggas
Tryna tell a real nigga how to really fuckin' get a bag 
How you fuckin' 25 with your first car?

Why you wanna hate on progress? 
Why you wanna keep me in the projects? 
Nigga, why you wanna eat off my check? 
That's some weird ass shit, you suspect 
That's a weird ass bitch, don't trust that 
Shut the hell up, a nigga ain't done yet 
All these shots, are you niggas havin' fun yet? 
I'ma do it by the book so run that 
Take ya bitch, then I ride in the sunset 
Layin' on the Westside, hit Sunset 
Backwoods, you can find me where the skunk at 
Bullet with ya name on it, if you want that 
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
They don't revive a nigga then bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right  I don't dieIf you're only as good as the company you keep
Then I'ma blame you for what they say about me
When I was by myself, I was fast asleep
Since you came around, I've been up for weeks
Yi-Yi-Yikes, I've been with the wrong crowd
I can make you a believer
If I turn the nonsense down
I keep my secrets in a safehouse 
Better if I don't speak 
Devil's tryna tempt me
They just outline my shape out 
Place me at the crime scene 
I can see from this high up

Oh-oh 
Oh, oh 
Oh, woah 
Oh-oh Yeah, it's how I feel, right
It's only me right
Ha, it's life, ha
I was 15, a Virginia nigga with ambition
Young but I envisioned fuckin' 'em bad bitches
Live my life with no regrets, I try to show respect but you don't give it
I guess you don't understand winnin'
It might take me a lifetime to take it back
And it might take you a lifetime to know the facts
Yeah, just 'cause we different, don't mean we distant
And if you kill a man, ain't no way to bring him back
Yeah, they say it's mind over matter
But what we livin' for? What really matters?
Some niggas silver spoon just on a platter
And other niggas is doomed just for disaster
All alone sleepin' in my bedroom
As I wet the sheets, momma gon' be dead soon
'Cause a man beat her, but he don't realize
She important to this family like a fuckin' heirloom
Yeah, a nigga still found his way out
A record deal came, that nigga played out
My momma livin' good, she takin' days out
They sayin', "Boy, all that hard work paid off"
500 racks for an hour show
But ain't gon' ever do no 60-minute interview
'Cause all you wanna do is twist my words up
And all I wanna do is flip my birds up
Kinda tipsy off that red rum, murder
I'm a singin' ass nigga, know you heard of me
Every day my clique stuntin'
Niggas talkin' down but I'ma make them pick they words up
I done said all I had to say, what else?
Cock suckers low blowin' under my belt
Yeah, they hangin' from the tip, they tryna get a sip
Don't let them get a grip, I'm pissin' on them myself
19 a nigga went through a tragedy
Three years a nigga just found a better me
Yeah, you might find another lover
But you always started with Breezy like the letter "B"
Nightmares feelin' haunted
Thinkin' do I really like this star shit?
Huh, because fame ain't freedom
And this diamond chain only mean they hold you hostage
Now I got a lot of offers
Tellin' me to wear their clothes and they wanna be my sponsor
But when a nigga fall off again, they be like, "Off him"
And then they gonna smile up in your face just like, "Awesome, great"
Wait, police and a thug cannot relate
I guess that's why this war on drugs is the debate
So I'ma keep on livin' my life from day to day
Learn from my mistakesYeah, oh
Yeah
Tell me what you feeling
Wanna know what's on your mind
I know we ain't committed
But we do this all the time, oh

Trapped and bored, it's on a magic floor, behind a padded door 
All my emotions in the attic stored, inside the bag of orbs, in the cabin drawer

I keep looking for love 
Dying over diamonds 
Counterfeit designing
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
Alright

Everything fake like a movie script
Everything I got public, so
You already know how the groupies get
Pulled up in the fakest city with the Lambo' sittin' and my Rambo with me
Plus I got a bitch so bad, with a rep so cold, big ass, big titties
Stuck in a fairy tale lifestyle
Snow White rollin' with gold diggers
Nigga say, "How much for that one?"
Shit, I ain't even know she was a ho, nigga
I meet these hoes erryday
Try to turn love like erry way
Hundred dollars bills run the color of red
So I'm countin' my dough in a private place, yikes
You don't wanna love, maybe not
Baby, you gon' give me everything you got, damn right
Say you love me, ooh
Why you in my bed turning over like the graves of the ones before you, 'fore ya?

I keep looking for love 
Dying over diamonds 
Counterfeit designing 
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes
Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoes
Uh, hold up, wait
Shoulda been on time but you showed up late
Had a little feelin' but it's gone away
Gave you a piece, you want a whole damn plate
Wanna play, wanna ball
Wanna have your cake and eat it all
Now I gotta new one outta state
So them ratchets gonna hate
But they hated Jesus, man
Runnin' around sayin' you don't need a man
You know you gon' miss them private flights
Errything high with Young Khalifa, man
Errything paid for
It's taken its course, so much back and then forth
That's a erryday thing though, woo
So I'm skatin'
Headin' straight for your replacement
'Cause your story, I couldn't take it
It had holes in it like Jason
But I stuck around and stayed patient
Mama called me up basin'
Father called me up pacin'
All your friends were all basic
Now I see right through you, woulda thought a nigga had LASIK
Extra cash, spent that so my car look like a spaceship
Wanna leave me, that's cool, I was thinkin' 'bout leavin' you
Walked out the door like poof, made it look like the thing to do
I keep looking for love 
Can't find it in a party , in a whole room full of bodies 
I keep looking for love 
Dying over diamonds 
Counterfeit designing 
I'm not feeling these counterfeit hoes

Feeling these counterfeit hoes, hoesHey, whoa
Would you mind if I take my time, and admire you?
Candlelight, a little wine to set the mood

Ain't no pressure, we ain't gotta rush
Wanna know what's on your mind before we touch, touch
So do you mind if I take my time?

So do you mind, if I take my time? Yeah, I love women and power
We used to sit and talk for hours on the balcony
My condo, play your favorite Sade 
No love lost, just the perfect soulmate, that's all
It's my fault, caught in a rupture
Should've been you I was touchin', I knew it wasn't
My ego, I was buzzin' but not like how you wanted 
Too busy tryna flaunt it, like I just bought it 
You know them bitches 'round you can't hold water
This s'posed to be our moment
These pills set it , I'm feelin' better 
Called you to tell you I love you
But you busy with some other shit, I'm guessin'
No texts, no proof, no voice messages 
How we become enemies so effortless? 
Or was I blind while you was naked?
Or high when you was level?
Know time is of the essence
No lie, I live and regret it 
Decisions I made, embedded in my mind
Hate to admit it , but I gotta say it one time 
Should've treated you right 
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane
I should've put my focus on you
In the club every night
I just get it wrong when you do right
And I keep just fillin' your head with the lies
Oh baby, this shit comes with a price
A nigga should've loved you better
Oh-oh, oh-oh

Oh baby

Now you need me time 
The fuck I'm s'posed to do in the meantime? 
Then she told me, "Figure it out"
Should've treated you right
But every night I was livin' life in the fast lane

In the club every night

And I'm sick of dreamin' 'bout you 
Now you sick of seein' my daughter
Her eyes look like mine
Now I'm forced to pick sides
Yeah, now you wish I was the one
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep, babe 
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat, babe
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one
And now, baby
I'm the one that's s'posed to be broken 
Break me down and build me up 
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart
Woah, no, woah, yeah
Don't have the heart
Oh, yeah, oh
Girl, you was s'posed to have the first pick 
And I don't go to church like you wish I did 
I put us in this predicament
I wish you could believe me
Cryin' ain't easy
Trust me, baby, I need you to hold me
I miss my friend 
Netflix and chill at the crib
Mind, body and soul, you my rib 
Why you wish I was the one? 
Wish I was the one who couldn't sleep
Wish I was the one who couldn't eat
Wish I was the one who couldn't breathe without the other one
Now, ooh, you, you
I'm the one that's s'posed to be broken
You the one to break me down and build me up 
Wish that I could meet you halfway
But I don't have the heart 
I don't have the heart
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ohI'll pull up on 'em, pull up
Yeah
Shit, I'll get it, no cap
Sex
My lil' shawty had bumped her head
And I steady been whippin' her 
If I roll up the Maybach windows
We don't care 'bout the listeners 
I don't know what a nigga told you
But he should've told you I'm killin' him 
I've been draped in Margielas
And I don't need credentials 
If a nigga can't put that shit on 
Gotta get off the premises 
I just came from the crack of the dawn 
'Cause a nigga was strugglin' 
Had to put all my young niggas on
Ain't no jewelry we sharing 
Had to rock the two-tones on the same day
'Cause these niggas been trippin' 
I triple up, pour up my cup and it's all Tussion'
My coupe got nitro and all dustin' 
We smokin' these niggas like kush
Yeah, when we fuck on these hoes, make 'em gush 
Pop out the Bentley Mulsanne, head to Tootsies
I fuck on your ho and she say that's my pussy
I wet paper napkin, I'm wipin' my dick off
This Actavis slushin', my ho drink that Cristal
She wrapped in saran, dressed fresh as she can
'Cause I just been playin' with these bands 
I open my hand, there's nothin' but bands
Now YSL big as Japan 
I had dropped in the Lam', ducked fast as I can
'Cause I was gettin' trailed by a van 
I'm poppin', my mama, my bitch
And even my baby mama whip a sedan 
I just spent some bands, spent five-hundred grand
I'm waitin' on these bags to land 
I'm cool as a fan, you play with my man
And we come and takin' your land
I took YSL from here to the can
And got niggas waitin' to land 
I told all my niggas, "Sit back, it's a scam"
When these niggas go on a rant
My lil' shawty had bumped her head

If I roll up the Maybach windows
We don't care 'bout the listeners

'Cause a nigga was strugglin' 
Had to put all my young niggas on
Ain't no jewelry we sharing 
Had to rock the two-tones on the same day
'Cause these niggas been trippin'
Spent a whole hundred racks on the plain Jane
That's a cool pretty penny, you lil' bitty bitches
Know me by my first and my last name
I done went got the riches, I'm matchin' the vision
I'm fuckin' these hoes in the backstage
No, I don't do no kisses
She know I just tip her and send her on home like a Backpage
I been playin' with this ice, look like Ice Age
I just got me a rose gold chain, it remind me of Moët
Got the Louis V shirt and belt and chain, should have seen how I wore it 
I call the slimes that'll pull up with the things that'll kill all the noise
After U.S., now I'm headed out to Spain, I got foreign lil' whores
That biscotti, I smoke it like a train, smell that shit in my kidney
I got lil' shawty inside a Mulsanne, she don't know it's a Bentley
She asked me for a lil' help on her back end and you know that I did it
Found an old check and I went to go cash it, lot of money we gettin'
My lil' shawty had bumped her head
And I steady been whippin' her 
If I roll up the Maybach windows
We don't care 'bout the listeners

'Cause a nigga was strugglin' 
Had to put all my young niggas on
Ain't no jewelry we sharing 
Had to rock the two-tones on the same day
'Cause these niggas been trippin' 
I ordered two more two-tones
Callin' my plug on two phones
Lambos, six-fours, got it offset, it's sittin' low
My shit stainless, don't put your fingers on it
No, these ain't no finger waves, bitch, this ain't Tony! Toni! Toné!
I feel like Kurt Cobain, hit your brain with the shotgun
Get my niggas do it for me, I never shot one
And watch her get on her knees, give me that rug burn
I told her I got five on me, send me the wire 
My lil' shawty had bumped her head
And I steady been whippin' her 
If I roll up the Maybach windows
We don't care 'bout the listeners

Aight, yeahThis time she's really out my life, oh
I know I gotta get her back
Just need one night to hit it right
But I can't get her alone, no
Know she deserves to up and leave
If it was me I'd do the same
I see that girl and the life she hopes
So I'll be damned to let it go, damned to let it go
I discover, discover I love her
Oh, I gotta get her back, oh
I discover, discover that I love her

It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life
Welcome to my—
Hello, this my life in your TV
I overdose on that nightlife, them bright lights and bikinis
I keep my hand on that gold bottle, I'm tryna find me that genie
They say money doesn't buy happiness, but I'd rather cry in that
Lamborghini
Damn, I don't know who I am
I just know who I wanna be
No lookin' back, everything is in front of me
I never act like they puttin' a gun to me
I ain't stuck up, same motherfucker that I've always been
You must got me fucked up, think I changed when I got that all white Benz?
Never that though
Been on my job, sayin' I'm different now
Say I don't listen now
I don't got time to pick up the phone to hear what you bitchin' 'bout
I'm on a mission, feel like I'm missin' now
Bitch, you ain't in my position now
You never walked a mile in my shoes
I'm feeling so distant now
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life
Welcome to my life—
I've been thinkin' too much , I wonder if I did that right 
I've been drinkin' too much , I don't know what I did last night 
Tried talk to myself like, "You don't really wanna live that life" 
I wanted it all to myself like, you don't wanna give that life, away 
But I gotta leave, I can't stay
Part of me say "Keep going," that other half say, "Quit playin'" 
Gotta keep prayin' 
Even when I got it all, all these broads and alcohol
Livin' on the edge, I'm bound to fall 
But I stay movin', stay climbin' 
Puttin' in work, I stay grindin' 
Lookin' for the answer, can't find it 
That's the truth, I can't hide it 
Now or never forever, that's how I'm livin' my life
It's hard to plan for tomorrow, when you just live for the night 
Every dream in my head
It's like a mountain that I just keep climbing
And when I get to the edge
I turn around and put that dream behind me
And it never feels the way I want
But I keep on trying
I just keep on trying
Have you been there?
Have you seen it all?
Have you done this once before?
Did they tell you, you'll love this life and all these lights?
Now you're lying on the floor
And they know, what doesn't kill you makes you want it more
And this is your life
Your life, your life
Welcome to my—I dug a single seed into the ground, I hope it grows, grows
In a year or two if you're around, you'll see a rose, rose
Pack me up and keep me hidden somewhere, that you can find me
On a train to Paris going nowhere, draw the bridge behind me
Don't be gone too long 
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long 
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
When you're, when you're gone
When you're gone
Golden leaves are dancing on the ground, it's getting cold, cold 
Safe from time, we'll be forever young, never old, old
See a ball of fire out in space, zooming up behind me
All the wonder written on your face, was there inside me
Don't be gone too long 
'Cause you won't be there to love me when you're gone
Don't be gone too long 
Tell me who's gonna love me when you're gone?
Oh, oh-whoa-oh-oh

I've been looking for love in all the wrong places 
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it 
I messed up with you
I played the game but I broke all the rules
I fell out of paradise
And now all I do is cry
It hurts when you fall out of paradise
It cuts me just like a knife
Got me all of out place and it don't feel right
Got lost in the sauce
And now I'm paying the price
I fell out of paradise

'Cause I've been looking for love in all the wrong places 
And I've been looking for you in other girl's faces, it's time that I face it

Damn, it's the honest truth, I need my bitch a hunnid proof 
Forget about the past, girl, let's call a truce 
And I didn't wanna put no pain on you

Falling out of paradise

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

My friend, where it all began
Uh, lookin' back now, know you hear me, wanna see me smile
Hold me down, keep me safe, when I'm down, not a sound
Ever since you was a child, always had your back 'til now
Should've kept the circle round, now it's like you're not around
Used to run it through the town, toughest little dudes around
Always thought you had a daughter, sure to teach her what they taught us
Had a son, he gettin' smarter, every day more like his father
Know this game and keep it solid, present faith, you know you got it 
Big things come back again but ain't the same
I tell myself, "Remain the same and keep it sane"
Know it's hard when your dog ain't there to bark with ya
Seems like yesterday we was all in pictures
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began

Oh, oh-oh, oh, oh-oh

First, you both go out your way and the vibe is feelin' strong
And what's small, turned to a friendship, friendship turned to a bond
And that bond will never be broken, the love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first, then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own, when that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reached, so remember me when I'm gone
How could we not talk about family, when family's all that we got?
Everythin' I went through, you were standin' there by my side and now you gon' be with me for the last ride
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again, when I see you again

Chasing my tail like a fool
You got me going right around, right around, right around 
Chasing down your love, oh, oh, around I'm going nowhere
Damn, too important to forget you and it's hard not to miss you

Don't pull it, don't pull it, don't pull it
Blood all over the wall and dresser
And if I have the chance would I save her life?
If I never cheated, she wouldn't have died

Since we sat and talked for hours
Girl, it's just ain't right, when you give me the run around
I can't even give you flowers
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplatin', I'm just waitin' on your call
We couldn't last 'til the Winter and now it's Fall
We fell in love, I'm still fallin'
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me
Don't know how many days in a year
Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round 'til I catch up
Oh, yeah 
Now why the hell I let you get away from me? 
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasons
Girl, I've given my time and all my love
Not to mention, I didn't cheat but you didn't even trust me
Even when you out late night, messages on your phone, baby
I never said a word, I just left it alone
It's all in your head when your friends talk about me
You run away from the truth and accept the lies, you doubt me
I'm like a fool contemplatin', I'm just waitin' on your call
We couldn't last through the Winter and now it's Fall
Girl, we fell in love, I'm still fallin'
Sometimes I let my thoughts run away from me 
Don't know how many days in a year
Runnin' 'round, runnin' 'round 'til I catch up 
Oh, yeah 
Now why the hell I let you get away from me? 
Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasons

Never thought that I would say goodbye to my girl, no, oh
Girl, you changed like the seasonsWhy am I mad? I don't get it
It seems like every time you give me signs and I miss it
I did it again, I admit it
I left you standing there and now I regret it
Seems like every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it
And I get all tongue-tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
Now why didn't I give you my two cents?
A million reasons why I should have and it makes no sense
So here I am, by myself again
Stopping for green lights and I know I wanna be more than friends
How come every time I get the chance
I lose my cool and I blow it?
And I get all tongue-tied, lost in your eyes
I'm a fool and I know it, hey
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you
I should've told you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
So I turned the car around and you were right where I left you
And your smile said you were feeling it too
And the moon shone bright 'cause when your lips met mine
And yeah, I finally got it right, I'll be leaving with you tonight
And I won't have to say...
I should've kissed you, I should've told you
Told you just how I feel
And next time I won't stop, I'll listen to my heart
'Cause what I feel is real
I should've kissed you, girl
I should've showed you how I feel
I should've kissed you
I should've showed you just how I feel
Girl, I should've kissed you
I should've told you, told you just how I feel
And this time I won't stop until I have your heart
'Cause what I'm feeling is realEverybody sees this you
I'm the one that lost the view
Everybody says we're through
I hope you haven't said it too
So where do we go from here
With all this fear in our eyes?
And where can love take us now?
We've been so far down
We can still touch the sky if we crawl
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah
Why did I change the pace?
Hearts were never meant to race
Always felt the need for space
And now I can't reach your face 
So where are you standing now?
Are you in the crowd of my faults? 
Love, can't you see my hand?
I need one more chance
We can still have it all so we'll crawl 
'Til we can walk again
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
Back to love, yeah
Back to love, yeah
Everybody sees this you
Well, I never wanna lose that view
So we'll crawl  'til we can walk again
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly until there is no wind
So let's crawl, crawl, crawl
So we'll crawl  'til we can walk again 
Then we'll run  until we're strong enough to jump
Then we'll fly  until there is no wind
So let's crawl, let's crawl, let's crawl

Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of me
I done been through Hell and back
I'm seein' demons everyday, callin' the kettle black
Perfectionists, if you're perfect, where your medal at?
My life was goin' downhill, I had to pedal back
These niggas always wanna talk about the lame shit
If I looked back on my life, I wouldn't change shit
Maybe a couple more cars so I can lane switch
If I put that mic on silence and never sang shit
This my life and that's your job, dawg
I'm too high, got me thinkin' did the clouds fall? Prolly not
Shit, just put me back up in the bleachers
Back when all a nigga had was a pair of sneakers
All this stress on my chest, I'm fuckin' having seizures
Nowadays, havin' fun is fuckin' illegal
Walkin' with your head down, that's not grown man shit
I'm takin' over the game until I own that bitch
Yeah, nigga, in my hood them choppers always bussin'
Niggas livin' day-to-day like tomorrow ain't nothin'
Fuck love, that shit get in the way now
She lovin' every nigga, ass up and face down
Addicted to the game, my youngin's use a .38, first 48
They gon' throw that shit away, bet they never catch a case

If I die and float away, you gon' feel my mama pain
Sittin' in my room, I'm reminiscin'
Shit, I ain't have a pot to piss in
Family whippin' crack up in the kitchen
All eyes on me, so pay attention
Got a problem with the D.A., should've stayed my ass in V.A
Thousand hours, some bull, pickin' trash up off the freeway
I'm the nigga that the kids lookin' up to
Straight As now, before they say, "Fuck school," ha
And I don't bite my tongue for no weak nigga
'Cause y'all never had to starve for a week, nigga
No clothes but .44 to a household
Stomach growlin' but I kept my fuckin' mouth closed
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me 
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of me 
Came in the game thinkin' music was the way out
To get us off the corners, hit records was the payout
Hard transitionin' from hustlin' 'til it's grey out
A decade with the devil, lemme show you how this play out
Started as a duo, didn't stay a duo
Things fall apart, Ricky Martin left Menudo
Was a team of us, everything was for the crew though
Never Rosé while my niggas sippin' Nuvo
So, so records bought more dope
Every record label dollar went to more coke
Ghetto rich but still scramblin' like we poor folks
We was all goin' left from what the Lord taught
The pressure, my pride wouldn't let up
The way they took my niggas had us thinkin' we was set up
All at once so the pain hardly let up
Now this bitch mumblin' 'round the house about she fed up
Yugh, when it rains, it pours, nigga
Dope boys expect the money, hungry whore, nigga
Woo, with my niggas and the feds
Do you think I give a fuck if Def Jam is in the red?
They'll undership your record while they pillow talk in bed
So I never try to talk them motherfuckers off the ledge
"Jump nigga," like Joe Clark said
If you ain't tryna win then you better off dead, gone
If these walls could speak
I wouldn't have to make believe you're here
Holy angel, just start the fire that burns in me
I need a savior 'cause I'm scared of meJahlil Beats, holla at me

Never thought of what I might need, need, need
Ain't it funny, how I spend my whole life running

It feels like I'm four years old all over again
Because I'm just running fast but should be walking
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"
I guess I was faking 'cause look at all the money I'm making
Still nothing can compare to the thought of love
But it's taking too much time to see that I'm wasting
Reaching for the sky-y and coming down with nothing
It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast but should be walking
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"
I'm so alone
I feel so alone
So alone in this world
Got everything I want
It feels like I'm four years old all over again
'Cause I just keep running fast but should be walking 
Saying, "When I grow up you gon' see
I'm gon' be comfortable and happy"

Yeah, smash on the radio, bet I penned it If you had a choice then what would you choose to do?
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without
If I couldn't blink would I still be able to see you?
I couldn't imagine, oh
Without arms could I reach?
No way could I ever hold you, oh
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without
Oh, oh-oh-oh
Woah, oh
If I couldn't dream would I believe that there could be a you and me?
And if I couldn't sing, would you be able to hear my melody?
I know that something's wrong and I'm afraid that you're moving on
How can I fly when you're my wings?
I need these things like I need you
If you had a choice, what would you choose?
I could live without money, I could live without the fame
And if every day was sunny, I could live without the rain
And if I ever went up to Heaven, I would fall right back down
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without
You can take it all from me and it wouldn't mean anything
Turn the whole world against me as long as you don't leave
It's getting hard for me to sleep, even harder for me to breathe
I'm used to life with you, tell me what I need to do
I could live without money , I could live without the fame 
And if every day was sunny , I could live without the rain 
And if I ever went up to Heaven , I would fall right back down 
That life wouldn't be living  'cause you're the one I couldn't live without 
I could live without money , I could live without the fame 
And if every day was sunny , I could live without the rain 
And if I ever went up to Heaven , I would fall right back down 
That life wouldn't be living 'cause you're the one I couldn't live without K-K-K-K-K-Mac

Please stop acting like you know me
On my place, tryna keep us going
You got the right, the right to live it up
Shine 'til your light is bright and big enough
And if you bow down, come on, pick it up
When you aim for the sky, you start lifting up

Only your love can save me

When the rain falls down
Watch me clean, baptised up in your love, ay

Always tension, to get my attention
And I've waited, been so patient
So sick and tired of your lying, I can't take it
I'm flipping this tarot card
This is life, we can't change it
We're like the pyramids aligned with Orion
How could a love that's so new feel so ancient?
I guess that love runs out of love eventually
I can't change what's meant to be
Looks like this our final destination
All this love we made
We gon' let it fade away
It's time , to let it die now
Before I let you kill me
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
I'll let our love rest in peace
Love rest in peace
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
This love is a battlefield, I'm just a soldier
I need to call the cavalry
'Cause you're taking over
Without all these different emotions
And all your ulterior motives
Girl, I don't care the fight with you
You can't have that, I just want it all back
'Cause I planned to spend my life with you
And now it's rainy days and dark clouds
Tears feel like rain on my window
Baby, can you tell me...
How could a love that's so new feel so ancient?
I guess that love runs out of love eventually
I can't change what's meant to be
Looks like this our final destination 
All this love we made
We gon' let it fade away 
It's time , to let it die now
Before I let you kill me 
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Girl, I'll let our love rest in peace
Baby, 'cause all our love right now is resting in peace
Baby, I can't take this love, you know that you're killing me, babe
I'm gone, I'm gone, I'm gone
Oh, oh
Girl, you're killing me, baby
You're trouble, babe
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, oh, ohOh mother, sweet Caroline
Feels like you shot me with a .38 or a .45
And my heart's bleeding, baby
Can't feel my legs I'm paralyzed
I know you just in it for the moment, so I'll enjoy the ride
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone
I can see all of nothin', what's happenin'?
Can't even look at your face, girl, I'm fadin' away
Girl, your drug is automatic
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh-oh
You're my sweet Caroline , my sweet Caroline
Ooh, baby, I'm down
As long as you do the same, I'll try the same shit right now, right now
Baby, tell me when you start to feel it 
Got me dead, oh , yeah, baby 
Just let go of all the emotion, all the emotion
Just let it out, fly with me
Eyes start rolling in back of my head, girl, I'm already gone
I can see all of nothin', what's happenin'?
Can't even look at your face, girl, I'm fadin' away
Girl, your drug is automatic
Higher than a fan, one sip of that, lights out
I'm just floating above the clouds, it really feels like life
Sweet love of mine, oh-oh
You're my sweet Caroline , my sweet Caroline
Breezy, let me make sure Caroline understands somethin'
Here I go, when I step up in the spot like another block
When the nigga drop stop, you ain't even got a clue
Regularly, man, a nigga that need to be seen
Medically, tell me what you really wanna do
Generally, niggas think they better than me, boo
Niggas really tryna put they foot up in my shoe
That's when I make a panic, I don't really understand it
That's when I lay 'em down, they tryna get a better view
Genuinely see the way I regularly choose
Whack niggas switch, I'm up to legendary view
Somethin' from benal, they already really knew
Instead of tryna fuck you, need to get a better crew
Lactose, switch, I came up back close
Better know I back those, I don't wanna let it go 
Damn folks, shawty wanna stand close
When a nigga bang those panties, and I let it blow 
He didn't really wanna do it
Then what it gets a nigga that be flowin' like a fluid
And I be damagin' everything every time a nigga get up on it, it's nothin'
We know that they already do it and ain't nothin' really to it
Pull up, stop, how 'bout a drop top?
Then I'm unlocked, I got my Glock cocked
That's how we do it over here
Do not hop on the mic on a wrong block, not
Y'all niggas know what it is

3 A.M. when my phone ring
Begging me to come by, I was right around the corner 
I know I could've said no, but I ain't stop
Told me, "Come in, the door's unlocked for you"
My intuition, I should have listened to it
My girl, yo, she'd be pissed if she knew about this visit 
She had a tank top on, I took her tank top off but should've stopped 
But she ain't let me, kissed me soft and gently, she tempt me
Right then I stopped thinking consequences 
Guess I must have lost my mind for a minute, listen
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust 
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up 
One phone call started this whole thing now 
Look at the damage 
Look at the damage 
Damage, damage that I caused you 
I know I broke your heart 
'Cause I did you wrong now look at the damage 
Look at the damage that I caused
The dumbest decision that I made that I ain't proud of
A few hours that meant absolutely nothing cost me your love 
I gotta live with regret, deserve to get what you give
Now you won't listen to nothing that I'm saying 
I rode passed your house for hours, just to feel close to ya
No cards, no gifts, no flowers, could get me back with you
Your kiss, your touch, girl, you know I'm missing 
But you got my heart inside a prison, listen 
Girl, you know that I love
Girl, I love you, with her, that was lust 
Shouldn't have happened, I know I messed up

Don’t fuck with my old bitch, it’s like a bad fur

Bitches breakin' codes, but I'm the password
Now it’s time for young niggas to shut down shit 
If you yappin' in the club then you surrounded 
They say he trippin' on some greyhound shit 
He didn't listen, now he listenin' to the ground, bitch

Hand on his chest, holdin' his heart, pledge of allegiance
Damn, his bitch cold, need a Theraflu
Took ‘em shoppin', bought ‘em 1500 pair of shoes
Ha, Theraflu

Her booty super thick, but her tummy super small
And when she dancin', the booty swallow up her draws

Bottle in my hand, mean muggin' like I'm ugly
Only models in my section, get them uglies 'way from me
And when they be like, I just play dummy
In the party got them white girls rollin' like whoa
In the mornin' they be like, "Where the fuck are my clothes?
Please don't tell nobody cause I don't really do this"
Sure, what you think I'm stupid?
I told her just to call me dada
But shorty Spanish so she wanna call me papa, or papi
Never met a nigga like me
I swept her up, so I guess she had light feet

Good sex is a passionate art, let's put some paint where it ain't
Couple hickies, couple bites, scratches and marks, we need to leave marks
Marking that territory, like a flare gun, flash in the dark, so we know what we at with it
We used to do each other real good, now we do it real smart

No clouds in my stones, let it rain
I hydroplane in the bank coming down with the Dow Jones 
When the clouds come, we gone, we Roc-A-Fella 
We fly higher than weather, in G5's or better
You know me, in anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay, Rain Man is back 
With little Ms. Sunshine, Rihanna, where you at? 
You have my heart and we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines but you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark, you can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there, with you I'll always share because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
Under my umbrella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You're becoming a dream to me, a fairytale fantasy
Nothing can never compare an image to my memory
Girl, I'm asking, could you be my queen? A vision on a magazine
That's when I'll be there, it's something we both share because
When the sun shine, we'll shine together
You know I'll be here forever
Although it's a lot of rain outside
Girl, it's getting late, and you can stay the night
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car, I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You can run into my arms
It's okay don't be alarmed
Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and say my name some more
I'll be all you need and more 
Because
When the sun shines, we'll shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be a friend
Took an oath, I'mna stick it out till the end
But you can dip out anytime whenever
I can call a car I ain't tryna stress ya
I'm looking for the one with the glass slipper
Baby girl, you can be my Cinderella, ella, ella, ayy, ayy, ayy

Even if it's raining or it's pouring outside, I'ma have you by my side
I can't tell you no-no, no
We can love forever, always be together
I can't tell you no-no, no
And make it last forever, make it last forever, ohWhen a bitch say she fucked 20 niggas, I respect her more
Instead of running 'round this motherfucker lying all the time
Talking 'bout some
5 niggas, 5 niggas you cared about, shit
Bitch you lying and girl I'm built honest
Still living for today, tomorrow ain't promised
Holding on to the love cause the hate follows
When you young, getting money, yeah you date models
Let the cork pop off when we shake bottles
You don't need a glass, gulp, just take swallows
Yeah, young and reckless, I spike her beverage
Self medicated, pills or liquor, what's your preference?
She usually ain't the type to take rejection
She don't know her dad so the hate turned into affection
She only dreamed to be up in my section
Believing any lie they tell her just to get her naked
Bitches keep playing games like it's checkers
But bitch this chess and those DD's gon' be your blessing
I'm looking forward to all them text messages
Talking 'bout how you done, I love when bitches threaten me
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind
She said follow me , she wanna fuck up a nigga's Valentine
Pardon me, only thing growing on me is the dollar signs
Oh baby, I'm only used to your ways
Say you in love and you ain't, try to be honest, you can't
You always tripping on the same minor drugs
I do for the piece of mind and you do when you 'bout to fuck
I leave, act up and leave you and something trap out the bando
But I want a nigga call the curtain, choppers fired and it's having the fam over
That's the thing, I love to hate so I got a whip for my bitch
If you think I'm cuffing, you should forget it
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermind
You never wanna hear it, you never wanna be there
You never take me serious, you piece of shit, let's be fair
Know you got it from your mama, the day I met her she said "Why he here?"
Where the fuck you put your heart at? Bitches that pulling ain't all that
You on another level, showing off, tryna make me jealous
All the homies that been a problem, nigga bring the weapons
AKs and the fans, disrespecting
They close to my kin, OHB shit
I'ma keep it real with you baby
Understand me, don't tell you lies
I feel your love is premeditated
Too complicated, never willing to try
When I locked it down, she freed up
Coco in her nose she loves the freedom
Now she changing niggas like the seasons
Got it good but I feel distant in my mind, can't help think I'm mastermindYou ain’t nothing but trouble, yeah, yeah

And I can't take 'em all with me is my only issue
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
And show them how to do the chocha, hit it like Sosa
I wanna leave out of here, take 'em back to the crib
'Cause they know what I'm thinking, they look better naked
There's so many ladies
Up in this club I can choose from
And they all look amazing
That's why it's so hard to just pick one
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules
And girl singing melodies

And can't get enough of me
I had a girl singing like me
I had a girl singing like me

All this bottle popping got me feeling nicely
Leaving by myself is highly unlikely
Looking for a right now, don't need no wifey
Settling down with one chick, that ain't even like me
So many women in the atmosphere 
Gotta leave with at least three and a pair 
The look in they eyes telling me that they want it
Don't like it that much to put a ring on it
There's so many ladies
Up in this club I can choose from
And they all look amazing
That's why it's so hard to just pick one 
When I get 'em off to the room, we ain't playing by no rules

Too many bills when the mail come

But sometimes I wanna wake up and be on my own
Sometimes I don't wanna walk by and smile
But at the same time, I don't wanna let people down
 Can you imagine, the weight of a world
 Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
 And no one can reach you , ooh
 So no one can help you now 
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down 
I'm standing up , but I'm fallin' down 
Time keeps on ticking, I wish there was a way to slow it down 
Someone pick me up  'cause I'm fallin' down 
Fallin' down  down  down  down 
Fallin' down  down  down  down
Why is it so easy for you to blame?
I'm only human, we're all the same
I've given up everything in exchange for being alone
I'm shaking these demons underneath all the pride, oh-woah
 Can you imagine, the weight of a world
 Placed on your shoulders, trapped in this world?
 And no one can reach you , ooh
 So no one can help you now 
It's getting heavy, I think I'm 'bout ready to break down 
I'm standing up , but I'm fallin' down

Yeah
It's a three-sixty turn, it's ending where we begin
Beginning like here's the end, like kissing and missing class
What we needed to learn was different than just some math
This the big picture, we missed it, the figures just didn't add up
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words , it could be love, right? Uh-huh 
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn, it was just 'cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby, you know
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
'Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
How do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you
Still love you, still love—
It's a plot twist, just when you said I got this
Right when the fight has stopped, it seemed right but it felt wrong
Held on, all them nights we held on, we can't let it go
But if we don't then we will never know
We said let's not leave on bad terms
In between them bad words, it could be love, right? Uh-huh 
But are we gon' leave when it's this good? Damn, it was just 'cause
Seems this loving's all for nothing, baby, you know
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you, still love you
A happy ending makes you cry
'Cause it ends when you don't want to, don't want to, yeah
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start
But how do I explain this nonsense to my heart? 
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you
Still love you, still love—
Oh-oh-oh-oh 
My heart is aching thinking 'bout all the love we wasted
Ooh, ooh, ooh 
My heart's impatient, can't understand the time we're taking
A heart can't have , my heart can't decide 
But it's telling me it's right
And I know that we should just call it quits
But I'm thinking that all of this gotta change 
'Cause my heart's going insane
A heart ain't a brain
But I think that I still love you 
A happy ending makes you cry 
'Cause it ends when you don't want to 
And it makes perfect sense to end it like the start 
And how do I explain this nonsense to my heart?
A heart ain't a brain but I'm thinking that I still love you 
Still love you, still love you
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you 
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you 
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah 
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you 
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love you 
Woah-ah, woah-woah-ah, woah
A heart ain't a brain but I think I love youIf I asked to kiss ya
Would you say yes or turn and walk away, oh baby?

For me to make you mine

All I know is we made love all over my place
And that's all I can remember, but my condo gave the play-by-play
It started when I seen all of the bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that somethin' crazy here went on
Sex was everywhere, whipped cream all over the counter
But she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, but the only thing I found was
Lipstick on the glass 
'Cause we drank, got drunk, that night, we lived it up 
Yeah, that night we did it up
And now the only trace I found was lipstick on the glass 
Shot after shot, we got high, sippin', we tore it up 
Now all I got left is the lipstick on the glass
I can still smell your perfume in my home
I can still taste the sweetness of your touch
I should ask the neighbors, maybe they know
I know they heard us lovin' on the night before
I'm tryna find out where you are, hope you not very far
I gotta find you, girl, where we can have another night with all these
Bottles of Patrón
Empty, obvious that somethin' crazy here went on
Sex was everywhere, whipped cream all over the counter
But she's nowhere to be found
I took a look around, that's when I saw that she left the
Lipstick on the glass 
'Cause we drank, got drunk, that night, we lived it up 
Yeah, that night we lived up
And now the only trace I found was lipstick on the glass 
Shot after shot, we got high, sippin', we tore it up

I know where that missing diamond should...
Go-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?
I didn't think so
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a one in a million you 
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould
There will never be another you
Oh, never be another you
Oh-oh, never be another you
Now I can spend my whole life
Searching for something that's better than my dear
But that's a waste of my time
'Cause what’s better than perfect love?
Nothing that’s what my point is
You can stand in front of a mirror 
And there wouldn't be a reflection, no
'Cause there's only one of you
And that's why I never let you...
Go-oh-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh
Is there a magical garden where more of you
Grow-whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh?

There will never be another you
Oh , never be another you 
Oh-oh , never be another you

But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say whatever, man, it don't even matter
'Cause I know our love is true
I'm a firm believer in never say never
But I can say I'll never find another you
They can say whatever, man, it don't even matter
'Cause I know our love is true 
Feel like I just won the lotto, I found a one in a million you 
God made you from the Earth and he broke the mould 
There will never be another you

Wishing that I could just change the past, babe
One day, my love could change again

So I'm leaping off the ledge with no pressure
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end, it's all worth it
Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling
Geronimo
No more holding back, finally letting go
I'm gonna show you I ain't scared to jump
And you don't even seem that far away
Yeah, yeah, I'll base jump, base jump
For your love
Up in the rain, as I'm falling through the storm
And the lightning's in my face, girl, you're beautiful
Oh what a day 'cause girl, it ain't the usual
And the sky is bright now
And I can feel it 'cause I'm getting closer
And no one else gave me a chance to fly
Feels like I'm in outer space
And your gravity's pulling me down right now
Like an acrobat or a fighter jet
I'll just soar through the air 'cause I'm so fearless 
When I reach my mark, hope that it's your heart
At the end, it's all worth it
Just so I scream geronimo
Girl, the clouds are blinding my eyes from free falling 
Geronimo

10 girls in the back seat, nigga, I'm winnin'
She broke my heart, I guess she a superstar now
When all I really needed was your love
She don't wanna love me no more 
She said I was doing too much 
And now I'm all alone with nobody 
I might as hell roll up
I'm tired of fighting 
Already been down that road 
And she don't wanna love me no more 
She don't wanna love me no more 
She don't wanna love me no more
All her shit parked front at the door

They say love don't cost a thing
But I can see change, girl, keep it one hunnid
If you really wanna leave
If you really wanna go, you gotta make it through me
I ain't doin' this alone
Think I'm goin' insane and it usually turns you on but right now
She don't wanna love me no more 
She said I was doing too much 
And now I'm all alone with nobody 
I might as hell roll up

Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
Told you that I'm leaving, deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah 
I know you're mad, but so what? I wish you best of luck

What you mean I ain't call you? I hit you when I landed
I'm waitin' in my hotel room
Seems like we're arguin' more and it's gettin' less romantic
Yeah, I think she'll be able to tell soon
But I'll fuck you right, I will, I fuck you right, I will
I'll fuck you like no one has ever, ever made you feel
I mean, this part of our relationship's amazin' still
I might just put up with the arguin' and stay, for real
You lookin' bad, girl, for goodness sakes
You with all those curves, and me without no brakes, ooh
I'm willin' to work it out however long it takes you
You feel like you miss those happy days
Well, girl, that makes two of us, our timing is wrong
Your friends always tyin' up every line on your phone
Yeah, but tell them bitches that you'll always be my missus
And the hardest part about the fuckin' business
Is mindin' your own, uh, and every time I try and break it off
We just yell until we tired, then I break you off
It's useless, all this fightin', let's get past it now
Even when I throw them deuces, you just send it back around
You know what, yo? You a bitch
You should have a travel agent, ‘cause you a trip
You should make your own toilet tissue since you the shit
But all you got is some fuckin' issues, you fuckin' bitch
I hate niggas, but I love your mom
Give her a kiss for me, her second son
Get your mind right, baby, or get your shit together
You gonna be hot a little while, I'ma be rich forever
Girl seducers, they come in deuces
But when I cut 'em off they always become a nuisance
Niggas take my old flows and they take my old swag
He just took my old bitch and turned it to his new bitch 
I'm stupid, but I won't get my drama on
What I'm dealin' with is too real for me to comment on
Jay finally got it through my head not to run my mouth
So when you talk 'bout “you know who”
I don't know who you talkin' 'bout
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
The farewell email from a female
But I’m a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she’s not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can’t ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store, and leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her; ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this is all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It’s hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it’s juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase the Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to herMan, y'all don't know what y'all do for me

You know you make me laughEvery child grows up, with the thought of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most is never there?
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit 10, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends, just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
I need, I needed you
Every child grows up, with the thought of being something special in life
But what happens when the one that they depend on the most is never there?
I need, I needed you
Told that I'm supposed to fail
I wouldn't amount to much of nothing
Yes, I pray
There was days I wondered if you really loved me
But baby, you feel pain
Mama was sane when I felt like running away
I couldn't take it
I soon hit 10, angry with all of the world
I couldn't keep friends just wishing you'd come back and see
My difficult times being an adolescent
And like so many just like me without a shoulder to lean
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
17 when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
Mama had no financial help
And thoughts of breaking the law came
See her hurt tryna hold down two jobs
Was tearing up on me
Had a way
All my friends was getting it in
It came time for me to get that dough
Wrong or right
I had to go for what I know
I needed you when I needed a father figure
I needed you to stop me from making the wrong decisions
At 17, when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
I needed you
I need, I needed you
I needed you
I need, I need you
17 when the cold of the world had my back up against the wall
When temptation was calling me, didn't know which way to go
Lord I pray, give me strength to forgive them and not all the I hate I got
Even though the pain sometimes as too heavy

'Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'
All of my grindin', you know I grind

Who got award shows rockin' every time I hit the stage?

The more I got the money , the more I got the problems, ayo

You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up 
'Cause it's already written on the wall
You can't cover it up, you can't cover it up 
It's already done, ain't gotta paint no more
With all this pain that I've endured
I know I was wrong for what I did 
And I made some mistakes 'cause I'm human 
I ain't gon' feed into the negative
I'ma keep grinding, oh, yeah 
But this graffiti, oh, oh, oh
'Cause I already put in time with all of my grindin'
All of my grindin', you know I grind
Through all of this struggle, all of this struggle
Even through the pain, I still had to hustle

You decide to neglect when the truth is that...

My young niggas shootin' shit Curry but they more like Horry in the clutch
It all started with a quarter, turned that to a Porsche now them Lamb' doors are up
Kinda hard to find a room in the crib like a fortress and them Xans catchin' up
Used to trap out the garage, sell packs to the stars
Was the man with the Act' and a plug for the bars
Had the MDMA 'fore they knew what it was
Man they kill 'em off of X, I'm a one stop plug
Young legend with the mud

From the first time that I ever saw you

And I know it's not like me getting beside myself
She got me feeling that way
And I know it's unlikely that you're gon' deny me
And just walk away

Too beautiful, you don't need no make-up 
'Cause you a dime already
I need the type of bad bitch sleepin' by my side when I wake up
And all my diamonds shinin'
Let me light you up, you know our time is priceless
I-I-I know that this your first time, live it up
You try to hit me up when you need me
It was over 'cause I put my faith in you
Yeah, I'm hella cocky, I'm conceited, hella charged up
Bitch, I'm in my feelings for a fuckin' reason
I ain't got to lie to you 
If you ain't in love then why do it?
Shattered my heart
Fuckin' bitches 'cause we fell apart
And you know I'ma go to war for you
Like it or not, no

And everytime I tryna say some, you don't believe me 
Girl, you so damn cold, I've been down this road before

I'm sick of running around 
I need somebody around 
Grocery shopping around 
Baby, you got a key to the house
Never again, that's on my city, never again 
How am I supposed to trust you when your love's inconsistent?
But you've been going on and on 'bout commitment
Yeah, yeah, commitment 
God as my witness, commitment 
Commitment , commitment 
Living is living, cheating is cheating
Winning is winning
You won't be committed
But married to me like a federal sentence
I'ma handle my business, 'cause you make a difference
Don't see other bitches
You can't compare living
To finish each others sentences
And we got to go
Just looking back at all this shit that you did for me
I'm 'bout to buy this bitch a Rolls
Met her on internet, high but it weren't from the weed
We never beef, she always lie to police
That bitch a rider for me
And then when I put designer on her feet
I'ma cuff it, but I'm not the police
Commitment
Yeah, yeah, commitment
God as my witness, commitment
Commitment, commitmentHold up, hold up, what you saying, babe?
I heard that your love's only a mile away
Moving slower, why am I wide awake?
All of this pain I'm tryna take away
Don't bother me, don't even bother calling
Drinking it tonight, I'm an alcoholic
Now I wanna try
Something new tonight
Where the fuck is my lighter? 
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up 
Throw my drink in the fire 
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape
Turn the lights off, I wanna blackout 
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?
I'ma take away the pain while I'm runnin' with the flame
In the night time, I'ma come alive
When I'm seein' a crazy face, but none of ‘em look the same
I'ma let go, just wanna let go
Can't hear what you're sayin', while the liquor playin'
Killin' my brain, it's suicide
My veins burnin' up, it feels like I'm gon' die
I'll take two shots, fuck it if you watchin'
Give me the bottle, I'ma down it
I'ma roll up with the Swisher
Where the fuck is my lighter? 
I'm tired of all this shit, I want to light up 
Throw my drink in the fire 
Just let me pass out, I just wanna escape 
Turn the lights off, I wanna blackout 
We are not one and the same
So where the fuck is my lighter?That last hour was the worst
When we remember forever
Blessing and a curse
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back for more hours
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Don't watch time slip away
Like true love with no rail, that's right
Seen blue skies turning grey
Ooh, if we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back for more hours
Daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could revisit that moment again
I would never let us end that way
Like daylight savings
Like daylight savings
If we could fall back one more hour
Maybe we could've made it work
Maybe we should've focused on each other first
Could've left off on better terms
If we could fall back one more hourWhat you looking for, baby?

They try to break us up
They don't understand our love
'Cause it gets too deep, girl
Check me
I know a way to make a bunch of people love me 
If you were to leave me all by myself
As soon as we turn our way back, they hustle out

Baby, sorry, the things I said and the things I did
If you want to hurry home 'cause I'm sitting here alone 'cause I miss you

But I kept my heart out of reach
Feeling strong enough to carry us
Still I violated every trust
Is it too late, I wonder, to say I'm sorry?
Too late, I wonder, to beg your pardon?
All I think about is how I messed it up
And all I think about is how I need your love
And if I had it to do all over
I would find me another way
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another

And If I can see you
I'll tell you that I'm sorry
I'll tell you that it's my fault
And I don't wanna be alone
And if I can hold you
I'll love you like I never did before
And then I would love you more
Never, ever let you go
I swear that if I had it to do all over 
I would find me another way 
To express what's on my mind
And try to find me the words I wanna say
And now I'm too hurt to love another 
But I'm too proud to ask you back 
I don't know if you'll ever get to hear this song
But I needed to tell you that, when I 
When I first let you go, I ain't know that it would hurt but I miss you 
I ain't never had it bad but each day is getting worse 'cause I miss you
And if I could see you again, I'd say, baby

I remember Saturday mornings
Me waking up to mama in the kitchen cooking to Sam Cook
And I was just a young dude, watching morning cartoons
Waiting for mama to braid my hair
I used to hate to get it done 'cause she'd braid it too tight
My mama always gave a style, she knew I would like
And then I would go outside and play, she'd sit on the front porch
While me and Rob played ball
Mama always did little things like that
Mama always will know I love her for that
For all the things that you used to do
Mama, I dedicate this one to you
It's straight from the heart, this is your song

She's like the mother of Tappahannock, VA 
Everybody knew miss Joyce where we stayed 
Old heads said she was cool, nothing that she wouldn't do
What about CB? She was known I acted a fool
 With the little money that she made
She took the bad and made it all okay
Nights at the daycare, when we had to stay there
Always held it down, so I gotta thank you now
Mama always did little things like that 
Mama always will know I love her for that 
For all the things that you used to do
Mama, I dedicate this one to you
It's straight from the heart, this is your song
You're my lucky charm so you already know

Staring down at the phone
Damn, what did I do that was so wrong?
And girl, I never thought you would move on
Can't believe you're gone
It's killing me, my heart ain't your home
Thought I was the one but you done left me out
And now
Now I can't see nothing 
And now my everything done turned to nothing 
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing 
Wish I could've stopped you walking out
Should have screamed out loud 
Baby, can't you hear me? 
Don't you miss me? 
'Cause I'm hurting, girl, I wish that you could feel me 
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me or something 
You ain't saying nothing, no
I never even gave you 100 percent
I never said what I meant, damn
Girl, I never thought you'd be burnt out, now my heart is breaking down
It's killing me, I can't save it and it's gone
Thought I was the one but you done left me out
And now
Now I can't see nothing
And now my everything done turned to nothing 
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing 
Wish I could've stopped you walking out 
Should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me? 
Don't you miss me? 
'Cause I'm hurting, girl, I wish that you could feel me
I guess there's nothing
Wish that you would talk to me or something 
You ain't saying nothing, no
One of the things I miss most is how you made me feel so right 
And even though you're gone, I'm all alone, hey
I dream 'bout you day and night
Day and night , I'm breaking down
I'm wishing my baby was next to me
Can't you see? 'Cause I don't know who else to love 
Now I can't see nothing
And now my everything done turned to nothing 
What can I do? What can I say? Nothing 
Wish I could've stopped you walking out
Should have screamed out loud
Baby, can't you hear me?

Talk to the whole world, man
Ghetto America, talk to 'em, man 
It's been a struggle for me
Wondering why I can't get by with my life
But now I'm free
And I done did some right and wrong but still I seen the light
And I done been around the sex and drugs
Hustling but mama ain't raise no thug
And it took a little to see
How real it could get and how this life wasn't meant for me 'cause I
Seen a lot of bad things on my block
But I ain't wanna be a victim of a gunshot
I can't let nothing hold me down
See all the things I heard about 
See all the things I've read about 
I seen the light 
It's kinda hard for me
To stay away from all these girls and the haters, they don't like
That I'm fulfilling my dream
But I'm just tryna do my thing, my nigga, can't I live my life?
I got the world on my shoulders 
And I'm only getting older 
But it's like it's getting colder
I'm gon' make it but I can't take it sometimes
I came a long way from my block
And I'm grateful for everything I got
I didn't let nothing bring me down
See all the things I heard about 
See all the things I've read about
I seen the light
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Wow, huh man, after all this, who woulda thought? 
Ah, ah, ah-ah, ah
Little boy from Tappahannock, Virginia
Y'all know what I'm saying? Would make it all the way to the top
Life is vivid but seen through the eyes of a righteous spirit
They try to show us the light but we don't like to hear it 
Mama told me I was bright but despite her lyrics
A large heard across my sight, I had to fight to clear it 
Like a runner, a couple of summers, I often wondered if it
Really was winter and that's when I heard the thunder
A current was occurrin', it was stirrin' up my hunger
But I couldn't let the **** bury a ***** under 
Used to cry hopin' all of this would pass
And then I learned to use my tears to water up the grass
A part of my swag but apparently I've won
'Cause I took my shades off and now I'm starin' at the sun
I'm seein' the light, I'm seein' the light
Uh, realizin' that it's me in the light
I read about it 
Heard about it , and now I know 
I coulda did wrong
I seen a lot of people hustle but I left them things alone
I almost lost my friend to the struggle
But I guess that made me strong, made me strong
I seen a whole lot of drama and it taught me how to fight
Taught me how to fight
And I thank God for my mama, she showed me what was right
I coulda been in the dark, but thank God for the light
 I seen the light
See all the things I heard about
All the things I've heard about
See all the things I've read about
I've read about it, I've read about it, oh
I seen the light

I know you've been tellin' everybody who would listen
That I ain't shit

But that's your perspective 
And you know perspective's subjective 
I, I don't blame you, baby
You lie, so leave, baby
That's okay 'cause you gonna do what you wanna do 
Play it like you wanna, move how you wanna move 
I ain't gon' stop ya, say what you wanna say 
That's okay, it's okay
Ah, guess you gotta do whatever helps you sleep at night 
Hope you're comfortable layin' your head down on your pride 
Holdin' on to lonely ego empty bed of lies
But, whatever helps you sleep at night, at night
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh no
Ooh
Ooh-ooh-oohShout out to La the Dark
Monday through Sunday, we rock different pairs
Feel me 
Gangsta Grillz, bastards
I got a problem, I got the answer now
No more singin' chicks I'm messin' with a dancer now
She got a stripper pole, know how to break it down
She went from nothin' to somethin', she tryna make it now
She's original, I boosted up her style
She got her downtown pierced just to make me smile
We was finna go, but she naked now
And she did it in front of an audience
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil' waist, I ain't stupid, can't let it go to waste
Man, damn, she got swag
Temperature's heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash
Go and try to get her, but when you do, she say that I'm with her
They ain't got the last, I'm chasin' with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers
And you know I never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
I can't get rid of her, can't understand it now
I got the fresh girl, nigga, you got the hand-me-down
You got the sloppy seconds, already dug it out
I did my Dougie, sat down and let her work it out
She got them cakes out, I call her Betty Crock
Mr. Flintstone, I can make her bed rock
When I was tryna go, she got naked now
And shawty took it off in a DeLorean
Shawty got ass
Skinny lil' waist, I ain't stupid, can't let it go to waste
Man, damn, she got swag
Temperature's heat, picture perfect every scene
Any camera flash
Go and try to get her, but when you do, she say that I'm with her
They ain't got the last, I'm chasin' with the mask
Tell me who's meaner when I switch 'em like sneakers
And you know I never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life 
'Cause I treat them like shoes
Whether Jordan 13's or Jordan D-Wade's 
With every new pair, my old pair feel played 
New Carmello's, new Chris Paul's 
Little do they know, I love all y'all 
I treat 'em like pros, high top or lows 
Space Jam, Bugs Bunny, Jordan Retros 
She bring it back, Barkley's, all black 
Or the red, white and grey Air Max 
I like that, a closet full of sneakers 
Just like my black book full of freakers 
La the Darkman, L.A deep 
Only wear Nike or the Timberland shoes
I treat 'em like shoes, yeah, that's what I do
Nanny-nanny, boo-boo
I'm shittin' on you, I treat 'em all like shoes
Some rough and some smooth
Just like shoes
More than one that I use
She gotta dunk, alley-oop
Nikes like ooh
Treat 'em all like shoes, treat 'em all like shoes
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that life
Never, never wear the same pair twice
I gotta keep 'em laced 'cause my tongue game nice
I rock 'em like you never do, chick game is phenomenal
Can't take nothin' from me 'cause I live that lifeYesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"
He said, "You dead, boy, too late to pray, boy"
Shot bullet holes through his sphere, God
Send him up like here, God
Smear bloody tears, drip like syrup, sippin' Smirnoff
Life of a crime boss, life in jail, that's time off
This right here that mob talk, run it here
Bye, dawg
30 clip, that's a dick, you get fucked with it
Throw away after you use it, swimmin' with the fishes 
Don't tell yo' bid'ness, go on missions and don't leave no witness 
All these bitches turn to snitches, coppas come and getcha 
Boy, them bullets hot, shoot you on the drop, you and yo' thot
Smokin' dreadlocks, headshot got that red dot
A million for my watch, said you got it? Bitch, I think not
Hop up at your spot, all these goons, don't get scared now
Fuck about a opp, bitch, I'm everywhere
If the niggas get to shootin', you gon' run and tell
I'ma catch a body 'fore a nigga get mine
Just because you pussy, watch a nigga get time
We all know that you the type to really switch sides
Runners from a youth, grind, gotta get mine
He did anythin' just to get on
But I'ma tell his mama, "He ain't comin' home"
Yesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"
He said, "You dead, boy, too late to pray, boy"
Shot bullet holes through his sphere, God
Send him up like here, God
Smear bloody tears, drip like syrup, sippin' Smirnoff
Life of a crime boss, life in jail, that's time off
This right here that mob talk, run it here
Bye, dawg
Killas at yo' crib drinkin' coffee like they work late 
Tryna squash it, niggas shouldn't have played with me in the first place 
I'ma make your death day 
Nigga, fuck your birthday 
Kill that pussy bitch and shoot whoever got his shirt made 
I be solo when I ride 
Not shootin' from a distance, I'ma run up, catch these shots 
If he a MAC with no kick, niggas die 
Spray the crowd, hollows ain't got names, they just flyin' 
I be in the shooter, with my hunters, 50 in my Ruger
Put a new drum on my glizzy, now that bitch sound like a Uzi
Shoot yo' momma house, now move her
Pulled a mission out this Uber
Me and lil' bro caught a body, ain't get caught, so we ain't do it, hol' up 
The opps on Instagram live 
Let's go flip a nigga crib inside out
These bullets go through bricks, I shake yo' hand, you make it out 
Two clips taped together, it look like it's upside down 
Yesterday my lil' brother caught a murder case
Had to, he didn't wanna throw his life away
Judge hit him with 20, told him, "Get out my face"
He said, "You dead, boy, too late to pray, boy"
Shot bullet holes through his sphere, God

Ooh, yeah

Uh, uh, uh
Oh
Ooh, woah
I know...Had an epiphany, and this what it seems
It's smoke and mirrors, don't wanna believe
For far too long they've been plotting on me
The story's unfolding now, it's a conspiracy
Starting to feel like got déjà vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me
Bring me to life 
Show me how to live 
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
I can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me 
Into the oracle, I wanted to know
What I was supposed to do, she said I see on my own
And the craziest thing is that you already know
Try to decipher the signs on the side of the road
Starting to feel like got déjà vu
I remember being here, must be a glitch in the matrix
Look around, they all got the same face on
I'm standing by the phone, someone call me
Bring me to life, yeah 
Show me how to live 
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woah
I took a red and a blue pill, now I
I can't decide what's make believe or real
Am I awake or am I still asleep?
It's killing me 
I need you, you gotta help me
I'm part human, part android
I need your power so you can charge me, charge me
Oh woah, stuck in the matrix, oh, bring me to life
Bring me to life 
Show me how to live 
'Cause I lose control, feeling like Neo in the matrix
I just wanna live, I just wanna live, oh woahOh-oh-oh-oh-oh

But there's no love with no trust
Got me thinking my mind is playing tricks on me
Trying not to believe what I see
But these thoughts in my head
It's telling me that you been cheating
Late at night, creeping on the low
I know sometimes I trip but this time, I ain't crazy
Ain't findin' the knowledge to settle in
On somewhere else, way back
'Cause I caught you red handed, red handed
I said, "Girl, who's on the phone?"
She said, "Nothing, I'll tell you later"
I said, "No, girl, tell me now"
She said, "Why you acting crazy?"
Why I'm acting crazy?
'Cause I wanna know who it is on the phone with my baby 
She said, "Baby, stop tripping
I was talking to my girls"
"Then why them numbers show up blocked, babe?
Guess she must have changed it
Girl, I don't know what kind of game you playing 
And I don't wanna say shit 'cause I'm

On somewhere else, way back
'Cause I caught you red handed , red handed 
You're not the criminal
Feel like you wanna lose
Running with my heart
But I'm not catching you
In the back of my head, always knew the truth
But it hurts, it still hurts
I gave you everything, look what I get back
All the shit I bought for you, wish I could take it back
But I can't
Call it my intuition, I saw all this coming, oh
Got me thinking my mind is playing tricks on me
Trying not to believe what I see
But these thoughts in my head

Don't know what I was thinking, what I had was so great
Charged it to my mind but not to my heart
I know it ain't fair, sometimes I want it all
Go 'head and cuss me out, girl, I understand
I'ma stay right here and take it like a man
I really need you back, babe, what I gotta do?
Let me be honest and straight up tell the truth
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I tried to
I'm not happy, it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh
Girl
I will never be the same no more
Promise I can do you better, sincerely yours
And them times I didn't even try
And even when I told them lies, you stayed wonderful, girl
Can I least just get the chance to show you I
That I'm not a little boy, I won't make you cry
And it means now, all we need is time
And we can get back to the way things were
I haven't been the same since I left you
I can't enjoy myself, even if I tried to
I'm not happy , it ain't a laughing matter
And you don't understand
My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud
Baby, I'll scream it out
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow
Only so much I can take, this love is breaking down
Come rescue me, I need your arms gently wrapped around
Say you need me and don't let go, woah
And just to put it simply, girl, my heart is empty
 My heart is hollow
I didn't know I'd end up like this
I said I didn't want it, now I miss you
My heart is hollow
And I don't care if the neighbors hear me loud 
Baby, I'll scream it out 
Don't know what I was thinking 'bout
Hollow
I thought I wanted to spread my wings 
But I'm empty tryna do my things out in these streets 
I wanna fly back, can I come back home?
Without your love, it's hollow

Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me
Hot damn, let me tell you man 
She looks so good I'ma say it again 
So good that I can't explain

Over here Ms. Lane 
Come on, get fly with a Superman 
You ain't got to worry, I won't play no games
Baby, tonight, yeah
So don't front, you know you wanna stay
It's all fun, yeah, yeah, so, baby, come and play
It's picture perfect, the way you work it, girl
What's your purpose? 'Cause I deserve it, girl, oh
Before we get into something crazy
All you fellas back up off my lady
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that 
It's the way she wears her clothes, her beauty overload

You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go 
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me
Say lil' mama, lemme holla 'cause I'm feelin' dirty
Gotta get you up in a position, have you feelin' flirty 
And you already know my status, I'll be back to the feelin'
Back of the club, instead of hollerin', I'ma get it 
H-U double R-I to the cane 
Hop in my whip and let me beat it out the frame 
Pull it to put your back in, I can beat it up in flames
I can hit your chick from a distance 
I hit it and quit it, she probably won't let you hit it 
I got a lot of money, that don't mean that I'm a trick 
That Lamborghini match the yellow diamonds on my wrist
You ain't on a level to be talkin' 'bout my chick 
She don't wanna holla, don't still be your sidekick
I don't wanna holla so I told her like this 
Baby, how you doing? I'm Chris and that's Chris , like that
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that one
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that
You might've seen her on every cover
Of every magazine but can't nobody get her but me
Uh-oh, there she go, uh-oh, there she go
Uh-oh, there she go, can't nobody get her but me 
Hot fresh off the UCP tour 
Say you got girls, but I bet I got way more 
Who you know who get girls quite like this, man? 
My girls cover King, Magazine, and Blackman 
When it comes to the chicks, they just like me 
I ain't gotta ask, they just do it like Nike 
Huh, see if you want one, bet I got 'em 
Bow make 'em yell, I ain't talkin' 'bout college 
I do girls like I do my clothes
I wear 'em one time then I go back for more 
'Cause she want me to trick, but I don't do that though 
And if your man get lost like the TV show, skidaddle
She came through, I gave Chris her friends 
You can dream though, my shawty a ten, ya dig, yeah
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that one 
Get you one 'cause I got that, got that 
It's the way she wears her clothes, her beauty overload
The definition of a star
Low key, my energy on E
Bright lights and cameras flash like it's the police
She spilled her drink on my Polo fleece
She's speedin', and she all on me
Came to the party with a bunch of OGs
Ladies wearin' Crown Holders and a bunch of Coogi
Now they lookin' and the fellas know what I got
Can't nobody get her but me
Flyest thing in this spot
Prettiest thing that you ever seen
Hold up, wait, stop
Wanna take her picture, you ain't gon' get it for free
Do you got what it takes to get down?
Lil' mama, the way she workin', she breakin' it to the ground
She twerkin' and workin' her body, hypnotic just to the sound
Can't nobody get her but me
Can't nobody get her but me
Hot—K-K-K-K-K-K-Mac
All that bullshit's for the birds, you ain't nothing but a vulture 
Always hoping for the worst, waiting for me to fuck up
You'll regret the day when I find another girl, yeah
Who knows just what I need, she knows just what I mean when I tell her keep it drama free
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah
Chu-chuckin' up them deuces
Woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah-woah

Say bye bye, say bye bye to her
Your wrist and fingers glisten, ice cold like Michigan

We used to be best friends, now it seems we finna be enemies
Deep inside it’s killin' me, but soon it's gon' be killin' you
To see her in that two-seater, know that's gon' hurt your feelings, boo
Ah ha, didn’t you think you would be over me by now?
So you go sleepin' with them clowns, they are no relief
She spoke her piece, I know, capisce
So love must be let go, released, into the wind
Again, again, and deuces I must throw ya, peace
I'm on some new shit

I'm moving on to something better, better, better

Got a bucket full of ice, and a watch to go with it 
Got a racin' Lamborghini, have my homies scared to drive
Haters better put their head down, they know that boy be fly
All the charter planes, now I’m talkin' ballers slang
R.O.Z.A.Y. on that wall in that Hall of Fame 
I let my denim sag, red Louis belt
How can you love me, baby? First, you gotta love yourself
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better

The farewell email  from a female 
But I'm a playa, ain't gonna tell you all the details
What it entails is hard to say, like sellin' seashells
By the seashore, but she's not a bore
But neither a whore who needs to know more
The kind you can't ignore but want to open the door for
Or run in your favorite store
And leave with all them shopping bags and half of it ain't yours
I did things for her, ain't rich, ain't poor
I wanted to do more, but hell, I just ain't know her
Well enough to know if this was all she came for
But enough to know tonight excited, she came four
Times to my cousin house to see if I was there
Get your minds out the gutter, man
We out here tryna have a good time
And here I am, all heavy with the words where
Somebody that's a nerd, likely fast forward
But, shit, they asked for it
It's hard to throw up them deuces
‘Cause when you know it's juicy
You start to sound like Confucius when makin' up excuses
Chase Cabooses until the track gone
I gotta find me a new locomotive, stop makin' sad songs
I'm on some new shit
I'm chucking my deuces up to her 
I'm moving on to something better, better, better
No more tryna make it work 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to her 
You made me wanna say bye bye
Say bye bye, say bye bye to herWell!

Let me hear you say ahh, say ahhThis the type of shit I deal with all the time, huh
I just stay lowkey fine
Usually I don't miss
Got this flight to London, I ain't pop no Xans for it
In case you was wondering, I ain't even plan for it
I just left L.A., barely caught the plane 
Don't fuck with TSA, private jets don't need no escort 
Get used to this fame shit 
This you-know-all-my-name-shit 
Yeah, I'm still the same kid
That fucked around and made it 
Fucked over my main chick
The second one did the same shit
Fucked up, had a baby on her, God told me stop playing
I was in L.A., you was in MIA 
I was tryna stay but you ain't tryna wait, no
Now I'm out the way, million miles away 
Thinkin' 'bout the games
I shouldn't have played, but I played it
And now I'm missing your love, I'ma roll up
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
Uh, I blame it on the distance
That's why I'm fuckin' with these bitches
These numbers in my phone
A text pops up, she's like, "Who is this?"
You probably got a mistress
Probably every week it switches
Now is this cause for concern?
And should I be suspicious?
I'm overseas trippin', a million miles away
And she's still in L.A., my mom's out in the Bay
And these overseas minutes add up, that's a lot to pay
I can pay it, yeah I know, but it's the excuse I say
She's been tryna track me down
I feel like I'm cattin' now
Dodgin' her when she's the one
I'm out here trippin', actin' wild
Start to wonder if I've changed
I'm like how could that be now?
Would these bitches be here really
If I wasn't rappin' now?
Now tell me now
I'm faded once again, yeah, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think, think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off, yeah
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
Uh, I'm just so conflicted
It's been so long since we've kicked it
And I can't lie, I've missed it
But somewhere the current shifted
And now I'm somewhere else
Far away, feel like we drifted
Hard to face the facts
I'm drinkin' to escape 'em, then get lifted
Get swept under a rug, 'til I'm trippin' on a pile
Get a change, somethin' different for a while
Yeah, we grew apart with time
We ain't kicked it in a while
But I still think about you now
Without you, see there's differences now
But shit happens, how could we have known?
Nothin' can prepare us
From sleepin' at your parents, now to sold-out shows in Paris
To parties at my hotel, ashin' blunts up off my terrace
Tell me, how'd we ever come to live this careless?
Tell me now
I'm faded once again, I don’t know where I am
But I just know I'm drifting far from you, ooh, yeah
I'm tryna keep my head strong, but my heart
Won't just let me grow away from you, ha 
Don't you know we're drifting off, drifting off?
I know you think that it's my fault for falling off
All this hope and disregard, drifting off
I know you think there ain't no fault, I fall apart
Ooh, and now I'm missing your love
And now I'm missing your love, oohI'm staring at the clock, it's a quarter to three
I'm tossing in my bed 'cause I just can't sleep
'Cause you're not here with me
I'm reaching out for you, I wish I could talk to you
Tryna figure out what's going on with me
I'm used to having all the answers for everything
Oh, girl, I think she is the one
But where is that coming from?
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me
So much more than lately
I owe it all to you 
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me
What I'm coming down with is new to me
All I know is that you are the cure
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love
Does anybody know the answer to this question?
'Cause I'm confused, so now I'm opened for suggestions 
My heart is talking loud , what is this about? 
I'm really changing now, oh
Cleared all the numbers out my phone, done left that whole life alone
Those are two of the symptoms I see, uh
And I believe, oh girl, I am sure
That you are my miracle
It's so crazy
Baby, you simply amaze me 
So much more than lately 
I owe it all to you 
All those games, we
Used to play now seems so lame to me 
What I'm coming down with is new to me 
All I know is that you are the cure 
'Cause I've been diagnosed with love
Let me hear you say, oh yeah

How could I let a girl go so perfect
Fellas, you know what I'm talking 'bout
And I've been thinking about it what you said
Screaming, "How you want me out?"
And then I turn around and look at your pics and all I think about
Is the way we used to kiss
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we showed romance, give me one more chance
Was it all my fault?
Sorry for the pain I caused
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave
That made me feel this way
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?
It's a shame that we can't at least talk about our problems
My heart's broken and my body is starving
For your love and I need you in my life, girl
For your touch and all I think about is...
Is the way we used to kiss 
Is the way you held my hand
Is the way we used to dance
How we showed romance, give me one more chance
Was it all my fault? 
Sorry for the pain I caused 
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave 
That made me feel this way 
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?
Wait, girl, you hear your conscience calling, all in
Wait, girl, come back to me, I need you here, baby
Stay, girl, baby, I want you to stay around
For me, girl, I'm sorry, baby
Was it all my fault? 
Sorry for the pain I caused 
With no love involved
Do I cross your mind at all?
With all the love I gave 
That made me feel this way 
At any time of the day
Do I cross your mind at all?
At all, at all, at all
Do I cross your mind at all?
Yeah, girl
Do I cross your mind at all?I would have never crossed that line 
If I knew one kiss would change our lives, oh girl
You can't even look me in my face 
You just wanna walk away 
And act like it never happened, oh no
And you don't wanna mess up a good thing 
Can't you see it? Girl, we got a good things 
And right now, girl, I can't change the way I'm feeling
You said that we should be friends
But girl, my heart can't take that
But I don't ever wanna see you again
Think about the good times that we had
Inside of my chest is so numb
When I think about what we could have done
Girl, tell me what are you running from
No one could ever love you like I do
I remember all the stories you told me 
And all them lames that you used to date
You know it's not me 
And all them rainy days I held you in my arms
While you cried , cried , cried 
I was always the one there for you
I guess I fell for you too deep 
And i can't believe you saying this to me 
You think we should we...
You said that we should be friends 
But girl, my heart can't take that 
But I don't ever wanna see you again 
Think about the good times that we had 
Inside of my chest is so numb 
When I think about what we could have done 
Girl, tell me what are you running from 
No one could ever love you like I do
All this love I have for you 
Girl, you're more than just a friend
I wish that I could change the past but I can't 
Now I gotta walk away 
'Cause I can't deal with this pain 
'Cause girl, you said that we should just be friends
You said that we should be friends 
But girl, my heart can't take that 
But I don't ever wanna see you again
Think about the good times that we had
Inside of my chest is so numb 
When I think about what we could have done 
Girl, tell me what are you running from
No one could ever love you like I do
You said that we should be friends 
But girl, my heart can't take that 
But I don't ever wanna see you again 
Think about the good times that we had
Inside of my chest is so numb
When I think about what we could have done
Girl, tell me what are you running from 
No one could ever love you like I doOh, every time I, I look at you
I lose my breath when you're in my bed
Oh, what a feeling that I can't believe
Happens over and over 
Yes, over and over
Together forever and ever, we're never apart
No matter the distance, our journies to Mars
We'll never just give up what's in our hearts
I'll let down my guard, love's in my heart
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years
And centuries, together with you and I
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream
Ages ago
Yeah, never would have crossed my frame of mind
I needed a sign
Towards the radio
And every time I turn it up, your song would play
See how love has its ways
Together forever and ever, we're never apart
No matter the distance, our journies to Mars
We'll never just give up what's in our hearts
I'll let down my guard, love's in my heart
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years
And centuries, together with you and I 
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream
Let's jump in my pickup and hot tail outta here, oh 
Girl, it's me and you, just follow my lead 
We can make it no matter how hard it is, yeah 
I love you 
I love you, ooh
This is too easy 'cause I'm waiting right here 
Gotta be a reason for you and I
It's like I'm floating in space and I done caught me a star
Infinity, and all these light-years 
And centuries, together with you and I 
Why'd you pick me? It's like I'm trapped in a dream

Floating on 25's, I wouldn't be fly if I threw some D's on it
From the center to the floor, I'm fresh low-key

Tryna find a flame for my fire, can't burn me out
Smoke is clouding a fantasy
And now we are where we are right now
We found our way back to each other and turned it around
We'll build a hell of a family
That's where we are, where we are right now
On that bullshit 
Miss me with the bullshit
On that bullshit
Oh, don't bring that back
You're just like me, you like to sleep around
I hate this feelin', just tryna get it rightI hate to admit it, boy, but I need loving
But if it's gonna be this hard, I don't need nothing
Everything you say is like a crossword puzzle
I'm always tryna put it together
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'Cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need—
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I can't, can't
Now I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you , love you 
Said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you , love you 
Everything you put me through for no damn reason
Try to fix the problem when I say I'm leaving
I heard it before but I just don't believe it
I don't think you're playing for keeps
I don't, I don't need that, no
I got my feet on the gas though
I don't need anyone slowing me down
I just don't know who to love
Don't know who to trust
My heart's been broke so many times
I would be a fool to love
Be a fool to love
'Cause I'm done with waiting now
I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I said I would be a fool to love you
Be a fool to love you, love you
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I just need—
I don't need multiple
I just need comfortable
I don't need multiple
I can't, can't

Get it, touch right there, babe
I ain't scared, I'm down 
All I need is one time, one time
For me to go down  and eat it like it's lunchtime
I'm in a four-door 
Polo, them horses 
But you roll up in a four-door 
In the mirror, she gorgeous
Red light, nigga, waiting for that green light 
Baby, get your head right, follow me to that east side
I fuck with some real niggas
The belly of the beast all day, V.A
You know that we all deal wishing
Then I pop up the pussy in your face, fillet
After party, got bank 
Got that bomb ass sushi, call that ass to the sink 
Stop acting like it ain't
And it's a violation, three seconds in the paint
Woah, oh
Oh girl, I really fuck with ya
Oh, oh
Girl, I think I'm in love with ya
That one girl, I only seen on my way, yeah
It's a straight shot to the crib, no chaser
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib 
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Okay, let me bust on the bullet, automatic, call it pump
Straight shots, caught made shots in the Maybach
Throwin' up the OHB 'cause we out here ballin'
And we still getting paid, buck
I elevate and get rich, VVS flow
Cuttin' through the diamonds like a fuckin' laser
Pow, pow, look at the crowd
Said I wasn't shit, nigga, look at me now
Gon' put it on wax, try to figure me out
Random selectin' the lineup, she pickin' me out
It's 'cause I'm a black guy and she a white girl
No, I did not have my dick in her mouth
I'm busy bein' the life of the motherfuckin' party
Private jets, private sex, private departures
The money ain't a thing, I don't care 'bout an offer
But I'm 'bout put the pussy right up in the coffin, let's go
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
Straight shot to the crib, straight shot to the crib 
Take shots, take shots, take shots, we don't waste shots
Take shots, take shots, take shots, to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the crib
One, two, three, it's a straight shot to the cribA material girl in her own world
Can't even see the things she's missing
Right in the curve, a little girl wanting to grow up and be a star
Take a look around, not looking down
All these things have blurred your vision
Material things don't amount to nothing
But I know how you feel
It's hard to see who's real
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time, takes time, to love
And I'ma tell the truth when it comes to you, my lady
And it's a miracle you have found a conscience, baby
I had a plan on leaving, you came and gave a reason
And now I know the reason why, why
But I know how you feel 
It's hard to see who's real 
It takes time, living in a world when you don't know who to trust
Next time, slow it down and don't feel you have to rush
It'll be fine
Takes time , takes time , to loveOh, you're 'bout to catch a flow
It'll be so lovely, so lovely
Think I should tell you
Tell you how it goes
You chilling with the Sok
Sok or that purple
One hit, take me away
To another time, another space, another day
One more hit, blow me away
I could find another place
So you can find another way
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off and their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the real cool people don't dance anymore
They just glidin', we glidin' 
They glidin', they glidin'
Just glidin', they glidin'
They glidin', they glidin'
They—
She's phased, he's in a daze
Thirsty girls look around
While the others frown, not doin' anything
So, get your kicks in whatever way
Then let me tell you to your face
'Cause it's a shame to let it go to waste
Doing all the same stuff beside your boy
By the time, I stepped through the door
I just wanna really tell you how I feel
Nobody else wants to keep it real
All the pretty girls stepping on the scene
Who can dress their ass off and their walk is mean
All they wanna do is get up on the floor
But the really cool people don't dance anymore
They just glidin', we glidin' 
They glidin', they glidin'
Just glidin', they glidin'
They glidin', they glidin'
They—
Sometimes people think that
They can fool the world into believing
That they are original
But they are only fools
So I, find a place in my mind
Where nobody else can go
Drifting, floating, gliding
So meet me there
Now a nigga glidin'
Do it from the front, back to the side and
I gotta roll one up 'fore a nigga drivin'
Blow a couple hunnid
You might think it's stuntin'
But to me it's really nothin', oh
Who you came with? 
Who the ones spendin' money like it ain't shit? 
Me, and I'm poppin' champagne
Hella niggas in here rollin' with me throwin' up the gang 
Um
You ain't gotta ask, already know
You don't need a grinder 'cause they already rolled
And everything I blow is potent in the air
'Cause me and Breezy got 'em floating 
What you smoking? 
Glidin', we glidin' 
They glidin', they glidin' 
Glidin', they glidin'
They glidin', they glidin' 
They glidin', they glidin' 
They glidin', they glidin' 
Glidin', they glidin' 
Glidin', they glidin' 
Candy, Apple, Holly
Chiefin' like a Molly
It'll be so lovely, so lovely
We came to party
Girl, you're getting naughty
Bu, your friends too ugly to fuck with me
Let me reframe 'cause these paper planes
Got my brain, stained, I'm trippin', mayne 
Me and my gang
In here super fucked up off the same thing
I need my shades Tyler, The Creator: Can you, I don't know if you've ever said this in an interview, can you tell them your theory, on how Ray J, has never taken an L?
Vince Staples: Ray J will never lose, Ray J is the man, Ray J is probably top 5, hip-hop, West Coast of all time
Peter Rosenberg: Why? Why do you feel this way, Vince?
Vince Staples: Does Ray J not have hits?
Peter Rosenberg: He has a couple hits
Vince Staples: Ray J was the first Blood on a record that was certified. Have you seen the Kay Slay interview?

It's spelling her name and it's tearing me
'Cause I can't get her in my hands to put her on my arm
These expensive things are just wearing me
'Cause nothing even matters if her sun shines
Trapped in behind the clouds most of the time
I finally see why they guard her soul 'cause she's priceless
But there's something that she ought to know, so
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh, I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me
Now this, might be the only time to say it
We're finally face-to-face and maybe, huh
You're probably scared to be put out on display
To be part of a showcase
But if I could paint a picture, you'd be my Mona Lisa
Baby, you're a work of art
And just when I thought I had her, baby girl, picked her bag up
Told me watch out, then she ran back into the house now
She got me picking up rocks, tossing them at her window
Baby, come outside
I gave it two or three knocks, standing at the front door
'Cause I done ran out of rocks
Oh, I gotta get up and let her know she's perfect in ways
She couldn't think of and I think about her every day
This might not be love but this crush
Got me wanting to tell you today
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for me
You're a diamond in the rough, dust you off, baby
I wanna make you shine for me
And if I can take you out, I'll show you off, baby
I want the whole world to see
Your future looks so blind 'cause they say I'm a star
But you can carry your own light, shed some light on my heart
You're a diamond in the rough
I wanna make you shine for me, shine for me, shine for meI'm not shallow
And I know what girls got her needs
All the guys say, "She blows"
'Cause that's what makes her very special to me
But where is she now?
She's got one night on the town
When she comes to my house
I know I'ma nail her now
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you are
Everywhere she goes
She thinks that guys are wonderful
And she likes to smoke
And drink margaritas
But where is she now?
She just left my best friend's house
I should kick her out
But she's so fucking awesome
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you are
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
Everyone gets a turn like a door
But I like it, I like it
And I don't really like you classy
'Cause I want a girl who's trashy
You're a skank, you're a whore
You're a slut, but I like it, I like it
The way you areWhat do I do?
Stop? Go?
Fail? Succeed?
Live or die?
I just gotta believe
Believe, it's worth saving
And to get lost, lost in a daydream
So why hesitate? Take me to another place
So far, far away, so I can get out of the dark
High speed, like I'm racing
Just like lighting, the sky is blazing
But you've lost your way, you've been lead astray
Are there better days for my fallen dreamer?

'Cause my wish has never come back around
You take me up, and then you drop me, baby
’Cause you're the perfect fix, you're my drug
You drive me crazy
I go again and again, and then I overdose
Like I'm sober, but I don't know where I'm at
See I done followed you, girl, and I don't know my way back
I gave you my love, just wanna be loved
Just you and me in love, yeah
You're tryna defeat love, I’m fighting to keep love
What did you do to me, babe?
There’s no such thing as a perfect day
'Cause once the moment comes, it’ll fade away
I done gave you every single part of me

Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all
I see it clearer
Girl, you’re my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all
I see it clearer
I used to think that I need you as bad as I need it
And all this rage that you started inside of me, it ain't 'posed to be here
One minute you say that you love me, and then you go and close the door-oor
This ain't a mistake, I don't know what it's for
I just wanted another to just prove you wrong
Can't take it no more, oh-oh-oh
Like I'm sober, but I don't know where I'm at

See I done followed you, girl, and I don't know my way back 
I gave you my love, just wanna be loved
Just you and me in love, yeah
You're tryna defeat love, I'm fighting to keep love
Fighting to keep you here

What else can I give? There's nothing left to take 
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all 
I see it clearer
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall

I'm playing it over again
Wanna be back in love, back in love with you
I'm so confused
Why can't you change for me? 
Why can't you stay for me? 
Instead of changing who you are
Girl, you don't have to please everybody 
There's no such thing as a perfect thing 
'Cause once the moment comes, it'll fade away 
I done gave you every single part of me 
What else can I give? There's nothing else to take
Girl, you're my rise 'n fall
Ooh-ooh, a-all 
I see it clearer

The worst part is over
The worst part is over

Kiss my chance at love goodbye

Lately, more and more I been feeling some kind of way
And I ain't crazy, I know you got those texts from me 
But it's this thing that we've been going through, is something wrong with you?

When you turned away from me 
Makes me think that I should just leave 
Go back to being the ol' G

No, I don't want you mad at me
Snatching the covers, acting like you're asleep
When you know you're up, no
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back 
All night long, I find myself tryna get away and that ain't right, no
Looking through my phone tryna remember her name
That would only make it worse
We tried to talk through our problems, but it takes more than words
Said it don't even bother me but I swear it hurts
When I said I didn't wanna go through the same shit, this is what I meant, oh, woah
When you turned away from me 
Makes me think that I should just leave 
Go back to being the ol' G 
Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back

Girl, I don't wanna lay here back to back 
I thought about it, got my bags, now I'm 'bout to roll
You standing there screaming, "Please don't go"
Too late, no excuses, I swear I can't do this
Don't wanna go through this no more
Now I know what it means to really have it bad
Got me laying in this bed and looking at your bags 
Oh girl , wish you could make me believe

I picked up the paper and the headline reads 
It says, "Single broken heart in some satin sheets"
And I'm like why? We had a hell of a time 
When I first met you , I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something  falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped, oh, it's your heart
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but seen it's alright 
That's just something that can happen when you put it down 
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right 
You see the mama called me to release steam
She said, "My daughter won't eat and she don't sleep
She just cries 'cause you're in her mind" 
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something  falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped , oh, it's your heart 
Shawty is caught up  from a long night
She's ready to fall but  seen it's alright
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right

If you just keep it in stride you should be all right
And if you take what's inside  and mix that with pride
Instead, running along, keeping it going when you call
Girl, tell me why
When I first met you, I told ya that you'll be safe
In the midst of arguing something falls to the floor and breaks
But when you looked down to see what you dropped , oh, it's your heart
Shawty is caught up from a long night
She's ready to fall but seen it's alright 
That's just something that can happen when you put it down
See she's caught up, that's not my fault right

From the moment I looked into your eyes
I never wanted to see you cry over me
But I knew if we got serious in love
We would never, ever wanna break it up

It's not safe to say it's over now
We're here, now see
Little bodies laying on the ground
It coulda been your baby

They need some food to eat
But there'll be brighter days
When we'll be saved
The Lord will send blessings
When I think about the things you've done for me
And how you made me see, truthfully
I ain't gon' do you wrong no
Don't let no one of us go because I know

Gotta get on my way
Nine o'clock in the morning
Hope I'm not too late
'Cause I been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd pay for you
So I took the bus downtown
Traffic made me wait
I should get out now and try to run the rest of the way
You're all that matters to me
It would be a shame
If someone took my place today
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cry
When I got there, so aligned
People all outside
Wrapped around the block now
I couldn't believe my eyes
But I've been thinking 'bout you
Words can not explain
Any price I'd pay for you
So I tried to cut the line
Security said, "Nice try"
Damn, they knocked my ass out
But I put up a fight
Just to feel your sole
Your tongue against my skin
Oh, I gotta find my way
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cry
Oh please
Please don't leave before I get to you
I don't know what I would do without you
Oh, I, I might cry, cry, cry
I might cryDrumma Boy

Girl, I'm about to take off my attire

Tonight is the day when I set your soul on fire
I'm showing offYou should get a tattoo that says, "Hold on"

But you can go and give me your way

Win, lose or draw for
I'll lose it all for
I'll break the law for your love{Verse 1}
No one ever thought anyone could pull the wool over my eyes, yeah
But you're not just anyone, you're a master of disguise, oh yeah
I swear you put on one hell of a performance
You were just using me to get what you wanted
And I ain't see it coming, no, I couldn't see it coming
{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled 
Thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need when I'm alone, huh
{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
{Verse 2}
Oh, I can't feel my heart, really this is how you do me?
I told you that I loved you, oh
And that's not something I say loosely
No, not often, yeah
And that's not something I say loosely
Ooh, ooh
No, oh, woah
{Pre-Chorus}
'Cause you had me fooled 
Thinking that you were the one for me
Thinking that you were the one I need when I'm alone, huh
{Chorus}
I was just, I was just
Loving a stranger, loving a stranger
Loving, loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
Loving a stranger
{Bridge}
Maybe it's karma, maybe it's bad luck, maybe it's all coincidence
Maybe I gave you confidence, maybe
I'll forgive you, already miss you
But right now, I ain't got time for that
Make you to hit the road, hope you comin' back
No, ooh
You crossed that line when you walked outside when I said goodbye, oh
Victim of your crimes, taking back what's mine, put your pride aside
Wish I could rewind, but I know that I can't take back time
I can't take back time, I can't take back time, so, woah
{Chorus}
I'm hoping that you learn how it feels to be loving a stranger

Being without you is like having nothing
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus in my bank account
But it's nothing without you, nothing without you
I ain't been the same since you came in my life
And you're the only one to help me get right
And the way I'm feeling, girl, you need to know
Without you life is back to zero
Baby, just listen, girl, it's just a job so don't look at me different
Looking in your heart, girl, I know you're committed
And what I told you stands true
I've been down for you, baby
That was way before the videos
Way before the number 1 singles
On the radio, late night at the studio
When I was just CB, nobody knew me
Girl, you were still the same
Being without you is like having nothing 
It don't matter 'bout the money I spend
Got a million plus in my bank account
But it's nothing without you , nothing without you

He don't want you anymore
He's leavin' your shit at the door
You walkin' around, modelin' now
Like you gon' settle the score
But you, not the one anymore
And I got the keys to his Porsche
With nothing I like, not one in the same
I just wanna say
I want your boyfriend and he wants me
So I understand why you don't like me
And me letting go, girl, is unlikely
So I guess we have to agree to disagree
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely, oh
You're so lonely
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
You're looking stupid, oh, poor baby
You're better off letting it go
There's no pacifier for you
Nobody will spoil you
Ain't hiding, him and me gettin' on, on
He don't want you anymore
He's leavin' your shit at the door
You walkin' around, modelin' now
Like you gon' settle the score
But you not, the one anymore
And I got the keys to hIs Porsche

So I guess we have to agree to disagree
I want your boyfriend and he wants me

Uh-huh, yeah
Oh, woah
Yo, tell me fellas have you seen her? 
It was about five minutes ago
When I seen the hottest chick that a youngin' never seen before
I say, "Yo, tell the girls I wanna meet her" 
On second thought that ain't the way to go
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her
Oh, should I talk about her smile? 
Or what about her style? 
I'm out of time, she's out the door
I gotta go for mine, I think I'll say
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss 
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
Now shawty, grab hold of my hand
And let's pretend the floor is ours
You say you don't really dance
Don't worry 'bout it, we just one-two step, one-two step
Now if the music is moving too fast 
Grab my hand a little tighter 
Don't be afraid to move a little closer
Girl, there's something about you that makes me wanna say 
Yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss 
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss 
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I think I'll say yo
I don't know your name but excuse me miss
I saw you from across the room
And I got to admit that you got my attention
You're making me wanna say yo
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
I wanna be where you are
Ain't nothing wrong with dancing
Baby, it's so romantic
Baby, I can be in your heart
So many things I wanna tell you 
I think that I should start by saying
Yo, woah
I don't know your name but excuse me miss 
I saw you from across the room
I gotta give her game proper
Spit it so she'll get it, there she is I gotta stop her 
I know you're tryna leave but excuse me miss 
I saved the last dance for you
I would love to keep you here with me, oh baby
Now everybody just clap your hands like this 
Just clap your hands like this 
And if your shorty's in the house tonight
Just grab her by the hand, homie, make her understand
Y'all was made to dance like this 
Y'all was made to bounce like this 
Just let her know she was made for you and
You want to do everything she want to, man
Ha, woo!She looked up from the book she was reading
With the prettiest smile that I ever saw
Curly hair down her back
And her skin like cinnamon brown without a flaw
And man, those eyes
Made my heart stop in my chest
Then she said, "Hi"
And it was hard to catch my breath
I said, "Hey lil' mama
I don't mean to bother at all, my name is Chris" 
And before she could answer
I said, "Don't say a word
Listen to this, I think you're fine"
And she cracked that smile again
Let's say goodbye to my homies and your friends
We can dip out...
We can dip out alone, keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up 
Keep it moving 
Don't matter at all 
Wherever we go 
Oh 
Girl, just come on, let's keep it moving
So we exchange numbers
I told her I'll be at her crib by a quarter to six
We can go get a bite, little lady
Or chill at the mall and catch a flick
If that's alright
She said, "As long I'm home by nine 
Whatever we do is fine"
I can't believe
I can't believe that she's here with me, no 
And God only knows
God only knows, how far we can go
I hope this night will go my way
I hope this night will go my way and we can do this everyday
And if I'm cool and take my time
Then I might just get a kiss goodnight, oh yeah
We can dip out alone, and keep it moving
Do something fun, and keep it moving 
Talk about life, about love, that's what's up 
And keep it moving 
It don't matter at all 
Wherever we go 
Oh no 
Girl, just come on, let's keep it movingMy friends keep saying I'm in love
When  they saw you kiss me on the cheek
Now  everybody thinks you're my girl, oh yeah
If it's alright with you, then it's alright with me
So can I take a little walk with you?
Maybe  after school, and talk to you
Oh,  baby
The very first time is still on my mind
When  we kissed, you had sugar on your lips
Can I walk with you on the avenue and talk to you?
Oh, baby 
The very first time that you were on my mind
When  we kissed, you had sugar on your lips
I can't wait 'til the school bell rings at three
Ooh, no
To pick up some of your favorite candy
Oh, baby
If I had one wish, I would wish it on you
'Cause you're so fine
Today is my dream come true, so
Can I take a little walk with you?
Maybe after school, and talk to you
Oh, baby

Oh, baby 
The last time you blew my mind, now I know why
You had sugar on your lips 
My heart starts beating fast every time I see you, girl
If I had my way, it would be you kissin' me
Listen, baby girl
I just wanna say to you
I still remember the day
When you were standin' in front of the school with your friends
I know you special
'Cause when you went to kiss me goodbye
I couldn't even wipe the sugar off my lips
Can I take another walk with you?
Maybe after school, and talk to you, yeah
Oh, baby
The very first time is still on my mind
When we kissed, you had sugar on your lips
Can I take another walk with you on the avenue and talk to you, baby?
Oh, baby 
'Cause last time, you blew my mind
When we kissed, you had sugar on your lips 
I don't know what I'm feelin', girl
But I know that I can't help myself 
And I don't care what nobody says
But I hope that you're not with nobody else 
I can't even do my homework
'Cause I'm always thinkin' of you 
And I love your hair and the clothes you wear
You got sugar on your lips
Oh

We should never go there
Damn, why you wanna go there?
I guess I gotta go there
You're hearing rumors about me and you can't stomach the thought
Of someone touching my body when you're so close to my heart
I won't deny what they saying because most of it is true
But it was all before I fell for you, so please, babe
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful 
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful
Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? 
You're beautiful, so baby
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am  and not who I was 
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please
So please don't judge me 
And I won't judge you 
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you 
And if you love me , then let it be beautiful, babe
Let it be beautifu-u-ul 
Let it be beautiful 
Let it be, oh
Let it be beautiful, ayy
Let it be beautiful
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't wanna go there, baby 
We should never go there Lyrics From Snippet
She don't think I see her 
'Cause I...
We know that we can fall in love tonight
...'cause I feel it
It's the moonlight
...in love with you

And I asked around, tryna get the deal

Don't worry 'bout the trips I take
Got shots with or who I am
Please believe I'm the one that you need
When it's time to put something on your wrist or your feet

First I wanna show you, first I wanna hold you

Only 15 minutes 'til your mama comes home from work and I know, ha
That she would be tickled pink to find me here, yeah
'Cause even though we was just chilling and a little flirting
She don't even want me anywhere near her baby girl, oh no
So I think I better leave, grab my coat, hat and Timbos
And bounce through the window
'Cause the last song on the CD is skipping
And I don't want your folks catching me, you tripping
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love 
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks
But she don't see there's more to me than just a thug 
There's nothing you can do when opposites  attract and it's like that
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Yeah, now if y'all wanna fall in love with Chris, say woah, woah
All my ladies in the house tonight, say ooh
Aw yeah, that sounds so good, now say woah, woah 
'Cause she don't think we're old enough to fall in love 
'Cause she swears that I'm from the wrong side of the tracks 
But she don't see there's more to me than just a thug
There's nothing you can do when opposites attract and it's like thatScribingEverywhere everywhere, everywhere I go

        Right from the start
You were a thief
You stole my heart
And I your willing victim
I let you see the parts of me
That weren't all that pretty
And with every touch you fixed them
Now you've been talking in your sleep, oh, oh
Things you never say to me, oh, oh
Tell me that you've had enough
Of our love, our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
We're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reason
I'm sorry I don't understand
Where all of this is coming from
I thought that we were fine
Your head is running wild again
My dear we still have everythin'
And it's all in your mind
You've been havin' real bad dreams, oh, oh
You used to lie so close to me, oh, oh
There's nothing more than empty sheets
Between our love, our love
Oh, our love, our love
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
I never stopped
You're still written in the scars on my heart
You're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reason
Oh, tear ducts and rust
I'll fix it for us
We're collecting dust
But our love's enough
You're holding it in
You're pouring a drink
No nothing is as bad as it seems
Well complete
Just give me a reason
Just a little bit's enough
Just a second we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
It's in the stars
It's been written in the scars on our hearts
That we're not broken just bent
And we can learn to love again
Because when it was not being busy
If there's no other like me
Is it just doesn't feel
Maybe you can observe your research
It keeps me entertained for
Not even sure what they've known
If I just give me a reasonWoo, yeah, S. Dot

The young boy just turned 16 and I got 
Six four's and hot bikes that I rock 
Keep three or four sweeties on my clock 
But all that swinging in that bikini just make 'em vicious
Slow all the traffic down to a complete stop 
'Cause you speak in that slang that I talk 
That sassy tempo with that walk 
May be the reason that all these teenies may never see me
Momma you may be three years older but you hot 
You be talking like you like what I got 
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"

I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme"
Ma, take a break, let me explain to you 
What your body got a young boy ready to do 
If you take a chance to let me put them thangs on you
I could show you why I make them straight A's at school
I'm a hustler, trust my frame and age
Got you thinking that I'm just too young to turn your page
I can picture us switching lanes
In the coupe, with you on the phone screaming my name 
Momma you may be three years older but you hot 
You be talking like you like what I got 
I know you like it how I lean in the 'lac
You could be in the back saying, "Gimme, gimme, gimme" 
Momma you may be three years older but you hot 
You be talking like you like what I got

You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? 
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed
Sorry if I'm up and down a lot 
Sorry that I think I'm not еnough
And sorry if I say sorry way too much
You can go ahead and call me selfish 
But after all this damage, I can't help it 
But what you can trust is I need your touch
I'ma scream and shout for what I love
Passionate, but I don't give no fucks
I admit that I'm a lil' messed up
But I can hide it when I'm all dressed up
I'm obsessive and I love too hard
Good at overthinking with my heart
How you even think it got this far, this far?
And I can be needy, way too damn needy
I can be needy, tell me how good it feels to be needed
I can be needy, so hard to please me
I know it feels so good to be needed

Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful

Everything I say right now is gonna be used in another fight
And I've been through this so many times
Can we change the subject?
You gonna start asking me questions like
"Was she attractive? Was she an actress?"
Baby, the fact is
You're hearing rumors about me and saw some pictures online
Saying they got you so angry, making you wish you were blind
Before we start talking crazy, saying some things we'll regret
Can we just slow it down and press reset? 
So please don't judge me and I won't judge you
'Cause it could get ugly before it gets beautiful
Please don't judge me and I won't judge you
And if you love me, then let it be beautiful
Then let it be beautiful
Just let the past, just be the past
And focused on things that are gonna make us laugh
Take me as I am and not who I was
I'll promise I'll be the one that you can trust, so please

You're my one true lover

Girl, you been actin' up
Body knockin' me out, I'm seein' stars 
I'm fallin', followin' your master plan
She walks in, heads to the floor, thinks she gon' dance 
Pullin' me closer, I'm like a stalker
I won't take "no" for an answer
I know what she thinks, I can see it in her eyes
She walkin' on water 
Fantasy
Fantasy

FantasyHahaha
I-I-I-I-I ain't gotta talk, I don't wanna know her name 
'Cause with all that there, I don't even see your face 
And she see all the zeros and commas, she know I'm paid 
A freaky little thing, she givin' me brain
Look up at my chain, don't look at my face, yikes!
She got that booty delivery, let me pull up to your bumper
I'ma spend that whole life savings but no ho savin', I make a bitch roll up 
I never go raw, never gon' roll the dice, put that thing on twice
A nigga never be a doorknob
Too busy livin' that fast life, that cash life
I see them lights in the donut
I put the bullshit off to the side 
P-P-Panties go with it 
'Cause she got a real boss in her life 
Had to come get her 
24s on the muhfuckin' Rolls 
White on white 
Le-Leave all them pussy niggas outside
A fuck nigga I don't like 
All this money I'm makin'
It makes the niggas offended 
I put my bitches in Bentleys
And bought they mamas a kidney now
So what the fuck can you say to me? 
Really, nigga, what can you say to me?
Look, ow!
This money, money, bet I count more hunnids, hunnids
Let the top, don't wanna smoke that loud in my backseat, no honies, honies
Motherfucker, I rip this shit, then kick this shit and punt it, punt it
Play with my dick, she for me, for me
Can't trace this shit, that funny money
My interior  and I am her receiver
She throw it back, I try to catch that shit
I slide down and I eat her
Baby should be riped up
But she striped up like Adidas
Three niggas in one week
I fuck her, but I don't keep her
All this money I'm makin'
It makes the niggas offended
I put my bitches in Bentleys
And bought they mamas a kidney now
So what the fuck can you say to me?
Really, nigga, what can you say to me?
Ow!Lyrics from snippet:

I look fly and they jocking
I got friends and you got friends 
I look fly and they jockingSometimes I feel like running away
From my own fears, own tears and reality
All together, through my eyes there's a different side
You want me to show you why you're here
It's clear
I don't have the answers you wish to learn, learn
You'll always wonder the secrets that I hold, ho-old
My heart cries a bleeding symphony
All my life 'cause you have set me free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery
I'm so numb, I can't feel my face
And for reason, I am not afraid
So if I leave, it's not in vain
I slowly feel my problems fading away
And now I'm drifting to another world
And don't you dare try to follow me, follow me
You wonder if we'll be together, girl
On the other side, but I
I don't have the answers  you wish to learn, learn 
You'll always wonder the secrets that I hold, ho-old 
My heart cries a bleeding symphony
All my life 'cause you have set me free
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery
No more crying
Slowly dying
Gave up trying
There's no turning back
Lightning strikes me
Quietly, rocking me to eternal sleep
Beautiful voices singing me a lullaby
Luring me to the other side
I don't have the answers  you wish to learn, learn 
You'll always wonder   the secrets that I hold, ho-old 
My heart cries a bleeding symphony 
All my life 'cause you have set me free 
Oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
You put me out of my, my misery
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
I don't have the answers
Save me, why don't you believe?
I told you I don't have the answersWhere you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what

Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine

You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-Shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark
If we touched, it would bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine what it'd be like
Oh, every time, it will bring me to life
I can only imagine, only imagine
What it'd be like, what it'd be like
What it'd be like, like, like
What it'd be like, like, like, like, like, like
I want your love to touch me, one touch will feel free
I want to feel free, so I can finally be 
So I can finally be, so I can finally be 
So I can finally see, so I can finally see 
Saw you, saw you, saw you from afar, thought I'd say, "Wassup"
You can tell me your name, when we wakin' up
They, they call me Tunechi, I'm good, I'm Gucci
Now you can kiss your old dude goodbye, smooches
You're a beast, yo-you're a beauty
Man, I think somebody done gave Cupid a Uzi
Sh-shoot me, you're a firework, brighter in the dark
So let's turn off the lights, and give me that spark
What it'd be likeWhere you been? Where you been all my life?
Baby, it's a sin, the way you looking alive
It's obvious that I want something from you
And you know what
What I wanna do, do, do

Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes 
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder 
Ooh, make it loud
I be Mr. Who You Wanna Be
Don't hate me 'cause I'm doin' me, you won't wanna be
Anywhere I go, girl, you should follow me
And I don't mean Twitter, just come follow and me
Bottles of that Kool-Aid, drink some
Already know I'm your favorite flavor, but pick one
Already got them girls screaming, "Where he came from?"
Get it up while I'm feeling like an alien
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door
Speedin' to the show, I'm cuttin' it close
Your boy's still young but you know that I'm a pro
I'm thankful for my fans, so I'm rockin' every show
Show, I'm in Mexico
I got 'em going crazy, ooh-ooh, loco
This is not your average rodeo 
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes 
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder
A little louder 
Ooh, make it loud
I'm doin' a hunnid, I'm tryna peel out
I'm wilin' out, I need to slow down
Down the reg', all I see is you, oh
Come here, girl, I won't hurt you
Just throw my heart, I wanna search you
Can I pat you down?
Girl, your body's sayin'
Wake up in the morning and I'm looking for my clothes 
Couldn't tell the time 'cause my wrist stay froze 
Stayed at my girl crib, snuck out the back door

Ooh, make it loud
I got 'em goin' crazy, hand on my antenna
Goin' apeshit, someone throw me a bannana
Pose
Now watch me pose for the cameras
Click, click, click, watch 'em all go Adam Sandler
These girls go too loco, they won't let me on they campus
I guess they parents feel like I don't meet they standards
I felt too many co-ed parties, we in our pajamas
Vegas pool party, hunnid girls in my cabana
Hunnid on my neck, your house on my pinkie
All I see is green, dollar signs when I'm blinkin'
More bucks on the tour bus
Me and Bieber hit the Dougie, they cheer for us
This is not your average rodeo 
Baby, if you tryna ride with me
A chin reaction like dominoes 
And all my ladies scream for me
And make it loud
Make it loud
A little louder

Ooh, make it loudThis is my song

Bitch, I'm in the buildin', guarantee that it's an emergency
Stompin' like a stampede, so I know you bitches heard of me
I'm straight from Virginia, but this ain't common courtesy
Fuck your feelings, I take your feelings' virginity
Million dollars for a show, got a nigga ballin'
I think my phone tapped 'cause my money steady callin'
Every other day, I'm in and out the office
And my soup killin' niggas, need a fuckin' coffin
I'm bossin', if I gotta take it off, I'm a warrior
Known for buyin' big shit, call me notorious
Kill that pussy, ain't no secret, I'm victorious
With all these Columbianas and Eva Longoria, haha
Now I done made a million down in Cancún
I keep shittin' on niggas, need a bathroom
I got my yacht in the water
If it's sharks in the water
It don't matter, I'm killin' 'em with this harpoon
Ha, these niggas, they ain't my friends
They party with me, party with me
But at the same time, they tryna fuck my bitch
And I don't care 'bout them fuck niggas
Never get on my high horse
Ain't ride out with these fuck niggas
This life I got, I die for it
Oh dawg, for this shit, man, I swear to God
All my niggas in the club, we about to mob
Mob with it

Holla at us if you want that problem
First niggas was ballin', now we slam dunkin'
Arms out of school like I'm ridin' in the bunky
That's C Breezy with it, he pushin' my shit
We swapped them out, just like we do the bitches
New to this, I hear they blowin' money like a swisher
Used to be on county, now my taxes six figures
Said my dick conceited, can my head get any bigger?
Then I told her to lick it and blow it, just like it's a swisher
I'm that nigga, I'm that fuckin' nigga
Is that your baby mama? She gon' need a baby sitter
'Cause once I get her, I'ma be all up in her
You fuck with the tip, then I'ma eat her like she dinner
Californication got a nigga faded
I see why a pussy nigga and the bitch related
Too sweet, soft nigga, I'ma call you Danish
I know you see this camera section, bitch, a nigga famous
Girl, I better kill that pussy like a vet
Not like veteran, but I mean veterinarian, I kill the cat
If you a paper chaser, I got them racks on top of racks
Shake your money maker, I got a hunnid
