They like, "Savage, why you got a 12 car garage
And you only got six cars?" 
I ain't with the cakin', how you kiss that? 
Your wifey say I'm lookin' like a whole snack 
Green hundreds in my safe, I got old racks 
L.A. bitches always askin', "Where the coke at?"

Bitch, I'm young Stoney, I do what I wantMe and Kurt feel the same, too much pleasure is pain
My girl spites me in vain, all I do is complain
She needs something to change, need to take off the e-e-edge
So fuck it all tonight
And don't tell me to shut up
When you know you talk too much
But you don't got shit to say 
I want you out of my head
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too
I'm no good at goodbyes
We're both actin' insane, but too stubborn to change
Now I'm drinkin' again, 80 proof in my veins
And my fingertips stained, looking over the e-e-edge
Don't fuck with me tonight
Say you needed this heart, then you got it 
Turns out that it wasn't what you wanted 
And we wouldn't let go and we lost it
Now I'm a goner

I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too 
I'm no good at goodbyes
I want you out of my life

I'm tryna cut you, no knife
I wanna slice you and dice you
My argue possessive, it got you precise
Can you not turn off the TV? I'm watchin' the fight
I flood the garage, blue diamond, no shark
You're Barbie life doll, it's Nicki Minaj
You don't need a key to drive, your car on the charger
I just wanna see the side, the one that's unbothered 
And I don't want ya to never go outside 
I promise if they play, my niggas slidin' 
I'm fuckin' her, and the tour bus still ridin' 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I want you out of my head 
I want you out of my bedroom tonight 
There's no way I could save you 
'Cause I need to be saved too 
I'm no good at goodbyes
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye

Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here before

We bought all the bottles, we came with the models
Girl, this a confession, I'm not like your exes

Dior falls on the floor, I swear we been here beforeHollywood's bleeding, vampires feedin'
Darkness turns to dust
Everyone's gone, but no one's leavin'
Nobody left but us
Tryna chase a feelin', but we'll never feel it
Ridin' on the last train home
Dyin' in our sleep, we're livin' out a dream
We only make it out alone
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it home
Outside, the winter sky turnin' grey
City up in smoke, it's only ash when it rains
Howl at the moon and go to sleep in the day
Love for everybody 'til the drugs fade away
In the mornin', blocking out the sun with the shades
She gotta check her pulse and tell herself that she okay
It seem like dying young is an honor
But who'd be at my funeral? I wonder
I go out, and all they eyes on me
I show out, do you like what you see?
And now they closin' in on me
Let 'em sharpen all they teeth
This is more than I can handle
Blood in my Lambo'
Wish I could go, oh, I'm losin' ho-ope
I light a candle, some Palo Santo
For all these demons, wish I could just go on
I just keep on hopin' that you call me
You say you wanna see me, but you can't right now
You never took the time to get to know me
Was scared of losin' somethin' that we never found
We're running out of reasons, but we can't let go
Yeah, Hollywood is bleeding, but we call it homeI've been looking for someone...
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone to put up with my bullshit
I can't even leave my bedroom so I keep pouring
And I ain't seen a light of day since, well, that's not important
It's been long
And I was feeling Whitney, me and my homies sip the Houston
Cars and clothes, thought I was winning, you knew I was losing
You told me to wake up but my clock always stays on snooze
And I'm done
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh
And I've been looking for someone that I can buy my drugs from
It seems like every plug ran east to Utah, became Mormons
Drought comes around, feels like I have no one to depend on
Sober, ugh
I had 80 beers on Tuesday night, I had nothing to do then
I put on a little Dwight and sang a happy tune
And lit a cigarette, stepped out the door, had an appearance
Drank more
To each their own and find peace in knowing
Ain't always broken, but here's to hoping
Show no emotion, against your coding
Just act as hard as you can
You don't need a friend
Boy, you're the man
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, oohNever know when someone come and try to take my life
I've been sleepin' with the .45 like every night
In the whip I pray to God I don't see flashin' lights
God damn, they right behind me
And I wake up everyday
I wake up every day with this anxiety
And they know where I stay
Got "Malone" on my plates
And they followin' me
Two hundred bands under the floor of the kitchen
A little more up in the walls and the ceilin'
Even family and friends started switchin'
Ever since I got that check, seen 'em itchin'
Eyes open, I see you, I'm watchin' you
More people wanna be you, don't trust no one
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace
Sometimes feel like I got no friends
Can't trust a soul, like I'm Snowden
Right by the bed, keep it loaded
Lord have mercy if they broke in
I don't ever sleep, yeah, I'm wide awake
If you try to pull up to my place
Beam is gonna hit you a mile away
I promise, one of us gonna die today
Helicopters in the sky
No, he can't escape the eyes
Politicians and the lies
Tell me, what's the point in pickin' sides?
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peace
 Mind is runnin' all day
Cost me more than money and I'm payin' the price, yeah
I ain't goin' nowhere
Killin' myself so I can make me a life, yeah
Minute after minute, never had a limit
Woke up every mornin', knew that I just had to get it
Windows always tinted, you ain't lookin' in it
Either way, I know they'll come for me again
Tell me why I can get no relief 
Wonderin' when they'll come for me
A paranoid man makes paranoid plans
I do what I can, but it's out of my hands
Strugglin' just to find my peaceOh
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
I never needed anything from you
And all I ever asked was for the truth 
You showed your tongue and it was forked in two
Your venom was lethal, I almost believed you 
Yeah, you preyed on my every mistake
Waited on me to break, held me under hopin' I would drown
Like a plague, I was wasting away
Tryna find my way out, find my way out 
And it finally came the day
I start giving my heart away
For Heaven's sake, my bones will break
But you'll never own my soul, no
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
I took them stones you threw, made chains for the crew 
I brought up 10 hoes, this coupe only made for two 
They all ran through it, it ain't nothin' left to do
I need some more reasons to live out this evening 
I've been sippin' forever and just taking whatever
Hoping, thinking whenever you'll be back around
Let's go our ways, whichever
You say how is however long
'Cause you know I'll never be alone 
Love 
Shorty gon' back 
Need it on sight 
Crack it all back 
Give her that pipe 
All of my gang 
Shawty went bad 
I feel you crumble in my arms down to your heart of stone
You bled me dry just like the tears you never show
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Why don't you take what you want from me?
Take what you need from me
Take what you want and go
Take it all away
Why don't you 
Take what you need from me, yeah
 Why don't you Ahahah, yeah
When you leave me, make me jump up off my roof
Didn't faze you, would've given you the moon
Even after everything that we've been through
I ain't never met nobody like you
Why you always tryna tell me that it's cool?
Need to quiet 'cause you never tell the truth
Felt like ballin' was the only thing to do
Trade my woman for some diamonds and a coupe
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways
Won't take me down in flames
I don't even wanna know your name
Watch how everything is gonna change, yeah, ayy

It don't matter what you gotta say about it, yeah

So you know that I'm never ever coming back
You kept your heart on the counter in a Prada bag
I used to never ever want to see the light of day, yeah

Beggin' on my knees onto the floor
Now, I don't even want you anymore, anymore
It's over now

Feels like a knife in my throat, you treat this like it's a joke
I bet you've done this before, I ain't surprised, yeah
I wasn't tryna let go, but you'll know why when I'm ghost
I hope you wind up alone, dead in my eyes, yeah
Ain't religious, only Christian when it's Dior
Only prayin' for the Amex and the gold
You ain't stop me, no, you only was a detour
Tried to drive me crazy, you ran out of road
When she's comin' for my heart, it feels like Armageddon
I'ma turn the tables, promise you will not forget it
Won't apologize, don't give a fuck if you're offended
No discussion, yeah, we gotta go our separate ways

Yeah, you'd die for me
Said you'd die, said you'd die
But you lied, you lied to me
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
It was love at first sight, felt like you were chosen 
But that blood in your veins, yeah, I know it's frozen 
Got no patience no more , been waitin' too long 
You hid that shit away and I was the last one to know, bitch 
I heard you comin' in, I was lyin' there awake 
Didn't know that it was you, got the gun right out the safe 
Remember when you got my ass arrested 
At least when I was in jail, I got some rest in 
Ooh, I surrender , time to forget ya 
I'm too tired to forgive ya , it's too hard on my liver 
And you know  it’s all  over now
All your friends , you know  they sold you out
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me, yeah 
It was a VIP, happened to be one of my best nights 
9 AM, I came from out the club, it was daylight 
Got a bad girl, I was treating her too nice 
Caught you being vulnerable, that ain't what I need 
You just sold your soul, girl, quit crying 
Your passport, it looks like you lying 
You broken down by your past, don't deny it 
Your ex called, you was vulnerable, you flying, nah 
Wasn't on the best of terms, girl, I was trying 
I did everything to reach out to you 
Said you never had me caught up in no drama 
I done ran into my karma 
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me 
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me 
We been on the low, but you been getting high with me 
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me 
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me 
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Settle down, I'll spell it out, it's simple enough
I came around, I figured out, should follow my gut
I don't play anymore, I went through your phone
And called the girls in your DMs and took all them home
And I know it's been a while since the last time you heard from me
Grew into a savage and that's why they gave this verse to me
Turns out it shows 'cause they turn out at shows
I sold 15 million copies of a break-up note
Brought some strangers in our beds
And now you lost your right to privacy
Spilling all our secrets
When you thought they'd probably die with me
Know you fucking love it on the low
And you don't have to say I'm crazy
'Cause I know nothing's changed though
Said you'd take a bullet, told me you would die for me
I had a really bad feeling you'd been lying to me
We were on the low, but you were getting high with me
When it's past 11, that's a different side I see
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to me
Said you'd die for me, you'd die for me, you'd die for me
But you lied to me, you lied to me, you lied to meOoh-ooh, wow
Ahh, yeah-yeah

Take me right to you
One hundred bottles of the good shit couldn't even bring you back
What am I to do?
Feel like I'm circlin' a drain, all I see is the remains of an ugly truth 
One hundred models I could follow all the way to hell and back, but they can't replace you

I was puttin' on for you like a jersey
What I didn't know then couldn't hurt me
Never thought that you'd go and do me dirty
Left me in the cold, but on the inside I was burnin'
But that's just the way it goes
Wish that I could have control
Everybody dies alone
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago 
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?
I'm still waitin', wide awake for the waves to come and take
Take me right to you 
One hundred vials of denial, I know they won't bring you back
What am I to do? 
You’re my alibi and motive when I'm lyin' to myself, what an ugly truth 
We’re no strangers to the flame
We will never be the same if we make it through 
My back is up against the wall
But I used to feel invincible
Yeah, it was us against the world
But somehow, someway, the tables turned
I remember back then
Played my cards right you were my best hand
Still you keep me guessin'
Wonder if I'll ever get the message
Say my prayers, but I lost faith a long time ago 
Dream nightmares
I guess we're gettin' used to losin' hope 
I don't even wonder why you don't answer when I call your name
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?
Are you on the other side? Will you save us?
Or will you run away?Ooh, yeah, yeah, hey

'Cause they ain’t ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on ’em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
Yeah, they bet I'ma fall
And I’m only 24, but, bitch, I been through it all
I got so many hits, can’t remember them all 
While I'm takin’ a shit, look at the plaques on the wall
Y'all just sit back, get your kick back
Keep on actin' like you did that, got no respect
For nobody who's just fake in life, ayy, ayy
You ain’t really who you say you are
So pick up the pace, there ain't no slowin' me up 
Get the fuck out my face, can you stop blowing me up?
'Cause my time is expensive, one mill a setlist
Bought a new car 'fore you woke up for breakfast, yeah
'Cause they ain't ever seen me fold under pressure

Yeah, where you been? 
When it was time to do some work and put it in 
I just be laughin' when I see 'em, look at them 
Leave when I lose and pop back up as soon as I win 
You ain't my day one and I know you not my friend
So I can't judge you when you do some phony shit and just pretend
Like you really down with me, because bein' loyal starts within
I seen that money overpower that love and turn it thin
But it ain't stop me, I just kept goin' up, took it on the chin
I wish every time they said I would fold, I'd make an M
Fuck around and be as rich as Jeff Bezos, say it again
Never lose, I go overtime on 'em, stay in that gym
Let's get it
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
I'm tired of bein' tired
This my last shot, you can't be mad, at least I tried
We supposed to be grown, but yet you still acting childish
I can get on the jet alone, I don't need no extra baggage
This year turned into a savage, I got baguettes in my necklace
Driving fast and I won't crash it and I'm supposed to be sober
But some kind of way, I just keep getting loaded
It's gonna take more than some pressure to fold me
Tried as hard as I can, but at this point it's outta my hands
I ain't runnin' out of these bands for nothin' or no one
She say I'm a dog, but it takes one to know one
Been goin' hard, been by myself, I don't need no love
'Cause they ain't ever seein' me fold under pressure
They ain't never, ever seen me fold, nah, never
Always keep one up on 'em 'cause I'm too clever
I would never, ever sell my soul, nah, never
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time
'Cause I been on the road, been on the road, I
Quit actin' like you been with me this whole time

She looking at me like she surprised
They're packin' the post and I'm home alone
When the box hit the door, they go for 35
I try to put on for my partners, they turn into enemies right before a nigga eye
You reach for a shake, I'ma hold out a fist
Giving a nigga a quarter pound without the fries
I just went double platinum with no features
Just to show a nigga I don't really need him
Pass a man a plate and he can make it shake
It's guaranteed he'll fold and bite the hand that feed him
And I know you think that I ain't see it
And I know you bitch ain't got a car
Don't make me go and buy a bitch a lil' Prius
Fuck on the camera, we can call it even
Friends are like the autumn, every year they leavin'
And I'ma rake 'em in a pile, throw 'em in a bag
Tie them bitches up and leave 'em

Hago lo que quiera
Compro lo que quiera porque soy un rockstar
Voy pa'l avión privado
En el Ferrari, en el tablero "180" 
Voy de camino a Suiza
Pa' lanzar mi propio Hublot a la venta
Y voy llamando al Russo
Porque quiero gastarme un millón en prenda'
Una Panamera, un F12 frente a casa 
Gucci, Ferragamo, compro todo plaza 
Rhino pa' los corta', ratas que te cazan
Miles de hipócrita' que vienen y te abrazan
Yeh, yeh, vivo la vida como un rey 
Kilos de música de Medellín a Monterrey 
Siempre cruzando todos los límites de la ley 
Mi movie siempre está en play, yey 
Vivo la vida como un rockstar
Los que tiraron ya no existen, obvio no están
Tengo brujas que con los palos te acuestan
Con peine doble llenos que se manifiestan 
Dicen que el dinero el alma me consume
Yo sigo celebrando en un jet por las nubes
Nadie me las daba cuando abajo solo estuve
Ahora la cuenta nunca declina, siempre sube
Siempre sube, siempre sube, siempre 
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta 
'Tá bien, ustedes son los que más tienen
Vamos pa' los números y verán que son mis nenes
Lo que yo me compro no es pa' frontearle' a ustedes
Es pa' yo llevarme a su mujer en la Mercedes
Maybach, G Wagon, la llevo al privado
30 mil de altura, de camino a Colorado
Le regalo un AP en oro rosado
Me dice que le gusta en el avión si se lo hago
Pregúntale a tu patrón que sabe lo que haremo'
En P.R. calentón, en R.D. reclamón y conectao' en el Bronx, eh, eh
Pregúntale a tu patrón que sabe lo que haremo'
En P.R. calentón, en R.D. reclamón y conectao' en el Bronx, eh, eh
Yo soy una estrella, to'as las babys a mí me quieren, me reclaman
200 el Richard Miller, pero más cabrón que la casa está salda
Yo no tengo enemigo', tampoco amigo', a to' los trato por igual
Que canto pa' las babys no significa que no te la puedas buscar
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block
They make that thing go grrra-ta-ta-ta

Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh 
Ayy, ayy
Ooh-ooh, some things you just can't refuse
She wanna ride me like a cruise and I’m not tryna lose
Then you're left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're a sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you’ll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
Yo no sé lo que tú tienes
Como hace' lo que quiera' con mi vida, tú te vas y luego vienes
Yo no sé que tiene' tú, pero a la ve' yo pienso que no me convienes
A veces trato de buscar una salida, rápido tú me detienes
Así de loco tú me quieres
Pero soy un loco por ti
Tú no sabe' lo que por dentro yo siento por ti
Y por má’ que no quiero verte, vuelvo a repetir
Y sentir cada parte de tu cuerpo cuando estas aquí
No te puedo mentir
Siempre estoy buscándote, yeah-yey
Trato de alejarme y tú acercándote, yeah-yey
De lo que nos pasa siempre culpándote, yeah-yey
Pero se me olvida cuando te veo desnudándote
Y no sé por qué, eh 
And you’ll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, I think your love would be too much
Or you’ll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflower
Ese día que te conocí
No sabia que iba a ser así
El girasol más lindo del jardín
Y verte en el amanecer
Con un beso volví a caer
Dime a dónde se fue, a dónde se fue
Y ahora me quedo con la confusión
Con sentimientos de amor y dolor
Te juro que esa no fue mi intención
La flor de antes cambió de color
Uh-uh-uh-uuh
En mi vida sólo existes tú
Baby, tell what we try to proof
Si tú sabes que yo soy tu luz
And you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You’re the sunflower, es que tu amor es just too much
Or you'll be left in the dust, unless I stuck by ya
You're the sunflower, you're the sunflowerHomie, you's a window shopper

Hey girl, love me
In the middle of a cold dark night
I heard a sound and I thought to myself, "What was that?"
I got up and checked
It was you walking out my door
You said you loved me just moments before
Why'd you lie?
What the heck?
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?

My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Let me introduce you to my friend, Jazzy Eff
Don't you know my friend would do anything?
He would sing to you from winter to spring
You betrayed him
You should go away
He really, really, really misses you bad 
He remembers all the times that y'all had
He's crying 
That's not okay
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Stop, girl, what have you done?
You used to be sweet just like bubblegum
Now you are no fun
You suck, you broke my heart
Our love was as hot as a torch
But you couldn't take it anymore
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
Why don't you love me?
Why don't you love him?
My heart was beating like a very fast drum
You looked at me and said I'm not number one

All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta 
Fuckin' with me, call up on a Uzi
And show up, man, name them the shottas 
When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta 
Switch my whip, came back in black
I'm startin' sayin', "Rest in peace to Bon Scott" 
Close that door, we blowin' smoke
She ask me light a fire like I'm Morrison 
Act a fool on stage
Prolly leave my fuckin' show in a cop car 
Shit was legendary
Threw a TV out the window of the Montage
Cocaine on the table, liquor pourin', don't give a damn
Dude, your girlfriend is a groupie, she just tryna get in
Sayin', "I'm with the band" 
Now she actin' outta pocket, tryna grab up on my pants
Hundred bitches in my trailer say they ain't got a man
And they all brought a friend 
I've been fuckin' hoes and poppin' pillies
Man, I feel just like a rockstar 
All my brothers got that gas
And they always be smokin' like a Rasta

She been givin' me head for twenty minutes, man, this bitch gotta have lockjaw 
Ain't no retirin', bitch I'm firin' out the car, let the Glock off 
And it's a job, take the car to the karate shop and chop that bitch like water 
Man, my shit been going back-to-back, grrra-ta-ta-ta, just like a choppa 
Police pull up behind me, ain't no time to go and hide it, throw the rock far 
Valuable , for twenty minutes, oh man, my shit is 'bout as swole as a gold bond 
I got plenty more, prolly fifty more, but this is what we did so far-ar-ar

When my homies pull up on your block they make that thing go
Grrra-ta-ta-ta 
This that Amethyst Rockstar-life, might not make it
Drop gems 'til I shine bright, just be patient
Two girls in my hotel bathroom naked
That's the type of thrill that I like, don't waste it
My cup filled with no chaser, I'm wasted
Mixin' weed with the Henny, got me cross-faded
Like, "Sorry, no interviews, y'all caught in the Matrix"
Checkin' for statements, life is what you make it
I'm never on vacation 'cause there's no days off
All the hard work, dedication, know it all pays off
I been gettin' no sleep, I been workin' graveyard shifts
I'm a Braveheart, shit, they call me the Sergeant
The general, my squadron, the Pro Era army
Droppin' bombs, this is just the calm before the storm, see
They can never harm me, my brother catch a homi
T-Pain, Post Malone, Joey Bad, this is godly
Huh, hahaha

I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
The finest day that I've ever had
Was when I learned to cry on command
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain

My mother died every night
It's safe to say, don't quote me on that
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?

Forgot to put on the zip code
Love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
I'm on a plain
Somewhere I have heard this before
In a dream my memory has stored
As a defense I'm neutered and spayed
What the hell am I trying to say?
It is now time to make it unclear
To write off lines that don't make sense
I love myself better than you
I know it's wrong so what should I do?
And one more special message to go
And then I'm done and I can go home
Love myself better than you
Know it's wrong so what should I do?
I'm on a plain
I can't complain
