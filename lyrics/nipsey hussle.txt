Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets you could" 
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets you could"
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets you could"
I'm prolific, so gifted
I'm the type that's gon' go get it, no kiddin'
Breaking down a Swisher front of yo buildin'
Sitting on the steps feeling no feelings
Last night, it was a cold killin'
You gotta keep the devil in his hole, nigga
But you know how it go, nigga
I'm front line every time it's on, nigga
Hunnid proof flow, run and shoot pro
458 drop, playin' "Bullet Proof Soul"
Every few shows I just buy some new gold
Circle got smaller, everybody can't go
Downtown diamond district, jewelers like "Yo
Hussle, holla at me, I got Cubans on the low"
Flew to Cancun, smokin' Cubans on the boat
And docked at Tulum just to smoke, look
Listening to music at the Mayan Ruins
True devotion on the bluest ocean, cruisin'
My cultural influence even rival Lucien
I'm integrated vertically, y'all niggas blew it
They tell me, "Hussle, dumb it down, you might confuse 'em"
This ain't that weirdo rap you motherfuckers used to
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
I'm an urban legend, South Central in a certain section
Can't express how I curbed detectives
Guess it's, evidence of a divine presence
Blessings, help me out at times I seem reckless, F it
You got a L but got an E for effort, stretched him
Dropped him off in the Mojave desert, and left him
Ain't no answer to these trick questions
Money makin' Nip, straighten out my jewelry on my bitch dresser
Well known, flick up and jail pose
Smash champagne bottle from Rico's til' Teeth show
Whatever, nigga, playin' chess, not checkers, nigga
Thirty-eight special for you clever niggas
See bro, if you ain't live and die by the street code
Been through all these motions, up and down like a see-saw
I can never view you as my equal
Fuck I wanna hear your CD for?
 Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
 Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
 Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
 Like the beginning of "Mean Streets"
Yeah, look
I'm finna take it there, this time around I'ma make it clear
Spoke some things into the universe and they appeared
I say it's worth it, I won't say it's fair
Find your purpose or you wastin' air
Fuck it though, y'all niggas scared, eyes opened, I can see it clear
They don't make em bar none, they don't make 'em real
They don't make it where I'm from, they don't take it here
They ain't see in due time, I be makin' mil's
Bossed up in this game, I been makin' deals
Get your lawyer on the phone, we can make it real
I got checks and balance, I flex dramatic
Other fifty on my neck, just my reckless habit
Ain't no pussy on my rep, disrespect the savage
I make one phone call and the rest get handled
This just another front step with candles
Lil message from the set, "We accept your challenge"
Whoa-oh, whoa-oh, whoa-oh
Whoa, whoa
We gotta make it, yeah we gotta
We gotta make it, oh, we gotta make it
Ohh, ahh, ooh
We gotta make it, ohh
Victory LapYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ay
I was riding ’round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck 
Tryna put the water on my Patek 
I got killers to the left of me 
We was lurking on 'em, ain't show no mercy on 'em
We was goin' back to back, we put a curfew on 'em
It was dark clouds on us, but that was perfect for us
We know you always crash and burn, but it was working for us
Limo tint the V-12, double check the details
Gotta cross my T’s and dot my I’s or I can't sleep well
Millions off of retail
Once again, I prevail
Knew that shit was over from the day I dropped my presale
Hold up, let the beat build
See me in the streets still
I been fightin’ battles up a steep hill
They gave my road dog twelve, it was a sweet deal
And I been ridin' solo tryna rebuild
Look
I was riding 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin’ up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck 
Tryna put the water on my Patek 
I got killers to the left of me 
Look, under no condition would you ever catch me slippin'
Motorcaded shooters plus the Maybach chauffeur driven
If they catch me wit' it, gon' send me off to prison
Judge ain't sympathizin', court don't show forgiveness
Engine in the Lambo drownin' out the music
Silk Dior with the flowers, five gold Cubans
Champagne while I shop, hope I splurge foolish
Closin' Escrow twice this month, both commercial units
Damn, I wish my nigga Fatts was here
How you die thirty somethin' after banging all them years?
Grammy-nominated, in the sauna sheddin' tears
All this money, power, fame and I can't make you reappear
But I don't wipe 'em though
We just embrace the only life we know
If it was me, I would tell you, "Nigga, live your life and grow"
I'd tell you, "Finish what we started, reach them heights, you know?
And gas the V-12 'til the pipe in smoke"
I was ridin' 'round in the V-12 with the racks in the middle
Had to pray to almighty God they let my dog out the kennel
When you get it straight up out the mud, you can't imagine this shit
I been pullin' up in the drop tops with the baddest bitches
Young nigga been focused on my check 
Got a new coupe wrapped around my neck 
Tryna put the water on my Patek 
I got killers to the left of me 
Another million dollar bail, that's just some regular shit
See my granny on a jet, some shit I'll never forget
Next day we flew to Vegas, with my Puma connects
We break bread, we ain't new to success
Bleed music, invest, enterprise, take lucrative steps
Cold game, but I knew it was Chess
As a youth in the set
Learn the game, you a student at best
But it's a couple things you can expect
Look, just like money know money, nigga, shooters respect
Other shooters we was both, don't want my crew on your neck
I'm on the freeway in a drop, it got me losing my breath
I do the dash with the blues on the deck
Mhmmhm

That money, my dreams, come true
My life, in diamonds, who knew?
Who knew? Who knew?
Turned seven to a 14, 14 to a whole thing
Lord knows it's a cold game, switched up on you hoes, mayne
Big-body take both lanes, backseat blowin' propane
All-black, five gold chains
Young rich nigga bossed up on his own, man
My new shit sound like it's "Soul Train"
Tookie Williams over Coltrane
Eric B by the rope chain, RSC, we fo' sho bang
Tiny locs and they go crazy
What you know about the dope game?
Was you born in the 80s? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
Would you drove through the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school, play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna
Double up

I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down 
Got my All Money In chain too
Let me down 
It's hard to catch what you can't see
I grew up to be who I wanna be, so
The more niggas talk I'ma shine
Might a been way before its time
Posted wit my back against the wall
Life is a bitch but she mine
The rag six deuce yeah it's mine
"The Westside II", yeah it's mine
What you know about
Your poster on the wall like the dealership?
Leave her in the bed, legs tremblin'
Gettin' banged on for your Pendleton's
What you know about
Your response be the reason you exist?
Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so
As the champagne spill
And the car accelerate and the beat gon' cry
I be goin' to the bank at least three, four times
Getting handshakes from the branch managers
We keep doing fly shit when the cameras cut
Double up 
Three or four times, I ain't tellin no lies, I just run it up
Never let a hard time humble us
Do-do-double up

I'd jump off the ledge if you with me
I'd break you up, you just let me down
Let me down 
Let me down Look, my nigga this is dedication, this is anti-hesitation
This a real nigga celebration
This a Dime Blocc declaration
59th and 5th Ave, granny house with vanilla wafers
This the remedy, the separation
2Pac of my generation, blue pill in the fuckin' Matrix
Red rose in the gray pavement
Young black nigga trapped and he can't change it
Know he a genius, he just can't claim it
'Cause they left him no platforms to explain it
He frustrated so he get faded
But deep down inside he know you can't fade him
How long should I stay dedicated?
How long 'til opportunity meet preparation?
I need some real nigga reparations
'Fore I run up in your bank just for recreation
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedication, look
I spent my whole life thinkin' out the box
Boxin' homies three-on-one, got DP'ed but I ain't drop
Chirp on me, here I come, brrt, spin around the block
They blurped on me, said I ran a stop sign but that's a lie
I spent my whole life starin' at the stage
Playin' Sega, daddy smokin' sherm, mama playin' spades
Catchin' vapors, grandma said I'd get some Jordans for my grades
That's my baby, when she died my heart broke a hundred ways
I spent my whole life tryna make it, tryna chase it
The cycle of a black man divided, tryna break it
You take a loss? Shit, don't cry about it, just embrace it
Minor setback for major comeback, that's my favorite
My nigga L said, "You do a song with Nip, K. Dot he a better Crip"
I said, "He a man first, you hear the words out his lips
About flourishing from the streets to black businesses?"
Level four, yard livin', given to false imprisonment
Listen close, my nigga
It's bigger than deuces and fours, my nigga
Since elementary we close, my nigga, yeah, straight like that
I give you the game, go back to the turf and give it right back
For generations we been dealt bad hands with bad plans
Prove your dedication by hoppin' out Grand Am's
I'm at the premiere politickin' with Top, Nip, and Snoop
Damn, Pac watchin' the way we grew, from dedication
If it ain't congratulate then it look like hate
If it ain't congratulate then it look like what, Nipsey?
Hol' up
Look
This ain't entertainment, it's for niggas on the slave ship
These songs just the spirituals I swam against them waves with
Ended up on shore to they amazement
Now I hope the example I set's not contagious
Lock us behind gates but can't tame us
Used to be, "Stay safe," now it's, "Stay dangerous"
'Cause ain't no point in playin' defense, nigga
That's why I dove off the deep end, nigga, without a life jacket
Couple mil', tour the world, dawg, my life crackin'
Cook the books, bring it back so it's no taxes
Royalties, publishing, plus I own masters
I'll be damned if I slave for some white crackers
I was mappin' this out, I hit the heist backwards
Hoppin' out the eighty-five in Reebok Classics
Ran a couple marathons just to get established
To make it happen, you got to have it
Dedication, hard work plus patience
The sum of all my sacrifice, I'm done waitin'
I'm done waitin', told you that I wasn't playin'
Now you hear what I been sayin'
Dedication
It's dedicationPull up in motorcades, I got a show today
This all I'm tryna do, hustle and motivate
Choppers and throwaways, hustle the Hova way
That's why they follow me, huh? They think I know the way
Cause I took control of things, ballin' the solo way
And if you pattern my trend, I make you my protege
Slauson Ave. soldier raised, niggas don't know them days
Take you in back of the buildings, make you expose your rage
Take you across the tracks, make you explode a face
Now you official now, but you got a soul to save
I just been cookin' that new, I'm bout to drop in a few
Think if I call it the great, the people gon' call it the truth
Ain't really trip on the credit, I just paid all of my dues
I just respected the game, now my name all in the news
Trippin' on all of my moves, quote me on this, got a lot more to prove
'Member I came in this bitch, fresh out the county with nothin' to lose
And I don't do this for nothin', nah, from the ground up, yeah
But I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, not at all, yeah
My momma need rent, ma need rent, yeah she do, aw yeah

Hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motivate
Woo!
Back in this bitch like I never left
Stand for some shit that you never rep
Passing through stages in life
Through the ups and the downs like it's all just another test
Live by the rules like a fuckin' ref
I got respect in a hundred sets
Too many chains, need another chest
Playin' no games if it wasn't chess
Cut from that cloth that you couldn't stretch
Cut from that circle you couldn't test
Heavily pressured and under stressed
Even though niggas ain't show up, it was a mess
Honest attempt, play him to the left
Judge a young nigga by they address
Left us no option, what they expect?
Only thing we knew for sure was to bang the set
Fuck livin' basic, I'm takin' risks
Fuck what they sayin', I'm sayin' this
Don't waste your time, it don't make you rich
It don't mean nothin' so fuck 'em, let's make a grip
Double up, triple up, make assist
Ballin' so hard, you could play your bench
Lead to the lake, if they wanna fish
Make sure them niggas around you stick to the script
This should be written in stone
You should come visit my zone
Don't take my word, double check all of my flows
Ask 'em how Hussle got on, but fuck what you heard
This is for who walked down that road
Sold everything, but they soul
Straight off the curb, real niggas rich as you nerds
Addressed to whom it may concern
I don't do this for nothin', nah
And I don't do this for nothin', nah, from the ground up, yeah
But I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, not at all, yeah
My momma need rent, ma need rent, yeah she do, aw yeah
Hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv'
So I don't do this shit for nothin', no, not at all, all
Hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motivate
I told her I got it, ohh, yeah
Hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv', hustle and motiv'
So I don't do this shit for nothin', not at all, from the ground up

Victory LapAw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
Mogul and they know that, logo on my floor mat
Courtside, Chamberlain throwback match my Rolex
Everywhere I go, flex, vallet park on some loc shit
Whole lot of smoke in that 'Rari, that thang potent
Burnin' rubber, wearin' cameras, they was undercovers
Under pressure, made statements, turned on they brothers
Never judge you but the streets'll never love you
I wonder what it come to you in your brain for you to run to
Ones that hate us, handcuff us and mace us
Call us dumb niggas cause our culture is contagious
Third generation South Central gangbangers
That lived long enough to see it changing
Think it's time we make arrangements
Finally wiggle out they mazes, find me out in different places
I'm the spook by the door, this the infiltration
Double back dressed in blue laces
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
They killed Dr. Sebi, he was teachin' health
I fuck with Rick Ross 'cause he teachin' wealth
Dropped out of school, I'ma teach myself
Made my first mil' on my own, I don't need your help
All black Tom Ford, it's a special evenin'
City council meetin', they got Hussle speakin'
Billion dollar project 'bout to crack the cement
So one of our investments had become strategic
Summer roll '18, man it's such a season
'Bout to make more partners look like fuckin' genius
We was in the Regal, it was me and Steven
We done took a dream and turned it to a zenith
Anything I want and everything I needed
Gotta pace yourself, it's all about yo' breathin'
You can have it all, it's all about your reason
I done took my name and carved it in the cement
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
I flashback on that shootout at the beach, twenty deep
You tried to squeeze, your gun jammed and they released
Blood on your tee, how many stains? I see three
The bitch started to panic so I made her switch seats
Drivin' now, police chopper ahead flyin' now
Really not too spooked, calmly asked me, "Am I dyin' now?"
All I know is keep you calm and collected
Crackin' jokes like, "Nigga, now you gon' be finally respected"
See your blood leakin', got my foot on this gas
Tossed the .40, we pulled up to Daniel Free and see CRASH
You know the alibi, they started shootin', we was standin' by
Ain't see nothing but the flare from the talons fly
"I wasn't there, I was passin' by"
Matter fact, don't say shit, I'm just gon' drop you in the back and slide
That's yo weed, all the cash is mine
I'll take 'em both to the spot plus your phone 'til you back online
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-oh
Aw baby, it's been so long, long, ah-ohIt's that 4 in the morning shit
I'm off this Red Bull
I got a head full
A nigga stressed out, let's get this bed full
Sexual healing; so appealing
You a bad bitch, I'm a real nigga
Tell me that you love me
I tell you the same
That's a fucking shame
We both runnin' game
I just want your pleasure
You just want my pain
I just want you all for me and you just want the same
Let's take a flight; let's live this life
Let's get a hotel, let's both spend a night
I'm a busy nigga, you a busy girl
It's a fast life we liven' in this busy world
We in my fast car, you ain't no fast broad
You got yo' heart broke, he did yo' ass wrong
Plus yo' dad gone, let me be yo' daddy
I wanna see you happy we both come from broken families
You can tell the truth, I'mma tell it too
We gon' smoke this weed 'til they kick us out the room
Like fuck it, that's life
Fuckin' tonight; we fuckin' right?
You fuckin' right
I ain't goon' lie to you; I know I'm fly to you
Nah, fuck that girl I'm the sky to you
Ocean in the clouds; birds and the bees
Your friends proud when they know that you fuckin' with me

Around the world; started on Slauson
That's real shit; real shit
I know all my real bitches feel this

Bend you over, I got you moaning
You love this shit, you want this shit
You got this shit, no politics
Smoke something with you?
It's like we pouring' some more drink
Get yours, I got mine

Sittin' on the top floor of the fly ass hotel drunk as fuck with a bad bitch
Make you appreciate life
Nigga work hard you know
7 days a week we do this shit
You should do it with me
When I'm gone, shit play this
I ain't trippin' on shit, ain't no rules in this
Fuck 'em all though
HussleLast time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked
I was sellin' zones in the set 
Make a quarter mill no sweat 
Last time that I checked, I'm the street's voice out west
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first, you get the money, then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked
I been self-made from the dribble
I was been sayin' I'ma kill em, look
Playing no games with you niggas
Pop clutch, switch lanes on you niggas, look
I laid down the game for you niggas
Taught you how to charge more than
What they paid for you niggas
Own the whole thing for you niggas
Reinvest, double up, then explained for you niggas
It gotta be love, who run the city? It gotta be cuz
This for the pieces I took off the Monopoly board
And y'all niggas false claims—it gotta be fraud
Just keep the hood up out your mouth and you gotta be charged
I doubled up, tripled up, nigga, what!
Banged on the whole game, I ain't give a fuck
Nobody trippin', had no business, got my digits up
And when I drop, you know I'm 'bout to fuck the city up
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked
I was selling zones in the set 
Make a quarter-mill', no sweat 
Last time that I checked, I'm the streets' voice out west
Legendary self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first, you get the money, then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checked 
And I come through fly , no co-sign
I ain't need radio to do mine, I done fine
And I take my time , and take my tribe
Every level that I crossed in this game like state lines
It was visionary; either I'm genius or you niggas scary
Maybe it's both, and this balance I deliver daily
For every nigga in these streets tryna feed the babies
The single mamas working hard not to miss a payment
And dirty money get washed on royalty statements
Black owners in this game of powerful racists
Young niggas in the set that's doing it makeshift
Out the garage is how you end up in charge
It's how you end up in penthouses, end up in cars
It's how you start off a curb-server, end up a boss
It's how you win the whole thing and lift up a cigar
With sweat dripping down your face
'Cause the mission was hard! Ayy!
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked
I was sellin' zones in the set 
Make a quarter-mill', no sweat 
Last time that I checked, I'm the streets' voice out west
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first, get the money, then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next 
Last time that I checked
I got the front end and the back
We on the way and that's a fact 
This real, this ain't rap, where everybody wanna act pro-Black
The last lie you heard, this ain't that
This that "I done made it out the gutter" shit
Nip told you, "Fuck the middleman," I told you, "Fuck a bitch"
Fuck wearing they clothes, I wear my own shit
Y'all can own y'all label, I own my own, bitch!
Ayy, Nip, I remember all that game you throwed me
Don't fuck around and get played by these label owners
Talk that shit to these niggas, Adrien Broner
But secure the win, though, don't let that game fold you
'Cause when this game over, it's really game over
And all they do is play the game 'til this game over
And you be giving game like a big brother
Mission, never let 'em take it from us, no!
Last time that I checked, it was five chains on my neck
It was no smut on my rep
Last time that I checked
I was sellin' zones in the set 
Make a quarter-mill', no sweat 
Last time that I checked, I'm the streets' voice out west
Legendary, self-made progress
Last time that I checked, first, you get the money, then respect
Then the power, and the hoes come next
Last time that I checkedWhen all dreams seem to die
The summer's gone, the breeze stops blowing
The sun just leaves the sky
Yeah
Uh
Yeah, this your life, you can play with it
You make your bed, you gon' lay in it
Do your thing, just be safe with it
Triple bunks in the state prison
Blue laces in my blue chucks
I ain't never gave two fucks
BET I chucked the hood up
Asking if that nigga Nip hood, what
Like I wouldn't take it to the back with you
Same nigga walk the track with you
Same nigga shot a strap with you
Same nigga bought a sack with you
Nineteen touchin' two birds
Alpinas off a few swerves
Grey leather in my white Lincoln
Shit smellin' like a new purse
Two C's on my bitch shit
My money risin' like Bisquick
Six words help you get this
Rich Rapper On Some Crip Shit
I prayed for blessings as a young nigga
Not to learn the hard lessons of a drug dealer
Triple life with a gang enhancement
The judge triple white and he hate your blackness
Slam the gavel with a racist passion
Got you waitin' on appeals but your patience passin'
All you've got to offer is a fight
It's too late to run to Christ once you caught up in this life
Look
So face the world now or cry
Look
Don't cry tears, they don't fly here
And if you don't die here, you supposed to fly lears
365 here is like a dog year
No wonder why these niggas 20 and got white hairs
Stressin' like they 40 and some change
It's lonely in this game, all my homies is in pain
And brodie is the slang, but it don't mean he your brother
It don't mean you can trust him, it don't mean that he love you
And we was raised wrong but we stayed strong
And when we kept it real, we got faked on
And when we showed up, we got flaked on
While them niggas story's gettin' cake holmes
I bet my life I'm a dice shaker
Electric lights on a skyscraper
It's up and downs for a real nigga
But you'll be lame all your life, hater
Mac-10 in my black Benz
Show me signals of betrayal, can't be back friends
Long flights get my mind right
Victory to me is when you spend your time right
Victory to me is when you get your grind right
Victory to me is when you get your moms right
Niggas, got this shit twisted
Like Jean-Michel Basquiat destroyed his pictures
Self-inflicted homicide, don't pull the trigger
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
Regardless what you into, regardless what you been through
I feel like I got to tell you you got something to contribute
Something to contributeStrippers in the club and my cups half empty
Ride with my niggas cause my niggas understand me
Still on Plan A, pussy niggas on Plan B
Young rich nigga, young rich nigga
Right now
Motherfucker, let's go
Yeah, what can make a nigga wanna go and get it?
Said he want a Bimmer with the subs in it
Said he grew up in a house and it was love missin'
Said he grew up in the set, he keep his guns with him
Young nigga  young nigga 
Young  just a young nigga
And he don't need a reason, he a young nigga
And you don't want your daughter and your sons with him
A young  just a young nigga 
Young  just a young nigga
Probably never understand us 
Til he pull in Phantom  
When he pull up in a Phantom
He gon' have that shit blastin' 
Like young nigga  just a young nigga
Young nigga  just a young nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga? 
In my city, that was question number one, nigga 
Lookin' at the legend I become, nigga 
I can't help, but feeling like I am the one, nigga 
Remember I was on the run, nigga 
Couple years before you had a son, nigga 
Open up your doors and kept it one with me
Held a nigga down and that was love, nigga 
Nobody want to stand in front a judge, nigga 
Make you think of better days like when you was winnin'
Standin' on the couches in the club with us
We all in here and we gonna be here
But then I got my shot, I had to run with it
Out the gate, lost count, many days in the studio we slaved
But this shit we gotta say
Staring in the space that you fishing for a phrase
Uninspired and your mind, still it's all a paper chase
First you over dedicate, then you notice that you great
And you been the whole time then it slap you in yo face
Then you stack it in your safe, got it crackin', it was fate
You the definition, nigga, laughin' to the bank
I'm a master of my fate
Plus I'm the type of nigga own the masters to my tapes
I'm in Nevada for the day
I caught a flight from Philly, we just sold out TLA
Fresh up off of stage on my way to B of A
AMB, we L.A., tryna eat, we the way
Look, young Nipsey the great
Never taught how to drink, I just lead to the lake
It's eighty-something degrees in L.A 
Fuck it, time to put some jetskis on the lake
Look, I got a team in my bank
I don't even need an ID at my bank
This used to be a dream we would chase
I know J. Stone and Cobby Supreme could relate
I know the whole team could relate
I know Evan McKenzie and Bron Lees could relate
Cornell, Saddam, Adam Andebrhan
Steven Donelson and Blacc Sam been on this Marathon
Ballin' since my brother used to hustle out the Vons
Couple hundred thousand up, he took a shovel to the lawn
No exaggeration for the content of my songs
When he went to dig it up, shit, a hundred somethin' gone
Molded, you can ask moms
Had to plug in blow dryers for the ones we could wash 
Salvaged the little bit, young rich nigga shit
Pressure on your shoulder, how you gon' deal with it? 
Say it's all uncomfortable when you transition 
But it's all beautiful when you get rich in it 
When you start killin' shit  and they all witness it 
Money grow faster  than niggas could spend the shit 
Open more businesses with you and your niggas
That's watchin'  your vision  and being more generous
Fuck a Ford dealership, we up in Forbes 
Watching and they wishin' that it wasn't yours 
I forgive you, I remember I was poor 
Plus I ain't in the way of what you reachin' for 
You gotta play the game, you gotta read the score 
See, I'ma do the same and pop the clutch of foreign 
They told me if I want it, gotta hustle for it 
Only difference now, the money more mature
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga
Young nigga, young nigga
Get your money, young nigga
Get your money, young nigga, young nigga, young nigga
Get the money, young
Get the money, young, get the money, young
Get the money, young nigga
Keep God first though, take thatPART 1
Look, relate to you, I can't if you's a fake nigga
Where Level 4 in the state what your mistakes get you
Rap niggas, they just wanna double date with you
Twitpic and show these hoes that they affiliate with you
Labels used to treatin' rappers like a slave, nigga
Starvin' artist, "Just be happy with your fame, nigga"
Shit changed, now it's such a different game
All the niggas like myself is controlling everything
If you, pay attention see exactly what I mean
Fuck the middleman, I said that in 2003
Was 18, White Lincoln, chrome feet
Black .40 was my pillow, every night I go to sleep
Grown niggas treat me like they OG
Holdin' on to every word that the tiny loc speaks
I had a vision that nobody else could see
Sold my shit to D-Mac, a little less than 10 Gs
Brought my grocery bag of cash back to Blacc Sam
He matched a nigga, next day we went to Sam Ash
We bought a Pro Tools and a microphone
Studio was far from plush but them lights was on
Couple hunned thousand stashed at my mama's home
Real estate in Atlanta, but ain't nobody know
Mac 11s in the safe, hidden in the floor
My bro did it like nobody that I've ever known
Screens on every wall with 16 camera angles
Double pane bulletproof glass pushin' past the haters
Cuban links and Rolexes, fold a check from Epic
This industry ain't gotta like us but they gon' respect it
Built the label up from money we was savin' up
No details 'til the statute of limitations up
Couple niggas got flipped tryna play with us
The demonstrations speak loud so I ain't sayin' much
Was a charismatic nigga, I don't play as much
'Cause life is real when you live it in a place like us
School pictures crackin' smiles, now my face is stuck
Shell shocked to see how much they really hated us
Couldn't keep a kind heart, get yo' hatred up
Streets smarts, nigga, get yo information up
Watching Belly, smokin blunts, take Jamaican puffs
One day I'ma have a house and car like Jamaican cuz
Credits roll, back to stress pound breakin' up
Had to fight before we hustled, and it made us tough
Early '90s, neighbor's rooster used to wake us up
Mama had a bucket and a shack but we ain't make a fuss
Blue Cutlass, no license, .380 tucked
'96 Caprice 'Bolt Da Fatts' was savin up
They gettin' packed out if niggas try fade with us
Crenshaw and Slauson, True Story, Zo, play the drums
PART 2
I got to this paper, no industry favors
Speaking to they soul, so they tell me I'm they favorite
Been through it myself, yeah, I know how it make you
Never let 'em judge you cuz they ain't you
I could tell a long story or just say I'm grateful
I could tell a gang of reasons or just say I'm faithful
I can sell a million records or just mixtape it
They don't really give a fuck long as I just keep pacing
Quiet for a year, gave no explanation
Now I'm 'bout to drop, I got 'em on that Proud 2 Pay shit
Half of a million cash, he gon' offer me a label
Told him that I need to own it, so I'm cool, kept it gangster
Holla back, real niggas what you calling that
You see the game fucked up, look, what part is that
They compare where I'm at to where I started at
They put me in the Getty, I'm a artifact
They can't never hang me on the wall, though
We presidents, nigga, we push buttons
The rest of y'all just react
Victory Lap, nigga, this Marathon
Still don't stop though
Count me up, count me up
I'm in this shit, you niggas is out as fuck
I'm used to people doubting I'd amount to much
I thrive off the challenge, I'm a childish fuck
I love toys so I'm by the buck
I hate to lose so I play too rough
I speak my mind and say I say too much
Minus the hip-hop, cops say I don't say enough
I know they listening to my raps
While I'm out running these laps
Tryna make my paper stack
It's like this and like that
I think I'm KRS
I think I'm dead prez
I think I'm 2Pac, nigga, I need some fuckin' meds
I think I'm Eminem, I'm going crazy
Shoot in front of the shop, Nas & AZ
I never planned to make it to a old nigga
Plant the bag, 560 off a zone, nigga
Dip my Giovanni feet in chrome nigga
Drop them bitches on Pirellis, hit the road with 'em
I should get the cover of the Rolling Stone, nigga
I should perform at the Old Republic or Rome, nigga
I'm not a rapper or a poet, I'm a poem, nigga
Ain't it amazing how I'm standing on my own, nigga?
Always pull up in foreign that's never loaned, nigga
Always speaking my music straight from my soul, nigga
My business partners Jewish but I'm all nigga
Still ghetto that ain't wrong is it?
Way I see it long as I ball, nigga
I'm a California don, nigga
Hundred thousand on my car, nigga
You know very well who you are, nigga
PART 3
I been that nigga before the fame happened
That tell them hoes go get my name tatted
I rock a Roley 'cause my game classic
And repped L.A. before it came back in
I know y'all see me in my lane smashin'
I know y'all hate me with a strange passion
I made examples out y'all lame asses
I love my life, y'all could hate that shit
All the smart money got they bets on me
And all them real niggas wish the best for me
All these bad bitches got some sex for me
Shout out them bad bitches getting dressed for me
They down to stand in line 'cause it's well worth it
Pull up to my shows in Chanel purses
They jeans fit the worst but they smell perfect
Never argue with they niggas but they yell verses
Ay, I'm true to this game
Gimme that pussy 'fore she tell me her name
Ay, I'm true to this game
All Money In No Money Out on my chain
Ay, I'm true to this game
No guarantees, you gotta live for today
Ay, I'm true to this game
Do it big 'til they remember your name
Hustle
Ay, I'm true to this game
Gimme that pussy 'fore she tell me her name
Ay, I'm true to this game

Ay, I'm true to this game
No guarantees, you gotta live for today
Ay, I'm true to this game
Do it big 'til they remember your name
Hustle
We still them same niggas that we used to be
Blacc Sam in that sedan in the coupe is me
Hundred thousand for the car so the roof was free
While I'm in it flashback on how it used to be
Wildin', nigga, can't relax, it was the youth of me
That make a smoker buy the bullets for a shooting spree
Found myself, same time family losing me
But all that violence from the past is what produced a G
All the real L.A. niggas know the truth is me
No hotline, homie, I could tell your future free
Get on your Marathon 'til you bruise ya feet
Or run the streets 'til the reverend write ya eulogy
Fishbowl in the six with all my jewelry
'Cause I heard my haters is supposed to be shooting me
I'll never let a broke bitch influence me
Slauson Ave, getting money and the proof is me
'Cause I tell everybody all the time
Own your masters, own your catalog
Can't none of these niggas say they own their masters and their catalog
If they do, they're lying to you
Or they gon' say own some of it or they gon' buy it back
All that is bullshit
Just had to get our little thing together
We picked up distribution
Now we're strong, now we're legit, naw'mean
And we're a force to be reckoned with right now, word upLook, I ain't nothin' like you fuckin' rap niggas

Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price 
Want a slice, got to roll the dice

I'm married to this game, that's who I made my wife
Said I'll die alone, I told that bitch she prolly right
One thing that's for sure, not a stranger to this life
Got a safe that's full of Franklins, and a shoulder full of stripes 
Don't know a nigga like myself
I say self-made, meanin' I designed myself
County jail fades, you could pull my file yourself
Spot raid, swallow rocks, I'm gettin' high myself
Look, and damn right, I like the life I built
I'm from Westside, 60, shit, I might got killed
Standin' so tall, they think I might got stilts
Legendary baller like Mike, like Wilt
'96 Impala, thug life on wheels
Up against the walls, squabble at Fox Hills
Like a motherfuckin' boss, ask me how I feel
Successful street nigga touchin' them first mills 
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, got to roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life, look

It look like I'm just gon' keep on gettin' rich 
Know them Westside RSC's is us
LAPD on my dick, I'ma squeeze and bust
If a rap nigga diss, Swiss cheese his bus
All this rap money, nigga, look, I need too much
Money, loyalty and love in the dream we trust
You be switchin' up the players on your team too much
Tiny Cobby, that's my loc, Young Supreme, what's up?
And we travel 'round the world gettin' cream and what
Ain't you get off on whoever Hussle seem to rush?
Las Vegas, strip pop, yeah, you creamed them punks

That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life, lookYuh
Me? I'm gettin' back rubs from these leather seats 
Negotiatin' equity positions you'll never be 
Rap sheet full of felonies 
Status symbol on my set of keys, they say I was sellin' dreams
Back to the brick wall, I'm inhalin' trees
Visualizin' hella cheese, you can smell the weed
Niggas doubt, pessimism ain't affectin' me
Fuel to the fire, took it higher than they ever see
Frequent flight seat like seven seas
Shoppin' spree spent about eleven Gs
Eyes bloodshot, I don't ever sleep
My niggas act on instinct, we don't ever think
When confronted with a problem, we don't ever flee
We connected at the bottom like the letter V
So accustomed to the pop, we don't even blink
When them shots go off, get the Glock, show off
Yellow tape a nigga, he grew up to hate a nigga
Nothin' major, nigga, just a demonstration, nigga
Within the matrix, nigga, I drew illustrations with him
Words, that is, for sure, that is
Look, that nigga got his off the curb, that is
So how the fuck is niggas so concerned with his?
I be baffled by the fact when niggas burn their bridge
And try to double back like, "What the fuck is that?"
Like, Niggas want this rap life way too bad
We ain't gotta worry no more, we'll be just fine
And we ain't finna wait no more, so don't waste my time
Remember when we had no way, no way
But we'll be okay for now
We'll be okay for now
And here on out
Now you up, huh? Make it hard to trust, huh?
Got you fucked up sayin' it was luck, huh?
Pulling up, huh? Limo tinted trucks, huh?
Open trust, huh? Then you fill 'em up, huh?
Every time a nigga drop, it's real as fuck, huh?
Every time you hit the road, you fill 'em up, huh?
Whole city know that you became the one, huh?
They seen it from the jump, huh?
The pressure weigh a ton, huh?
Especially where you come from
Every night br-br-br-brap bump bump
Heavy price but it's just the cloth you cut from
It's alright, it's just life if you want one
Learn to hold yourself down with a big gun
All these niggas playin' tough, you gon' chip one
For these dollars, a decade, you a risk one
Fuck it though, 'cause when you flat broke, you ain't nothin', bro
Seen a gang of rich niggas get comfortable
Then lookin' at their watch like, "Where the fuck it go?"
Through my eyes I learned lessons like
Time is of the essence and my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless
Put myself in the game but batteries sold separate
Question, since when do real niggas come second?
So I kicked the door down, gettin' more now
Nigga need at least like thirty for the show now
Woah now, realest out of So Cal
Baby wanna fuck I'm like, "Mmm, slow down"
I'm eatin' cheese eggs in my hotel
Hussle sold out, nigga, retail and wholesale
Me ballin' hurt your feelings? Oh well
All money in, I pull coattails, nigga
We ain't gotta worry no more, we'll be just fine
And we ain't finna wait no more, so don't waste my time
Remember when we had no way, no way
But we'll be okay for now
We'll be okay for now
And here on out
Hey Nip
What up?
Let me get a flick wit'chu
Come on, lil' bro
Got your camera?
Yup, here it go right here
Aight bet, here you go, homie
Hey, Nip, let me spit somethin' for you real quick
Oh, you rap, nigga?
Yeah, you know how I get down
Let me hear somethin', bro, go 'head
Look, I was stuck in these streets tryna make it out
I seen most my homies change, man, they fakin' out
And my brother really gone, straight taken out
So a death spares a life and it really play about
Cadi finna make it, oh yeah, niggas, that's without a doubt
Hoe don't interfere 'cause all they wanna do is run they mouth
I been out chear really tryna chase the paper route
Fuck wit' me, I'll knock you out
Talkin' Manny Pacquiao
I really do this music so that I could see my mama smile
I'm tryna go major but I know that it's gon' take a while
I don't even know if I'ma live to even see a child
'Cause niggas in the streets with a gun and they be goin' wild
Cadi super hot, all you other niggas stuck on mild
In this Audi smashin', man, this jug got four-thousand miles
I ain't never stoppin' 'til my money stacked up in a pile
On TV, haters watchin' me, I hope that y'all could see me now
Everyday I wake up, I just thank God for another day
Damn, I really can't believe they killed my fuckin' nigga Tay
I remember goin' to school, chillin' up, smokin' eights
And now my nigga gone and his body gon' be on display
These gangbanger's serious, shit got me curious
Losin' homies to bullshit, this shit got me furious
My brother gone too, he ain't never comin' back
How you think that make me feel, nigga? All I do is rap
Anytime I spend money, all I do is make it back
Anytime I'm in these streets, all I do is watch my back
'Cause niggas'll wet you up, chicks'll set you up
You think your days ones with you but niggas be switchin' up
I seen it all
I seen homies go before my eyes
Some homies'll make it, some don't come out alive
My mom prayin' and she hopin' that her youngest survive
'Cause she know that I'm gettin' high
Bills steady, rollin' pie
Wasn't no father in my life, big brother in the sky
Every night I'm in my room and I sit and ask, "Why?"
Bitches choosin' on a nigga so you know I still reply
And they speakin' on my name so I know I'm that guy
Yeah, that's right, my nigga
How old are you, bro?
Man, I'm sixteen, man
Sixteen? That's right
What they call you, nigga?
LilCadiPGE
Fuck wit' meLook I let the beat bang I don't claim colors
Honestly the honesty is why the game love us
My women either centerfolds or on the main covers
Stunt so hard I make these niggas hate summer
And pray for winter but when it's winter time
I'm still waitin' on these niggas at the finish line
We just took our first trip to the Amalfi coast
Couple days on the beach then it's adios 
Just look at what I done alone
You will swear we planted trees the way the money's grown
We been busy like some bees no honeycomb
And you could prolly feel the breeze when the money's blown
Pardon my towel and flip flop phase
I'll never be the reason that a bitch got paid
Even when I'm not functioning in tip top shape
I could bench as much as hip hop weighs... drizzy
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa
Listen, look, before rap my last name was my lifestyle
And when I visualize success it look like right now
What was once gray skies is now white clouds
And I did it with the ones that ya'll said was not the right crowd
Follow my steps and you'll see what I'm 'bout
I keep my money coming in and never going out
Chuck taylors on the pavement with the blamma's out
Then I hit the league straight out the streets with no talent scout
And now my face bring the cameras out
That young nigga these industry bitches yap about
You know the one the cops buck you up and ask about
All because I took my wildest dreams and then mapped 'em out
I go for mine like it's overtime
Me and my niggas had to struggle so we over shined
Been fucked bitches I been on my grind
Cause on a mission your worst enemy is idle time... hussle
Uh, I'm tryna bring it home
Even if I gotta do it on my own
I'm a muhfuckin' killa, killa, killa, killa
Uh, and I'm the one to blame
Now that I'm around shit will neva be the same
I'm a killa, killa, killa, killa niggaYeah 
Hah

They connect with my words, right at the part where it hurts
This life is a bitch, my hand up her skirt
Had a thirst to get rich, couple stains on my shirt
Every reason to fail, but we was makin' it work

Do it 'til you sweat, and your hair a mess
Have you late for work, but you could care less
You been livin' more, you been lettin' go
You been havin' fun, just to let me know
That you down to ride, you down to roll
You know the game and how it go
Nigga, I’ma live like it’s my last 
Worried 'bout them bitches we done had

Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
Look, my mama wanna know why I'm bangin'
She told me I'ma lose my life
I ain't trippin', I'm a crip and I'ma do it right
'Fore I run from a nigga I'll lose the fight
I gotta hustle, Mama, I'ma move the white
If I died and came back I'd do it twice
Brainwashed by the block, it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howlin' at the moon at night
Mama, it's cold outside, ain't no hope outside
Couple niggas gettin' money, most is broke outside
Rocks in the house, sellin' dope outside
Reminiscin' on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Hustla gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner on my lap and I'm dippin' in my bucket
Life's a bitch, nigga, fuck it!
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
Chyeah, they say we probably die slangin', bangin', pressin' the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a chopper for the coppers, keep a TEC in the ride
Every nigga got a limit, never step on the line
When the set say it's on I'm expected to ride
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga, it's cold in my hood, ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope, smokin' dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I rode chrome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil' off what I wrote in my hood
I ain't trippin' 'cause niggas know I spoke for my hood
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
I don't give a fuck
Ride with my burner and my beat turned up
AC blowin' and my window down
Chunkin' up my hood when I hit yo town
"Bigger Than Life" 
What up?
What it do?
Music Corner
I'd like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need your hands up though
Yeah, look
I don't want your love, it’s not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach, it just seems so confusin'
That I felt my place in life, a young black man, it's seems so useless
But I don’t want no help, just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife that's in my back'll be the the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it, I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunist
Hopin' as you walk across the sand you see my shoe print
And you follow 'til it change your life, it’s all an evolution
And I hope you find your passion 'cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it’s not material 'cause that’s all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institution double standard
Actin' like they not the reason we ruthless
But tonight
Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history
Don't judge me by my progress
Look
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standin'
Y’all can say it's luck but I know that it's plannin'
Shout out to the pain that gave me understandin'
Shout out to my gang, it turned me to a savage
So niggas could say what they want to but I go through what you haven’t
But it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boastin' and braggin'
This road I chose to go down, hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow, I had to let go of some habits
And it's easy to say I’m on now 'cause you see it, and it happened
But before it ever did, I had to believe and get it crackin'
So I’m gon' take you back then, 32 shots and my MAC-10
With a dream minus the means, my early teens was fuckin' tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine
That I wrestle with at night, demons that I fight I can’t get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get, it don’t matter if you plastic
We was lookin' for the lights and all we stumbled 'cross was flashes
But tonight
Tonight is my night, this is my moment
Feelin' bigger than life but I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history
So if it’s meant, then it’s gon' be
People love it 'cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y’all to feel me
It’s my time so I’m goin' in
We ball 'til we fall, fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin’, I know you hoes plottin'
I ain't worried 'bout it 'cause I know God got me 
Got me 
Got me 
Say I know God got me 
Got me 
Got me 
Yeah, I know God got me 
Got me 
Got me 
Yeah, I know God got me
See, I ain't worried 'bout it
'Cause I know God got me 
Got me 
Got me 
Once in a lifetime shit, you know?
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafuckin' dream
Fuck what they say, do your shit
Tonight is my night 
This is my moment 
Feelin' bigger than life
But I gotta own it
A victory 
Let's make history
For my niggas that's gone
For my niggas that can't be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful little girl Emani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout out my nigga Fats
Shout out my bro Adam
Shout out my A and Bs
You know what this is, it's the motherfuckin' marathon
And this shit ain't gon' stop, man
One hundred Longwinded, running through this life like it was mine
Never settling, but setting every goal high
One thousand burpees on the path to my own destruction or success
But what is a mistake without the lesson?
See, the best teacher in life is your own experience
None of us know who we are until we fail
They say every man is defined by his reaction to any given situation
Well who would you want to define you?
Someone else or yourself?
Whatever you do, homie, give your heart to it
And stay strong
Lot of niggas fail, but I won't
Lot of niggas fold, but I cope
Lot of niggas gone, but I'm home
Lot of niggas off, but I'm on
Lot of niggas lost on this road
Couple niggas gave up their goal
Gang of niggas traded their soul
But me, I'm standin' on ten toes
Lookin' out my Benz window
Wonder where'd my friends all go
Scared to give my heart to this girl
Paranoid she gon' leave if my ends get low
No one in this game to be played
But I'm knowin' that this game to be changed
I should be afraid of afraid
I'm just tryna live up to the meanin' of my name
I'm just tryna live up to them niggas in my gang
I'm just tryna live up to my moment on the stage
I'm just tryna live up to the truth in my pain
And the power that they gave me in the youth of today
I put a coupe in the safe
And I shoot from the waist
My time is money
And I ain't got a second for you flukes and you fakes
I do this shit for my woes
I do this shit for my niggas
I do this shit for my bros
I do this shit for my niggas, yeah
I do this shit for my woes
I do this shit for my niggas
I do this shit for my bros
I do this shit for my niggas, yeah
We've been takin' trips more than often this month
When I call they pullin' up, 2, 3 stream up
You ain't do enough for the clan, how I feel
If I gotta shut it down, how the film gon' feel?
120 in the Euro, one hand on the wheel
I was just broke, ran through a quarter mil'
Can't believe I'm still here, shed tears for the dead
Cubes in my 30 chain, she don't even wear
Call my little brother up, you know we took it there
Real nigga tellin' on me, only thing that I fear
Yeah, only thing that I fear
Real nigga tellin' on me, only thing that I fear
Lotta niggas queers, lotta dope in the air
Lotta niggas queers, lotta dope in the air
Styrofoam contaminated, got a nigga meditatin'
Yeah, I said it got a nigga meditatin'
I can't even eat 'less I'm medicated
I can't even sleep 'less I'm medicated
I've been on my feet chasin' check after check
Nigga, week after week, 'cause I'm dedicated
I can't even eat 'less I'm medicated
I can't even sleep 'less I'm medicated
I've been on my feet chasin' check after check
Nigga, week after week, 'cause I'm dedicated
I do this shit for my woes

Wearin' red bottoms and Jimmy Choo
I do this shit for my daughter
I do this shit for my mama
I do this shit for my son, ayy, ayy
I do this shit for my brother
I do this shit for the world
I do this shit for the globe
I do this shit right here, nigga
And I do that shit, why y'all fuck with the boy?
I'm wet like a boat
I'm lovin' my chickens
I smoke and I choke
I do it for my brothers
I do it for my folk
Got 40s on me, yeah, yeah, yeah
Nigga shoot from the toes
All the way up to the top
All the way up to the topYea all this stress on my brain right
Poker face, I’m in the game right
Need a week to think, maybe 8 nights
Some promethazine and a straight flight
Let me cut off my phone, let me get in my zone
Let me center myself, just leave a nigga alone
I be back in a few, got some rappin' to do
Got some stacking still runnin', got some lapping to do
All, Jokes to the side, nigga know that they ain’t fucking with the flow I provide
Y'all, notice how I started and now a flow has evolved
And me and Ralo Styles like Wade and Lebron
And it’s all money in and your bros is in charge
Hoes in ménage for those rose carte blanche
In them out of town suites ‘cus they know we the ones
Equity nigga, what ive chosen, of course
No 360’s, clothing and tour
When I do drop I’mma blow past niggas
And I toe tag niggas like I told 'em before
Got flow, got whores
Got dough, get more
Fuck mine, get yours
And the show just started, nigga hold your applause
Tryna get to my spot
Look, you gotta go up floors
I put the 6 on stock, I was runnin' through tires like chicks on tour
And if im at the game, you can bet your bottom dollar that I sit on floor
And if im at the fight, you can bet your bottom dollar sweat hit my whore
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
A nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
I’m livin' out my dreams now
Livin' out my dreams now now now
Sittin' in the trap like damn tryin' to turn
Couple grams to a couple hundred grand
I grew up in a town they don’t make it out of
If you black you don’t live to see a man
You see 21, you done won the lottery
Talkin' friends, when the streets there
Took a lot from me, I washed up from a robbery
Now your name 4657239B state property
Yea, you had a dream, now you livin' out a nightmare
You almost made it little nigga you was right there
Now your release date is in another light year
Yea, and it’s quite clear
All you needed was a little bit of guidance
And your household it was just silence
You was your own mother and your father
How the hell you supposed to know what to do when nobody showed you the ropes
All they showed you was pistols and dope
Gang flags in the land with no hope
Where every fitted hat mean a different hood
Make it out & they still want you in the hood
Your own homies don't want you livin good
Niggas for they self, get it understood
Its just a playground full of mood swings
Die for the color of your shoe strings
Wish I had a different way to view things
You either had a rap hook or a hoop dream
From El Segundo to Slauson
Me and Nipsey, we young bosses
Never takin' no losses
Check the garments nigga, life's marvelous
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
Won’t take no loss, won’t take days off
We go so hard, until we fall
A nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
Nigga used to dream, my reality’s a dream now
I’m livin' out my dreams now
Livin' out my dreams now now nowLoaded bases, that's my motivation
A nigga feelin' lucky, we should go to Vegas
2018 mode of transportation
Got me feelin' over-anxious like a home invasion
My dough inflated and I'm more creative
Signed a couple big deals but it's no paradin'
See it's a couple niggas every generation
That wasn't supposed to make it out but decode the Matrix
And when they get to speak, it's like a coded language
Reminds niggas of they strength and all the stolen greatness
We used to shoot at niggas' at the Mobil station
Full circle, mogul motivation
My, self-educated shrewd negotiations
Got these sharks that I'm sittin' at this table with afraid to bait me
No tint on my Mercedes, that's for inspiration
Two kilos on my neck like the fuckin' 80's
Westside Slauson Ave., know my demonstration
Born and raised, y'all affiliated
It's really greatness, ride around like I really made it
Loaded bases, I'm gonna Wille Mays it, yeah
Listen to my ambition 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every second's being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom line, I'm gon' make it home
Look, I was sittin' on my Lincoln, I start thinkin'
Nigga, I ain't gon' make a hundred mil' off in these streets and
More than likely I'm gon' end up in somebody precinct, even worse
The horse and carriage front the church, laid off in a hearse
I dealt with it, I ain't just out here for my health with it
I weighted the risk and the reward and seen the scale tippin'
Let's all get on one accord and take the world niggas
Take the money, take the power and the girls with us
Can't buy that bullshit that they sell niggas
That breed drugs heads and jail niggas
Look, all these ways they derail niggas
That's why respect me to the utmost when you see me's how I feel niggas
'Cause I ain't fail niggas, I seen it comin', didn't I tell niggas?
Different lane, same passion for the mail niggas
Switch lanes, all black, two glass ceilings
V-12 too fast nigga, gone
Listen to my ambition 'cause I'm on one
Swingin' for the fences for the home run
Even further beyond into the universe
But I got to make it to first first
It feels like every second's being stolen
I risked it for every ticket we sold them
You got the ball, I'ma take it home
Bottom line, I'm gon' make it homeThey call me Young Nip C-Note, Rose Clicquot
Talkin' to my girl while your bitch give me deep throat
Shootin' at the world, dog, 'cause life is just a free throw
Shoppin' on rodeo in some dickies, that's my steelo
Played out pussy, please don’t offer me, no
If sex was a weapon, she could not kill a mosquito
Little mama lost her grip, pastrami around her pee hole
Got too many miles, baby, that’s a repo
Shorty's in denial, really tryna fuck with me though
I'm way out your league so please excuse my ego
Diamonds in my Cuban link, my Rolex presidential
Penthouses and beach homes, perrier and patron
Told you way before about this baller shit I be on
Young Nipsey Hussle ain't some shit that you should sleep on
Rich before rap, had to let the streets go
Faith in my transition, I knew I’ll be back in beast mode
Catch a case, that’s the tradition, either that or six believe no
Still somehow I understood that I could make the seed grow
And that one day that tree will bear fruit to feed my people
That one day is upon us, grab your fork it's time to eat, bro
Slauson Ave he's so
Rapper, CEO
And if we're all actors, I guess I'll be Al Pacino
And it was all after when they thought I was finito
Not my Valentino, it's what I got up my sleeve though
LAX to JFK then on our way to Heathrow
At the polo lounge in here sippin' cappuccino
Spendin' pounds, every purchase man this feeling has no equal
If you come from where I come from, it's rare that you see folk
That did it like I did it but do it ‘cause we need more
Cuba Gooding Juniors kill 'em with that submarine flow
Like every man of honor had to conquer Rob De Niro
Like Ginger in Casino or that runway light in Heat
That shadow in the grass from when Vincent shot him off his feet
In other words, life is just a fight against your disbeliefs
That's why I'm screamin' I'm the greatest of all time like Young Ali
Play Mohammad to these false prophets in this industry
But I’m just me, catch me cruising solo in my 2-seat B-E-N-Z
Or at the Roosevelt with Rimpau smokin' weed TMZ
Flashing lights like Kanye album number three, but I’m gon' be
From R.S.C. 'til the day I D-I-E, so I crank my beat and hit the gas on 'emOcean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Blessings, bitches in my section
Young with all this money, I'm obsessive, weapons
Turnin' off y'all extras
Turnin' off this bullshit direction
Turnin' up my grind
Wakin' up to more pressure
But it's all in your mind, so I never feel pressured
Knew it's all in due time, now hundreds stackin' like Tetris
Hustle hard is my message, then double back and get extras
Know I spaz when I catch it
Yellow Bone, white Lexus, all black tint, two white cups, fat gold chains, Sprite, Texas
I'm just young and I'm reckless, I'm just on for my section
I'm just out here on top speed with my top down and I'm revin’
I don't know about Hell, I don't know about Heaven
All I know is 'bout right now and this lifestyle is interestin'
Iced out in my session, I just write down these confessions
Niggas died and got life around me, I guess that I'm an exception
Blessings
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Look, I'm in these streets with my Cuban on
In my Benz with my music on
Old friends like, "What you been on?"
Shit, I've been on my grind
I ain't usually home, focused, I ain't usin' phones
Lately, I've been usin' songs to get my point across
While niggas 'round me lose it all, but that's your coin to toss
I guess I always knew to ball
And as this world revolves, I'm crackin' 'cause I do my job
Look, from fuckin' hood rats to fuckin' stars
Spendin' all cash to slidin' cards, it's the definition of livin' large
Smokin' top flight in the biggest cars
Told you '08 this shit was ours
Gettin' this cake, yeah, nigga, then gettin' more
Look at this world, young nigga, this really yours
Nigga, this really mine, my niggas is really for it
Them buildings is really high
Them cars is really foreign and all I see is
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true
Yeah, early mornin' off that flight though
We gon' go hard then get right, bro
It seemed simple, that's not life though
Ten years later I'm alright though
Look, these niggas act like they don't like dough
They be mad 'cause niggas shine bright though
Look, I got a Ruger and a Bryco
But I'ma let you pick which way tonight go
I got my dough right, plus the right dough
I mean it's legal, pay taxes to them white folks
My procedure, stay crackin 'til my life's low
Then when I die, blue rag around my rifle
Hundred thousand in my coffin, that's just life though
Play a Stevie Wonder song, smoke some flight, bro
Crack a pint of Actavis then pour in some Sprite, bro
Until that day I'm walking toward what's in my sights though
'Cause all I see is
Ocean views, small circle, it's a chosen few
I wrote it down then I followed through
I bought a pound and we rolled a few
I talk shit but she know it's true

Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'?
Rappin' for my section, roll with my protection
Who gon' die next? Ain't tryna get elected
Ridin' by myself, time for some reflection
I feel like a young boss nigga that's thankful for his blessings
I can't even lie, I ain't even flexin'
Block for me black man, know they tryna stretch us
I ain't tryna preach, I ain't tryna lecture
When you make your first mil' in cash, you gon' feel the pressure
Just wanna feel the thrust, wanna feel the texture
Wanna feel the drop top breeze, wanna feel successful
Wanna change the game, never chase a message
Never stop grindin', cherish no possessions
We ain't get accepted, we just reinvested
Things that I expected 'cause we ain't even set trip

Turn the headphones up for me G
A little bit lower, yeah
Always had the passion, nigga this a classic
How we came from nothing, went and got established
Livin' like a savage, tryna make some magic
Everybody starving, tryna take the sandwich
I know it's elaborate, a nigga just imagined
Felt the right to ask it, we can make it happen
Weavin' through the traffic, I can take you back then
Everything I said I meant, I was never cappin'
I was never scared to stand, front line with MAC 10's
Raise and shoot at black men, never felt the satisfaction
When I seen the game collapsin', guess they took the rules and wacked it
Started movin' at a different frequency and it got me livin' lavish
All my partners steady passin', tryna wiggle through this madness
Tryna fight this gravity at time and I swear I could feel it pull me backwards
Puttin' thousands on they caskets, tryna pick the right reactions
I appreciate the progress, but I'm so conflicted about the status
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot where I was goin', I been drivin', I been smokin'
Almost forgot what I was doin'
Almost forgot what I was drinkin', what the hell have I been thinkin'?

Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
I got that good, still in the hood
I kept my word, yeah my nigga, I make good
6 figure niggas in them v-12s
No tint, nigga, so you see well
My Cuban link, that's 14k
My presidential, I wear it every day
It symbolizes, how I'm enterprising
I came from lint in Dickie pockets so I emphasize it
You check the filing, niggas say I kept it solid
But fuck the rumors, money talks and you made less deposits
I dropped some videos, you should go check the comments
They love me all around the world my nigga, what's your problem?
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
All my liquor from France, my cars from Frankfurt
Told them keep they advance, distribute and market my label
I own it all, I own it all, word in them offices is that I want it all
That's right I do, now who the fuck is you?
To question my request, I paid my fucking dues
Had a couple dreams, now they coming true
I'm at the Porsche lot, asking do they come in coupes?
Walking out the club with a hundred goons
Magnum bottles of the Veuve, and a pungent fume
Model bitches stunting in them fucking shoes
Bring your homegirl 'cause she coming too
Fast cars with them leather seats
Drop top, she a fucking freak
Blow me down while we ride on PCH
I'm Nip Hussle the great, middle fingers in your face, uh
Turn off the lights, turn up my mic
Roll up some flight, let's all get right
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life
I'm Infant Stone, I just came home
My flow is sick, disinfect the microphone
In '08 we told you we was never gon'
Change, and we still on this marathon
I'm a heavy hitter like Barry Bonds
Lightweight setback for a heavy arm
Now I'm jumping on stage with my jewelry froze
Fresh out, spending money, killed the movie role
It's all money in like a Brinks truck
And it's no money out like a prenup
You need to get your green up
'Cause me and my team up
Light up some flight, lace up my Nikes
Victory lap, tonight is the night
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life
This the shit I waited for my whole fucking life 
Turn off the lights , turn up my mic 
Roll up some flight , let's all get right 
It's that shit you waited for your whole fucking life

Turn off the lights , turn up my mic 
Roll up some flight , let's all get right

Nigga, fuck it 
Nigga, fuck it, I came from nothing
Shootouts in public, ridin' buses
Buyin' Benzes, was buying buckets
Knock me off of my grind, that's what they wasn't
My life was ugly, and I got money
Caught a glimpse of that, but that's not for me
She say she love me, she think she love me
She want my money, I think she funny
Uh, a-all bad bitches
V12 engines
Broke niggas die slow
While the rich get richer
Shit like that
Sound like it looks

We on the 'shaw 
Above the law

And never call

All bad bitches, 
V-12 engines 
Broke niggas die slow 
While the rich get richer
Balenciagas, no Gucci problems
Get money with Timers, Louis V persona
Hit a nigga with a llama
You don’t want them problems
I do my thang in the kitchen
See, that's a Pyrex vision
And I roll with the riches
Stay flippin' those bitches
Stay away from the snitches
That's how you get those stitches
Only fuck with my circle
No square ass niggas
And we don't smoke on purple
Only kush out the Benzes
Where a nigga come from?
My niggas is so relentless
We don't play no games
Send a nigga to the dentist
Or to the ICU, that's how I see you
All about my business
All Money business, bitches

Nigga
Y'all see this shit, uh
Everything I operate go fast
Today, the day go by when I ain't got
If I want it, then that's how it should be
That's what we run this game for
Play thatI put my right hand to God, shine on these broads
Stay on my job, grind with my squad
Hundred racks on my car, no license at all
No tint on that thing, nigga, 'cause that's how we ball
All these fuck niggas flawed, suckas and frauds
My circle so small, stick to my script and just ball
First I pick up my bitch, and we shut down the mall
Had to pick up the tip, she tried to pay for it all
Bring some 'Gnac with my plate, garlic noodles and steak
Bouncin' out the valet, with all these tats' on my face
People looking like, "Hey! Black nigga' stay in your place"
But it's some shit they gon' think, and it's some shit they gon' say
Got to a brick from an eighth, see that music's my fate
Switched it out from out my trunk, went to the top of my state
And I Versace'd my waist, like 2Pac in his hey
Bryan Williams how I built this All Money Estate, whoa!
I put my right hand to God
I put my right hand to God
Put my right hand to Jesus, fly like a eagle
Fight with these demons, shine light on my people
This life is a free throw, success is a kilo
My wife is a C-note, but my mistress is Creole
I sip on that Clicquot, while I'm bangin' that Z-Ro
Ghetto nigga' like Cheeto's, that got more famous than Cee-Lo
Turn legit from illegal, just like Pesci in "Casino"
Get J-S off a P-ro, watch him blow up like C4
I rose from a Regal, Auroras and Lincoln's
Low-pros on Alpina's, to German drop top two-seaters
Was young and prestigious, phone was matchin' my beeper
How the fuck you gon' reach him? He makin' more than his teachers
Movin' forward with speed, all your morals'll leave
Only focus is cheese, now the forest is trees
Got infected with greed, distort what you see
Your worst nightmare than me, is justifyin' your means
Hold up!
I put my right hand to God
I put my right hand to GodAnd I'm actually gonna get right into it
And they really wanna know how?
You know how can I blaze my own path?
Uh, how can I be successful?
Um, how can I follow the path
That someone else has laid for me to be successful?
I'm sittin' on Dueces while the blunt burn
Still rapin' rap music 'cause I want more
All Money In, it's just us four
It's just Cobby, it's just Harvee, it's just Rimpau
It's just Adam, it's just Blac Sam and Bolt Da Fatts
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban links? Nigga, where your Rollies at?
Where your big booty bad bitches, Staple posters at?
Where you hustle? Where you run from the police at?
Where you ever represented hope where the hopeless at?
Where you had to take an oath 'fore you sold a sack?
Dealt with all the pressure, played it like you never noticed that
Amongst it all, put yourself on the map
Turned into a booming operation, where your focus at?
Where your 600 Benz? Where your Rovers at?
Where your Cuban link? Nigga, where your Rollie at?
Uh, I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
So if you can tell us how exactly
And what deal you did to make your first million dollars?
I can tell you niggas how I came up
Similar to climbin' out the grave, huh
Can't be actin' like a bitch tryna get saved, bruh
Get that dirt up off your shoulder, step yo game up
Can't be chasin' pussy, switch your ways up
Can't be fuckin' off your lucci, gotta save up
See you gon' probably fail tryna play us
Streets ain't for everybody, get your grades up
Ain't 'bout your money, you just lookin' for a stage, huh?
And all that stuntin' put a bullet in your brain, huh?
Stupid ass nigga, you can't fade us
Niggas like, "Pfft, who even raised Cuz?"
Where you come from? Where you get your name from?
You was in the house, not with the runaway slaves, huh?
You ain't never in the spot when they raid, huh?
You ain't really 'bout it lil nigga, this a phase, huh?
Uh, I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
I would rather shoot before I run
Pressure on my shoulder weigh a ton
You should try and do what we done
Make a million dollars while you young
Oh, oh, oh
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
This shit ain't easy, believe me
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
This shit ain't easy, believe me
Self made, self made, nigga really self made
And I'll never understand the type of games you niggas play
Westside to the Westside Atlanta until I die 
Fuck with my nigga Nipsey, best believe a nigga gonna ride
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
This shit ain't easy, believe me
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
I know to you it looks easy
Tell me why you mad for, tell me why you mad
This shit ain't easy, believe meI can feel the excitement like I can sense an indictment
Swear I hope that I'm wrong but just in case I'm on my tip
Forever on some fly shit however illogic
Spend a regular nigga monthly income on my outfit
See I was in front of they house with rocks inside of my mouth
When jealous niggas that hate me had they feet up on the couch
And then we made it out
And now we standin' here
Hope niggas don't think this type of shit going to magically appear
And so I got some news for ya
They say life's a bitch and she'll sang the blues to ya
Pay attention to Hussle I got the rules for ya
Made my way through the maze and I left some clues for ya
Now its up to you are you going
Take heed and get paid
And scream all money in until your dying day
Say fuck the middle man get on your grind and save
Or are you more the type that have your mind enslaved
They tellin' me they believe and I got style for days
And when I drop an album they'll be proud to pay
Still out here on this mission and I'm miles away
Somehow I feel like recently I found my way 
And ain't no feelings that can rival those
And you can pop a molly you can sniff a pile of coke
You could make a hundred million fuck a thousand hoes
But when its all over all that counts is how the story's told
So write my name down write my aim down
To do this my way and carve my own lane out
Shit changed they say I don't act the same now
But it was either that or blow my fucking brains out
Niggas dissin' me got me tempted to change routes
Pressure building up gotta let this pain out
Gotta think smart gotta map my plays out
Before I kill these niggas broad day and yell my gang out 
And I stay in this game and get my change out
Figured how to deal with it and see what fame's 'bout
I got the secret to success do your thang now
Or you can keep watching cable on the same couch
Whatever niggas reap they sowing
Me I'll be out in Vegas smokin'
Stupid view city lights glowing
Wine tasting, filet mignon, and knows who grows it
So many people call only a few chosen
And that's why I go hard cause I do notice
She tells me that I am wrong for not using emotion
Too busy to love a broad and I can't lose focus
But maybe in a different life
Maybe when we make it well meet at the finish line
Maybe this is fate maybe god will send a sign
But more than likely he'll say nigga grind
Yeah, so here I go on my second wind
I'm checking shit off my bucket list and it's getting thin
Run out of shit to buy in places you ain't never been
And what you'll value most is a honest friend
Calls from the bank there's more deposits in
Seven days a week I be at my offices
Keys to the city nigga I'm the hottest even if the OG's don't acknowledge it
Gone...Real big, real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Nighttime, locs on
Can't even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?
Tryna walk to school get yo' jaw socked
Tryna pump your gas get yo' car shot
Large profit margin on the long shots
Cause young niggas rarely make it off of our block
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
High school, didn't go
Couldn't understand my plan now you niggas know
Self made, well paid
I'm from where they tell you never touch the shell case
I'm from where they teach you never trust a pale face
Let's talk bangin', I can tell you 'bout a field race
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Night time, locs on
Fuckin' young bitches while they folks home
Real big, real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Nighttime, locs on
Can't even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?
Sold out shows, that's a door split
Niggas ain't show up, that's a forfeit
Left my record label, just got more rich
I switched it up, that's me singin' on the chorus
But still I spit bars so gutter
Drive cars, no stutter, top floor, no clutter
Hardwood floors though
White wall, that's where my awards go
Runnin' from the law 'til they foreclose
Sit with myself when them doors close
Sometimes I got a question, only Lord knows
What I'm doing out in Copenhagen spendin' euros?
Nighttime, locs on
Do it big nigga 'til my locs home
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Real big, real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Nighttime, locs on
Can't even see the stars but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?
If I could stay in this moment, I would, forever
If I could live in this moment, said I would, forever
Real shit, real shit 
If I could give you the stars baby, I would
Wanna last and share in this moment baby
And I would give you the stars baby, I would
Real big, real big
I knew one day I would do it real big
Real shit, real shit
I know all my real niggas feel this
Nighttime, locs on
Can't even see the stars, but we still wish
Real shit, real shit
Who would ever thought that we would build this?What up
What it do 
I'd like to welcome everybody out tonight
Welcome all the new Marathon members
To the experience of a lifetime
I need y'all hands up though
Yeah, look
No I don't want your love
It’s not why I make music
I owe myself, I told myself back then that I would do this
And I always look so out of reach
And just seem so confusing
That I felt my place in life
A young black man it seems so useless
But I don’t want no help
Just let me suffer through this
The world would not know Jesus Christ if there was never Judas
This knife that's in my back
Will be the truth that introduced us
And the distance in between us
Is the proof of my conclusion
So life is what you make it
I hope you make a movement
Hope your opportunity survives the opportunists
Hoping as you walk across the sands you see my shoeprint
And you follow, til it change your life, cuz it's all evolution
And I hope you find your passion, cause I found mine in this music
But I hope it’s not material cause that’s all an illusion
And they all in collusion
This racist institution's double standard
Acting like they not the reason why we ruthless
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
It's a victory
Let's make history
Look at where I started and look at where I’m standing
Y’all can say its luck
But I know that it's planning
Shout out to the pain
That gave me understanding
Shout out to my gang
It turned me to a savage
So niggas say what they want to
But I go through what you haven’t
And it’s not ego driven, it’s not me boasting and bragging
This road I chose to go down
Hard to slow down when in traffic
In order for me to grow I had to let go of some habits
And it's easy to say I’m on now cause you see it, and it happened
But before it ever did had to believe and get it cracking
So I’m gon take you back then, 32 shots in my mack 10
With a dream minus the means my early teens was fucking tragic
And deep inside my mind is buried crimes you can’t imagine
That I wrestle with at night demons that I fight I can’t get past it
So no matter how straight your cash get
It don’t matter if you plastic
We was looking for the lights and all we stumbled across was flashes
But tonight…
Bigger than average life
I’m brighter than Vegas lights
Feeling like I can’t lose
Any other day I do
Feels like I'm ?
It feels like I’m 8 feet tall
Tonight is my night
For sure, for sure
So if it’s meant, then it’s gon be
People love it, cause they know that this the real me
The cops hate it, so they hope my homies kill me
But I ain't want the fame, I just wanted y’all to feel me
It’s my time, so I’m going in
We ball till we fall, fuck how the story ends
I see these niggas hatin’
I know you hoes plotting
I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Got me, got me
Say I know God got me
Got me, got me
Yeah I know God got me
Got me, got me
Yeah I know God got me
See I ain't worried bout it
Cause I know God got me
Once in a lifetime shit you know
This song dedicated to everybody out there with a muthafucking dream
Fuck what they say, do your shit
Tonight is my night
This is my moment
Feeling bigger than life
But I gotta own it
Its a victory
Lets make history
The marathon nigga
This shit ain't gone stop until I say its gone' stop
It ain't gone' stop until you say its gone' stop
And it ain't gone be unless you make it
It's yo time get up off yo ass
Ten toes down out here you know?
I swear to God I shed tears in this muthafuckin booth nigga
For my niggas that's gone
My niggas that can't be here with me
For the ones that is
Shout out my beautiful lil girl Imani
Shout out my big bro Black Sam
Shout my nigga Fats
Shout out my bro Adam
Shout out my AMB's
You know what this is, it's the muthafuckin marathon
This shit ain't gone stop man
One hunnidPicture me rollin', tippin' my chaueffer
Niggas look jealous, you gotta control it
Reachin' my quota, mixin' my soda
Feeling connected to God, tryna' get closer
Steppin' on roaches, me and my locsters
Just tryna get over, tryna not get swallowed by locusts
Tryna' to stay focus, kinda like Moses
Like somebody chose us, this weight on my shoulder
I feel these emotions, but still I keep going
A pen to a poet
I been through the motions
I’m feeling heroic but life is a dice game
And they dare you to blow it
You might get a stripe man, but that ain't gon' pay for the strollers
It's never enough to console her
Telling, your daddy’s a soldier
She needs you right now in this moment
Not dead on your back pushing roses
To me I'm just carving this sculpture
You fine tune with my  approaches
Doubling back as a owner
The moment of truth Is upon us
Call the promoters
Picture me rollin' rollin' rollin'
Me and my friends not worried
Then we get stopped by the police
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause these days niggas goin' crazy
Gotta make it home to my baby
Cause this is they say me
Gotta make it home to my baby, Holla up, yeah
Look I bet I'ma make it home to my baby 
I bet I'ma make it home to my baby
I say, I bet I'ma make it home to you, babyLook, I'm from Westside California, they run up on ya
Ask you where you from and check yo' tats under yo' clothin'
Hustla, go hard make sure my knot swollen
Fuck it, say the wrong hood, bullets explodin'
I trust few people these days 'cause that's golden
I seen niggas get killed for who they roll with
And chose to keep inside they circle
Satan sittin' on your sofa
Same nigga that shot you was the one you used to smoke with
Cold shit, my whole clique notorious
You've heard of us, six Os is murderers
You still servin' clucks, jealous nigga, you broke as fuck
Yo bitch on my nuts, spillin' Patrón out my cup
She can't get enough, buffer me down as I puff on the finest kush
They say I be doin' too much, I just do my stuff
Yeah, I just do my stuff
Hussle, Hussle
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
I got Slauson on my back, Ed Hardy on my hip
Weight of the world on my shoulders, gold rollie on my wrist
Neighborhood chucks, blue checkerboard tint
Dickies saggin' off my ass, walk with a hoodsta limp
Two bricks on my white tee, same color cocaine
I ain't talkin' dope, I mean the price of my gold chain
All money in, no money out, that was my slogan
What I mean by that is stack it up and don't spend no change
I started small time, dope game, cocaine
Seven grams was thirty rocks, that was my program
The block propane, young nigga, no change
Shoot-out with no aim, so they know yo name
'Cause where yo mama paid rent, that was yo gang
So when yo homeboy bled, that was yo pain
And if y'all both catch a case, you don't say no names
That's just the code of the color of my shoe strings
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Been so many places, seen so many things
Niggas stood against tryna chase that cream
This ain't livin'
This ain't livin, no
You thinkin' you gettin' paid, hustlin' everyday
My homies passin' away, no
This ain't livin' 
This ain't livin, no
Look
What happened to the code? Streets all in shambles
Niggas powderin' they nose, put the shame to what we stand for
They think we on some kill another nigga shit
We really on some stay down and diligent
The streets is cold, turn innocence to militants
Young niggas gangbangin' for the thrill of it
Pops was gone, moms was never home
But the streets was right there so they took you as they own
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitch
Blue Laces, shell cases, we catch bodies, we don't leave no traces
Big faces, suitcases, if you ain't know, hoe, we gettin' paid, bitchNow, I don't ever wanna hear you niggas say you doubtin' shit again
Look, look
Fake niggas, don't show me love
And all you fake bitches, I don't want yo hugs
I got this pistol and a gang of hundreds
In this drop Mercedes-Benz, gettin' dumb blunted
Don't be surprised if you don't get what you never wanted
I'm on my fifth fly whip while you ain't never stunted
Never going broke, funny 'cause I never budget
Lotta niggas 'round now that I ain't never fucked with
That's why I'm in and out of town, out in other countries
It's like the less I come around, the more I get money
And I been catching wind lately that the feds want me
But I'm gon' keep getting rich, so it's gon' get ugly
Told my mama I'ma gang bang graduate
Pioneered the transition from this Crippin' wasn't easy nigga, but I mastered it
That's why I still deliver raps so passionate
Built my own lane, ain't no nigga ever hand me shit
Slauson Avenue, do you understand the averages?
The fact I'm still standing speaks volumes to my savages
We lust lavishness and aim for extravagance
Even if it's only temporary
'Least we had the shit
I press the gas 'til one-60 on the dash is hit
My bitch lit the blunt and passed the shit
Look, iPhone 4's and life on tour
Get five racks every night, what's the price on yours?
I'm down to splurge on my bitch, 'cause I don't wife no whores
Get the whole fall collection if she like that store
Baby, rhyme crazy, that's just how this life made me
Trust funds for Emani, in case this life take me
I live it to the fullest, never let this life break me
Thus far it's been a cold demonstration
Number one question now is, "Did the fame the change me?"
Fuckin' right young nigga, should I be still gang bangin'?
Wait, hold up, hold that thought, take these shots
And tell my niggas S.I.P. The Marathon don't stop
Before I sell my soul, I give my life
It's been a minute but we gon' get right, watch..
I'm out here on a mission and I'm all alone
I'm far from where I'm going and I'm far from home
Somehow I know I'm moving in the right direction
Mama always told me I was gon' be specialIf you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
We still up all night
And I breathe your air
Runnin' this marathon
You only can...
Look, now, I can't promise commitment, but I swear we'll have fun
If you, ask I'll be honest, girl, you not the only one
Just a man on a mission, with my hand on my gun
Couple niggas that hate me, but way more people show love
Niggas tryin' too hard, they dyin' to ball
Then turn around and hate on me like it's a crime to evolve
Too afraid to be different, too ashamed to just listen
See I'm way too 100, so now they hate on my niggas
Tried to hate on my Crippin', tried to hate on my business
Not to call you a bitch, but they gon' hate on my bitches
So if you fucking with Nip, let you know my intentions
Got to think like a rider, you gotta know your position
So if it's cool, then we can hop in my Mercedes coupe
Pop the cork off this imperial Veuv'
Crank the music, blowin' circles out the roof
And just enjoy the view
She said
If you were mine
I said
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
Let me hit somethin' wit' you, lil mama
Matter of fact
You only can...
Ay, I'm not trippin', back and forth with your nigga
Scared to lose what you got as you lookin' for something different
Me? "Fly Crippin'," international trippin'
I got my numbers up and now they pay for my statistics
Yeah, young nigga, started off with a vision
Built this shit up from nothing, to the critics I ain't listen
Now, transition, so check out how I'm livin'
We V12 pushers and they transmissions is slippin'
Nigga, get yo' bitch, 'cause I be bitch-gettin'
Treat her like she wanna be treated, but I ain't trickin'
Beat it like she want her shit beated, but I don't kiss it
Just blame it on that shit that we smokin', plus we sippin'
Look, double cups, she tryna double up
'Cause I just hit it once, but she caught a double nut
Nasty, since she use to double dutch
Too quick to fall in love, what the fuck?
She said
If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your air
You only can...
Look, now, if I was yours, and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side?
So, keep yo' nigga, while I stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon' spend some time
Look, if I was yours, and you was mine
Would you do me like you do him and have someone on the side?
So, keep your nigga and I'll stay on my grind
Just hit me up and we gon' spend some time
Right?
If you were mine
If you were mine
The way that I move
And I breathe your airI don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga
Playin' Pac in my cassette loud, nigga
I remember feelin' like a stepchild, nigga
I would hate to see my momma stressed out, nigga
Black Sam would tell me, "poke your chest out, nigga"
I could die today I've made the set proud, nigga
And I could fly away, but I respect vows, nigga
Used to always say I'd make the whole world feel this
Now I'm on the tour around the whole world, nigga
Paparazzi waitin' at my hotel, nigga
Smokin' while I'm drivin' that's with no L's, nigga
20 bands a month just for your bills, nigga
Princess cut diamonds up in your grill, nigga
Now smile in every camera and show you're a trill nigga
You feed 'em what you want cause that's your kill, nigga
And through the darkest days I was like, "oh well, nigga"
Westside neighborhood against the whole world, nigga
I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga
I never fold under mental pressure
I get better, ain't no code to y'all misconception
I'm just special, this an ode to my innersection
And God bless and save my soul from this imperfection
I can't measure with a number, all these niggas restin'
But it's a lot when you that young to witness life and death
You shellshocked, but ain't no tears involved
Accept it all, that's how the world revolve
Every 12 months you live another year you ball
Hindsight, it's 20-20 that was really God
Cause lookin' back it' ain't no reason why we ain't get caught
Mission after mission, we was trippin'
Me and Baby Bolt Da Fatts in Lil Killa Dave's kitchen
Police in the front, pistols in the court
When it hit the fan you get to find out who you are
Nervous as a bitch, was sweat drippin' down my palms
And think through it, thug, you got to stay calm
I don't stress out, nigga
Poke my chest out, nigga
Weight on my shoulder, bring the best out, nigga
Get it right or you get left out, nigga
Playin' BIG in my cassette loud, nigga
I remember feelin' like the best out, nigga
They ain't feel me then, but I'm a threat now, nigga
I'm the one that represent the West now, nigga
Almost didn't make it cause the set foul, nigga
Shit'll chip you quicker than the West now, nigga
Lock you up in cages, how it went down, nigga
Ship you out of town, you need to pen pal, nigga
Plenty times I've felt like this the end now, nigga
But I catch my 2nd wind around the 10th round, nigga
Only God knows to where it went down, nigga
But if you see us up that's cause we been down, nigga
Stand up, we don't never sit down, nigga
Man up, go and get a Benz now, nigga
Damn cuhz, look at how my campaign killin'
Panoramic views, chillin' under 12-foot ceilings
I don't stress out, nigga
I don't stress out, niggaFresh out the club, on my way back to the mansion
You know where I’m from, you don’t ever gotta ask us
Banged out, still, these hoes think I'm handsome
And yes I run my city, run my city single handed
If they’d made a movie about my life it would be a classic
Drove a bucket and we used to share a mattress
Looking at me now you can see the contrast
When I’m chilling with a model from Toronto in the Hamptons
So what do you need, cause you can have it
Long as you willing to bleed for what you’re asking
And when you see it you seize it with a passion
Cause we don’t believe in second chances
The way you fill up them jeans make me imagine
But I don’t live in a dream, I make it happen
Don’t mean to get in between you and your standards
But since every night is a scene, I’m yellin’ action
I’ve got the meat and the cheese, let’s make a sandwich
Just grab which ever of your home girls is the baddest
Hopefully she got a swag that could match this
But she could be whatever she want, except average
And dressed in something I can mess with
Spend a lil’ something on you bag is expected
Louis Vuitton and Valentino collections
All you Ugg-boot bitches I don’t mess with
I’m international, them niggas are domestic
Fuckin' with a baller and usually bringin' out the best in
And when it’s over you can count me as your blessing
Cause every single loss in your life is a lesson
I’m on, and I know I am
And I ain’t in nobody rush cause I know my plan
Money first, women second, and you hoes is last
Cause I don’t wanna fuck if I know I can
And yeah, you got a butt, but your soul is whack
You like a coke bottle but the soda’s flat
Your style like the plastic on the sofa set
And run and tell your homegirls I told ya that
Look, damn, flow kinda tough
And I don’t hate y’all I just only love us
The title that I hold is what every one wants
But still I play the game like I never one once
It's eleven, you know, one one
And every generation had to do what I’ve done
To the people I’m a hero unsung
Good thing I don’t want fame, I want funds
But if they say my name the bell rung
I’ve been through so much pain, I feel numb
The Marathon, my nigga, I’m on one
For as long as the Lord pump air through these lungs
And I ain’t perfect, Lord knows I murked shit
Until the day that he gave me something to work with
Open my eyes, he show me it wasn’t worth it
Told me if I lowered my pride, I’d find purpose
And it was hard to see the set was a serpent
Going too fast to turn, inertia
Gotta apply the lesson that you learn
You should come fuck with a star, get off earth dick
Got money, but you still feel worthless
Fuck like a porn star, pussy like a virgin
And in return, he keep you in fly purses
But when he gone you calling my line urgent
Cry me a river, I’ve never be the buyer of them lies you deliver
The real is me is mesmerized into women
Most of the times she never been with this fly of a nigga
And I am the realization, of the dream of this motherfucking nation!
Come on, for pussy and power you be patient
Come up first, that’s the order of operations
Broke nigga hope you hear what I’m saying
Either that or you should pop Scarface in
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing
You got a cell waiting on you in the state pen
Hope you hear what I’m saying
Either that or you should pop Scarface in
Learn the rules to the game that ya playing
Cause they got a cell waiting on you in the state pen
Yeah, uh, TMCUh, rollin' up some good, pourin' up 'til we get faded
You know how we do it, everybody takin' flicks of me
I got the keys to the city, I don't need no limousine
I turn out when I pull up and tell my bookin' agent book a show
Runnin' 'round with the paper bag
Runnin' 'round with the paper bag
Goin' crazy spendin' all this cash
Goin' crazy spendin' all this cash
If I spend it I'ma get it back, even when I'm ridin' round dirty
A nigga don't need a seatbelt, a nigga don't need a seatbelt
Nah, it don't cost to keep it real, run up, get done up
Shit can get real, fuck around and get your ass robbed
Nigga fuck around and take your shit, got you askin' God "Why?"
Drag your ass into a alley, pull out, aim for the target
Should've never been around the killers
In my town, we the fuckin' realest
No Cheddar Bobs 'round here
I get to sprayin', they gon' get down
Ski mask over my face, catch a body in broad day
Catch a body in broad day
I got the key to the city, I got a hoe that's saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili, tattoo my name in graffiti
Wack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of y'all niggas can see me
None of y'all niggas can see me
Ya'll ain't got nothin' like this over there
Bunch of front line millionaires
Bunch of self made, out the trunk paid
Against the odds, really took it there
Any prob I'ma reappear, with a squad you already fear
All this time I've been playin' fair, seven digits every single year
Niggas died, niggas disappear, alibis, I was really there
Life of crime 'til I get the chair, Columbine in my trigger hair
Still I rise and I took the stairs
Feel the fire, it's a different glare
All these fights, it was never fair
Bustin' knuckles still I'm swingin' fierce
Taste the salt inside my drippin' tears
You should know I never had a fear
You should know I never had a shot
Never had a chance, still I took it here
Manage pride but I see it clear, strategize, I'm a engineer
Pick a side, gotta keep it there, switchin' up nigga, lookin' weird
I got the key to the city, I got a hoe that's saddity
Talk to that bitch in Swahili, tattoo my name in graffiti
Wack out your hood in graffiti
Come through your hood on the weekly
None of y'all niggas can see me
None of y'all niggas can see me
Tappin in', said they'd waitin' for it
Tell the streets a nigga back again
Ridin' round inside the back again
Rollin' flights inside the back again
405, another traffic jam
Improvised another master plan
Sit outside a nigga family pad
Another seven grams inside a sandwich bag
My whole life is like a balance act
People's champ but could you handle that?
I pull up inside the black on black
And park this big ass Benz inside the handicap
What I done, they can't imagine that
One of one, it's like a magic trick
Matter fact, it's like a lotto pick
That's why I gotta talk a lot of shitI can feel the vibe, Hussle on the rise
This lil' light of mine, I'm gon' let it shine
All she want is time, all she want is time
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Lock the city down til' the summertime
Time to slice these niggas up some humble pie
Caravan of foreigns, let my youngin drive
Elevate my game for the hundredth time
You could hold me down through these troubled times
Or be another victim to my stubborn pride
Hold me down through these troubled times
Be another victim to my stubborn pride
I'm stuck in the grind
Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Middle of the night kitchen lights is on
Roll me up a Bacc then I light the stove
Taught her stay calm when the crisis on
Say I die alone, I say my life a poem
Hyde Park Hussle speakin' hyperbole
Translation, get the money never wife a hoe
Clip is full already now it's time to go
Shoulder full already where these stripes should go
Crash got opinions how my life should go
I'm screaming, "Fuck em'," they could suck a dick and die tonight you know
Bullets, rain on em', cut the life support
My section ride for sport every night of course
Niggas dyin' every day, that's the price of war
Gang members spendin' thousands at the nicest stores
Levitate on five-star luxury, every time I ride shit come for me
I'm stuck in the grind
Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Make a movie, take the top off
'Bout to cross over like Hot Sauce
On this gutter shit, I never hopped off, most calculated move by far
Always with a model and a fly car
Thirty-thousand for the python, rockin' knee-high, drinkin' white wine
Listening to In My Lifetime in the night time
Lookin' at the city skyline, gettin' sky high
Took the lil' bitch to Popeye, she was top 5
Excitement that she get from pop life could never top mine
Once you get the hustle locked down, you can stockpile
Level up another notch now, like it's stock now
Every time I take the top down she arch her eyebrows
Turnin' up the music high now, she feel alive now
Love me like we from a small town, let's make a mall round
You splurge, I splurge
We ball later and we ball now
I'm stuck in the grind
Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Ain't no goin' back once them lights on you
Left the dorm in the middle of the night, homie
Affidavits goin' viral, that's your life, homie
Ain't no point even tryna lie, homie
This go out to all the S.N.Y. homies
This is death before dishonor, you should die. homie
Fuck you niggas, you disrespected the tribe, homie
Wounded pride, it's written all in your eyes, homie
I'm stuck in the grind
Stuck in the grind, I'm stuck in the grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
I'm stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind

Like the type of raps make you wanna stack
Make a nigga want a Benz, make 100 racks
I heard yo tape, where you done it at?
Where you ever grind? Where you stunted at?
You wasn't full time, you was comin' back
You was like, "I’m finna roll," it was finna crack
'Cause you ain’t want none of that
Look, give me love, give me cash, give me respect
Anything, other than, I’ma reject
Give me time, give me space, give me a sec
On the real, what you gone get is the best

God damn455, I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted 'cause I do what I need
And that’s the reason that they love me
'Cause I’ve been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top, I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Listen, black on black Mercedes-Benz
Tattoo all my lady friends
Nipsey on they titties
More game than ESPN
I turn these hoes to lesbians, make her fuck her best of friends
Get head for one hour, smoke a blunt and catch my second wind
Hopping off that tour bus, she probably just had sex with him
She’s out of your possession, you cannot protect her then
South Central that's my residence
Deadly like them seven sins
And if I’m not the king of this
I must be the president
OMG, I’m ill as shit, money is my medicine
Shout out to my niggas in the pen text messaging
Shout out to them bitches getting it in in their crevices
Conjugal visits make sex seem so irrelevant
Forget about the risk we took, I never can
Rebel in this white man world until they bury him
Being broke is so un-American
That’s why I’m screaming all money in, 'til the end
Nigga
455, I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted 'cause I do what I need
And that’s the reason that they love me
'Cause I’ve been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top, I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Pull up in that old school, me and lil' Shady Blue
Fresh up out the county jail, they held us both without no bail
10 stacks to my lawyer, said a prayer that we prevailed
Jealous niggas hated that, love to see a nigga fail
Miss me with that, "Bro I love you"
Sucka nigga be for real
Fake as four dollar bills
Hit the gas, we’re out of here
On our way to Fox Hills, spending like we got a mil'
Smoking so much kush it got us feeling like we’re off a pill
They know we got dollars still
And bitches know they got the bill
Eatin' Benihana daily, drive my baby mama crazy
Name a nigga that could fade me
Pussy that does not persuade me
Got a swag that make 'em hate me
Plus we never shop at Macy’s
Louis V and Gucci, maybe
Neiman Marcus, blue Mercedes
We was both familiar faces
Spending thousands, dodging cases
"Fuck a bottle, bring the cases", is what we told the waitress
Then pop Clicquot for all of y'all that tried to play us
455, I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted 'cause I do what I need
And that’s the reason that they love me
'Cause I’ve been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top, I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shot
Hussle, hussle, Dre past, Def Jam, Capital Atlantic too
Thought that I’ll be dead or doing life, 'cause what I rap is true
Just another you know who
Sam had some time to do
And yea, Steve is cool, but I heard Big U's an animal
Fuck what they was talking about
We just did what we had to do
Became the most valuable, after I dropped Volume 2
From the West Coast at least, now for the West Coast I speak
'Cause on a level four with Gilbon is where I’m 'posed to be
I be on some business shit
Y'all bring out the loc in me
Like a broke weed head, my pistol will smoke for free
Emani ain’t gonna know the streets
Got to keep her close to me
Put that on the man that’s on the cross on my rosary
Wasn’t always banging but I speak about it openly
No shame in my game
I did my thing, on the coldest streets
Who’s the hottest on the West
All you niggas know it’s me
So tell whoever got it lock that Nipsey Hussle stole the key
455, I drive by doing a hundred
And I stay blunted 'cause I do what I need
And that’s the reason that they love me
'Cause I’ve been making money
I got the key to the city
It feels good to be on top, I got the key to the city
This is how it is to be a big shotYeah
I got it
Look
You like the way I play the cards that I'm dealt, huh
You like how I came up and stayed myself, huh
All that shit I said on my tapes niggas felt, huh
Got it, can't lose it gotta turn it into wealth, huh
Like how I go hard and never fell, huh
Like I how stayed down and lift the world up
I sold out judging by the sales, huh
I'm a heavyweight judging by the scales, huh
My name ring bells plus it sell tickets
As I push past these thousands to these mil tickets
Hatin' niggas get some bread you gon' feel different
And you can feel Nip from looking at the world different
All black kids all trapped in
All waitin' on a day that we can back in
The all black Benz with the black tint
Cause now you worth something, nigga that's what that meant
Gold rollies, gold cubans
Made what you make off going gold way before music
Keep them squares out my circle, nigga no Rubik's
Cause niggas learn you just to hurt you I'm like no Judas
Summertime, top off
Fake ass Louis, knockoff
Young nigga, lost cause
And till I pray to God that we all ball\
Dear Lord, please Bless us
Bless us with discretion not to blow this dough
Bless us with the strength not to fuck with hoes
Bless us with the gift of real loyalty
You know the type, he facin' life you pay the lawyer fee
Bless us with abundance let us ball hard
Protect us when they threaten us with a false charge
Bless us lord cause niggas with the extras Lord
Help me let the weight of what I made steer my direction more
All black leather, new coupe
Night vision in the dash make the moon blue
Nudie jeans on so my denim fresh
Making death threats but they ain't did it yet
Need to get some cash, fuck it get a check
But look, hop the fuck off this young nigga dick
I'm ballin', yo bitch callin'
My shit poppin' and yo shit keep floppin', look
Came in this game all the killas with me
Travel around the world I brought my niggas with me
Play the game right I build the foundation
Stay solid while these hatin' niggas stay hatin'
Summertime, top off
Try not to get your head knocked off
Young nigga, lost cause
Until I prayed to God that we all ballMost the time, when it rain it start pouring'
But how we grind, it make the weather change for us
We roll through, but we never change for 'em
So smile for us, when you see us, drive foreigns
Nigga watch us ball
Stop or stall, nigga not at all
I'm poppin' broads with Tiny Hog at the shoppin' mall
All money in the squad, boy I'm not involved
Can't pay the cost to floss? I can spot your flaws
SLs with the toppin' off
Dress well when it's time to ball
Couple hundred for my boxer drawers
Young nigga used to shop at Ross
First to shoot when it's poppin' off
Couple times, a nigga almost got popped by Ross
Crash unit, buzz cut ex-marines
Crenshaw, Slauson Ave 17
Infant Stone, Lil' Shady, Baby Bolt Da Fatts laid a demonstration
85 Cutlass with the 380s
Summertime functions, L.A. streets' crazy
Shoot it out that's what this crew about
Hangin' out the Cutlass window with the Rugar out
Prove yo'self, killers in pursuit of clout
It felt wrong, but who is you to doubt
Look, my master plan was buy a pound and then move it south
And hopefully one day I'll put this music out
Trippin' now, seeing that it's movin' out
I'm buying spots, nigga movin' out
My fan base, I see 'em movin' south
I'm overseas eating fuckin' croûte
Yeah… so I can tell you what this hustling 'bout
I couldn't tell you what no luck about
I had maps on my wall, nigga
Dope sacks in my drawers, nigga
Look, a lot of stress I couldn't rest not at all
Nigga risking everything trynna ball
Gotta let it breathe
And put the weed out
Double M
Niggas get it and they fall off
It's cause they all soft
Nigga like me started at the car wash
8am to 10pm, that's on the rainy day
Wise words from dope boys meant everything
They say it's levels to the street life
Then I seen a bezel with the pink ice
All natural, momma tell you to be careful
In the trap trappin' to increase capital
No longer cruising with the windows down
Hand on the pistol anticipating the riddle sound
I'm Kanye when it came to 'ye
I'm Jay-Z when it came to keys
I'm Snoop when it came to weed
So now they wanna Biggie me
As the credit rolls, now the charge is federal
Money bags, I'm placed upon a pedestal
Still on the block in my Reeboks
You ain't really know these was the Basquiat's
You ain't really know who really call shots
Worldwide mastermind, number one all charts
Reporting live from the land of the hopeless
Representing for the team that won rings with no coaches
We stay strapped and we cockin' so don't approach us
Price Johnson with a big gold chain and Louis Loafers
Been hiding guns in the sofa since toy soldiers
Thunder-domes up in Hyde Park, didn't nobody know us
We took all fades, our introduction was from the shoulders
We was kids, honestly we just needed someone to hold us
Grindin' hard on them corners with cane boulders
Fascinated by the green, all we wanted was Range Rovers
On the block politicking with brain blowers
Real niggas that got love in their hearts but can't show it
We live and die for the fame and the lights glowing
Fox Hills buying Jordans, but still the pain showing
When I die, put me next to the dead poets
Tell 'em God had a plan for me and I didn't know it
VictoryLook, I'm comin straight off of Slauson
A crazy motherfucker named Nipsey
I'm turnt up cause I grew up in the 60s
Caution to you rap niggas try and diss me
I go hard that's why yo' bitch wanna flip me
Big guns nigga, turn rivals into rosaries
Extended clips I give a fuck who you 'posed to be
Straight off the block I sold dope to buy groceries
Now it's rap money no advance it's all royalties
You broke nigga you could follow me
It's fuck bitches get money keep some hollow heads logically
And I'm from where homicide boost the economy
Pay taxes to these corners and put in work it's a policy
 It's white chalk on the corners
It's yellow tape on the gate, choppers up above
That's Cuz and Tiny Loc's runs the streets where I'm from
This is just a small introduction to this Nipsey Hussle music
Guns money and bitches that's the way that we do it
First get 'yo grind on, then get yo' shine on
We come through daytime with the lights on
Now hit the fast lane, and let yo' chain swang
You gettin dollars like a doctor but you gangbang
Yeah! It's Hussle in the house
Yeah! It's Hussle in the house
Blue rag, S-hat, gold on my neck fat
Guns case catch that, this neighborhood, I rep that
Shoot first, ask last, move work, fast cash
Brynhurst, 10th ave, squabble if you get mad
And in my lifetime, I seen a lot of death
A couple cold nights, it look like it was nothin left
But God got me, so I got him tatted on my flesh
Slauson - nigga, you ain't heard shit yet
Cuzzy, Cobby, Hoodsta Rob, Tiny Draws
Infant Stone, when he come home - then baby, we dog

I'm godly, I'm gutter, I'm genius
I'm prolly of cheese grits at Four Seasons
Fresh squeezed, no stressants, no reason
Toast champagne to achievements
I think we should dive off the deep end
Take you on vacation every weekend
Look, I be up at six, nigga, sleep in
I be at the Ritz puffin' G Pens
Them other niggas soft, I'm the cement
Fourteen, Bonnie and Clyde, we can be them
These rich nigga rules I believe in

Catch a flight, do my shit, hit a lick and go
Oh, now I got a different goal
'Cause I reached all my old ones
I be feelin' like somebody reached out and chose us
I be killin' life, nigga, we got it rollin'
We pop and pour shit
Standin' on them couches with my whole clique
Our jewelry on some 1994 shit
Champagne flutes, watch em go 'click'
Afterwards, baby fucked the whole clique
West Coast shit
Own the masters to these classics, Death Row shit
So when that check come, I get mo chips
All money in, I went and got my own shit, nigga
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
Life, and it's like, you know, you can look a gift horse in the face and not know what you lookin' at
And I feel like, you know, I'm lookin' at the gift horse
I'm just one of the ones that notice what I'm lookin' at
You know what I mean? It's actually an incredible time
It's like a gold rush, it's never been a time like this in our generation
It's our equivalent of the Gold Rush with everybody movin' to California
This technology has empowered everybody
And it's giving people, you know, it's as big as you wanna make it and, you know, it's as far as you take it
And we can quote a gang of things going on in the world right now
Or just, you know, accept it as being true
But, you know, it's like, man, giants gon' crumble
Big-big companies gon' crumble
New companies gon' pop up outta nowhere and it's-it's gon' be dramatic
And I believe that
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was different
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew
That's how I knew, that's how I knew that I was differentLook at my car

Look at my wrist, look at my waist
Niggas is fake, number one reason we'll never relate
Me, I get cake and I don't speak for them niggas that can't
Hussle the great, setting up shop or runnin' in banks
Fuck did you think? I would slow that? Fuck is you sayin'
Niggas was playin', me I just went from a bucket to Benz
Up in the pen where they predicted I'll be up in ten
Humble begins, but now I stunt sound hard it don't make no sense
Fly to Japan, they pay me in cash, convert it to yen
Bitch, I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man, bitch I'm the man
Go get yo' friend, I fucked you already can't fuck you again
Bitch, I'm the man, bitch, I'm the man, I'll say it again
Pay me in cash, fly to Japan and convert it to yen
BBC stores, we shut them down, it's just how we is
That's just how we live
Give wifey the twenties and fifties we spend
The hundreds we stack, then re-up the sack and go in again
Aye, look at my car
Look at my girl look like a star
Look at my life
Came up, nigga we came so far
You see us

Look at my plate
Look at my state now look at my plates
Everything custom sittin' on chrome, yeah that's my fate
Look at my pace, marathon life now look at my race
Look at where I started
Look at my state, got 'em lookin' my way
What could you say?
If it ain't salute, I got it lookin' like hate
Lookin' like why? Some things in life you just can't debate
You just can't relate, never drove cars from state to state
With a truck full of pounds and a 38
In a "I gotta get it type urgency," nah
Top third degree, ten toes in it like a pair of sneaks
Turf trick, he need a pair of cleats
Still I stayed down and emerged a beast
Out of town, I done worked for a week
Let a young nigga splurge in peace
We fuckin' up Lenox just me and my niggas
We ballin' like Nino and G
Was driving my Regal in heat
Caprone had kilos for cheap
Was rollin', but niggas was deep
The block was conjunct to my legal release
Was rappin' and now it's so sweet
They actually bow to my feet
The women around me is freaks
The money is long, my power is deep
Look at my car
Look at my girl look like a star
Look at my life
Came up, nigga we came so far
You see us
Aye, you see us, nigga
Aye
Look at my car

Came up, nigga we came so far
You see us
Aye, you see us, nigga
AyeThat's right...
Yeah, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Black eyed the game and got passed on
Me, I kept this shit super solid
Came up, and nigga you acknowledge
See me in my coupe, I got stupid dollars
I'm a dropout but now I speak at colleges
Ironic, I'm honest
I get paid to speak my mind, and it's crazy to me
Just pay me, fooly; if I wrote a script, it'd be a crazy movie
About my life, about rolling dice
About taking risks, you gotta know the price
Gotta know yourself, on the coldest nights
Can't turn it down, you gotta own the fight
Win, lose, or draw, you could ball
You could've kept it real, but nigga, you's a fraud
Before you get the shit, you gotta lose it all
And then you find yourself and see that you's a God
And that's real shit, thousand hundred dollar bill shit
From hood to the hills shit, like, "How the fuck did we build this?"
Real shit, look
Blue cup, black gun
Paid dues, that's done
Favors from me, can't ask none
Came in the game then I passed up
And I can't stop, won't stop
I'm the type to get more guap
You the type to fa sho flop
I'm from Brynhurst and them dope spots
Now look
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes 
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while
Aye, check it out, look
I'm still runnin' laps, takin' fades, I still run it back
Talkin' guns, I got a hundred straps
And I be in your bush if you fuck wit' Fats, that's a fact
I don't fuck wit' rats
This boss life, I got a lust for that
Pullin' up at Sak's, blow a hundred sacks in my V12
I don't fuckin' slack, not at all
I gotta ball, they shot my dog
Rest in peace, my nigga, Frog
Life is short, nigga, then it's gone
But in the meantime we tryna get it all
You should get involved, I'm really raw
Before this rap shit, I really balled
Alpina's, nigga, on white Lincoln's, nigga
Black Beamers, nigga, they can't see us, nigga, naw
Sometimes I get so offended by it
Don't compare me to none of these fuckin' liars
I'm fuckin' flyer, I'm fuckin' realer
Play wit' me, I'll be a fuckin' killer
Dropped seven tapes wit' no fuckin' filler
Now Victory Lap's my fuckin' Thriller, uh
If you broke, I ain't fuckin' wit' you
Unless you went broke while you was fuckin' wit' me
Then we bounce back 'cause it's nothing really
Gon' do it big 'til they fuckin' kill me
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes 
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a while
Yeah
I could remember, like, bangin' on the MPC late night
Gettin' kicked outta the house because of that shit
Catchin' the 108 to the Blue Line
Niggas sittin' on the bridge, loadin' up they burners, sweatin'
We were just kids tryna get to it
Takin' losses, stayin' down
Frustration
Go looking back at the shit right now, it's like, it's nothin'
It's gon' feel like that for you, too
Hustlers
It's hard but it's fast, see, these haters don't care
When they see you, they stop and stare
Rollin' on them thangs with them gold out rings
Smokin' kush and switchin' lanes 
See, the only thing I think about is when the star might fall
See, we won't stop until we reach the top
And we gon' be there for a whileLook, somehow I escaped the fate of this life I lead
Divorced the street, she tried to kill me and my wife to be
Black widow, silk sheets and a satin pillow
This California king loved you like a sack of indo
Empty patron bottles and a pack of Mentos
Master suite frigerator full of incidentals
Every day we have a ball like the blond bimbo
Talk to her like a shrink and fuck her like a nympho
And it can be as simple as it seems
If you never doubt yourself and learn from everything you see
No wishing on a star can turn your life into a dream
You could walk on water just don't look down at your feet
Look
Told this world I was a star I'm gon' need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When I was 12 a crazy lady told me lead the way
I shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic, when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
Once you found the the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic
I ain't no Christian, ain't no Catholic but I believe
God gonna shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking
We used to be connected, who detached us
We used to be respected, now they laughin'
We've turned into possessions with no passion
How we go from the best to less then average
We used to be connected, who detached us
With no collective identity, it's every man for himself
We need a black mafia
Ruthless Crip on some stupid shit
To valeting at Ruth Chris in some roofless shit
I think too much TV is what ruins kids
When homosexual actors is their influences
We need community centers that teach the music biz
That way we learn to retain ownership on some Jewish shit
Don't take your hand out, you build it it's more lucrative
And now everything that I spoke is the truest shit
You get abused long enough, you start abusing shit
She flipped the script and now your woman calling you a bitch
You got some problems in the house that only you can fix
And if you was a kid that grew up with it even you would split
He told the world he was a star and he gonna need a stage
Cause life is short and talk is cheap so fuck what people say
When he was 12 a crazy lady told him lead the way
He shed a tear cause it was real and swore to never stray
Now every second is a classic, when nothing last
Gotta take a moment and appreciate the fact that
This world is turning faster and faster
Once you found the real it's hard to tolerate the plastic
I ain't no christian, ain't no catholic but
I believe god gonna shine his light on everyone that never had shit
I need some answers to these questions that I'm asking
We used to be connected, who detached us
Death is the destination we all share. No one has ever escaped it
And that is as it should be, because Death is very likely the single best invention of Life
It is Life's change agent. It clears out the old to make way for the new
Right now the new is you, but someday not too long from now, you will gradually become the old and be cleared away
Your time is limited, so don't waste it living someone else's life
Don't be trapped by dogma, which is living with the results of other people's thinking
Don't let the noise of other's opinions drown out your own inner voice
And most important, have the courage to follow your heart and intuition. They somehow already know what you truly want to become. Everything else is secondary
Stay Hungry. Stay Foolish
It was their farewell message as they signed off
And I have always wished that for myself. And now, as you graduate to begin anew, I wish that for you
Stay Hungry. Stay FoolishYou don't put a actress on the floor
You don't ever frontline a war
You ain't never headline a tour
You ain't got a line around the store
You ain't did, you ain't did
I never see your name up in the Forbes
You ain't got a line around the store
Never put a actress on the floor
You ain't never frontline a war
Nigga you ain't did none of this
You ain't did none of this
You ain't got what I got
You ain't seen what I seen
Put lil bitch on my 
Put lil bitch in a beam
Window tint let me see
It's a lot on my plate
I can't make no mistake
Shoulders hold a lot of weight
V's jumping out the face
He ain't gon' build like I build
Niggas ain't real like I'm real
S'why they can't feel like I feel
If we get to you try to take from you
You ain't finna kill like I will
You don't even want to live like I live
You ain't gotta gotta get it out here
Ima drive and I shoot on a mission
I was raised by the realest of niggas
All they told us was kill all these niggas
We never gone lose if we handle this business
Took a turn on the road to the riches
Left my heart in the curb in the trenches
Everything that I want is expensive
And it came with a lot of conditions
That poison done got in your system
This boy here done shot through the ceiling
At first it's the awkwardest feeling
But fuck it my nigga lets get it
Doin' donuts in something ridiculous
Fuck up traffic with all of my crips
And I gotta be over specific
Just so they notice the difference
You don't put a actress on the floor
You don't ever frontline a war
You ain't never headline a tour
You ain't got a line around the store
You ain't did, you ain't did
I never see your name up in the Forbes
You ain't got a line around the store
Never put a actress on the floor
You ain't never frontline a war
Nigga you ain't did none of this
You ain't did none of this
This shit is not fictional
It's really my life every verse is medicinal
The shit it got critical
Pain is forever the payback residual
You ain't got war yo I keep on popping my shit that you know you gon' feel in Ru
Ain't got no pressure problem by the beat
This my lil brother call him Body Lee
Went and took a lot of risks
For that money I commit
Streets took all from
Wishing that ain't in vain
I was outdoor though
I was tryna get it
And that's when I get in the game
Bitch you won't get in the way
I put my focus solely in the music
My niggas start feelin' a way
Even if niggas really make it through
Probably gon' deal in the way
I wrap that dope up like some fine China pieces and I ship 'em away
We do this shit everyday
Hussle got rich in the paint
But Hussle got chips in the bank
Hussle ambitious the great
Hussle put fish in a lake
Hussle officially straight
Hussle unlimited faith
Hussle relate if you gon' touch you a safe
Stayed down through the hard times
Frontline when it was yard time
Self-made pushing hard lines
Tryna tell you niggas that it's our time
You don't put a actress on the floor
You don't ever frontline a war
You ain't never headline a tour
You ain't got a line around the store
You ain't did, you ain't did
I never see your name up in the Forbes
You ain't got a line around the store
Never put a actress on the floor
You ain't never frontline a war
Nigga you ain't did none of this
You ain't did none of thisNow if I break your heart, lil' momma, don't make a scene
You really mad at yourself 'cause you couldn't do it to me
Probably call me a failure if I ain't never achieved
I rather you call me cocky for livin' like I believe, that I'm a king
No sympathizin' with the fake or suprises from the snakes
It's flock season and I value my estate
So I bought some barbed wire 'case they tryna climb the gate
Houston Rocket on my waist
Hip-Hop cops on my case, but fuck 'em, more deposits in the bank
God damn a nigga straight, crooked letter on my face
I'm a fly crip but I rep my whole race
Couple of us eatin' good but everybody want a taste
They say, "Get with it or them niggas gon' take"
I say, "If you want fish, let me lead you to the lake"
But niggas lazy and I'm a late night, early mornin' nigga 25/8 Life wasn't easy growin' up, I had to make somethin' out of nothin'
If you struggled you relate
But now I'm straight, everything great
I don't need your help now, nigga, all of y'all late
That's why I made sure all of y'all shake
The way y'all ride dick I think all of y'all gay
Practice all night, ballin' all day
Sleepin' on the flights, when I land I get paid
I ain't got a boss, I am not a slave
Turnin' up my hustle is how I give myself a raise
And it's funny how people let money make 'em change
See you stickin' to the script then start rippin' out the pages of history, it ain't a mystery
If I died yesterday, my life would be a victory
These niggas sound stupid, sayin' they invented me
But arguin' with fools is a waste of energy
I'm a franchise player and a owner of the team
And they only envy me 'cause we on a winnin' spree
Now, this the sound of my ceremony
The sweet smell of success, yes, I wear it on me
The Snoop Dogg lookin' nigga in the mirror told me
"Keep gettin' money, fuck bitches, and beware of homies"
'Cause Brutus killed Caesar, and Judas killed Jesus
But that's where I'ma leave it
'Cause they call it dry snitchin' if I take it any deeperYeah 
Plug 
Bidness

Two twelves in the trunk, nigga
Havin' everything he want, nigga
Life in the rush nigga
Probably never good enough, nigga
All he wanna do is stunt
Nigga’s always lookin' up to him, whole spot goin' up to him
New money gettin' stuck to him
Life, it was rough to him
Skinny nigga, he was buff to it, trying to do it like Puff do it
Do it like Russ do it, real life, said, "What's up?" to it
Need a Benz, nigga, fuck Buick
Made a plan and I stuck to it
I'm the man, you a bluff to us, small talk such a sus to us
The money is a must to us
We came from these corners but we at it 'til we affluent
You gotta bring your guts to it
Tryna get it to the point they gotta bring it in a truck to us
Yeah, look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you, girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And, nigga, I'ma die for my fuckin' respect
Smoke with me

Hundred racks just to book a nigga

All this ice here is hard to overlook a nigga
Fell in love with that fast money
50 racks on that back end
Walk through cause four bricks
Maybachs when I back in
L.A.X., Nip, roll that pound
Poolside at that polo lounge
M-O-B, bitch, hold that down
Pinky ring, gold Rolex crown
Testify, never go that route
Black bottles, that Moët out
My first mil, I had a Kodak smile
Tell the plug, "Bring more back now"
Fake jewels, never tolerate it
Pray Boobee case exonerated
Every night I thank God I made it
Every night I thank God I made it!
My bitch bad like Paula Patton
Big ass mansion from all that rappin'
Tell the police, "Call the captain"
Motherfucker, I'ma start the clappin'
Yeah, look
Need a hundred a show so we can fly in a jet
Fuck with you, girl, you always ready for sex
Keep my eye on this game and let the money invest
And, nigga, I'ma die for my fuckin' respect
Maybach MusicYuh, me and my nigga Rimpau was on the way to the studio
And cuz had that, um, that Wiz and Curren$y mixtape in the tape deck, the CD changer
And I heard this beat I'm like, "What the fuck?"
Yahp!
Ya know, only thought it's right for my 58,000th leak
Shit, hear we go
Like this, look
Seven days a week, seven different freaks
But I got tired of fuckin' hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watchin' Godfather, leather couches, flat screens
I say I'm on this marathon, she ask me, “What does that mean?”
Ain't no puff and pass, please roll your own, I do the same
Girl, get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame, that's why you're not used to this game
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin' gear 'cause I don't need no runway
My final destination is a cloud, it's a one-way
Fuckin' with them streets, ain't no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I don't never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets, never on no sober shit
Post-traumatic stress, I feel like that's what I'm copin' with
So I smoke the best, impossible not to notice this
30,000 feet up, I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time ain't even over yet
I'm tryna live my life so when it's over I got no regrets
The keys to success, multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it 'til it's over with
Napa Valley Dolce, my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof, ayy, you know who you rollin' with
Hussle
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You ain't gotta worry and we ain't gotta rush, 'cause we not in no hurry
You can't be afraid to let go, you gotta let go of yourself
But you ain't gotta worry, 'cause this gon' take some time
But we not in no hurry
58,000

Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
I wake up in this state of mind, like sky's the limit
My niggas said you crossed the line, well I'm gon' kill you
I'm focused on a million cash, that's the vision
Speeding and I'm finna crash, that's the feeling
Until my tires burn, though, and my wheels give out
These backwoods burn slow, like my bills dish out
When them people come for you, they gone steal yo house
Put yo name on them papers, they gone fill you out
Couple moves from yo quota, come fuck up yo count
Have you thinking bounce back when you out
Look, I'm tip-toeing over traps
Tight-roping at a height, you fall you knowing it's a wrap
But I'm gon' keep this balance, cause it ain't no turning back
Ain't no looking down, my niggas ain't concerned with that
More concerned with cash
More concerned with running laps, running rap
Getting rich, then run it back
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
What's the deal, nigga? What's the deal, nigga?
How you feel? Now you know this shit is real, nigga
Once upon a time was in the field, nigga
War time, really kill or kill, nigga
Gunfire, shooting out civills, nigga
Young, wild, police gon' deal with you
Not too many still living
So I gotta paint it real vivid
I'm surprised that I'm here, nigga
Naw, I'm blind to my fears, nigga
I shine like De Beers, nigga
And fly like a Lear, nigga
Climb like the stairs, nigga
Spend time out in Paris, nigga
Come from where the grannies gotta bury niggas
And money make these hoes wanna marry niggas
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
I think about them late nights
Drive to Vegas across the state lines
Finally did it, it just take time
Since I was ye' high, my only goal was get this cake right
And what they say, right
You on your own, it's what you make life
You was out there everyday, right?
Tryna push foreign, tryna eat steak, right?
Put some hunnids in yo safe, right?
Hang some flat screens in yo place, right?
Life insurance, just in case, right?
Gave something to the lawyer, just in case, right?
Sitting solo, first class, on a straight flight
I remember waiting on my day like...
Everyday I'm on this paper chase, like
Stand between these buildings 'til the daylight
Wiggle through the prisons and the grave sites
Then you finally get it, and you take flight
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killa
Light my backwood, count 100 racks, smoking killa
I pull up in that black on black, smoking killa
My AC on, my ceiling cracked, smoking killaEasy to spot me like Lil Yachty
Red ambient light luminate the big body
Bro hand me a sprite na fuck it alkaline me
Had to rise from the grave but ain't a nigga out climb me
Take it to trial and beat all charges
Pull up in Rarri and ball hard
Watching me take this shit way farther
Now they can tell I was way smarter
Cause you came from hood things
This life it got good things about it too
And now we push Blue Wraith
Got the whole hood singing about you
And you can't stop
Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no
All that pressure but it can't defeat you
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
Authentic ain't the word I'm on 63rd
Tween Brynhurst and Vic where all them killers were
Burgundy your curb burgundy your curb
Hit the gas and swerve hit the gas and swerve
When it's time to purge I can send the work but I don't send em I go wit em cause I risk adverse
And this shit realer than life when you raised so fucked up you start feeling this right
When you seen so much death you start dealing with Christ
If you ever make it out you give em different different advice
Put my truth in this music hope I'm givin' em light
Just another flawed human trying to get this shit right
Love a strong passion but resist it with pride
Too much honor in my heart to let that mickey shit fly
750li count another hunnid thou while I ride
Stonewashed Fear of God like peanut butter on rye
Real shit a nigga touchin' the sky everyday I wake up I refine
You see me drinking alkaline
By any means i gave you a design
I even titled it I put it on my part of the shine
Keep shit going every morning I try
Long as it's late model foreign I'm fine
Lot of pain don't expect me to cry
Lot of fails still expect me to try
I'm from the gang they expect me to die
Cause you came from hood things
This life it got good things about it too
And now we push Blue Wraith
Got the whole hood singing about you
And you can't stop
Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no
All that pressure but it can't defeat you
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
We ain't have no cable but with cane was able
To buy my momma groceries before she made the table
I seen niggas die over a conversation
Young with a gun speedin' through life with no kinds of patience
You can smell the murder while the kids playin'
Enemies on top of enemies the pigs hate us
New nina open your chest up like Vick's Vapor
Ballin' in New York they confusin' me with a Knick's player
Burgundy your block burgundy your block
Was servin' smokers in the spot till cuzzo served a cop
He ain't look like no police he bought it by the piece
His daughter I call her my niece so she gon' always eat
I'm focused like Mohammed with a speed bag
Ski masks, you ain't seeing faces when we need that
Arm and Hammer powder in my finger nails
Got more stripes than a Adidas sale I seen a jail
Was eating tuna as a I read my mail
Everywhere I go now they feel me like they reading braille
I might be a demon I seen shit I never need to tell
Two guns up, Lennox to King Park, two thumbs up
Beans and Bleek, Who want what?
We was off surviving off of samples
Homies dying lit the block up like a blunt with the candle
So fuck your code of ethics we just showin' progression
All that tough shit out your window the minute you show your weapon
Harlem
Cause you came from hood things
This life it got good things about it too
And now we push Blue Wraith
Got the whole hood singing about you
And you can't stop
Oh no you can't stop no, oh no you can't stop no
All that pressure but it can't defeat you
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we do
They don't know the block like we doAnd you will know I am the lord, when I lay my vengeance upon you. I been saying that shit for years, and if you heard it that meant yo ass. I never gave much thought to what it meant I just thought it was some cold blooded shit to say to a muthafucka before I popped a cap in his ass. I saw some shit this morning made me think twice. See now I'm thinking, maybe it means you're the evil man, and I'm the righteous man. And Mr. 9mm here is the shepard protecting my righteous ass in the valley of darkness

We throwin' up gang signs, no Zodiac nigga
Been locked up like three times, I can't go back nigga

Time is ticking, got the Frank on my wrist, I ain't talking about Ski

I just hope when we gone that they don’t forget us 
Look
We just sitting here tryna win
Pull up to the spot, it’s a flock of Benz
So much smoke need oxygen,
Re-up money, that’s not to spend
All gold bottles at Toxic and
Standing on the couch, me and my accomplices
Pop a bottle, spot the bitch; get the bitch, got the bitch
Streets wanna know 'when you droppin' Nip?'
Police wanna know how you got your Six?
Niggas on the side hate to watch the shit
See you on top, so they throw rocks and shit
Never really was with the talking shit
Me, I just went and got a pot to piss
Upgrade diamonds on my watch and shit
Pictures on the wall at the offices
AC colder than my Compton bitch
Talking that “You don’t even need a condom” shit
Look, I’m really on some baller shit
On some rich nigga, I ain't gotta call you shit
On some, fuck with me if you loyal shit
Everybody in my circle get spoiled shit
Really started in the soil shit
Crowns on the wrist, that’s royal shit
 x2
Look
We just sitting here tryna win
Drop 20 bands, you can fly us in
Turned down deals, they gon' try again
We need a partnership, it ain't no signing him
You don’t see the type of cars we in?
You don’t see the shows and the lines for them?
You don’t know the spots we residing in
Nigga we straight with dough ain't no enticing him
Look at my life my friend, I got the right to win
I put the grinding in
Even on them nights when the lights was dim
When my hope was low, I found light within
I know it’s ups and downs
So every loss I took, I knew to strike again
And I be saying a lot, that’s a priceless gem
And if we living in hell, is it alright to sin?
I had a goal to chase, a life to live
I tried to wash my hands, pulled me right back in
 x2Check me out, look
I know perfect timing feels like I'm too late
And I know I'm still great in spite of my mistakes
You know it's authentic, every rhyme I say
My only regret is I made niggas wait
See, ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape
And I don't fuck with busters, I can't integrate
Grew up with these killers in my living space
Lotta niggas folded through them village days
Citywide, gang and junction police raids
L.A. Times, Rollin 60s, made the front page
I vowed to never let you ditch and seal my fate
Sellin' dope with hopes to graduate to real estate
I knew I was drummin' to a different beat
Felt it in my stomach, I was just unique
We decided we gon' let these digits speak
Then we turn Slauson into Venice Beach
S 600 Maybach, platinum dealer plates
Wake up in this penthouse to the cityscape
You know it's authentic, every shit I say
I knew self destruction ain't the only way
Sometimes perfect timing feels like I'm too late
But  I know you still great in spite of your mistakes
Before you run your race you gotta find a pace
Just make sure you cross the line, and fuck the time it takes
I got out the county jail 2008
Couple months, I dropped the tape then I was on my way
My first single out, it set the streets ablaze
On location, shot that video in front the cage
Tryna find my way through this fuckin' maze
Every concert, hundred niggas on the stage
I'm still active so it's really just another day
Promoters paranoid to book you, that affects ya pay
And when you stop eatin', that affects your weight
And when you get hungry, that affects your brain
See me I'm not trippin', I respect the game
I hope y'all do, if I can't make it, I'm gon' take your chain
See ain't too many like us, we like vintage Bape
And I don't fuck with busters I can't integrate
I know perfect timing feels like I'm too late
But every single time I drop they tell me I'm the great
Victory LapGotta light up to shit like this, nigga
And I ain't even said it or wrote it yet
I just feel it, you know?
Yuh
Overtime 'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy
Yuh
Overtime  'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong 
Now them niggas know I had it right 
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice 
You see me up in Neiman's, right?
My chain and my pinky bright 
I valet this Mercedes Benz 
Lookin' like somebody that people like 
Can't but help to think how fake it is
This world and this music biz
I just want all of this paper, though 
So maybe I could try and change this shit
Maybe, me, I'm too ambitious
Or maybe this a new dimension
Maybe them, they too religious
Maybe they judge my intentions
But either way, I'm on my mission
In the sky, for our love, I'ma tie a ribbon
Life's a bitch, lady luck my woman
Forever you my lady, I'm your fuckin' nigga
Overtime  'cause I ain't have a mic 
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong 
Now them niggas know I had it right 
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice 
Cappin' for a cheaper price
Hustlin' for a bucket, keep your sneakers tight
Shoot a box, catch the cheapest flight
If it land, thank you Jesus Christ 
You ain't gon' get it till you see it right
And jump off in this legal life
Feel the pressure from your people, right? 
Still choose to lead 'em right 
Sometimes I rap about my feature price 
Or all of my defeats in life
They told me don't believe the hype
But I felt like this 'bout myself before the mic
And you know, if you look at like the movie industry
You don't, you don't base the success off for how many tickets sold
You know, like, what's the gross? How much it gross?
Period, right?
When it come to business, the bottom line is, you know, we in business to make money
How much you gross?
So, it's like, I feel like it's a looming question mark over Hollywood, over the entertainment, music industry
What's the new business model?
And, to me, you know, the people that lead to that answer
That lend they intelligence, they hustle, they effort, they mind-power, you know?
Whatever they can offer to that question, and stick to that and come up with answers to that
I feel like that's one of the most important things going on
Like in the city they'll try and disrespect
 and you'll try to go to, you know, the moon
And then it was like, uh, it had industrial revolutions
Like now, I think it's the business model, creators of the new era that's gon' be able to be the type to keep the business moving forward
People that create new business models, you know, as well as products that, you know, are sold and consumed, services that are consumed, these models
But I feel like the giants gon' be the ones who create the business models
But that's we trying to do with this Proud2Pay
Fuck the middle man
And uh, this disruptive multimedia
Collab and I'm going with, uh, Ryan Legend
Overtime  'cause I ain't have a mic
I was in that Chevy playin' Savage Life
Niggas lookin' like I had it wrong 
Now them niggas know I had it right 
They don't know about them sleepless nights
Them lookin' for a reason nights
They say it's six degrees in life
Opportunity, preparation, they meet, it's nice I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become
I make a grip
Walk inside this shit, then take my pick
I take a shit
On all you fake niggas when I drop my shit
I run my shit, I own my shit, I'm on my shit
I'm on some shit, some owner shit, some Moët shit
I pay my rent, I pay my team
They make me rich, I make them rich, ain't that some shit
Now, watch this, look
More cash, more money, more fame
I'm the realest nigga in this fucking game
I came up, off the corner, all grind
Make these cracker niggas respect my mind
I run my shit, I own my shit, I'm on my shit
I'm on some shit, some owner shit, Range Rover shit
I came to slice bread off the loaf and shit
And get you niggas off that feet up on the sofa shit
Hustle
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage

Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become
I talk that shit that's 'cause I live it, nigga
And if I don't no more, that's 'cause I did it, nigga
You get smart, you get richer, nigga
You start hating and I'll chip you, nigga
To be specific, it's a, Westside, neighborhood
Crenshaw District, Slauson Ave Crippin', anybody killa
Don't give a fuck about a bitch or a nigga
Yeah, they quote my raps like scriptures
Say I shop like hipsters
I drive cars like a rich nigga
And probably pull up with your, ho
Oh, 6-2-O's, fa sho, get dough
Pulling up at my show
Been about a bankroll, make these mills and lay low
Bust a whip and change clothes
Money, power, and hoes
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it
You asking why you won't, it got too much mileage
Ooh, you're looking at a 1 of 1
Ooh, I'll show you how this shit is done
Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've become
100 pints, that's 100 grand 
Bring your money if you want it then 
I'm the man, don't you understand? 
My pack loud like like a fucking band
Big choppers like the Taliban
All these racks, I'm breaking rubber bands 
I love my haters, they my biggest fans 
I'm on the field and they just in the stands
I let 'em watch me while I make these plays
Six touchdowns in they face
That's something to hate on
On the block, yeah, get this money on
OG rolled in my Swisher 
Actavis, pour it in my Sprite 
That little bitch know she bad
She got ass and I wanna fuck, but
I came to get money, and now that I got it
They hate on a nigga, but they should just stop it
She throw me that pussy, but I never caught it

Ooh, my chain look like it weigh a ton
Ooh, bitch, look at what I've becomeYeah, yeah
I limo tint the coupe ain’t no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it up
Used kiss my granny, make my mornin' swerves
Foggy window in my Cutlass was my learning curve
Keep a couple pistols in my furniture
Every time they serve my set, we came to service yours
Tell you somethin' bout my city in case you never heard
All these gangs in competition, who gon' murder more?
We never wave no white flag in this urban war
Head shots so you murder stars
Check out my perfect form
Straight out the eye of this perfect storm
I did my mine with a perfect score
Don't waste time we just work some more
Rolls Royce raps and my tone is Forbes
I'ma take it overboard
Goyard by my .44
Go hard cause this world is yours
I'ma pay that fee
Smoked out with E-40 on
Bossed up like a Corleone
In these Maybach seats
I limo tint the coupe, ain't no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it up
Projects to the condo, thinkin' bout should I decorate?
Only motivation I ever needed was Section 8
Pissy staircases, rats and roaches, wasn't restin' late
Coke and dope we separate
Ain't bagged it yet, they better wait
S600 black Mercedes-Benz, I love the features
Free my cousin, the D's caught him with 100 pieces
Foreign visas, smokin' in Japan, I'm from the cement
One of the homies start tellin', I ain't wanna believe it
Backwoods still burnin' out, Maserati murkin'
This that shit they ain't heard about, certified in person
Real niggas serve a purpose, write my life out in these verses
Clarity in this Rollie, my bitch into Fendi purses
On Slauson with no license, Nipsey told me bring a two liter
20,000 on me, I just made that shit off two features
Cuzzo just came home and all he askin' for is new sneakers
Sun up to sundown I used to trap, I was like who need it?
Dave East nigga
I limo tint the coupe, ain't no clarity in my whip
That Rollie bezzel dazzle, that's clarity on my wrist
That .40 get to dancin', I carry it on my hip
I ain't gon' feel no pressure, don't care how these niggas feel
I ain't gon' keep stressin' on problems, I'm doin' drugs
You can't see it how I see it, you can't keep up
All my enemies defeated, we run it up
All my money go away when I count it upEffortless, call us aggressive intelligence
Hussle my artist and I'm the executive
Buy us a spot in Connecticut
Come from the block with an etiquette
It's never lie to the fellowship
We just survivin' the elements
But I had my eye on some better shit
I pour up my problems irrelevant
I come from sippin' and sellin' it
Big in the streets, I'm a elephant
Blow the brain, push the pedal in
I jumped in the game, got my Letterman
Jumped in the game, I was true to it
We don't ever really lose lose, do it for Uzi and deuce deuce
This one a lay up, fucked lil' bitch and then break up
I sip drank then I left, I can't think without syrup
Feel the pain in my verse, got the game from the curb
You weren't there when it hurt, wore my chain in the church
VS everything, VS make 'dem Rollies stand out
Came up in the game different, my approach was planned out
I want everything nigga, I just don't want no handouts
Hoes will arm themselves, and that's all, I still can't get the sayin' out
Whole lotta sneak dissin', and politicking that shit gone get you layin' down
And my nigga gone, it make Christmas sad now
How I'm 'posed to be gettin' better at it? This shit gettin' bad now
Ain't no pressure young nigga, yeah yeahhh
Don't be so mad at us, all of my talents, it rep for Los Angeles
You should be proud of us, I'm the one came to put on from the land of the scandalous
Use my advantages, I ain't get pick for this shit, I was takin' a stab at it
That make me passionate, that let me know when I gas you niggas can't handle it
Anytime you gotta murk the Devil
Enterprise, you gotta work together
More Cuban links and more German pedals
Know the game, it got certain levels
Know the bosses rock certain bezels
I ain't got the time, I got a certain schedule
You gotta fuck lil' mama in a certain bedroom
And if she a diamond, I'm the perfect pressure
They put it all on me, that pressure don't fall on me
I pull up when she call on me, I pull up with my big dog
Take my watch of my wrist though
All that pain it gone hit y'all, choppa shakin' the clip off
Sip on drink till I bleed it, got my gang on my fitted
Fuck lil' hoe and admit it, fuck lil' hoe and I'm litty
Out the gate undefeated, metro fuck up my breathin'
We don't spend on middle men, we want the whole thing
All I want bitch on bitch, my bitch go both ways
White dick, lick me up, OK
Monthly trips, sales stacking money, just so I can go away
Can't trust a bitch, bitch let her get to a nigga, both ways
True religions 'fore I blew up, world paid
My prescription yeah we boost up, all paid
They put they weight on me
Y'all niggas stayed on it
They want me gone gone
Niggas is plannin' on it
But they gotta wait on it, this shit ain't a game for me
You got a lot of mouths to feed, I got the same motive
Ain't gotta explain for me, just don't put your blame on me
But that's just a part of the game, and I ain't a shamed for it
I was taught to remain humble, and apply in the same hustle
Take me for a loaded wall in the kitchen while he making the 'cain bubble
Why I feel like the grave love us?
Why I feel like the pain numb us?
Why I feel like we started off tight but nowadays we ain't brothers?
​What they call you where you from, nigga?
Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
I'm a 108 bus catching
Blue line train riding, westsider with the young extras
These old rules came with no questions
Wrong to live by them but it's no exceptions
Was young and reckless with loaded weapons
The code of ethics lead to self destruction
When it's over, you left with nothing
This life ain't it boy, better check the subtext
Or the fine print, felt entitled to this fly shit
Felt like every bad bitch should be on my dick
Felt like niggas lied to us on some fraud shit
Fuck it, that's just how the ball bounce on some boss shit
Right here with all my brothers, on some squad shit
All money, one nation under God shit
Naybahood, Nipsey Hussle, on some boss shit
AKA nigga born broke, gotta die rich
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking like the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
A nigga had the nerve to walk up on me ask me where I'm from
I told him I ain't bang, he didn't listen so I gave him one
Not the cididy one, nigga try to hit him up
Now you wanna get him up, set it up and wet it up
Now from the hood, checking niggas on the daily
Started off BG, OG, baby
Real live homie, two heaters in my seat
Had to check a nigga at the Compton Swap Meet
Where you from? I don't bang
Where you live? Where you hang?
Say the wrong thing, and bang
Lights out, kites out to the homies in the pen
Crippin' in the city, we ain't let the cuz in
A lot of niggas camouflage, try to blend in to fit in
Get a hood rat so they set in
But if she got a brother, a daddy, or a cousin
They hit your ass up like motherfuckers, where you from, cuh?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking like the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, niggaPolice ain't never gone know
Niggas ain't never gone know
Just know that I know
Know that I know and ain't never gone know
You never gone know you never gone know
You niggas ain't never gone know and you bitches ain't never gone know
But just know that I know put that on my soul
Put that on my soul you just know that I know
You know that I know you know that I know
You ain't never gone know
These police ain't never gone know

Cause we was up with money back when it was ugly trying to campaign
Ima do it make it look a lil different in this same thang
Cause them niggas weren't built
I was the soundtrack to the street when my brother got killed
And they left me alone they ain't never gone know
I been dealing with accepting it ain't gone respect it
I've been motivated focused my energy be getting tested
Guilty tatted on my arm put it on a necklace
Ima get it how I want for what you suggested
That work was easy tell them niggas I got jobs for em like Steve told em it was worth it they ain't want believe me
Them niggas tryna send a message we don't receive it
And it's all love for the sheep I can't believe how they try trick me

Ambition to elevate but try not to separate
The losses we can't erase wins we gone celebrate
Start of 2008 and I promised my niggas I take this shit all the way
Never complain I take all this hate in return I'm just asking for all your faith
Follow my lead and you saw the lakes so don't turn on me now if you not a snake
We went to war and I caught a case that nigga Nip through it all away up in the county have a couple fights a day I'm in my bunk tryna map a brighter day
You underestimated seven digits later see how I levitated
You see how I play it player

Blue bandanas blue dickies and a deuce fifth
Slauson ave ain't the side you could truce with
Homicide city turned these young niggas ruthless
With loose lips will make a snitch nigga shoes slip
Pistol introduce a pussy nigga to the pulpit
Blue rag "S" hat gold on my neck fat
Gun case catch that cause neighborhood I rep that
Bust heads peel caps cook coke sell crack
Hit the county jail make yo enemies run that
Momma know my gun clap granny know my gun clap
Shoot it out fuck that
Duck down bust back
Deuce deuces on my cadillac
California state of mind since Kurupt dropped with battle cat
Some niggas crippin and some niggas don't

Some niggas bloodin and some niggas don't
Times get so crazy when you're out on your own
We gets it crackin like the old G's used to do

Them gangstas they roll them gangstas they roll
Red converse nigga
Soo woopin from the dirt nigga
Bangin my turf like snoop did
And it's still 187 on a mothafuckin cop
When I'm dippin down the block banging Black Superman
And CJ Mack naw Game wasn't the first with the L.A. tat
It was Keita Rock I'm the blood him straight from Cedar block
Name still painted on the wall I never leave the block
Can't stop won't stop gotta keep the heater cocked
Fiends like S Dot they'll never leave the rock
Palm trees crips bloods hundreds in the strip club

Them gangstas live on them gangstas they rollInitials on my wallets, smoking with my stylist
Custom German plates on all my cars, cause bitch I'm balling
All in burning crosses, which royalty regardless
Honestly I'm honored just to represent the progress
Distant as I seem to you, I know what I mean to you
Martin Luther King Jr., Hustle let me dream through you
When I told my scheme to em, told me that I seem stupid
Empty engines need fueling, y'all was like my theme music
Now I keep them links Cuban, money talk I speak fluent
Everybody buying Rolies, you can ask my team's jeweller
Life is but a dream to us, life is why they need music
Got em wrapped around the corner, looking like Supreme threw it
Cause when you cook it right, the fiends use it
Come take a look at life how we view it
You gotta start off in a cheap buick
Then book a flight and see to it
That's first class, my first pass
It's big shit nigga like when birds pass
Them 7 grams I got to a bird fast
On Brynhurst Ave start busting on my church pass
DOA, "you gon' be okay" that's what my granny used to say
But I ain't see a way
Sitting in the county jail I pray I see today
Most successful nigga got a "S" up on his face
Fuck the world, fuck the world
They hate a young nigga that could fuck your girl
They hate a real nigga when he touch a mill
Hate you if you fake, but hate you more if you realAll these jewels that I spit
Fools will get chipped
Can't change the game cause there's rules to this shit
When you follow suit whole crew will get rich
I'm the proof check the motherfucking views in this bitch
Yeah, as I cruise in my 6
Need a 100K a show that's my muse when I spit
I'm the type to make the news when I trip
Prolly be my downfall a short fuse on a crip
And I'm working on my temper put some jewels on my wrist
Cause I'd rather be that nigga on a cruise with my bitch
Boat dock, only food is a fish
On the coast to Greece nigga where the views is the shit
Follow me home come and view the abyss
Take a walk with me take your tool just to take a piss
It ain't safe tell a nigga get a grip
Hard headed niggas gotta take a bag to take a shit
Where if you let a nigga mark you out
You labeled as a bitch
Can't take a strike back so niggas ain't taking shit
They see you with it prolly take a nigga shit
If you got that on your record prolly take you for your chick
Disrespect you infront of your kids
Treat you like the broad that you is
That's on God and my kid
Imma have you gone with the wind
Stop them games where they start begin
Lion heart in my brim
And nigga it get dark in the den
Question is homie with the sharks can you swim?
Smell fakes, smell pussy, smell fear
Killer instinct we can tell what's pretend
I be getting to the money
Ain't a damn thing funny
You can see this cash all on me
I'll be on it till I'm dead and gone, dead and gone
After that then I'm heading home, heading home
I be getting to the money
Ain't a damn thing funny
You can see this cash all on me
I'll be on it till I'm dead and gone, dead and gone
After that then I'm heading home, heading homeMe and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
Me and my niggas stay, stay loyal, loyal
And I do not fuck with fake niggas so miss me with that snake
But I know pro 3 chrome versace whips is how I'm skating
Pistol on my lap, niggas making threats
Me I'm tryna ball, niggas wishing death
Probably all just talking, probably idle threats
I seen this shit happen I can't take this shit for less
Smoking as I drive, watching for the people
All I know is eat while in these streets don't let them eat you
This for all my dogs, this for all my locs
Fucking with that fuck around, fuck around and get smoked
One time for my killas, go hard bitches
Worldwide bosses, young real niggas
Had to make it happen, plus I gave my word
Started out the trunk now I'm on the curb
Trapping 'round the world, lessons that we learned
Blessings we deserved cause niggas kept it firm
All my niggas  stay, stay loyal, loyal 
All my niggas  stay, stay loyal, loyal 
All my niggas  stay, stay loyal, loyal 
All my niggas  stay, stay loyal, loyal 
All my niggas  stay, stay loyal, loyal 
All I know is banging, all I know is rap
Got put on the hood then I went and bought a strap
Couldn't understand the stack so I put it on my lap
Slauson Boy tat, put it on my back
Had to flip some money I put it on a sack
Invested in my music finally put it in this rap
Started with my niggas so I put my heart in it
Never switch real, still here with who I started with
Loyalty respect against betrayal and dishonor
So when a real nigga stands it killavates you when you spotted
Don't get me cause I got it, really cause I'm bout it
This one's for my niggas sippin Remy in the projects
Look how far we came without a record deal
All Money In now you niggas know the drill
Lessons that we learn, just from standing firm
Blessings that we earned we got what we deserved
Yo you can look up and thats when at the highest level of business
That's they model, equity
You know what I mean?
At the highest level of business there's mailbox money
They gon' give the masses the checks
That's what they gon' do
A percent of what you gon' make
They gon' cash that check on the back of them
It's like hip hop is so much inspired and you know
Respect and honor to us, you know what I'm saying that
It's just, it's hip hop that's doing this much
You know what I'm saying that, it's just you know
Play the game have, you know the pros playing
And you switch them out for, you know what I'm saying
What's the intention what's cool, whats braggin rights?
What's them braggin rights gonna be
That's what the braggin right is it used to be
I used to be the Mexican  success
But to me it's like, you know, what would you want?
You want something what's your position?
Can you make shit move?
Can you have power? Can you have true power?
Then you have control of your desitinyForever on some fly shit
I'mma draw the line, you niggas pick who you gone ride with
Simple ass niggas happy because they fucked my side bitch
But she just mad at me cause she ain't the one I ride with
Drop down and pick yo heart up off the floor girl
And quit tryna convince me that yo ass is not a ho, girl
Wonder why I'm not picking up my phone well
The last twelve months months I done traveled 'cross the whole world
And niggas hoping I'ma flop but, meanwhile I've been getting paid on every stop
Neighborhood nigga still good on every block
Still bust on any nigga acting like he can't be shot, hol' up
I got an extra clip for the johnny still
Burner on my lap, only difference is the wheels
Murder is a fact when you out here in the field
Cause jealous niggas dealing with emotions only bitches feel
And nine times out of ten they just want a friend
But I've been real before rap so I won't pretend
Tell em to they face all flaws all the flaws that I'm noticing
I've never fucked with your type and I won't begin
And then its "oh we on this high horse"
But bottom line bitch nigga this is my horse
Never kill nothing you just wait on it to die first
But this gone be the season that you vulture niggas fly north
Drop classic after classic
Streets on fire, soft rappers can't match this
I ain't doin features even if they got the cash
Me and Blacc Sam ballin out the shop on slauson ave look
There's way more profit in these clothes
So I give away this music and make double back in shows I
360 myself then I exercise control
IHussle.com my digital Louis store
Tell 'em catch up now or find out later
I'm revenge in the form of success to all haters
Where a benz is a form of respect to spectators
And your friends keep it real for a sec then switch later
In this material world where a thought is contagious
Insecurity is created cause niggas is less famous than
Most the time, they just in it for these hoes
So it's fuckin up their lives once she sees there's no controlMy seat back

That's all I need to keep bringing this dough in
Yes I bangin' and I'm boastin', it's a fact I'm the dopest
If you don't believe I got some things I want to show you

Double quick oyster perpetual Presidential Rolex
I'm on it early in the morning

I feel like that nigga Pac these bitches set me up
I make her kiss my nuts just to get me up
Oh yeah, we back hoe
Niggas that they ask for

TMC this shit don't stop
Me and Nip is really runnin' it
And the funny shit I'll say is that it's only just begun 
Niggas be up early before the Sun 
It's money in the morning 
Niggas traded coffee for Patron 
Y'all just pardon me I'm just zoning 
Gold hundred spokes look chrome
The one that got your girl's shit foaming
And your bitch is in my ear saying she need thatUh, yeah
It's that L.A. shit, Crenshaw and Slauson, 2003
Young niggas getting money for real this time
Ay
Look, summertime in that Cutlass
All these young hoes is fuckin'
All these young niggas is hustlin'
Pull up thick to that function
Pull out guns and start bussin'
'Cause niggas not with no fussin'
Roll up kush and shoot hunneds
And take your bitch like its nothin'
We was living fast, we was rushin'
Niggas burnt and crashed on that dumb shit
And it was fuckin' sad 'cause we was puppets
Had to learn so fast to switch hustles
And my bag, that’s $1200
And my fucking pad is illustrious
And I’d still kill one of you niggas
'Cause I’m not really for the fuck shit
And we was raised around hustlers
Rolex chains and K’s bussin'
Super Sports and boxed Cutlass
And pull off fast and burn rubber
Pull out cash like it’s nothin'
'Cause all these young niggas is hustlin'
All these young hoes his fuckin'
Summertime in that Cutlass
Summertime in that Cutlass
Summertime in that Cutlass
Summertime in that Cutlass
Roll up flight then get blunted
Thousand grams in that cupboard
If the police raid then we flush it
Murder case wit' no suspects
And all these niggas done got bust at
All these niggas they went and bust back
Make it hard to tell which one of us done what
As some young niggas we ain't want much
But if we was gon' have it, it was on us
Handouts, it was no such
Ten toes in some old Chucks
Beat loud but I’m low-cut
European clip grille when I roll up
Oh, fat Roley all gold, huh?
Let me squeeze ten shots, that’d be yo' luck
Look, talk money or I’m deaf
See niggas going broke, that ain't nothin' to respect
And I ain't tryna feel it so I do it to the death
1985 Cut dawg in the set
When I was fuckin' Courtney and Lauren, they was neighbors
And Car-Car told both of 'em, she was hatin'
But I ain't give a fuck, I been a young player
Push foreign shit now but remember them days when I used to spend a
Summertime in that Cutlass
Summertime in that CutlassYou Know, some things just got to be said
Marathon Music, uh
Look, you don't a clue of what you want to do
I'm busy gettin' rich, you think that I'm gon' stop for you?
I built this on my own and everybody know it's true
Still niggas act like they supposed to have control of what I do
But look, they don't got a clue of what I been through
Nigga ain't have no trust funds or eat off no silver spoons
Nigga ain't have no peace inside my house until I moved
And I damn sure can't recall havin' no exit route in you
But really, I don't got a clue of what you even do
And what good is a dream if you can't make yo shit come true?
What good is a team when everyone depends on you?
Hope opportunity don't knock, what opportunist in yo group?
'Cause then what you gon' do?
What you gon' do?
'Cause if you sharin' your success and not your struggle, you's a fool
Then you start to look like food, the game don't even chew
Eat you up and shit you out and then them critics say you through
But look, they don't got a clue what you was tryna do
Keepin' it one hunnid, one hunnid don't keep it you
But I'm gon' tell you what to do
Here is what you do
Say, "fuck the middle-man," get on your marathon and get your loot
I hustle 'cause I have to, not because it's cool
And over time became accustomed to the bullshit niggas do
Now I'm numb and it's cool, had to bounce back and regroup
Hope you don't expect shit from me, 'cause I don't want shit from you
Now I'm ballin' like I'm 
Livin' life like we s'posed to
Fuckin' bitches like we s'posed to
Gettin' money like we s'posed to
Smokin' kush like we s'posed toIt's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
Laps
Verse 1:
Chip on my shoulder, for niggas that hated on us
Labels that hesitated when radio wouldn't play us
Rappers dropping they disses now see us start explaining
Bitches I used to date wouldn't shut up and stop complaining
Now they looking salty cause I'm sucka ducking full time
Sipping dolce at the roosevelt, cabana poolside
Hundred thousand ain't enough to buy a new ride
See that's the type of disrespectful deal you sign
What happened nigga? last year you was cracking nigga
This marathon got me lapping all you rapping niggas
Been steady rising since the world got a half a whiff of 'Hussle in the House'
And Felli Fel ran it back on niggas
Streets love me cause they know I got crackin' in 'em
Took a stand, never ran and got gaffled in 'em
Bailed out with block money, kept trappin'
And I took this rap game and put some real nigga passion in it
It's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
Laps
Lo and behold, he getting his dough
Got that presidential roley flow, you niggas should know
Criticize me for the jewelery that I rock at my show
But watch the value of the dollar drop and gold explode
I got no time for these "I ain't tryin'a stand in line" homies
Think I owe them the world but never did nothing for me
Talking under they breath till they bitch just making her want me
See me or hit me with some fake shit like hey brody
Got enemies, trying to kill me for the rep
Couple smart niggas, think they playing chess go gonna get
Tony montana at the lot with my bitch
Tell them bulletproof that and bulletproof this
Guns behind the AC, I'm stashbox crazy
You can look at me and tell I was a match box baby
I'm game tight so niggas will never play me
Four words for my haters, look: fuck you pay me
It's young hussle an' I'm bout to make it crack
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out to bitches on the stage getting racks
Told her it's a marathon, now she out here running laps
It's young hussle when I'm bout to make it clap
Got a Roley on my wrist and my city on my back
Shout out my niggas on the block selling crack
Told them it's a marathon, now they out here running
LapsIf what I believe
Is proved to be wrong
Then I guess I'm a miracle
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say I did it
Look nigga, uh
All black everything and my diamonds all love like Vera Wang
Look, blue rags in the south of France
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? I'm a nigga that's supposed to ball
'Cause I'm a street survivor and they mold us wrong
Before rap we was rollin' stones
I drove a Cutlass coupe, would cop a quarter zone
Front of the buildin' on my mobile phone
I'm thinkin' pace myself 'cause you could overdose
Not on the drugs but the life you chose
By hangin' niggas, I don't like the row
No such thing as they might parole
They putting cameras up in microphones
They got me sandwiched in, I want a nicer home
They know I take the risk, I don't know right from wrong
Plus any given day you might be gone
No cliché where the lines get drawn
Come on the block, it's a riot zone
For the loot niggas stoop into pirate mode
Paint with less strokes and divide you, dawg
Guns get drawn, niggas lives get lost
Never was entitled, had to fight for raw
Necessities in life, you see the reason, right?
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say I did it
Look nigga, uh
All black everything in my 600 Benz with a heavy chain
Look, you deserve a real nigga with money
There's some things in life that won't ever change
Me? Fell in love with a cutie
A celebrity herself, prolly fuck with her music
She the one that the shoe fit but I can't stop for love
Look how the game has seduced us
Benihana's or the Ruth's Chris
A lot of new responsibilities with all of this influence
Spendin' racks, therapeutic
So I snow flake the face like A.C.s in my new shit
One button, where the roof went?
TMZ takin' shots, say cheese for the news clips
Dope boys and them boosters
Gangbangers and hoopers
My style is inclusive, the streets is abusive
But it's life, my nigga, wanna survive, gotta shoot shit
Hella thick skin, never bruise quick
Yellow wrists and some 7-speed shit
I talk to you on some suck a D shit
All visual, nigga going digital, nigga
Not the smartest nigga but its visceral, nigga
My understandin' on a level kinda different, my nigga
Every time I drop, the city a feel it
Every time you hate, you gotta be kiddin'
Every time I pull up, the foreign is kitted
And I can't even really walk through the Beverly Center
Hudson jeans on, ain't the regular demin
I bought the 600, not the regular Benz
Famous without a deal, that ain't regular nigga
Tired of tellin' you niggas I'm not a regular nigga, no!
I was been supposed to change up
I was been supposed to fold all this pressure
I was been supposed to change up
Nigga, what would I look like? I come from the hood
I represent the only way up
Had to hustle, boy, I'm tryna touch a toy
I'm tryna fuck these L.A. streets up
Think it's safe to say I did it
Look nigga, uhWalk with a real nigga
Self-made millionaire
What more could you ask for, huh?
All blue Chucks, with the gold spikes
All black Benz with the chrome pipes
Run my own shit, own my own rights
Press my own line got my own stripes
Thousand-dollar luggage on a long flight
See me out in public, bet my arm bright
Million-dollar meetings, 'cause my songs tight
Said they gon' take it, nigga all right
Fake it 'til you make it — me, I ball right
Stack it 'til my paper is LeBron height
Russian cut diamond cost your car twice
S550, that's the wrong type
600 Benz, with the frog lights
Press the gas, snap your neck like a shark bite
Most of these niggas live the fraud life
So most of these bitches is a fraud's wife
When you meet a real nigga, play your cards right
'Cause when I meet a real bitch I do that broad right
Bet you I'ma leave my mark like a dog bite
Sellin hot 16's like they off white
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back — I'ma ball first
Put you in the dirt, with all worms
My team straight, all perms
These hoes dirty, nigga, all germs
Listen to Nip, you learn like he spittin' all verbs
Bad lil bitch, all curves
Homies like corners, they all turn
Man, that big body, nigga, all swerves
Bitch, before you come to my house, call first
Nigga, do your homework
Gotta take care of home first
You a ho nigga, take a ho bath
I got the strap on me, real niggas hold that
Where the ratchets at? Lets get ratchet, though
Never trick on a bitch, this ain't a magic show
I never trust and I never lust
And if it ain't the first night then we never fuck
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back — I'ma ball first
No clothes in the closet, it's all birds
No sneakers in the sneaker box, it's all birds
No luggage in the trunk, man, it's all birds
And I ain't going back — I'ma ball firstYuh, sound like some AZ shit
What
Count up that loot, count up that loot, nigga
Count up that loot, that's just what I do
Count up that loot, nigga, what?
Count up that loot, count up that loot
Look, count up that loot, count up that loot
Look, black on black Benz, young nigga, salute
Look, gold Cuban Links, just reppin' my roots
Look, blood, sweat, and tears, just squeezin' my fruits
Look, top of my game, and what's up wit' you
Look, pop at you lames 'cause I'm sucka proof
Look, don't play no games, boy, I'm busta proof
Can't fuck wit' me, I don't fuck wit' you
You a fuckin' fraud, I'm the fuckin' truth
I went solo on that ass, I think I'm fuckin' Snoop
Solo in this game, I'm like, "Fuck the group"
Solo in my SL Benz like, "fuck the roof"
That's fuckin' true, that's fuckin' who?
Nip muthafucka, lookin' like a hustla do
I built this label up just like Russell do
Gimme 10 years, they gon' be like, "Russell who?"
Never trust them fools, get a fuckin' clue
I skip them meetings, tell them fags, "Watch my fuckin' moves"
I'm Birdman in blue Chucks, watch my fuckin' shoes
I'm Suge Knight, I'm J. Prince, I'm like, "Fuck the rules"
I'm Austin Rosen, I'm Jonah Berger
This ain't black-on-black crime, but it's fuckin' murder
This beat ain't even mixed, but it's fuckin' perfect
They paid a hundred for my tape and it was fuckin' worth it
Shout out to Wendy Williams 'cause she helped it surface
Shout out my nigga Jigga 'cause he made that purchase
Shout out my nigga Sway, my nigga B Dot, Whoo Kid
Sold out the first day, we had to restock
Look, count up that loot, count up that loot
Look, black on black Benz, young nigga, salute
Look, gold Cuban Links, just reppin' my roots
Look, blood, sweat, and tears, just squeezin' my fruits
Look, my nigga Hoggie got shot in his head
Look, I got that call and they said he was dead
Look, I couldn't cry, but it hurt a nigga
Mostly because he was too young to find his purpose, nigga
This life is short, let's make it worth it, nigga
We all so far from perfect, nigga
Them cameras rollin', no rehearsals, nigga
Plus scared money never made a fuckin' purchase, nigga
Look at all this game in my verses, nigga
I swore that I would never have to work for niggas
I sacrificed like every nigga in my circle, nigga
Now world tours every summer like the circus, nigga
Barnum & Baileys, y'all clowns is crazy
These diamonds is flawless, that shit is fugazy
Just open yo' magazine, see my picture by Jay-Z
Brand new Mercedes, Los Angeles made me
Pull up at the Shell, playin' D'Angelo, Lady
This industry racist, don't ever mistake it
Can't say my name wit' niggas who labels enslaved 'em
You say my name wit' niggas like Malcolm and Jesus
Look, count up that loot, count up that loot
Look, black on black Benz, young nigga, salute
Look, gold Cuban Links, just reppin' my roots
Look, blood, sweat, and tears, just squeezin' my fruits

Walk inside my house, all you see is views
Flat screens on the wall, white folks in the hall
Make 100 racks and tell my bitch to count it all
It was us against the odds 'til niggas played they cards
All we did was ball, look how they did my dog
All these pretty broads, all these foreign cars
Made a grip to lose it all, it was the rise before the fall

My money come in lumps, love only come once
You the nigga she got, but I’m the nigga she want
I told er leave on the pumps, ‘cause it’s a perfect occasion
Her body lookin' amazing and my pockets looking Caucasian
And you niggas salty at me but I’ll slap your face off

That Westside still the best side, got a Mac 11 on hip

Got these dollars split with my crew
Plus we stay shittin', PU
PS, we just, the best, Khaled

Crenshaw on my shirt, German on my stuntAnd this night time I got my Locs on
Six hundred Benz with the Vogues on
Been through everything, but I rode on
And I ain't never quit or take no loss
And I'm proud of that!
Back to the wall, I was so stoned
Self-made nigga, I was solo
Hot up in the kitchen, I was so stove
A nigga couldn't tell me nothing, I was so rogue
I had AR's, fo-fo's Alpines on low pros
Brought K's with us, and caught fades nigga
And I used to get good grades nigga!
My momma paid the bills, but couldn't save, nigga
So we couldn't ask for no J's, nigga
See, that's the type of shit change niggas
Now from the street, she couldn't save niggas
Only difference was we wasn't playin' with it
Wasn't in it for the hoes or the fame, nigga
Swear to God, I couldn't buy a bag of Lay's, nigga
And I rather be a sinner than a shame nigga
So like that!
I rationalize it in my brain, nigga
Even if I was a victim to the game, it was
Better than living life as a slave nigga
Be right back! Had to turn myself into a paid nigga
I did dirt 'cuz I was climbin' out the grave nigga
To go straight and re-examine my ways
That was the concept and now they're telling me I'm next
But, please my nigga, please my nigga
Don't take this out of context
All the nights I dealt with my stress
All the triple bunks where I slept
All the busted knuckles, all the smoking guns
And all the shit I did for my set!
All my niggas is gone, they got stretched
But now your nigga is on, so don't fret
It's a marathon to success
So all my niggas that's home, we run laps
I got a flight tomorrow I'm gonna catch
I got a presidential Rolex
I have my mind made up, got my grind game up
Now I thank the Lord I'm so blessed
And this night time I got my Locs on
Six hundred Benz with the Vogues on
Been through everything, but I rode on
And I ain't never quit or take no loss
And I'm proud of that!
My life's a marathon. If I die today
Will you rep tomorrow, or will this fade away?
Black diamonds on my chain, violence comes with this fame
I'm ridin dirty, my cup leaning, Pimp C inspired my paint
I got enemies on my mind, expiration dates on their lives
Try to keep your head above water, they wanna see a nigga capsized
Can't a nigga live, I'm bumpin' Pac, I'm blowin' big, I'm strapped down
Colin Powell, I hold it down, with these 40 rounds
My windows up, my top down
I'm stacking money, I'm out of town
You acting funny, you're a pussy nigga
Talk behind my back but try to dap me now
Not my type of nigga, I'm so certified
When them niggas schemin', take them for that murder ride
It's not who starts the strongest, but who money the longest
Or who shooting the longest, a head shot is a bonus
And this night time I got my Locs on
Six hundred Benz with the Vogues on
Been through everything, but I rode on
And I ain't never quit or take no loss
And I'm proud of that!Dickie shorts, Bally belt, boxer briefs
Bitch, of course this marathon is where you ought to be
Shopping sprees spending thousands on designer jeans
Exotic women, Mercedes Benzes with bucket seats
Pretty feet, pretty hair that blow in the breeze
It's pretty rare that she meet a nigga as real as me
Especially when she fishin' in this music industry
But luckily she fucked around and fucked with me
Surround myself with the finer things
I guess I'm Hollywood 'cause I'm enjoyin' what my grindin' bring
I'm All Money In, dot I-N-C
Minus the major record label, time to rise the fee
On every stage I'm givin' everything inside of me
But she gon' give it back after the show in the Le Montrose suite
My-My-My nigga Rimpee's got a thick freak 
Down the hall gettin' crackin' over this beat
We smokin' good, y'all smell the weed
We finally made it to the plane then we fell asleep
The mornin' came, the night leaves
A little of a workaholic, shit, I might be
Up at 6 in the morning like I'm Ice T
Spent the grip on the Malcolm X, Spike Lee
Hope them other rappers never think they like me
On any given day 60 thousand on my white tee
Ain't nothin' much but what them dollars bring
Addicted to the rush of money, wires and depositing
So no I can't fall asleep at the driver's seat
That's why y'all wake up to a kush blunt and a Ralo beat
Hard top, push the button, you don't turn the key
Bulletproof 'cause I know niggas wanna murder me
I never heard of you, I know you heard of me
And that's the part that make your head hurt
It's 5 in the mornin'
And I'm talkin' this thug shit to you 
Got it and I want it
Let me run this marathon with you 
Look
'Cause I got it on deck, baby
I put that on the set, baby
I'm kissin' on yo neck
Yo pussy get wet
And then we have sex, baby
'Cause I got it on deck, baby
I put that on the set, baby
I get to kissing yo neck
Yo pussy get wet
And then we have sex, baby
Ayy
You know the hotel get turnt up if we in it
Smell the kush soon as you exit the elevators
You hear the musicLook, just got a call from my bank
To tell me that we hit again, keep doing my thing
The boys on fire money wires everyday
It's a natural known fact I'm the hottest in LA
It's All Money In, thats all I gotta say
Got em repping down in Diego, Las Vegas to the bay
Even on the east they never hesitate
They shouting out my words from the crowd towards the stage
And you know im getting paid, yeah you know im getting paid
Look, marathon life it's all about the pace
Lot of niggas running sprints but they never win the race
You don't see me at the shop, I'm probably outta state
In my fly hotel working on my mixtape
Standing on the couches later on that day
Champagne, models pouring bottles on their face
The S is for succcess and that's why I love the hate
They mad cause I can, and I'm happy cause they can't
Yeah, I'm happy cause they can't
It's that feel good, you know
Shout out to my enemies, shout out to the facts
We the ones that they pretend to be
Rappers with their gangbang identity
But imitation is the highest form of humility
Then my phone rang, it was Killa B
Thats a bad bitch, plus she get her cheese
Know I'm feeling her, I know she feeling me
But we dont even fuck, we do some different things
Take her to the turf, she trynna take me to her church
Just be yourself, thats the only way to make it work
Sweet cady drop top mercedes
Blowing that Obama with some old school, playin'
PCH, switching lane feels amazing
Life is everything that I said I would make it
Love my niggas, so bread I'm gon' break it
20 racks, 50 racks, 100 racks, run it back
If that ain't fly cripping, what the fuck is that
Type of life you know nothing bout
Gotta fly first class if you wanna talk
Louie on the duffle bag pick a airport
We can be there tonight baby therefore
You know, I gotta say, the motherfucking marathon continues
Late night, top off, her hair blowing in the wind, nigga smoking on that good
Feeling oh so hood, yeah, told you, yeah, this is volume one
Aight, Hussle, motherfucker, hey, Rallo
Heyy
Yo-yo-yo-yoNiggas be nervous on the mic
I’m real comfortable
Look
Count my dough and smoke up
I’m from California
Mean my weed is potent, all my bitches go up
Where you from? So what?
Ah, y'all niggas so tough?
All you niggas so broke
All my niggas so up
California sown up, and I’m still a owner
And I’m on my shit, smellin' my aroma
Fuck you niggas, watch this
Roley with no toc tic
Oops, I mean no tic toc
Never took no pit stop
Every time my shit drop
Victory for hip-hop
Never mind my title, I’m the up and coming Michael
All I got is ice on, skinny as a rifle
Still my pockets fat, nigga, bitches need some lipos
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues
Built my foundation strong, now I live like a boss
Even good niggas hate you, but fuck you, I'll kill you all
Sippin' that lean, huh? But niggas not trill at all
Niggas is playin' with me, like sushi ain’t really raw
Like guns don’t really kill, and bullets ain’t really hot
Like I ain't a fuckin' fool, 2000-and-20 Pac
He said hit 'em up, X said shut 'em down
I been going hard, ain’t no stopping now
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues
I can’t see the ceiling, y'all can’t see the reason
I keep killin' niggas, but I can’t leave em breathin'
Bro said do it to 'em, I’m gon' do it to 'em
See these brick walls? I keep on going through 'em
They can't stop it, nigga, this my profit, nigga
It’s my real sweat, y'all ain’t killed shit
But if you a real nigga, had to do real shit
Come from a real struggle, hustle and deal shit
Promise you feel this, know that you fearless
All of my real Bloods, all of my real Crips
Doing her thang for you, shout out that real bitch
Hop on them planes, nigga, taking them field trips
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shut down retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' dues
Ain’t no excuse for my failures
My success, no apologies
All that I own
Absolute honesty
Keep it 100
But that’s what they all say
Pull up in drop coupes
Hopped in them V12’s
Went from them mixtapes, shutdown retail
Switchin' my line nigga, she hittin' my Twitter, fool
Niggas is sprung on pussy
Me, I’m just payin' duesLook
I'm lookin’ at these niggas like, "Fuck 'em all"
Sock a nigga then he quick to get his gun involved
Toss a nigga some work, that nigga runnin' off
Then leave these niggas to starve, they say you uninvolved
I see why niggas get money now and wander off
Not sayin’ that I condone, I'm sayin' it's fuckin' hard
Young niggas with inhibitions of livin' large
Road to riches in double digits on prison yards
Pit falls, brick walls but still I charge at high speed regardless of what I've seen
Chasin' my dream, money comin’ at odd schemes
Got the streets in my vein, that’s a poisonous I.V
They speakin' my name, I know they despise me for the status I’ve obtained and the places I fly free
They hesitate and this is what I see
'Cause before this rap shit, they know them triggers I squeezed
So fuck all you niggas that lies lead
'Cause I'm just waitin’ on the day you choose to try me
Until then, drop Benz in the breeze
Out in Vegas in the Phantom like a limo I-Z
At the Palms eatin' steak, no need for for I.D
Double shot of Hennessy
Meet my nigga Rob and he's chillin' with some bitches, early 20s, late teens
Pearly whites, pretty face, fat ass, in bikin
Look
We do it at rehab
My aim is to outweigh the painful days we had
Life after the rubbergloves and ski masks
Niggas kill they partners and bring yams to the repass
But still to this shit I pledge allegiance
You could get the fade, holla at me if you need that
I left the hood and gave a fuck about the feedback
'Cause I was once told you that you dont shit where you sleep at
You dumb nigga, this young nigga's on his way up
The world, chico
It's 'bout time they pay up
No more small potatoes for all them nights that we stayed up
Huggin' them blocks, them bullets bustin', they graze us
Run from them cops, they catch up, cuff us, and cage us
'Fore they get our laces, post bail, that's outrageous
Then bleed the block for more paper
Man, ten toes down, I won't ask for no favorsI got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
Look, TMC is my new shit
I don't make no excuses
Fly crip in my blueprint
Niggas talk but I do this
I gave a AR to my new bitch
I had a Rolex before music
Money talks, loud and clear
Niggas looking like two cents
So we could line them up and we could shoot shit
We could range Rover, Benz coupe shit
Turn a couple of zones into a few bricks
And turn a couple of bars into a new hit
New Louis bag, new Louis kicks
And my trunk right where my roof is
Nigga stay in style like I'm boostin'
How they say they fly when they flew shit
I got tats all on my neck, tats all on my face
Get 10 G's so up and I don't hop bout till I pay
I drink that Clicquot and that Ace
Smoke Kush weed and eat steak
She can't resist to fly crip
So she get wet when I get on stage
And yeah I dropped out in 10th Grade
But I fly first class on these planes
Never stand in line at my bank
All money In is incorporated
They say "Damn, Hussle you made it"
I said "No, you just think basic"
And if them niggas fly, then I'm a spaceship
I got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got that rag all on my left
Bank when I step
Tattoo on my neck, my face and all on my chest
What you gonna do next?
Take your main bitch and have sex
I keep a 40 on my in case a nigga trying to flex
So niggas stop with all that press, cause you ain't gonna do shit
I hear you talking loud, well nigga talk about my dick
And how your bitch swallow this
You go home and you kiss
But guess what you hater, you be kissing on my dick
No homo trick, she look at you like you a lick
She fuck with Cob Supreme 'cause I'm a fly ass young crip
I got Polo socks on my feet
Polo draws on my waist, Louis belt on my Levi's
And these diamonds be all on me
Diamonds on my neck, diamonds on my wrist
I look like a robbery but nigga that will be a risk
Ride around in that jag, I roll around in that range
But if a nigga walk we are still not the same
'Cause I got
I got a swag when I step
Blue rag to the left
All the girls know im the biz
I think I know what it is
It's fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'
I got this 40 on my waist, Louis suit case
And I'm tattooed on my neck, my chest, my face
Fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin', fly crippin'Don't be mad at me streets phased me gradually
Chose the grind but it wasn't all vanity
Court rooms and casualties it all came naturally
Always hoped I change the game for those after me
Gang of broken kids only hope to live
Stick together through this shit so that's what we did
I pray all the hundreds keep on coming in
We ain't playin' round with you nigga me and my niggas jumping in
Still passing, baby
Locked my brother up, couldn't face what happened
?
Take my slimmer of my weight when I'm in traffic
Made it out the mud I ain't adapted
You ain't really live that struggle you be rappin'
With that forty on my hip like it's in fashion
I just pray my mama love me through the madness
Paint the picture perfect twice as rich as urges
Hurry up and leave the block if you ain't making purchase
It's a long story i've been busy working
Dropped ten tapes and I ain't nick the surface
I like to think I gave the hood a different purpose cause I ain't never seen these type of niggas this encouraged
First seven figures I'll admit to splurging
I admit to breaking down when I spoke at your service
Natural born leader ain't no gettin' nervous
Ain't no planning ain't no thinking we just putting work in
Hunnid thousand cash make you feel important
Break bread with your team then you feel extorted
Gotta get that out your heart cause we can't afford it
Gave your word and a plan aboard it
Always plan a fortune, get my people out this land of corpses
Nipseyno young legends out of California
I'm tryna prove it
I'm getting better shit I'm so proven
I swear I still remember we we're losing
No girl but what we didn't make it through it
Real niggas feel the pain in the music
If you went and got it out that mud dawg I'm with you
I was playin keep away from my plug got my issue
If they catch me pour mud at my vigil
Ball hard I can't give her game but I was true to her
Lil brother yea those neighbors they gon' do to em
I might put on my chains on at the funeral
They come kill a nigga they make it look beautiful
My mama ain't too real living

Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there
Now I lay my strap down on the table
We the only ones from underneath who wasn’t able
She gon' hop up in the mix cause she ain’t living stable
We done got it up and going without the jumper cables
And now the block sit right on top the label
We can do it how you wanna, just be honest with me
I can’t fuck with none of these niggas, I can’t find it in me
Ain’t a nigga with more loyalty and honor than me, ahh
Now I lay my strap down on the table
I’ve been lost confused too fucked up in this world enabled
And I relied on you as distraction to compensate it
Self destruction don't explain it, it’s like drugs and I’m too faded
Can’t put love before this greatness
When I’m gone I ain’t celebrate this
Worked too hard on this foundation
To get caught up in your matrix
I got tired of speaking your language
You would smile to see my soul anguish
I’m just tryna change my location
When I drive it’s like you grow anxious, damn
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right there
That’s just how it go, when it come to love
That’s just how it go, when it come to war
Ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, ain’t shit fair, I was right thereThat’s exactly what I want it to sound like
400
IHussle on this beat
Aye, bitches love me 'cause I walk around like I’m the shit
Niggas hate me 'cause I pull up with they favorite bitch
Seen these niggas fallin’ off 'cause they can’t persist
Seen these niggas lose it all off a basic bitch
Marathon, gotta run 'til your paper thick
Slauson Ave to Sunset, we could race the whip
All white diamonds, that’s a racist wrist
Look, I made it out the 60’s, that’s amazing shit
See, once upon a time, I was on my grind
I wasn't from the Chi, but it was do or die
Police in disguise asking for a dime
Niggas barely getting by, me – I’m tryna shine
Voices in my head, I’m tryna mute at times
Keep fucking with this shit, you’ll be doing time
Frustration on my mind so I’m usually high
Bitches on my dick now 'cause I’m usually fly
AC blowin’ with my music high
Rims on my shit when I’m cruisin’ by
I hustle like no other, this a new design
Look at me now, I kept going nigga, you reclined
Rap money cool but it’s movie time
And you could hit the carpet with me, girl, if you a dime
Getting dough, friend or foe – time to choose a side
She like my style so much she start using mine
I really like what you’ve done to me
Your style, I love it, baby
I am so into you
You ride or die
It’s only you and me
Let's ride to the moon, baby
I’m so into you
Homies ain’t homies, bitches ain’t shit
Stay with that MediCal 'cause bitches get sick
Young niggas getting rich, we turn nothing into somethin'
I could turn kisses into fuckin'
I could turn my ex back to wifey
Yesterday she said she didn't like me
Ah, and then she come over
She know what it do, I bet she give me that cooch
We could bet that  crap out 
And before you roll the dice I’m the type that'll bareback
Snake eyes, 2-1, nigga, shoot somethin'
If she come to the crib, she better toot somethin'
Get it, I’m a fool with the money
I just might blow it on a honey
Homies telling me a young nigga got it
I’m like, "That’s cool, long as a young nigga profit"
I really like what you’ve done to me
Your style, I love it, baby
I am so into you
You ride or die
It’s only you and me
Let's ride to the moon, baby
I’m so into you
All money in, no money outIt's legal to kill the black people
It's legal kill black people
Ain't that some shit?
It's legal to kill unarmed black people
It's legal to kill unarmed black people
That's fucked up
That's fucked up
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
Fuck the police
50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryna buy a Benz and a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it
It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil' boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it
One Shot got life, Zimmerman got acquitted
Talkin' 'bout a carjackin', we talkin' 'bout a killin'
Wonder why we never have faith in the system
Look at young niggas like a waste of existence
And when we do make it, look at how they try to twist it
Become the world champ, and then y'all enlist us
Get rich off of rap, y'all search us for pistols
It's like it ain't no respect 'til we burn up the buildings
Could you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
Would you just accept if we murdered your children?
50 young niggas sellin' crack for a livin'
Tryna buy a Benz and a flat television
Single income and he tired of the feelin'
"Momma, I'm a man," gotta show her that he meant it
It's a cold ass world, gotta show 'em that he get it
Watch a good lil boy turn into a cold nigga
He ready to die just to show 'em that he wit' it
So he put it on his mind, gotta get it how you live it
Petey Whack got life, Zimmerman got acquitted
Talkin' 'bout a gun case, and we talkin' 'bout a killin'It's like 2 o'clock in the studio
Backed up on the leaks, man, my shit crasp
But I'm back at you niggas though, you know?
I guess this fifty five thousand
So we gon' do it like this
Uh, Hussle, nigga
One take too
Look, uh
Mac 11 on my dresser drawer
Model bitches like, “Nipsey, what’s the weapon for?"
Niggas tryna take, I give 'em nothin' less than war
So what’s understood there is no explanation for
Put the box in concrete, then put the safe in floor
Extra thick carpet, that's what we laid it for
Young niggas gettin' money's what I make it for
Play this out your Range Rover and Mercedes door
Uh
I graduated from havin' haters
Now I see it all as fake love, so don’t congratulate us
And thank god for my imagination
I seen the vision, I’m in it, and now I’m after greatness
I know that God got me so I practice patience
Most the time I look inside and find the answers waitin'
Been tryna change my life but it’s aggravating
Making the same mistakes twice, I'm shackled to Satan
So Let's make a toast to the real niggas
Self-made success, know how it feel, nigga
Uh, now raise your glass to the real women
You know the one who man in jail but she still with him
Out here on her own but she deal with it
So I'm gon' tip my S-dome 'cause I'm feeling ya
I represent that any means necessary
Chopper in the window pane, lifestyle legendary
Been treated a lot of ways, it was never fairly
So we gon' shoot before we march like February
And they don't like when I rap like that
They rather I talk about the crime that's always black on black
And say, "Neighborhood of sixty Crip," in every rap
So they can play my tape in court and try to lock me up for that
But I'm cool
Tell them judges, "Look, I'm never goin' back"
It's a marathon, nigga, run a lap
Uh
Fifty six thousand
All Money In, in
All Money In, in
No motherfuckin' money out, nigga
Alright, that's it, they good
You think I don't know that?
You know, what I know
How many times I been on the other end of that fuckin' phone?
Twenty six times
Ray, but you just got done saying you and Sonny Black are friends
You were, you know?
Donnie, I got sent for
In our thing, you get sent for
You go in alive, you come out dead
And it's your best friend that does it10 toes in these chuck t's
When it come down to it
Still getting more money, more bitches
More love than a nigga screaming fuck me
It's so beautiful, it's disgusting
When you figure it out, niggas wasn't all in
So them niggas is out
Shit hit the fan see what niggas about
I heard misery loves company
It's no lie, you get lonely at the top
It's a chance you can drop, so, they don't try
And I won't judge you, I know why
So don't shoot me down when I fly
On the road to the riches
It's a whole grip of niggas that will wreck they cars it won't rise, fuck it
Call some hoes up and roll this weed up
And turn the lights down and pour this drink up
My last shit sold out I'm bout to re'up
Tat on my neck, face, chest and sleeve
Where the cars are world I like foreign features
I get 10 for shows and 10 for features
I've been in the hood and on them beaches
I've been in the game and on them bleachers
Now I see my lane and the shit I speak on
Where I'm standing, motivate my people
In the ocean, blue range with nico
If I'm drinking champagne, it's probably clicquot
Bossa Nova, we should probably eat bro
Got a couple of zones but we gon probably need more
We gon probably need more
But first, let's eat bro
Order me a steak and rice another early morning, another late night
Doing 7 days a week, can you ever get to sleep?
That's 25/8 life oh, get money
Take flights, go for full throttle, no brake lights
Make all the bad bitches wanna play nice
And all the broke nigga wanna hate life
Yo badTurn me up some
Nips! Let's hustle

Posted at the Shell, leanin' on my shit
Bitches pullin' up we like a hundred somethin' thick
Dice game crackin', threw a hundred licks
Now a nigga gotta talk my shit
When I was lookin' for a pot to piss
Posted on the block with all my Crips
Thought a hundred racks was gettin' rich
Risk a hundred years to hit a lick
They said it take patience to get rich
But I always knew one day I would do it big, then I did
Was on my grind, it was my time
I ain't think twice, I paid that price and we did this, nigga
Reached every goal I actually set

Woah, I'm on that small, I need double d's
Lots of sisters and brothers so they never notice me
Nipsey!I dropped seven tapes and it was all the truth
Live my life just like a baller do
Meet a gang of girls and they all be cute
You can fall for me I can't fall for you
I'm in a CL-6 that's the baller Coupe
You fuck for cash you a prostitute
Go to school then girl I salute
And make a hunnid mill' what I'm 'bout to do
To knock my hustle ain't possible
Me kill you that's optional
Slauson ave I've made lots of moves
'Cause I'm a African that think like a Jew
I be doing me, watching you is my example of what not to do
My shoe strings stay Dodger blue
I had a hoop dream but then I caught the flu
'Cause the routine is still 
And you know I'm a do what I got to do
Picked up the sack, dropped the school
Went hard to the paint, bought some jewels
Switch up my thinking to the proper view
Hopped in this rap, paid all my dues
I was something like an Impala fool
I'm so LA, like a barbecue
These niggas talk a lot, but they wallets mute
I shop a lot, you know cars and shoes
When I hit the block, I still rock my jewel
But I ain't one of these niggas that got a lot to prove, nah
I got a lot to do
I wake up nigga to an awesome view
Way these labels tryna deal with rappers got me fuckin' mad like I'm watchin' roots!
Kunta, no no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
Yeah, haters call now they callin' harder
Truth flies same day departure
Played the bench until I made the starter
Used to play the ball but now I'm ballin' harder
Street nigga can't stay legit
Next check I get I might cop a brick
Keep a tool handy, getcha fixed
Asshole for life, it's kind of hard to switch
Follow follow my lead, I'm in front of the line
If I don't get it today, then I'm a get it with time
If I don't get it with rap, then I'm a get it with crime
Runnin' in yo' crib tryna hit her wit' nine
Two door Coupe, might cop that twice
Outside was mean, inside was nice
In the hood, I'm rollin', I ain't talkin' dice
Fully loaded choppa can't block ya' life
What I'm worth you can't hop the price, nigga
My advice: don't end up hurt, nigga
Play with me, I bet shit get real
I'm 10 deep with goons and they about that murk, nigga
I don't fuck with fuck niggas, I'm nothin' like 'em
Yeah the truth a trip, nigga, you wouldn't like 'em
These cars and tents, nigga, you wouldn't like 'em
All this shit I'm on, nigga, you wouldn't like' em
Kunta, no no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like me
I don't know no nigga like meYeah we know your used to putting work that's sold
Nigga and we seen your paper work your told
All these niggas either sniffin' glass or they livin' off the past
Where I'm blowing money fast with my bros
Lately I've been seeing niggas sell they soul
How you catch a case and bail out on parole
I been state to state gettin money on the road
And I had to reevaluate who I could talk to on the phone
Switch it up, spit the game pay attention you should listen up
Follow code and one day you gon' get rich as us
Seven digit street nigga that ain't rich enough
Forty million on the crib like that nigga puff
Niggas buying yachts niggas buying jets
Make me wanna buy the block just to reinvest
Know my young niggas catch it fore' it's nothin left
Bury me the realest ever did it yet
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hunnid one until the death
Even when I'm gone they'll see I never left
Looking at the whip like,  "glad I never quit"
Pass my niggas women thought we'd never hit
Stickin' to the script get rich and  never switch
All my role models doin' sentences
Yeah
Fuck each and every one of 'em
I fear none of 'em
Frank Lukas push his roof back in front of him
Leave a nigga toothless when it comes to the loot
I go stupid with the butt of the gun, know where I'm coming from?
North Philly where Frazier and Muhammad sparred
Last name Akbar they callin' all cop cars
When they pull you over, they might shoot you over
Movin now that we true men they know who we are
They took a kink from us, they X'd Malcom out
You kidding me? I did my own black history
Studied Illmatic raised the roof out
Yeah, that's the main reason why these other rappers can't get with me
Fuck em all, I hear a whistle know it's time to ball
Y'all niggas throwing fouls but y'all don't wanna brawl
How you going to mission with no vision
Fuck Stevie's like a sight
Look at Stevie's ambition
We hood niggas that did it
Different nigga now that my pops gone
Low tolerance promised he'll get popped on
Microwave the bullets sounding like popcorn
Grind heavy the cops come or the rocks gone
Same nigga 'cept with the time changed
When I couldn't get money I used to find ways
Countin' thousands up for cavvy in the hallway
It wasn't long til I figured out grind pays
We still in search of them bright days
Dark streets only light when police raid
When niggas stress out and let the shots off
 like a skillet, it'll pop off
I hit the ave and post with the uncut raw
Sacked it up and told niggas I had to 
Nothing fancy, protect myself with the 8 ball
It wasn't easy, I had to hustle on 
Bury me the realest that ever did it yet
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hunnid  one until the death
Even when I'm gone they'll see I never left
Looking at the whip like,  "glad I never quit"
Pass my niggas women thought we'd never hit
Stickin' to the script get rich and  never switch
All my role models doin' sentences
YeaLook
Don't ever talk about the shit I'm 'bout to do
Don't ever lie to hoes, I just tell the truth
Don't ever put the pussy on a pedestal
This money is the motive, everything after the revenue
I swear to God that's what you better do
Cause in this life it ain't no tellin' what's ahead of you
These niggas done went federal
From young reppable niggas killin' it's all sectional
Now this is the reality we wrestle with
Where every nigga down to die for what he represent
Where every murder is a mission rooted in revenge
You make it out alive in one piece you set precedent
And then you start accumulating presidents
You lookin' like a legend especially when your record spins
Then you pull up in a six with a set of twins
And like I never thought I'd see you in the set again
Please
I'm gettin' paid, but that ain't change nothin'
Look
I'm gettin' cheese, but that ain't change nothin'
That ain't change nothin' my nigga
Look
I'm gettin' paid, but that don't mean nothin'
Look
I'm gettin' cheese, but that don't mean nothin'
I swore to tell the world if I made it out
The truth about these LA streets and all what they about
The paranoid emotions when they stake us out
When we pull up thick in some foreign shit at the geisha house
The losses that we took when they raid the house
The bitches that I seen when I laid it out
The only important thing is the paper route
The motto I embody the prophecy as I play it out
Smilin' faces rockin' diamond bracelets
Murder cases that's probation when your pockets make ya
I'm stuntin' or something that cost a lot of paper
I ain't fuckin' with nothin' that don't look like a spaceship
And that's the realest shit I ever spoke
Pull up in the shopping center with a centerfold
My windows up, my ceilings closed
Chopper still on me if you didn't know
And at this point, just take it to the next level
Niggas they grindin' so hard
Came so far
Travel the world
Got all type of money
And this shit still don't stop nigga
All I see is new opportunities, new arises
Real young niggas came up from nothin'
This is how I liveCan't stop this money marathon but they gonna try regardless
When you go as hard as Hussle they gonna pay you homage
Add my jewellery up 100,000 dollars
Plus I got the pink slips to the foreign shit that I be drivin'
Built my road to riches over lack of options
Out the trunk of my blue cutlass with my back to Slauson
Now my car's fresh off the lot and hoes got low mileage
Flying out getting paid 10 thousand a show, I'm in
2A with my seat back with my window up
Thinking bout the funny niggas that done switched it up
We made some plans most of them stuck
So tell me one good reason I should give a fuck

People lie but my stats right and in my last life I was a flash light
Nah, I’m just sayin' though I'm that bright
It don't even make sense like a black light
How I came put the city on my back no niggas cosign
Guess I’m just that type

Bullets start flying by a nigga, that's a sick breeze
While I'm here, take a pic please
You know legends die young, rest in peace Prince and Pimp C
From the block to the big leagues, self-made millionaire, white America ain't pimp me

Step back for the increase
Hussle ain't got it mapped out? Don't offend me
Yeah, look

Choppers out 'case a nigga tryna come creep
Bitch tripping cause I'm always in the street
Bag of money in a Beemer on the back seat

Hoppin' out the Regal, burner with the full clip
Summertime, murder gangs going back to back
Fly crippin' so my belt cost half a stack
I’ve been ballin', nigga, reach, I'ma handle that
Back when me and F and J Stone was selling candle wax
I’m the motherfuckin' truth, nigga, that’s a fact
And if I fuck your baby mama, can you handle that?
Look, the West? Nigga, that’s a wrap
You ain’t eating with us, you gon' have the scraps
Struck out, nigga, every time you at the bat
Niggas can't compete with us with them type of stats
Niggas can't compete with us with these type of racks
Fiends tend to blow your beeper up for this type of crack
Yeah, niggas trying to get their license back
Me, I’m trying to get my lifers back
Niggas couldn’t keep the chopper on the rifle rack
I’m a driver and a shooter, still, in spite on that
Light bulb, hustle, look you might could rap
Nightclubs, I know a couple that we might could pack
Try and fail, go to jail, quick to wife a rat
Rhetorically I ask myself "What type of life is that?"
Nah, you knew better, but you settled
I stepped it up a level, double up on my endeavors
So I'm broke never, i’m a Rich Rollin' rebel
Clever as the devil, pull strings like Geppetto
I've been real from the get-go
You’re green like a gecko
When your name gain weight your ex hoes can’t let go
Hello? Hanging up when you say your name
Play it too much to not know the game
Heartbroken, Frank Ocean on that novocaine
You know this change, but I won’t explain, look
Nip the Crip that flipped the blueprint that Hova laid
Ten thousand cash, no tickets, no overlay
And I’ll be in your city with the bros today
Presidential car service with the motorcade
Road to the riches, now you know the way
Run this money marathon at a owner's pace
You ain't a real nigga without a goal to chase
And a yellow bone bitch with some toes to paint, oh

I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches
I like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitches, that like bitchesI'm different
Grind strenuous, cash out continuous
Mogul in the making, autonomous black businesses
Broken culture that we all lost niggas in
Elevated innovation over ignorance
I represent it
Suburban tinted, five of that's percentage
Closed cur but the Mac-11 muzzle vintage
Go flourish, double back and come and get your niggas
Pass the power to your people, it ain't nothing realer
Faced with this decision it's a funny feeling
Knowing when you tell the truth they gon' come and kill you
Knowing people need some proof, went and got the millions
Stressed a young nigga out but I'm so resilient
The champagne, Honda Civics, they was taking pictures
Young niggas in front the buildings tryna make a living
Or I just figured they was jealous cause we made it quicker
And never asked for no favors, nigga, look
Real shit you can mark my words
'85 Cutlass, I'll make my swerves
These ho niggas tryna take what's yours
Take a stand or have to take one first
Back him up, but only take one burst
With white chalk I'll make 'em paint your curb
Rest in peace, have 'em paint your shirt
If a nigga's tryna take my worth
But you know
My last white was 20 million
So familiar like Tookie Williams, I'm in the building
My conversation is cash money
I fly private, rarely do I have luggage
Riding through the ghetto, where I'm from, the kids love me
Every day I'm rocking jewels, I know they wanna touch me
Repercussions mandatory when you injure mine
Every time I step on the block my dick on the line
Burning like a candle in Versace sandals
My persona on the camera, that's just how it's handled
Put me in, coach, I'm going to the paint
Ran a couple two-a-days ad took me to the bank
Mark my words, I know you're broke, I see it in your face
Art Basel, twin chains, I spend it on the vase
US Marshals came to cut the gates
I'm Double M, I'm known to beat the case
Real shit you can mark my words
'85 Cutlass, I'll make my swerves
These ho niggas tryna take what's yours
Take a stand or have to take one first
Back him up, but only take one burst
With white chalk I'll make 'em paint your curb
Rest in peace, have 'em paint your shirt
If a nigga's tryna take my worth
But you know
My nigga Nipsey, from the mud to the marble
What's up, my nigga?
It ain't 100 million in the room
Shit, let's shoot for three
What's up?Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like it's China, I been makin' these real nigga moves
Uh, look
Swervin', I'm feelin' this shit
Brown liquor on my liver and shit
Fast life, still livin' and shit
Black leather suede ceilings and shit
Top floor, tall buildings and shit
Live by the model, lets get killed or get rich
Fly to islands just to chill with a bitch
I'm just a nigga that was real and that's it
With no regards to how you feel about shit, them German plates on my 6
I sleep light, but I dream big
I tend to talk less 'cause I seen shit
Stick to the script until the scene switch
I wrote this movie, 'get this money' is what the theme is
I'm smoking weed like a weed head
Mimosas by the oceans with the cheese eggs
Flickin ashes out my sunroof, victory 'cause real niggas in the lead here
Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like its China, I be makin' these real nigga moves
A steak every week, I keep it too street, you know I'ma do what I do
Wallet so plush, you know my stock's up, I be makin' these real nigga moves
I'm workin' 'til like 3:00 a.m., the most beloved nigga from the C.A., unh
We hit Mitchell & Ness in the P-A-D, it's back to L.A., let the V.A. speak
We at sachi bowl, saw B-H-E, that Perrier water, that's for me right there
No soda drinkin', french fries at the roller rink

Last time I seen him he was actin' all shady
C.L.S. taillights pass you all crazy, O-P-M the army, yeah, exactly like Baby
Except we ain't got no fundin' from Universal
And still gettin' cameos in the big commercials
Gimme somethin' to mix with this lil' purp
Light that up, keep it in the circle, you know
Smoke marijuana, watch cost a Honda and the crib got remarkable views
Eatin' downtown, look like its China, I be makin' these real nigga moves
A steak every week, I keep it too street, you know I'ma do what I do
Wallet so plush, you know my stock's up, I be makin' these real nigga moves

I ain’t had much but you gotta chase your dream
Wrote it all down in my spot in like ‘03
10 years later, big shout to my whole team
We gon fly to Africa, we gon stop in Rome first
Exchange a 100k, and then buy the whole store
And we buy the whole floor, fuck it I just want more
Look I got fans everywhere, we need a globe tour
And I need 100k in stock, that’s a low score
Bitches gotta talk less, fiends that'll hold more
Bank accounts with less tax, overseas on show floors
Foreign shit, steering wheels opposite like Tom Boys
Only real niggas, V12’s in my convoy
All black tint, bad bitches, Mardi Gras boy 
Take ya top off, I'll give you some beads ho
I could turn your block to a free flow
Half-court shot to a freethrow
Impossible is nothing, Nike flow
It’s all in yo mind, it’s cerebral
I smoke so much weed, I should read more
Made so much cash I don't need dough
I ate so much food that I feed more
So tired of this place, that I leave more
And when you this fly, nigga wings grow
Can’t call it cloud 9 til my team know
50 stores up, blowing racks in casinos
And I got Ginger with me
Grind hard til it benefit me
Shine hard, nigga literally
Only day ones and my killers with me
And them hoes like kill 'em Nipsey
You see me out shopping, they be like what’s poppin ay?

Got young niggas that's gonna shoot for me
Bad bitches that buy shoes for me
Versace this, I'm the shit, got the six, got yo bitch
I ain't cocky, I'm confident
So I don't really need no compliments
Million dollar deals, that's common sense
I might let a major label be a part of this
I had one shot, went hard for this
Went to war and got scars for this
Shootouts in all of my Slauson tip
So shout out to all of my accomplishments
Nigga, real jewelry no starter kit
Corporate cards that I'm shoppin' with
Type of broads that I'm spotted with
Type of respect only bosses get
Nigga want a verse, well I'ma charge a grip
'Less you a nigga that I started with
'Less you a nigga that's a part of this
California love, look I'm the heart of this
I got the realest flow, I say the hardest shit
No co-signs, do the smartest bids
Started from the bottom, I ain't borrow shit
Self-made young nigga like Ross and 'em
And I got the six, got yo bitch
I ain't cocky I'm confident
You won't stop me, I'm competent
So I don't really need no compliments
Million dollar deals, that's common sense
I might let a major label be a part of this, nigga
Be a part of this, if not fuck y'all, give me all my chips
Oh I'm gone keep gettin' cash, I'm gone fuck these hoes later

Takin' care of my fam, 'cause all the money don't make us
Smilin' all on you niggas, shinin' like I'm Las Vegas
Next time you in church, say a prayer for yo hatersAll that
Yea, but really
I just got this dough in my pocket, the hoes that be jockin'
This weight on my shoulder, all these clothes in my closet
V12 engines, beautiful women
This life is a blast nigga when you the one winnin'
Liquor in my kidneys, yac when I’m sippin'
Black Escalade, with all of my niggas
Calls from them prisons, from careless decisions
Tryin' to upgrade yo livin', tryna spin off yo pivot
I relate though my nigga, so I shoot you that green dot
We fucking these bitches, 2013 Aaliyahs
We fly to these countries in 501 Levi’s
I’m so west side nigga, arriba arriba
These niggas be hatin', but really I see why
Hundred a show, so gas up the G5
That’s one of my goals nigga, know I complete mine
I think it, I do it
It’s part of my design
Yea, in a hotel suite, with a famous freak
Yea, told her do her thing, she ain’t even blink
Uh, took her off her feet, put her on that sink
Aye, everything by choice, but she came for me
Look, so I got that flight you should probably chief
Yea, shots of Patron make yo body weak
Look, and I ain't gon stop til we fuck up yo sheets
Look, then I wake you up and just fuck up yo sleep
Young nigga with no conscience, corporate cards in my wallet
Bitches tell me I’m awesome, I’m like duh bitch, I’m on Slauson
Life’s short, there’s no promise
Party hard like New Orleans
Crack a pint and then pour it, but I don’t ever start snoring
Foot to gas, I keep floorin'
Stop lookin', that could be yours
I just wrote a fuckin' book it's the taking  money, thesaurus
All I know is get more, all I know is just flourish
Started off on that porridge
Now it's shrimp tempura
Crab and lobster on Collins
Niggas all skipped college
Ended up as them bosses, all I know is we poppin'
All I know is I got it
TMC, that’s my logic
Marathon, ain’t no stoppin'
That’s the way I get all this
Los Angeles royal shit, county jail Top Ram shit
Court tank, gang brawl shit
Smoking, smellin like dog shit
Have you feeling like aw shit, I gotta go home, I gotta get up out
Then you scratch yo head, tryna find a route, you gotta figure it out
Gotta buy a Benz, buy a house
Stay confident while you try it out
Really do this type of shit that these rappin niggas be lyin bout
Be lyin bout, they trickin hoes, they flyin out
Bitch just call me like come through
I’m like yea boo, I’m bout to wear you out
Yea, in a hotel suite, with a famous freak
Yea, told her do her thing, she ain’t even blink
Uh, took her off her feet, put her on that sink
Aye, everything by choice, but she came for me
Look, so I got that flight we should probably chief
Yea, shots of Patron make yo body weak
Look, and I ain’t gon stop til we fuck up yo sheets
Look, then I wake you up and just fuck up yo sleep
All money in, no money outNo punches
Look
Bounce back off every loss like a real nigga
Handle business like a man, I'll make a deal with you
Loyalty for loyalty, I keep it real with you
You go to war, then I'm gonna kill with you
Married to the streets, ask me why I'm still with her
Asghedom, it’s obvious I’m a real nigga
Around the corner it's a dozen niggas still trippin'
They'll still kill you if you still slippin'
Look, I put curtains on my rear windshield
My bitch bad but my wrist on chill
My bitch bad, man, that bitch got skills
She 5'11 rockin' 6 inch heels
She my Excedrin in this sick ass world
She probably make a stray bitch toes curl
She used to be in rich nigga retail
But money's my only fetish with my rich ass self
Hussle, I know y'all hating but I wish y'all well
I'm eating steak, crackin' Crip leg shells
I'm gettin' cake, let the champagne spill
It's either participate or your bitch ass fail, nigga
I was lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
I couldn't chase this dream for long, I had to catch it
I been ten toes down, I'm out chea, lookin' back tha's how I got here
'Cause even when I slept in the gutter, I stared at the sky
Uh, yuh, look
Young niggas fuckin' bitches, gettin' dope money
745, gold chain, rope money
Was every man for himself when you was broke, bummy
You make it happen, niggas actin' like you owe somethin'
My nigga, I just wanna let you know somethin'
The clock tickin', gotta get it and devote somethin'
The transition and legitimize the flow of it
It's just a given that these folks comin'
Look, I knew some niggas that was killers and these hoes loved 'em
Was gettin' money 'til some other killers told on 'em
The whole city and they business they was known for
A string of bank robberies, was beastin' for a whole summer
It ain't no hall of fame, it's over then they don't love you
Ain't no arenas hangin' jerseys with your old numbers
You gotta get what you can get and make the most of it
You beat the odds then you grow from it, look
I was lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
I couldn't chase this dream for long, I had to catch it
I been ten toes down, I'm out chea, lookin' back that's how I got here
'Cause even when I slept in the gutter, I stared at the sky
Ayy, look
Let's get it straight, these niggas fake
It's nothin' though, we gettin' cake
My mornings early, my nights is late
It's all dollar signs in on my license plate
Y'all niggas strugglin', my life is great
You free stylin' your life, I write my fate
I play to win 'cause life's a game
Just put your all in this music and your life will change
It's what I told myself, that's what I showed myself
It's a cold and lonely road, you gotta go for self
I meditated 'cause I knew I had to know myself
Said 600 Benz, this is what I owe myself
And worldwide recognition, now my flow is known
In and out the States, pay me just to show my face
Bottle after bottle, empty out the case
Hip-hop, empty out the safe
Hussle
I was lookin' at the world through rose-colored glasses
I couldn't chase this dream for long, I had to catch it
I been ten toes down, I'm out chea, lookin' back that's how I got here
'Cause even when I slept in the gutter, I stared at the skyMake a million cash 'fore you flatline
Make a master plan watch it backfire
Burn it all down then collect the ashes
Build it back, respect ya passion
Witness to some shit that you shouldn't see
Whisper to yourself what you wouldn't be
Victim to the block where your mama moved, now your mind-state is I'mma do what I got to do
It's really quite logical, if you was me you wouldn't shoot at them if they just shot at you?
No trust funds but my daughter do, first generation that'll start with loot
My first record deal probably saved my life
So shout out to my nigga Draws and Jonny Shipes
My roll dog doing 12 now, gotta turn this shit to heaven cause we hell bound
Hard for y'all to fathom that we came from that
Sittin in the spot we was shaving crack
Navy blue chucks, my Mercedes black
Gave it all I got then it gave it back
30 niggas grinding on the same street
Thousand niggas dead from the same beef
Money to be made but it get risky
Inside job if it look fishy
Niggas playin' foul tryna play it down
Say that they gon' kill him if he stay around
Say that they gon' book him they just need a witness
Me I'm tryna make a exit all this politicking
Got my mind drifting, time ticking, death is in the air I'm tryna bound over my visit
Shit rough still ride wit it, rob different that's how I did it
You shouldYeah
So motherfucking hood
It's your uncle Snoop D O Double G
Oh weee
You know how we do it on the west coast
West west yo, diggy diggy diggy diggit yo
It's got a hold on me
The streets won't let me go
I'm in love
It takes it's toll on me
When I try to leave it alone
I can't say no to the gangsta's life
Gotta live a gangstas life
Gangstas life 
Look, what's up motherfuckers it's ya boy Nipsey Hussle
The neighbor banger that'll make the dope double
Block duck a cop cause yeah I'm all that
I made it out of haters try to see me fall back
I was once told that everything glittering is not gold
And money over bitches is the motto
Still some of these suckers think I owe him a dollar or a dime
I'm a product of my grind, fuck is on your mind
When you talk I don't listen cause a lot of niggas lie
Rule 1 gotta get gotta flip gotta find your position while you in a south central state of mind
Another Nip Hussle you will never find
Take a look into my eyes see I forever shine
They should'nt showed me that, true niggas shouldn't have told me that
The streets they know they homies they always try to hold me back
Give me a pen and a pad plus some Gin and a half
Put the clip in the mag, put the zip in the bag
Eastside rollin in an 6 deuce rag
Don't be slippin, cripping, we will get you fast
Streets be calling, see sawing
Never stalling, you hauling
Play calling, freefalling
Say it with me nephew, we balling
Get a zone, hit it, hit it get it on
Yes indeed the capital S-N Double O-P
Bin doing doing this gangsta shit since 83
Back in the LBC
Check my fouls nigga check my pedigree
Next to homie big D, nigga letter C
Another Snoop Dogg there will never be
Take my eyes have a look and you will never see
You should'nt have showed me that
You nigga's shouldn't have told me that
The streets they know they homies they always try to hold me back
Look, Look
I got 20 thousand dollars in my blue dickie pockets
Up at Fox Hill shoppin' rolex same tocking or ticking
They slipping we different bitches
6 0’s on my checks and the Crenshaw district
On lock, won't stop, big chain, big watch
Big rims, 3 piece leather seats, no top
Come through the block drive slow
Don't stop, niggas whisper don't talk
Cause they know they get by
From the bottom to the top
I done told ya nigga
Self made getting paid like I'm supposed to nigga
Now the hating is contagious and the only prescription is to load up a clip and give the nigga the business
It happens everyday just for instance
No weapons and no witness that means no conviction
While I'm mixing my patrone in my kitchen
Reminiscing before I make my transition
HUSSLEI'm tryna go down, down as a great
Every night I get, on my knees and pray
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah
Legendary moves, leader of my crew
Heavy is the head that wear the crown, that shit true
Do it like Nip Hussle, that's to fill some big shoes
And what good is excuses when the fuckin' rent's due?
Smokin' on this indo, run away from my pain
Rosemary on my temples, heard that's good for migraines
Solo in my Benzo, exit off the highway
Solitary thoughts like how to reinvest my side change
I'm tryna go down, down as a great
Every night I get, on my knees and pray
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah
I'm tryna go down, down as a legend
Every night I ask God for the blessin'
That I will go down, yeah
I will go down, yeah
So many niggas doin' time, who are you and I?
To play with it is a blessin', so reach for the sky
Pick up Shady off the block and we'll smoke and drive
Politickin' on the block to make it multiply
Keep some bitches on the team from the other side
Keep at least a pound of green, mothafuckin' right
30 hours in the spot, goin' overtime
Then we pull up to the Fox and go hold it down
You know this life, it got a cold design
How you go from eatin' lobster tails at Ocean Prime
To chain to a smoker and throat on the line
But when them gates close, keep an open mind
It ain't a force in this world like the focused drive
You gotta focus on yourself like an only child
You make your dream realer, and you make your team better
You wake your game up, and you make your scheme better
They say this time, this time
Won't be like the last time
But this time, this time
I'ma do it like my last time
I'ma go hard, my nigga
Put my name in the stars, my nigga
But I gotta pray to God, my nigga
That I will go down
Until we legendary, yeah
'Til we legendary
We legendary, yeah
Who don't wanna be legendary? Yeah
Wanna be.... legendary, legendary, yeah
I wanna be legendary
I'm just tryna go down, I'm just tryna go down, I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
And be a legend in my town
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
I'm just tryna go down
And be a legend in my townLook
On the road to riches
My car fast, my bitches bad
My locs on, my beat thump, my pistol stashed
It's transition, now it ain't no looking back
My bro home, my daughter straight, now what mo' can a nigga ask?
How it's looking? I'm gone keep getting cash
Cause I'm like that Rolex second hand behind the crystal glass
I keep moving, keep hustling till I see improvement
I know that I can't win them all, but I can't keep losing
What I used to tell myself when life seemed useless
When it felt like if I was to change it'd be for music
When Pac showed us that the pain we felt was not exclusive
Was in the hood, but Shawn Carter showed us no excuses
Now kids tell me I'm the reason that they finished school
And if it wasn't for The Marathon, they wouldn't have made it through it
All on Twitter like, nigga gone and drop your new shit
I'm just taking the time to make the proper use of my influence
A couple hundred thousand cash, a few haters
Lawyer fees for new cases, and a box of blunts later, I give you
The Streets Illustrated, latest issue
The update on my state of mind, the everything I been through
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging at what you can do
Theme music for young hustlers to get they ends to
To prove to every young nigga banging of what you can do
My
Beat banging
Gold chain swanging
And all money in, still the song that I'm singing, I'm on
Can't fade him, fate can't change him
Still screaming fuck a bitch, and these bitches can't blame him
It's true
When you in the game, to these hoes can't play him
Respect a nigga pimpin' cause they know
He don't save them, that's right
Can't brake him cause these niggas ain't making
Still try with all they might, but I rebuke you Satan
Let's prayLook, I'm like, "Ooh, girl, what's your name?"
I got this cash
I know a place that we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades
I've been goin' hard so long without takin' no breaks
Feels so right, I booked two flights, we leave tonight, and get away
It's not about no chase, 'cause for your pussy I won't pay
But I'm inspired and refreshed by somethin' beautiful with brains
We both have broken hearts so it's alright to love again
'Cause when you let go of your pride, you'll find a lesson in your pain
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, girl, put your guard down
Put your guard down, put your guard down
And that's when the-and that's when the guitar come in
Put your guard down
You got to, you know?
Or you can't be mad if youll never feel that feeling again!
Look, I'm like, "Ooh, girl, what's your name?"
I got this cash
I know a place that we can go and trick off on someone of ten Bulgari Shades
That's Harrods in London
Like twenty racks, you know?
Foolish hoes, uh-huh
And I got like sixty buck too
That's 'cause the marathon continues, nigga
Get the breathin' right
Yuh
That made her smile but she said, "Boy, don't even play
I got two jobs, I go to school, I got responsibilities
But I kinda like that type of fly shit that you say
So if you give me yo number, I might call you up one day
And by the way, I know that game you play
With all your money and your fame
But to me it don't mean a thing
So, just take a seat, don't introduce me to Nipsey
'Cause what good is the hood if its no engine underneath?"
And that kinda fucked me up, it did
That's true
So I took a seat, took off all my jewelry
Put my blunt out, took my hat off
And took two shots of that coconut Cîroc
And bring some of that pineapple juiceCome take a walk in my shoes
Just some young niggas makin' millionare moves
Everything to gain we ain't got nothin' to lose
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yup 
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do look
Wake up early in the morning on me
Go to sleep by myself and I ain't lonely homie
I'm a boss and I need space to calculate my plans
Ain't got no time for silly bitches that don't understand
Hit the Gucci store, spend a couple racks
Memories in case I catch a case and don't come back
Real niggas always take it, we don't ever ask
And live it up when we get it, cause it never last
Street life is like sand in the hour glass
And we is not the niggas watching hours pass
Road to riches 500 horse power fast
V-12 visions young nigga never fount in class
Pull up on the block and I'll be front and center
Unless of course a nigga gone until November
Gettin' money that's the only thing on my agenda
Now put your foot up in my shoe if you think I'm pretendin'
Come take a walk in my shoes
Just some young niggas makin' millionare moves
Everything to gain we ain't got nothin' to lose
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yup 
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do look
Now comin' up in this world they said I couldn't be shit
Cause a copped a couple pills and I flipped a couple zips
I'm rich of cocaine like I never touched a brick
But why they gettin' mad at how I make my money flip
Doin' outta town transactions, with my main man
Hope to reach home by Mother's Day was the game plan
When it's a drought down south you know how that go
And the packs are ???? so it's movin' that slow
I'm not one of them d-boys on the corna
Instead I'm in the Bentley smoking on marijuana
Money got me wit a bad case of insomnia
Yea, so I can't sleep, don't grind, don't eat
It's my motto, and that's what I follow
And ain't nothin' wrong with gettin' the money pronto
That's some advice for ya niggas that do not know
And soaking up this game, ya see the guap grow
Come take a walk in my shoes
Just some young niggas makin' millionare moves
Everything to gain we ain't got nothin' to lose
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yea 
Gotta hustle gotta grind yup 
If you tryna get money nigga this is what ya do look
Stay down city, yea
You gotta stay off in the trap till a nigga make a killin'
It don't matter what he dealin'
Cause the money spend the same
Once it all stack up, then ask me how I'm feelin'
Addin' up expenses, a luxury tax
A 40 inch gold chain and some brand new demin
You don't see how he do, starin' in my rearview
Speedin' in the lane, tryna feel what the gears do
Take a walk in my 10.5's
And you'll see what he did just to get at the cash
Real niggas take risks just to fill up rubber bands
With them big face Benjamins, you don't know the half, and
We don't ever ask, we just go hard and smash
Stay in love with lifestyle, it's far from a fad
And I'm far from a class, but I'm still doin' math nigga
I'm rich and infamous, don't care what the judge figuresAll Money In 
Yuh, real shit
Cookin' Soul
A million, a million-million, a million
A million, a million-million, a million
I got my mind on a million 'fore I turn 26
But that's just what it costs for that condo at the Ritz
I got this European belt , European bitch
Ever seen an African in a European whip?
I got my top off in traffic playin' this, got 'em pissed
Police hot 'cause my operations legit, suck my dick
All my life they've been shootin', thank god they miss
I'm convinced that I'm here for a reason, it don't make sense, how they miss?
All my niggas is gone, but I still exist 
So I got on my knees and I told him this 
One in a million, a million-million, a million
That's real talk
One in a million, a million-million, a million
We made it
I got my first hundred thousand 'fore I turned 22
And then I went to jail for some shit I did not do
Them niggas think it's rap, huh, 'til bullets make 'em back up
Know I'm in them movies, bro, but I am not no actor
Way before these contracts, I knew I was all that
Bet she say Nip Hussle if you ask her where that bomb at
She don't even smoke weed, she's just high off contact 
Way before I launched that I understood the concept
Got it from my bro, bro, never drove a six-four
Used to push that Cut, dawg, but now I drive that Benzo
I don't got no girlfriend 'cause, baby, I'm against those
We say that we just friends, but really know that is one in a
A million-million, a million
A million, a million-million

Please don't start with us
Sound of gunshots charge me up
Come through once a week like the garbage truck
This some thousand dollar chains with the carbon clutch
Quarter million dollar car with the driver cause
Everything I do done bossed up
Disrespectful and arrogant but who gon' stop us?
Rich nigga off the block, don't block us
Rap dreams disappeared and that 6-0 pop up
See most niggas in this life get locked up
Lost inside the system pull a white man's stock up
Only difference is, I picked hip-hop up
And this why they still can't stop us
Y'all niggas ain't hard enough
Y'all niggas ain't hard enough
Niggas ain't as hard as us
My young'n actin', finna charge him up
Gotta drop somethin' to be a part of us
The 40. tore the target up
We was kids tearing party's up
Yeah, the suckers know how far we up
The smokers know how far we've come
These niggas ain't known for parking nothin'
Theyain't follow niggas, cars or nothin'
30 or they chargin' for me
And you ain't pluck me, where your shooters at?
Running marathons around your goofy ass
Pull up to the necklace, I be reckless, real shooter gang
'Fore I 'buy the nookie K ya gotta let me shoot the K
Told my mama "nothing" when she ask me what I do today
Modified G-lock converted to a fully thang
Had to give twin 10 bands the way he do his thing
Shoestring around a stupid thang

I'ma grind, that's my motto 'til I get it
Full time, if you follow my commitment
You'll shine, nigga, that's a promise, make a killin'

Built this shit up from nothin', congratulations, you did it

Hussle in Crenshaw is like O'shea in a Sox Hat
Classic L.A., nigga, stay out my way, nigga
We ain't the same nigga, simple and plain
From reputation in these streets to where you sit on your plane
What you did for your fame?
How much you paid for your chains?
Tryna kick it with the Crips so he can say that he bang
You know he ain't from the gang, that nigga playin' with flames
Got a hunnid young niggas still dealin' with pain
Put a hole in your brain just for claimin' the fame

I’m ashamed when I say it, but, shit, a spade is a spade
And me? My transition got me showered in praise
From the streets to the stage, to changin' the game
International Nip Hussle, the current exchange

Real certified nigga get respect where I'm from

Murder scene, the routine ain't new to you
Switch cars, double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate where they niggas at
Some niggas need a bullet before they learn they lesson
You still ain't got your gun, you ain't got the message

Slauson Ave
All money in, no money out
No need to hate me, I’m supposed to be fly
You supposed to see my name up in lights
All money in, no money out that’s my life
Since you’d rather hate than show me love
I started on the block, then I rose to the top
Took some dollars out my stash, then I froze up my watch
These niggas got the nerve to be mad ‘cause I’m poppin’
Knowin’ damn well I’m on Crenshaw and Slauson
If they want, they can holler, that’s if they want problems
But they don’t cause they frauds, I’m the truth like Iver-
Son these niggas like they fathers
I’m walkin’ out the bank, and I just made a deposit
It’s the second this week, both for a hundred-thousand
Dollars, I’m the definition of a baller
Young fresh nigga no high school diploma, no college
Still my future lookin’ brighter than the lights on my impala
I’ma dog to these bitches, I don’t kiss her, I don’t call her
I’ma kick her out tonight, and I’m not gonna miss her tomorrow
On my mama, I tell her, “Look, I got my own problems
Plus I’m married to the game and I’m all about my dollars”
No need to hate me, I’m supposed to be fly
You supposed to see my name up in lights
All money in, no money out that’s my life
Since you’d rather hate than show me love
I know what you think, you prolly think this shit easy
I can hear you talkin’, hear you talkin’ so greasy
Fuck what you say, ‘cause this rap shit feeds me
Still Sixties on the wall, in all blue graffiti
I never fall, I never fail, and if I do
I bounce back and I prevail times two, mind you
I’m only twenty-two when I was fresh outta jail
Damn near lost my deal, but a nigga's still here
Still fear no man Sincere, no scam
No old school pictures with police shakin’ hands
Always fought, never ran
Always bust, never jam
Never told on no niggas to advance my stance
Some niggas left it up to chance, I had to plot my plan
On the road to the riches and extensive cash
Two thousand on the jeans, I pop expensive tags
And I’m dumpin’ out kush, that’s expensive ash
No need to hate me, I’m supposed to be fly
You supposed to see my name up in lights
All money in, no money out that’s my life
Since you’d rather hate than show me love
They tell you I was G’d up
How I roll through life with my feet up
You can hate it, do you when you see us
But you ain’t like me
They tell you I was G’d up
M.O.B. but the hoes don’t believe us
‘Cause the dudes like you, you do want to be us
But you ain’t like meBaby on the way then I caught my case
I went on the run and gave myself some time to think
Sitting in my cell, all I did was pray
Call home once a week and tell my people I'm okay
Ask me if I'm stressing I say hell naw I'm straight
But you can tell the difference cause it's written on my face
I've been working out, I've been gaining weight
I been having dreams about the day they crack the gate
Ain't send me no mail, pregnant with my baby girl
Planned to take over the world I just ended up in jail
Writing down my plans hoping I don't hit the pen
Drop a thousand on my books and trust me I'll be back again
 /x2
Shit ain't looking good, still I keep the faith
Sittin' in this county jail tryna fight my case
Running through these fades, I just miss my daughter face
They bring me out my cell sixty minutes everyday
Back and forth to court, bank on niggas in these tanks
Laughin with my homies bout them days when we was raised
You only down the street but seem so far away
As I'm sitting in this county jail tryna fight my caseHow to put it together?
How to say it right
Yo, yo, Ralo
Han, look
I'm like
Follow my steps, and you see what I'm bout
I keep that money coming in and never going out
You wanna fuck a fly nigga that you heard about
I beat that pussy up until it's watered down
She call me once a day to see if I'm around
But 9 times out of 10 I'm probably out of town
I told you ease up you more persistent now
I'm fronting though cuz if you stopped I'd probably miss the sound
Somewhere in between us it's attraction and I see that
You make me wanna make you tat my name up on your cleavage
I know it's just a song but when it stop I'm still gon' mean it
Sent your picture to my ex, told her this is why I'm leaving look
Couple stacks in my pocket and I'm fiending
To down a glass of Reisling and go blow it at Neiman's
Hop in the coupe I know that ass will fill my seats in
Something decent then ride to the remix
Han, Hussle
How to put it together?
How to say it right
Now I was driving down Wilshire
Just left the label
Lit my Swisher Sweet then we made a left on Rodeo
Life is beautiful if I might say so
I live it unrestricted, it ain't a place that I can't go
Gyu Kaku, hot shots and cold fish
Pints of dolce and coconut Ciroc fifths
Living drama free, Roosevelt cabana suites
TMZ questions me about my strands of weed
I like to vacation on Miami beach
Couple homies from the set, some Atlanta freaks
Used to have them pounds cheap in 2003
Most of the niggas from back then in penitentiaries
And now they see me on they TV like "how can it be?"
It's complicated how I made it like Avril Lavigne
That's why they rooting for me, I'm speaking what they think
Without no pieces I could show you how to build a dream
Hussle, Hussle, Hussle
How to put it together?
How to say it rightLook, All Money In what I been bout'
Since Fifth Ave on a Scwhinn out
In too deep had to swim out
But ain't nothin sweet but the penthouse
Droptop Benz on the ten now
Dropped green dots to the pen now
I came up but I been down
Cause I standup nigga when they sit down
And I gas on niggas in the six now
And I built my lane in a brick pile
Not a broke real nigga or a rich clown
And I coach lil niggas in the mix now
Got em thinkin' pro tools 'stead of pistols
And I train these bitches like a pit now
Every time that I pull up at the Ritz now
They be like young hussle you the shit now
It's amazing to niggas how I get down
But it's crazy to me that I exist still
Cause the maze in my city leave you crazy and dizzy
Cause you either doing life or get chipped now
Lot of ghosts in my pics now
It ain't souls occupy the obyss now
Tryna cry for em it don't drip down
Cause when you deep in the shit it'll get foul look
I just ball like I sposed' to
Quarter mill when I roll through
Got the game from the old school
Focused on break no rules
Operate on my own truth
I've been making my own moves
I keep hearing this game say
You could be the one if you so choose X2Mr. Untouchable
Ain't nobody fuckin' with these
You know I'm unfadeable
That's the reason why I'm out on these streets
'Cause I'm a bonafide gangsta 
Hustla 
I never been a mark ass buster
Haters, how you love that?
Crush 'em out that bulletproof, 740 Levi
Tipped a hundred dollars when the valet grabbed my keys
I'm runnin' through this money like these hundreds is adidas
They hatin' and we see why
We riders and we fly
You niggas is neither, you know the procedure
Hustle 'til we run out and then count cash and re-up
High 'til we die so it's motherfuckin' detox
The only thing we run is Louis belts through our Levi's
Catch me at the function, hoppin' out dumb thick
All these hoes wanna fuck but all I got is one dick
Expense, one more chance, all I need is one Nip
And all my competition on some I can't even front shit
You the one and I see what this become
They wavin' their white flag and I'm still bussin' my gun
No surrender, no retreat, my nigga, I got to eat
And keep thousand dollar sneakers on my feet

Haters, how you love that?
Uh, listen, look
Cops can't touch a nigga
Never been a sucka nigga
Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga
All money, money getter
All I really care about is the women in my kitchen
Foldin' clothes, washin' dishes, got me through them cold Decembers
Told 'em it'd be better days, so that explains the shit I'm into
I kept my word but details is confidential
Not too many niggas have survived the type of shit I've been through
And even less is this nice on an instrumental
Minus the pencil, just the info
They tell me that it's all a mind game, so I play this shit mental
They see the platinum plates and they assume that it's a rental
'Cause his album's yet to drop so how he pull up in a Benzo?
Drop the top, bet the bitch got crop
Let it blow in the wind on a roll, don't stop
Yah, yah, the next stop will be the block
Grab a fat stack of weed, then we hopped on a yacht
Yah
Well, alright, yah
Meet Mr. Untouchable
Blowin' that bubba kush out the sunroof
Let it burn like 151 proof, errh
They say some fools can and some fools can't
So you wish you can niggas can take this to the bank
Nipsey Hussle and Kokane
Putting paint where it ain't
Mr. Untouchable

Niggas still talking bad but they got they whole swag from me
And I wish a nigga would try and pass on me
AR-15 in a damier bag homie
Im getting racks, I ain't tryna make a rap homie
I fuck with who I fuck with and that's that homie 
100 thousand on my chain and piece
Bitches love to see you shine and I aim to
Please
This world turned a nigga violent but I came in peace
And keep it real until I kill this game, I just ain't complete
She ain't gone make it to the suite if she ain't a freak
Get crackin' in the backseat so she ain't for me
She tried to hit me that wait and see
Told her hope out and get a blunt then I got in the breeze
That type of shit that make me laugh brody
And I ain't met a bitch yet that can swag on me
Mascara tracks but she asked for em
Now I just home she got some cab money
HOOK
Now am I out here on my grind? that's fasho
Mind on my money, seven days twenty-fo

Get everything you want then go back and get some mo
Can you relate? just let me know
If you ain't afraid of heights, meet me on the top floor here I go
Look
Now two times for these pink slips
And all these bossy ass deals that we inked in
And ain't no playing with me, I got a 80/20
That mean my shit sell any they gon pay me plenty
It's strictly business in this game, still they faking friendly
Don't let em take advantage of you and it make em envy
Got it so a rap nigga never make a millie
With Nipsey though a middle man'll never make a penny 
I'm going hard like I'm 'posed to
And I ain't hanging out with money, that's what hoes do
We poppin' Clicquot at the condo with the cold view
From hanging out the window poppin' pistols out the old school
And I ain't blessing near nigga, kill ya own food
Sacrfice your own years, pay ya own dues
Sell ya own pounds, buy ya own Pro Tools
Do it like I did it, drop your nuts and make your own moves

Wasn’t hopping out the bed, cause I was sleeping on the floor
Back then y'all was sleeping on the flow
Used to get it on the block I had to keep it on the low
My cash grow like pinnochio’s nose
Bulletproof, seven series, yeah we set em on fours
Out of every new nigga I’m the one the city chose
Now can’t a muthafucker knock me out my zone, and that's why
And when they see me, me they like, like, like, like, like. 
I make the girls go  go, go, go, go
And when I step in they see me they like, like, like, like. 
I make the girls go  go, go

Hottest on the West, Dollars to invest
Ex fella, still I got your kids college on my neck
They said it wouldn’t work, cause I'mma rider from the set
But being you pays on, you should try it for yourself
And that's why
We’re standing on the couches, lighting up kush blunts
I'm the type of nigga that's gon’ take it if she look once
You the typa nigga that she gon’ have waiting for 2 months
For your head first base, I done scored 2 runs
Now ask some questions to clarify your view homes
First one being: “what type of shit is you on?”
It ain't my fault your girl got to choose home’s
Just blame it on the yellow gold Roley with the blue stones
So if you don’t need no help cause your feeling yourself somebody say

It don't make sense not to
Look, I be hoppin' on stages
Drinkin' champagne with a flock of bad bitches and some niggas I was raised with
How every step the topic of they conversation?
Buncha miserable ass broke niggas, jealous 'cause we made it
Young, rich, and famous plus I'm handsome and I'm faded
I'm just climbin' up this ladder that my swagger has created it
My intelligence has got them so intimidated
Really thought that I would listen to that bullshit you was sayin'?
Ride solo in my two-door with my top off if the tag
Ain't marathon, that Crenshaw crewneck, is a knock-off
When we started, he pinned us
No label ain't gon' stop us, I'm in Rothen off of Slauson
I made all my partners profit, look
I'm tatted from my face to my foot
So my body read like a good book
And, honestly, that fire weed keep my mind cooked
Takin' trips type of shit, usually keep a dime hooked
Pussy super good, go that sleepin' side grip
Ass pokin' out them pockets with that she is fly stitch
I'd rather be your nigga, she'd rather be my bitch
But no emotions 'cause we both is busy focused on the grip
Real shit, look
Niggas better understand this
I ain't doin' no favors, I ain't givin' out shit
I'm out here on my ten toes, nigga, no split
And if you don't like it, you can suck my dick

Black tint, presidential, with the AMG Kit
Always had a way with women
They say lifes a bitch, so I ain't mad
They just mad cause my lifes the shit

Blue '85 Cutlass, everybody knows Nipsey
Hanging out the window, swanging, rolling up endo
Streets detrimental, we ain't know what we was in for
Shootouts in broad day, it was crazy
77th on Broadway, still we blaze heat
When ducking shots turn to bustin' back and spraying blocks
When selling weed went to copping coke and chopping rocks
We going hard, had to give it all a nigga got
Narrowly escaped back-gates when cops raid the spot
My world spinning too fast, had to make it stop
Take a seat, make a plan, then make it pop
I made a record then he said he could make it drop
And one shot is all a nigga need to take it to the top
For the ones who don't know
It changed my life

The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wild out we gone all get wasted
I used to ride on alpinas, up and down Slauson, 18 with a scheme ta', simply get my cream up
Tryna to get my loot so I can floss on them bitches, black 745, Rick Ross on them bitches
Bulletproof with the chrome exhaust on them bitches, triple gold Cuban links I'm Raekwon on them bitches
Listen, Slauson Ave is what the game missin, niggas bang for a livin' and retire to San Quentin
That's why my only mission was contradict to statistics
Make it out, double back, with a pot that niggas can piss in
Or release the window we can throw it at em
But for now just roll em'up so I can blow the sour
Roll the windows up
The block is hot
Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops
Man we glowin' like the beams on my drop top
Roll the windows up
Let the base hit, crack a bottle of patron let me taste it
Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wile out we gone all get waisted
Yea, let your top down, turn your beat up
Go and spark the L, throw your dubs up
Comin to the west? you gotta go through us
Have communication, or get ya' ass bust
Yea, our motivation got us feelin' like we can't be touched
Slauson, can't you tell? we don't give a fuck
We gettin money round here, they wanna lock us up
Secret society all we ask is trust
Real niggas and we neva gonna change up
Not for money, na homey cause it is us
Slauson boys don't talk don't speak much
Roll around in something foreign with the windows up
Roll the windows up

Blowin' westcoast green while the speakers knock
And we about to cause a scene like fuck the cops

Split the swisha up the middle its basic, wild out we gone all get wastedThose little girls are being murdered
Those niggas are being shot down in broad day light
Now you tell me why the leaders of this struggle
Have never taken it before the United Nations
What its been like six years
You still lookin for Osama?
You gonna send more troops
That's your solution to the problem
With no evidence, yall never found the bomb
But that ain't stop yall from killing Tookie or Sadam
A neccessary evil, ain't that the term you use
Hundred thousand something soldiers went to serve for you
So you bury your people and let them burn for you
Over some oil cause the issue ain't concerning you
Since 9/11 you been talking 'bout the threat we facin'
And how you need a couple billion to protect the nation
But look, come to my hood i'll show you desperation
Kids dead at 13 like Devin Brown, with no explanation
Living in LA every single day
It's a war going on outside, no man is safe from
But since it's just niggas killing niggas
You just turn prison to a business
x2
Talkin Payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play that
You a blood, I'm a crip
You a tre, I'm a O
If you was raised on Slauson you would be one too
Your homeboys get low when they see me come through
And they say that I ain't got crack, And that would be untrue
But every now and then I think if we can get back to
That black shit, instead of killing for banging and crack shit
We'll be active
These niggas too stuck in their ways
I know we long overdue, but is we ready for change?
And stand under one flag like an army brigade
It's time to put the duece duece down and pick up a K
And if we banging on some black shit
Lets ride for the dead homies
Get the burners for Malcom and Natt Turner
Talking to them other niggas
Yea, my so called enemies
We don't own one block
We live and die for these city streets
And even though the pain run deeper
Real nigga know it's time to make peace, so we can focus on the
x2
Payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play that
Look, Fuck a injunction
I ain't violate nothin'
If you put your hands on me
Ima bust you, I ain't running
On the real, All you crash Johnny's know the deal
Once we start the revolution
All you probably do is squeal
Automatic weapons on my back, unconcealed
And I don't care where your from cause real recognize real
Every step is like chess, the wrong move gets you killed
So we act on how we think and never speak on how we feel
I don't believe 9/11 was Osama
Cause 9/11, Bush made a billion dollars
I heard them say gang violence was a problem
And they think that more prisons is a step to resolve it
But most prisons mean the checks keep revolving
And it don't take a rocket scientist to see the conflict
You can't cover up the pain with fake progress
It's time they pay back a portion of the profit
x3
I'm talkin payback
I knew you bitch niggas from way back
Witness who strap with macks
Knew I wouldn't play thatEvery day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this pain
Every day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this pain
All it take a nigga count it up once
I’ve been getting it since a youngin, niggas wasn’t counting up nothing
Niggas tried to press the line with us, we was calling out bluffing
And everyday a nigga grinding 'cause I came from struggling
Already lost some real ones but I came out thugging
Never folded under pressure now I got the name buzzing
All my niggas with the extras, ain’t nobody safe from it
And every day I’m pouring mud up 'cause I came from it
Now a nigga got some royalties and a chain comin'
Niggas I don’t even kick it with want some fame from me
Niggas wasn’t getting mad at me until I gained something
I done been through some shit, now I suffer pain from it
Fuck is you sayin'?
Every day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this pain
Every day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this pain
Nowadays keep the lights on when I’m ridin' in that Wraith
I remember back when Deuce died I was questioning faith
We ain’t never had a problem getting niggas out of the way
‘Member it used to be a problem tryna put some food on a plate
Got some niggas wanna play me, watching every move that I make
Know some niggas in the field, riding around, boosting up ranks
Pussy niggas doing everything they can do to relate
It wasn't easy, took a chance, had to do shit the right way
Every day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this pain
Every day I’m smoking dope
Every day I’m pouring drank
This how I deal with all this pain
This how I deal with all this painLook
Do I love it do I lust it? The struggle of a hustla
Life of a banger, and death is no stranger
I know 'em like it's kin to me, took a few friends from me
It all make since one day eventually
I guess so
Granny said it happen and it's meant to be, just let go
But I can't, this shit keep itchin' me, like
Them niggas outta line how they came through
Shot 'em in his face point blank, left his brains blew
Now who gon' go for 'em? Probably be the same crew
When bangin' is your religion, it's like a sin not to
A lotta niggas ain't cut from that same cloth
Them, I give 'em space, gotta play it safe
'Cause hard niggas turn holy when they catch a case
I still bark, real talk, I'll never fake
In Hyde Park late night, still chop a eighth
And grind with the homies
Serve dimes with the homies
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle way
I'm in a '85 Regal, no tint, you see clear through
Young nigga, lookin' life in the rear view
Burner on my lap, kush in my ashtray
And that's how I'ma play it 'til my last day
I'm used to gettin' money in the fast lane
And I only fuck with bitches that be nasty
Leather and wood, my money is good
And I'm like a young celebrity in every hood
Gold ropes for the crew, chrome spokes on my coupe, two seater
Then I take off the roof like Katrina
And slide like a Visa up Slauson in a Beamer
Call me what you want just don't call me a dreamer
'Cause mines is reality
Grind, no salary
I came a long way from sellin' grams off Gramercy
Boulders off Brynhurst and sevens off Slauson
Now I got options, now I got it poppin'
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle way
Look
Take away my granny blessings I'd be history
Them bullets cuz shot through my 'Lac wouldn't have missed me
Come to my hood, say my name, I ain't no mystery
I'm probably in the spot, feel the hustla's energy
In the kitchen countin' cash, watchin' cocaine chemistry
Cookin' into crack, I was lookin' into rap
Hard to focus on my dreams when I'm lookin' at the facts
Shootin' down the street, now I'm lookin' at my MAC
And you can tell just lookin' at the facts
It's a coffin or a cell if you young and you black
With your name on it
Still, every car pass, bang on it
If you gon' do it, do it right and put that thang on you
You too deep in it to quit, I know the pain of it
You love the game but knowin' that the game doesn't
Love you back, love the fact this the same struggle
City to city, we products of the same hustle
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle wayTake y’all on a little trip
To my side, Slauson Ave
Top of the mornin’
Ain’t nobody out yet
Paint this picture for you
I’m Slauson Ave. and everything on that street
Used to carve our names into wet concrete
Used to sell dope, and I still smoke weed
Just got a record deal, but I been had cheese
Lookin’ at my pieces, like I been had these
Lookin’ at these streets like there is no peace
Faded off a strain of that strongest leaf, like
If only these damn palm trees could speak
But they can’t, so they don’t, I could, so I will
Some people never do it, they just wonder how it feel
In the hour of chaos, come the water by my wheel
Like, it’s all an illusion and the only thing real
Is me, and we, whatever we believe
And that’s what we project, so that’s what we perceive
Embedded in my mind, it’s the code and the creed
Never went against it as I rose in these streets
We was, two deep in a cuddy on E
And Fats dropped a blunt and burnt a hole in my seat
Used to get butterflies when I roll with the heat
But, not for long, say goodbye to the sweaty palm
Young nigga on a mission, tote heavy arms
Young nigga wanna bang, it’s a heavy cost
Now what he got up in his brain, that’s a heavy thought
Turned a nigga out, had us murderin’ for clout, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit
Nip Hussle, look, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit
Nip Hussle
I’m Military Drive, everything on that strip
West Avenue and Fresno, heritage to the sticks
That ole trailer park out on highway 90
Or down on Colobra road, you might find me
Blindly pacing in the darkness, heartless
Livin’ out my car, gotta find a place to park it
Swisher full of dirt weed, spark it up
Lookin for change like a bum with a plastic cup
Like fuck the police, I been harassed enough
Where good men get turned to ash and dust
Where cash is lust, with massive nuts I hold
They bust AK47’s 'til their guts explode
And they stain the asphalt permanently
Daemons hold a player down when he determined to leave
But my kid’s graduation, I’m determined to see
Never knew how right Jeremiah’s sermon could be
‘Cause God damn America, the system is flawed
So we pump this d, avoid apprehension by law
Lay and brawl, and the black ice invisible
It’s either Mickey D’s or be a full time criminal
Yeah
And this is it
Cause my life is shit
Hip hop is all I got
Know what I'm talkin' about?
Texas out to Cali' baby
Essay to L.A
Nip Hussle
Slauson Boy
Question
Future of the southNow its a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now its a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
I've been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top
Wassup Loc, shit I'm just out here tryna make it
Moms keep trippin' and a nigga can't take it
Sick of standing on these same corners, tryna come up
Finna run up in the bank, hold my mother fuckin' gun up
Life, got a nigga so frustrated
All my real niggas is dead or incarcerated
Finna fill a nigga with lead
Show em what they made me
Give em what they gave me back
Feel my hatred
Click clack pop, was addicted to the six shot
Fiennin' for a fix like a smoker on the Vic block
Hoppin' out, getting high when the shit pop
Leaving bullet holes in the bricks in front of Big Lots
When I was broke, I hustled
Learned the game and I bubbled
Took my birthday money on Brynhurst and made it double
Snitches on the block always call the cops on us
Knowing damn well we got rocks on us, holla at us
Now its a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now its a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
Ive been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top
Life's like a dice game
Shake em' up, throw em'
There's rules to this shit, niggas fake they dont know em'
Number 1, scared money dont make none
And number 2, bullshit we don't take none
Never tell a bitch your plans or bring her to the house
Dont speak about a man, keep his name out your mouth
See that'll be the shit that'll get a nigga knocked off
Not the pussy, but the principal, cause jealousy is a felony
Now when you grinding, nigga dress bummy, fuck clothes
Ask yourself, are you in it for the money or the hoes
You content with a cutlass or you reaching for a rolls?
You straight up on them stocks says you fucking with them foes
I seen them quarters turn to halves, and halves to wholes
And now we hit the mall, we buy half the store
I had a Bentley coupe dream with a S up on the hood
Nigga ain't about to hustle, he get left up in the hood
Now its a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now its a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
Ive been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the top
Me and my brother we was broke as a bitch on some hopeless shit
Christmas day, we helped the homie open his gifts
But I ain't trip though, cause im from where they flip dough
And when they ask where you from you tell them Six Oh
Lets get rich bro, its time to get some big dough
Sunday nights on the 'shaw niggas rich roll
I used to only want to hit a switch and flip hoes
Now im thinking bigger man, its time to get home
On the East Side I used to buy stress and flip zones
108 late night, I pray I get home
Alotta niggas die young they never got to get old
Like Too Tall, Tiny Squeeze, Taca and S Dome
Dont know if you hear me, lord these niggas tryna kill me
So if I chip em' would you feel me
Now if you feel me, lord these niggas tryna kill me
If I was your child would I still be
Now its a possibility, that I can come from nothing to having it all
Now its a possibility, that I ain't gonna have it all and fall
But I stand tall
Ive been down for so long, you really want a chance so
I done paid my dues, my dues, my dues
I got to go, up to the topLook, let’s put some money up, you can’t make mine stop
I’m hot nigga, like a pistol off the dime block
Before you change lanes, you should check your blind spot
‘Cause I’ll be right there waitin’ like a bike cop
With my nine cocked, and I’m so hot
All a nigga really need is just one shot
To the dome, you be gone and it’s no more
I could kill ‘em goin’ fast or with the slow flow
Man I’m so O with the six in front
Motherfucka prolly smoke six blunts
Two o’s in the back, I got the six in front
Add four plus that, whatchu got, what’s what?
That’s a perfect ten, I’ma curse to him
Thinkin’ that the Slauson boys was not those men
I’ma knock those men out the ring by the third round
I treat it like the Superbowl, this is fourth down
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
It’s for the dough, the clothes
The bitches and the hoe’s
The paper in the cash, nigga used to livin’ fast
Navigation in my dash, big burner in my stash
Two twelves in my trunk, but nigga you don’t know the half
Look, ain’t nobody hold my hand through this shit
I was gave the same game, I just ran with this shit
On road to the riches, I don’t stand for no bitch
Caught herself for free when ridin’ with me
So It ain’t just MOB it’s MOE
That’s money-over-everything under G-O-D
I got A-1 credit, still its C.O.D
So keep it cash on deliver when you dealin’ with me
They wonder how a young nigga that’s as crooked as me
CEO of the label, no GED
See,I flow for them people that be in them streets
They seen me starve
Now they finna’ watch me eat
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
Look, off a fifth of that vodka-v, I’ma sick nigga
I’m dead up in the hood, livin’ like a rich nigga
I'd probably die in the hood cause of this nigga
I’m dead up in the hood, livin’ like a rich nigga
You’s bitch, you switch I’ma stay shitty
Win lose or draw, can’t take the pain with me
Said if I play the game, I gotta make my name history
Put it in the books, that nigga brought the flame with him
‘Cause where we go, nobody knows what’s coming after this
So while we’re here, let’s make a toast to all this lavish shit
Pop the Moe’ and pop the Vueve with the baddest bitch
Fast lane, young niggas just havin’ shit
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
However you want it, I got it in for the low
Come get it, I got it, you got it good nigga go
I hustle I rob, I do it all for the dough
It’s all for the dough
When I go to sleep late I get off my grind
And when I wake up in the mornin’, money on my mind
‘Cause I’ma hustleWe were born in sin, We die in sin
Lord have mercy
I did a lot in this life
So I fight and survive, Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Mercy, mercy, Lord have mercy
Now, standin' at the crossroads
Starin' at the cosmos
I'm a product of this gang bang
How we end up, only God knows
I'ma do about the self hate
I'm just tryna get myself straight
I'm so caught up in this wealth race
Cause I know how takin' L's taste
Look, set flame to your soul with us
When in wrong do what's wrong with us
Pops wasn't in the home with us
So we follow suit, look up to these old niggas
I can tell you how it go nigga
Light the fire with the flame, explode nigga
Nah, you gotta be a cold nigga
With the yellow brick road, brimstone nigga
We were born in sin, We die in sin
Lord have mercy
I did a lot in this life
So I fight and survive, Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Lord have mercy
Oh mercy, mercy, mercy, please
Mercy, mercy, Lord have mercy
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeahListen look look now ask yourself a question is you real or is you fake
Do you sell a nigga dreams or do you stand on what you say
When they ask you where you from you bite your lip and hesitate
Or do you step back and chuck yo hood up in they face
Is you bangin' is you poppin' is you turn't up
And dope money keep the kush wrapped and burnt up
Ya hot boy bullets bustin' out ya granny's shit
You gangbangin' even though it got your family sick
Now what your life about does money motivate your actions
Is you stackin' or you lost the self satisfaction
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions
It's just some thoughts for the mind it's just some questions
Now ask yourself another question is you happy with your life
House behind a picket fence couple kids and a wife
Or do you see yourself standin' in a different light
Your ambitions of a hustla got u pumpin all night
Do you know where your goin' or what you come from
I was a slanger then a banger never a dumb dumb
So what is you when u shoot without a set aim
A body part takin' orders from the set brain listen what the set sayin'
I will kill without a cause death before dishonor for your niggas go hard
Now ask is that your nigga or a snake in disguise
If that nigga give advice that'll lead to your demise
Just some questions
It's just some thoughts for the mind it's just some questionsSuicide doors, smoke grey Phantom
Fuckin’ these whores, bitches gettin' him
Rockin' this ice, lovin' my life
These niggas get mad, they don't wanna fight
'Bout to take a flight
And when I touch down it be ten thousand cash and the paper bag's brown
Ball with no budget, L.V.s on the luggage
Fall down to my knees, God, please keep it comin'
First-class flight, lookin' at the clouds
Hopin' that my niggas up in Heaven lookin' down
Hopin' what I'm doin' truly make my mama proud
'Cause for a very long time, I was the reason for her frowns
Chrome Alpinas, high school senior
I was never one of those, I sold zones out the Regal
Nigga had a vision
Then I made a decision
Then I gave a commitment
Then it put me in position
LookAye
Writing songs for my dogs, for my squad, from my heart
How we won, how we lost
How we came, how we saw
Through it all, ashin' Backs, out the roof, foreign cars
In pursuit by the law
Still we reach for the stars
Oh my God, oh my God, so high up, I'm so far, deja vu, I've been here before, say come back down to earth just to resist the urge, still no breaks on this car, live or die, either or, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, lead it all, on the floor
Yeah, ha, west side of Slauson grind and make a million, we them hungry niggas in between the buildings, risking everything we got to feed our children, my city built off of love but we killed it, hard times posted with pebbles and Buddha with it, I was told the money was there, it's up to you to get it, Girbauds with the Eddie Bauer no True Religion, Ralph Lauren ski jacket with the ruger in it, quarterback in the block with the Mike Vick game, I wasn't always successful but still I made plays, under pressure I run with the rock and get away, the main focus was living to see another day
Hall of Famer in the league but I never played
I left my granny house young when I should've stayed
Motiviated by the money I was getting paid
Go getter from the start and I'll never change
On this court, live or die, either or, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all on the floor, on the floor, go for broke, hustle hard, lead it all on the floor, on the floor, on the floor, lead it all, on the floor, on the floor, on the floor
Go for broke, hustle hard X4Intro/Chorus  x1:
Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya

And you ain't gotta act shy girl cause I already know, know
Like Yaaa...
Middle of the club with a big ass chain, wife beater on, bottle of champagne
Your baby momma grindin' on me, look like a mother fuckin' porno scene
Me, Her, drink, kush, pills, wheels, we push back to my crib showed her how I live
Get up in them guts and that's what I did, that's what I does, that's what I'm 'bout
All money in no money out, that's what I am, that's what I said
So what do you know it's a young nigga gettin' bread
Spending stacks at the mall, takin' stacks to the head
Ball till we fall, dinner in the Feds
That's where we go, you already know but you can ride with me in the Ol' 6-4
And you ain't gotta be a model, you can be a dime for what you got goin' on up inside
Even though you fly, your smell, your waistline, can I make you mine?
For the night, for the time
Man, I mean, you and me both in a relationship you hate the shit but you love it in the same breath, take a seat
Chorus  x1:
Got me intoxicated baby, every time that I see ya
Feels like I'm on that Patron, tryin' to take you home

Look so many n*ggas doin time
Who are you and I
To play wit it
It's a blessing
So reach for the sky
Pick up Shady off
The block and we gun
Smoke and drive
Politicing on a plot
To make it multiply
Keep some bitches on the team
From the other side
Keep at least a pound of green
Muthafucking righ
30 hours in the spot
Going over time
Then we pull up to the fox
And don’t hold a dime
You know this life got a co-design
How you go from eating lobster tail
To the ocean prime?
The chain to a smoker
It throw it on the line
& when them gates close keep
A open mind
It ain't no force in this world
Like a focused drive
You gotta focus on yaself
Like a only child
You make ya dream realer
Then you make ya team better
You make yo game up
Then you make ya scheme up
Bridge - Nippsey
Yeahh
Since when do real niggas come second?
So I kick the door down
Get more down
N*gga need atleast like 30 fo the show now
Woah now
Realest outta So Cal
Baby wanna f*ck, I'm like slow down
I’m eating cheese eggs in my hotel
Hussle sold out
N*gga retail and whole sale
Verse 2 - Dave East
Projects to the Condo
Thinking bout should I decorate
Only motivation I eva needed
Was section 8
Pissy stair cases
Rats and roaches
Wasn't resting late 
Coke and Dope we separate
Ain't bagged it yet
They better wait
That 600 Black
Mercedes Benz
I love tha features
Free my cousin Addiz
They caught em wit 100 pieces
Foreign visas, smoking in Japan
I'm from the cement
One of da homies start telling
I ain't wanna believe it
Backwoods still burning out
Maserati merkin
This that shit that they ain't heard about
Certified in person
Real n*ggas serve a purpose
Write my life out
In these verses
Clarity in this Rollie
My bitch into Fendi purses
On Slauson wit no license
Nippsey told me bring a 2 liter
20,000 on me
I just made that shit
Off two features
Cuzzo just came home
& All he asking for is new sneakers
Sun up to Sun down
I use to trap
I was like who need it?
Outro - Nippsey
I'm like fuck it though
Cuz when you flat broke
You ain’t nothin bro
I seen a gang
Of rich n*ggas get comfortable
Then lookin at they watch
Like where tf it go
Through my eyes I learn lessons
Like time is of the essence
& my grind got obsessive
Then my mind got restless
Put myself in the game
No batteries sold separate
Question?Long Beach, Compton, Watts, South Central
Eastside, Westside, Cali, Cali
Houses, apartments, projects, hot blocks
Avenues, boulevards, Cali, Cali, Cali
Johnnys, metros, CRASH Units, homicide
Deputy sheriffs in Cali, Cali, Cali
Aren't we, a jungle underneath the palm trees?
Don't go too deep into the concrete
Cuz, Blood, and who knows what
They all throwin' up somethin' but we ready to bust
Where I'm from, we get it poppin' with them rocks and slugs
Jab niggas, no boxing gloves 
You heard the story, know you seen the movies
Come through, it gets much more gruesome 
Yeah, nigga, you know, ask Pop, AK's go grrah
Pregnant mamas get shot sitting at bus stops 
We smoke Swisher Sweets, nigga, no Optimos
Rock white Tees, Dickies shorts, and fat gold
Squabble in facts, go back, homie, bust with a Mac
And bloodshed, we accustomed to that
On Korean storefronts, where we hustle them sacks
And tuck packs in a payphone, and purp on a Black
You see the helicopter circle, don't cross the tracks
You drive through and you'll be lucky if you walking back
These niggas wolves, gorillas with views that few choose
You think it's cool, but nigga, you too could get bruised
Or even worse, get put in a hearse, put in the church
Then put in the dirt, and that's just puttin' work in Cali
Home of the killers and thugs
Where COINTEL turned Panthers into Crips and Bloods
They tried to cover up the history of what we was
They killed Pac like Malcolm, now we drunk on they blood
 
And I'm from South Central Los Angeles, born and raised
My granny came from down south when they freed the slaves
With an aim, to make a better life than yesterday
But today, we hit the streets just to test the 'K
I live life between Slauson, a prison and coffin
Stuck on the block, I ask God for the option to profit
And what I see, all drama, All-Star Converse
And all these niggas got problems and they sobbed often
All the bitches gotta sit on expensive soft shit
Game tight, fly as they come, and all slick
It ain't shit in the world like a summer in the slums of Los Angeles
If you could manage, you could learn to love it
The murders and the bums on the corner become the normal
It's Nipsey, nigga, welcome to Killa CaliforniaFuck high school I'm trying find a lick
Can't spell success, but I can buy a Six
Kicked me out the house, and told them they can split
Moved off of 60th, and on to 5th
Stood in front of Nix and sold 200 nicks
Drop it on the hood, by some scandolous crips
Bought my first Cutlass, eyes on my tip
30 in the .40 incase you wanna trip
Blacc Sam told me, Hussle, that's 200 cent
It was when I knew the world was mine without a fucking blimp
Mostly 50s, 20's and a couple 10's
Moms counted with us, then she got a Benz
Thanks to my mother, both my aunties and my grandma
God bless you, cause I know I was a handful
The foundation, I was running through the sandbox
With the growing pains, but the love never ran out
Became a man watching uncle Reg' and grandpa
Corey taught me how to squabble with my head up
He told me, you will stop losing when you're fed up
Show me how to get my own fucking handout
Where I'm at, niggas die walking to the corner store
Instead of progress, candles burn and the Remy pours
Keep an extra set of eyes if you're getting yours
Desert Eagle shells flying straight through them hemi doors
And back at Charlie's with the cavi when I hug floors
Left Slip rocks, wanting to be drug lord
At Penny Pinches used to hustle to the crack of dawn
If you ain't tryna get the money, what you in it for?
What you in it for?
I'm trynna get the dough 
Count me up
Stay on the lot
Money, power and respect for the chosen few
Came through on low pros now they know to shoot
Nineteen, fuck rap, I'm the local truth
Me and Hub had the Alpinas, we the only two
Promote the gang, live and die for my rollie chain
Rich, gang banging music, I know my lane
Curb servin' off the corner was a protege
Pop the trunk and I'm manifesting my mobile ways
Real Estate, repossessed and do you know the pain?
Brodie in the state, I'm on the block quarter ounce of 'caine
Life cycles and circles that bubble into rage
Turn to self-destructive behavior, somebody light some sageCount this dough up
Call my name, I'm gon' show up
Young, bout to pour up
Quarter pint in my soda
Now picture me rollin'
My V-12, that's twin turbo
Fuck with that Gelardo
But the 'rari I prefer though
Y'all, war verbal
We candle your curb up
Police can't control us
They just react to these murders
Take y'all niggas off
And be back in the mornin'
Last time was a walk up
Now we poppin' out the foreign
Stickin' to the script
Y'all got too many stories
Talk just like a bitch
We got too many Maury's
Loose lips to sink the ship
But break the levees like New Orleans
I always move in silence
Except when I'm recordin'
Mama raised a king
Wasn't fit to be a doctor
Product of my environment
Sirens and helicopters
Murder, kidnap for capital's
Only one half of the problem
Prices on top of heads
Go through hell just to get that dollar
Rich and dangerous in the City of Angels
Everything about me, Slausangeles
Everyone around me still bang, don't bang with us
Disrespect the set and we on your neck if you don't hang with us
It's SlausangelesYeah, why would I stop?
When you get money like this, you gotta ask yourself that question
They say the greatest threat to your future success
Is your current success, that’s why I go hard
Ah, look, 7 Series black Benz, gun metal Mac 10
Yellow bone trophy, she gonna blow me as I back in
Marijuana smoking, black Versace shade glass tint
Cover up my bloodshot eyes like an aspirin
Nigga, ballin', that’s your past tense
I’m the present and the future of this rap shit
Don’t act like you can’t hear it, you should fear it
Kill me, can’t mute my spirit
Want a feature? Cut the check or nigga, you can’t clear it
Undisputed on the West — if not, who came near it?
Get at him with respect or young dude won’t hear it
It’s 20K in some states just for dude appearance, and look
You start getting rap money, they say you act funny
But I remember how I thought when I was that hungry
You let them take your sack from you, you’ll be back bummy
So niggas be ready to kill, 'fore they let crew take all their racks from them
Same mind state, different grind rate
The desperation tenfold 'cause the price changed
Make a hundred thousand dollars off a lick, or you can make 10 million off a hit
Nigga, not to mention, all the glamour and the glitz
Sold his soul for the fame - damn, ain’t that a bitch?
Ah, and when I pull up they say, "Ain’t that the 6?"
You talk money but I ain’t that convinced
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
'Cause these days niggas fake
I’m on my grind, I'm thankful I ain’t doing time
That’s why I’m solo when I ride
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
'Cause these days niggas fake
Wake up on my money with no emotions on my face
Keep a choppa at the house and a .40 on my waist
My strive, that’s all a nigga got
I’m the last one to lead, the first one to bleed the block
Now that, grind mode can’t stop, won’t stop
I’m just tryna turn that 1997 to a yacht
Uh, and put my son in the spot
So he ain’t never gotta worry 'bout the shit that he ain’t got
Just watch how I put my niggas in position
Without a handout given, we was out here fly living
Ah, I’m innocent until the jury plead
Guilty, your bitch feelin' how my jewelry bleeds
Bro, what? You niggas ain't no kin to me
A bunch of broke niggas suffering from in the breeze
Hopeless ass rap bitches in it for the cheese
Can't get comfortable, I’m working on that enemy
The hustle there, my nigga, though you're lacking energy
Every 16 will bring you closer to Ken Malik
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
'Cause these days niggas fake
I’m on my grind, I'm thankful I ain’t doing time
That’s why I’m solo when I ride
I’m getting paid, sometimes I wanna get away
'Cause these days niggas fake
Wake up on my money with no emotions on my face
Keep a choppa at the house and a .40 on my waist
AyAy, my nigga
I came too far, I can't let my plans change
I’m going broke on dope to get my flip my last chain
To pop the tops off the bubbly on the yacht
Sippin' Rose and Cliquot, I do it with my people
Them same niggas guaped out count cash with me
Plus them same niggas that hopped out quick to blast with me
And stood by my side when they tried to blast niggas
And never ran, never scared like a man shouldn't
Recollectin’ my reflection on a smoker bike
Late night, nigga dropped death in a smoker pipe
He disappeared like thick fog into the open night
And doubled back with more crack and got some smoker's light
Now double that, that's more black with no hope in life
Can't run from that 'cause that's a fact and you know it's right
I wish my niggas could wake up and focus right
And I don't give a fuck about the type of music Oprah like
I ain’t no street nigga, I’m the street, nigga
Slauson muthafuckin' Ave, every word I speak, nigga
And if I’m lying, God strike me in the booth
Got my record label logo on the side of my shoe
Slauson Boy beaters, nigga, and they Crippin' blue
And your bitch on my dick, so make sure you buy two
Try who? Not Hussle, don't fuck with him
Skinny nigga, no muscle, so I buck niggas
Silly nigga, no hustle, no bucks
While my 'Lac be the bank like a fuckin’ Brinks truck, nigga
And it ain't nothin' that you haters never seen
Picture everything that you haters wanna be
I'm young, I'm fresh, and feelin' myself
I'm gettin' money on the books, no more concealing my wealth, man
I sleep at night, there's no feeling like it
Cop the iPhone, man, I'm shittin' on your Sidekick
745 floatin' with a fly bitch
La Costra Nostra, nigga, this is my shit
A Slauson baby, 1-9-85 shit
Fourteen-five a bird on some pie shit
Walkin' out the Fox Hills on some fly shit
I'm just living life on some "limit is the sky" shit
I'm on some "Ribbon in the Sky" shit
Classic music, you could view it
Few dispute it, 'cause these niggas know I really do it
I shoot up your spot, make you niggas move units
I grew up to Pac, who was bangin' in his music
People tryna blame that for the gang related shootings
But save that, this is everyday movement
Can't bring tool the school then the students stay truant
Yep, and them streets gotta school you
No curriculum, they teach a nigga, get your gun
You met your enemies but you ain't checked your biggest one
Look, with no curriculum, they teach a nigga, get your gun
You met your enemies but you ain't checked your biggest one, nigga
We've come too far
We can't be stopped, we're taking over
We've come too far to fall back now
We've come too far
We can't be stopped, we're taking over
We've come too far to fall back now
Come from the bottom, sometimes they gon' hate
Try to take your breath from the back, smile up in your face
Some of these bad as bottoms, just I'm pregnant by the game
These fake ass haters at my show screamin' my name
It's so lonely at the top, people don't understand
It's your time, so feel me, 'cause this is who I am
Oh, oh, oh...I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
My Mama wanna know why I'm banging
She told me ima lose my life
I ain't trippin I'm a crip and ima do it right
'Fore I run from a nigga I lose the fight
I gotta hustle, momma ima move the white
If I died came back I'd do it twice
Brain washed by the block it consumed my life
Cool nigga but a killa when the mood is right
Bullets have the dogs howling at the moon at night
Momma its cold outside
Ain't no hope outside
Couple niggas getting money most us broke outside
Rocks in the house selling dope outside
Reminiscing on my niggas that got smoked outside
Suckas in the house when them locs outside
Huslta gotta eat when them folks outside
Got a burner in my lap and I'm dippin in my bucket
Lifes a bitch nigga fuck it!
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, and my beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your town
They say we probably die sanging, banging, pressing the line
All a nigga really got is my respect and my pride
Got a Chopper for the coppers keep protecting the ride
Every nigga got a limit never step on the line
When the set say it's on I'm expecting to ride
When the world say I'm on I got the set on my side
Matter fact a nigga got the set on my back
Slauson boy, the world ain't ready for that
Nigga it's cold in my hood
Ain't no hope in my hood
Couple homies couldn't cope smoking dope in my hood
But I could never ever be from no other hood
And I could never ever leave my folks in the hood
Thank the Lord every morning that I woke in the hood
And summers that I wrote prome spokes in the hood
If I never sold a mil off what I wrote in my hood
I ain't trippin cause niggas know I spoke for my hood
I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your tow I don't give a fuck
Ridin with my burner, beat turnt up
Ac blowin and my windows down
Chuckin up my hood when I hit your townI'm fresh off the table in Vegas, I'm bettin' big, nigga
Chuck Taylors, smoke in La Brea, brought the crib with us
Soon as we pull up they pay us, that's how it is, nigga
Still wanna kill us, but for now they gotta live with it
Niggas be hating up, it don't bother me none
The homie got some tommy guns, I'm 'bout to buy me one
They got it twisted cause I'm ballin', having lots of fun
But every real nigga gettin' money know that I'm the one
Just check me out, pay attention
If you watch me long enough you see the shit I mention
I really got it, I really live it
I'm really tryin' to play it down cause I really did it
Dope boys in the trap holla back
Smoking weed, cutting crack, counting stacks
Do your thing, just remember it's a fact
All them niggas ain't your bros, all the cell phones tapped
You in the game, and the game is just that
See there's winners and there's losers, when your freedom gets snatched and
What you thought you wanted don't amount to what you had
Seein' that you lost them both feeling like you 'bout to gag and
While you gone, your daughter need a dad
And her momma need a man that could keep buyin' her bags
And it's cold, hurt you so much you gotta laugh
Future fucked, now how you supposed to get over your past
You should just, suck it up and do your time like your man say
Nigga ridin' dick when you had the upper hand
Talking like you ain't shit, and the marathon you ran wasn't nothing
That's how that shit go, but keep hustlin'
Dirty game, see the twist so why shorty change
Think about it every single time I board a plane
It ain't no love, you just ignore the pain
And use the money and the fame as the novocaine
Yeah, that's how it go
When you young and gettin' dough
But do your thing, don't give a fuck
We're gettin' money, nigga
We're goin' up
Uh, dirty twenty, fifties, and hundreds
Fast life that I'm livin, marathon that I'm runnin'
Take advantage of everything granted, just keep it coming
On my off day they might accuse me of stuntin'
A-1 credit I don't co-sign nothing
Admit it I'm addicted, can't stop hustlin'
Went from blending in, now my lifestyle's custom
Bail money set aside, I ain't gonna touch it
Motivated nigga, make 'em reconsider something
Lot of niggas hustle, can't keep up with the money
Gotta grind through the winter, to make it to the summer
A risk you gotta take when you on it like I want it
Transition out the game, no longer see opponents
Now I see a business and I'm lookin' like the owner
Handle business from a distance, I don't know 'em, I don't wanna
Snitches on the prowl, matter of fact around the corner
The punishment is heavy and it's getting even stronger
Money coming steady, by the way it's even longer
Take a glimpse at my diploma, graduate it's a honor
I'm out here gettin' dollars, and they act like it's a problem
I'm all about a win, losing never was an option
That explains all that champagne bottle popping
You're damn right, my whole gang make a profit
What, we gettin' moneyStill leaning while I'm sipping
Screaming fuck a bitch
I thank God for my success
And I accept what it come with
I know the sacrifice this type of life actually is
But when I weigh my other options anything else don’t make sense
Screams, nightmares and dreams
And the story of my life it seem there ain't no in-betweens
Still plotting on a million hundred plus before I leave
God willing touch a billi that's just how a nigga think
On my own two, running this race just how I'm supposed to
Took back ownership for everything I sold dude
This is grinding, this is hustle in the old school
Don't be surprised when I roll, boo
I think I gotta problem in relationships
Tried to love a couple times but it ain't make no sense
Look I'm not tryna go to war with you, my dear
This time is real, don't let it be consumed by fear
I think I gotta problem in relationships
Tried to love a couple times but it ain't make no sense
Look I'm not tryna go to war with you, my dear
This time is real, don't let it be consumed by fear
See I got so much on my mind
But I just needed space and time
Know we got us here from somethin'
Everybody got their own assumptions
Stop wasting all your energy
Tryna find a new identity, for me
Damn, what the fuck is up?
See all this money got these bitches acting like they fell in love
And some of y'all niggas believe ‘em
But I'm not one of y'all
I'mma young nigga out here eating, just balling till I fall
Yea, solo in my 2-door
Never had to follow rules, if I want to then I do so
World famous, everywhere that you go
People taking pictures, imagine how your ego
Could run away, it could run away with you
Run you over and then stay with you
Slick words from a pretty bitch
I looked at her as I hit the spliff, and said
So material, why you so material?
Make it all about the sex, it should be something spiritual
I want the world, I'm not the man to make miracles
And in my mind it come that girls don't wanna marry you
Lost in this fast life, I know it's wrong
One day I come back round and prolly be gone
She say you balling but you all alone
And if you call bout a problem just dont call my phone
She like, you can't buy happiness
And that's true, but bitch I can't be average
To tell the truth don't really want it to be over with
There's just some things I got to go and getI'm rising in this game and it feels great
Still tryna keep it real, niggas still fake
Been off the label all year, nigga still ate
Drop the marathon in December, niggas still late
I'm so impatient, but I still wait
I still show love when I feel hate
On a scale of one to ten, I need a high heel eight
Or better, blowin' this cheddar like I'm Bill Gates
Whatever
I'm in this wind til the movie ends
Smokin' California, eatin Peruvian
Out on Miami beach my niggas a few of 'em
Dressed like Beverley Hills, the bitches we usually with
But wishin on a star nigga took it far
And if I lost it all tomorrow I wouldn't trip at all
They say I'm crazy when I say it
But the fear of fallin off is the only thing that can take your faithLook, pistols poppin
Shells fly you see the bodies drop
I'm knee deep in these streets you niggas dip dobbin
Too many niggas tryna hustle
Just stick to robbin
Imagine grindin 12 hours with 200 dollars
Block boy
It's my rise to the top boy
10 speed handle bar before I did the drop boy
I rock a soldier rag but nuttin like the hot boys
Mine navy blue "S" dome with the cocked toy
Yea and I walk it like I talk it boy
You don't wanna squabble you socks like the top drawer
White Lincoln with the light grey leather seats
Chrome Alpinas on Pirellis sold separately
Hell yea I'm rich rollin with the weaponry in case I got to pop a fuck nigga like a ecstasy
So a worry on my mind is what you'll never be
I'm ready for what ever beef

Now get yo, now get yo motherfuckin’ hands up
Now get yo hands up, I count money bitch
I smoke Kush and sip lean like, fuck a pill
Couple fake release dates, but my bucks is real
My competition never knew what having nothing feels
‘Bout to take hip-hop to trial, like fuck a deal
Rags to riches so my peeps never drag they feet
This all money marathon molds a masterpiece
That ? the button press recline the back seats
And I’m the realest nigga in it if you ask me
But that’s promotion, and I prefer publicity
So run and tell your homegirls, and get ‘em all into me
I got a swagger on stage you should really see
Gold stupid dumb chain, Ricky D
You can’t go against the grain when it’s meant to be
So hatin’ me’s an exercise in futility, dummy
Women, power and the money, got it all
See me out and can’t take nothing from me
I’ma ball, I’ma pop, I’ma raise Emani in the lap of luxury
‘Cause daddy ain’t no dummy, but
How can I prepare you for a world so ugly?
Gotta lace your baby Vuitton Chuck T’s
Life is an experience, enjoy that you can’t
Too much of anything will kill that, you must understand
It ain’t all about the money, it’s more about the Fam
And it ain’t all about yo momma, it’s more about your dad
That’s just a joke, now peep how I rise from the gun smoke
Pistol-grip-poetry my nigga get a dose, don’t stop
Don’t stop, no tick on my Rolex watch
I won’t stop, I won’t stop
Hood nigga out the hood gettin’ guap
I can’t stop, I can’t stop
There’s no tick on my Rolex watch
Money and the powerYuh, Nip Hussle in this motherfucker
Rallo, what up?
Look
My top down, your name hot now
But when I was out here, nigga, you was not 'round 
Was in the game, but I just watch now
I did rims so my shit stock now 
Suede, hit, linin' on the roof
Don't be lyin' on the facts, niggas lyin' in the booth
When we travel around the world, we flyin with a suitcase Stamped Louis Vuitton with Cuban cigar
Miami, Ocean Ave, couple beautiful broads
On the back of motorbikes, ain't no use for a car
I'm outta town, so the coupe is at large
And this, jealous of success, niggas usually are
But, I dont give a fuck, I ain't trippin' though
Nigga gettin' desperate while I'm gettin' dough
Oh, you love that bitch? Better get ya hoe
And I ain't gotta tell you why, you already know
One-One-Once in a lifetime shit
She ain't never been fucked in a drop top Benz
That's why when I pull up, she quick to get in
I'm a boss, young nigga, get some paper and a pen
Class is in session, rap 'til I'm restless
'Cause constant repetition is the path to progression
Class is in session, rap 'til I'm restless
'Cause constant repetition is the path to progression
Take that and run with it, you should get some cash 
Way back as young niggas, we was livin' fast
Heavy on the grind, South Central State of mind
Type of nigga buy a pound, break it all down in dimes
Baby blue regal, 1985
Gold Rollie on my neck, 380 in my spine
It was a lot of things that was runnin' through my mind
All of which I would bring to myself, in due time
And now I'm watchin' ring put a strain on her eye
Fireworks in my sleeve, the 4th of July
Waist line Louis, stay fly truly
Can't fuck with me with a rubber or a roofie
Hoes try to choose me, haters try and shoot me
Feds wanna book me and these bitches wanna screw me
Ex-street nigga turned boss, that's the routine
And you would have extras if your life was a movie
Yuh 
Catch my breath, that's a whole lot of words, you know
This is the marathon
New shit, Neighborhood Nip Hussle, let's get itI'm from Slauson, when shit get drastic down here

Let's take the block through my hood
Crenshaw corner stores, dope spots on the low
Young homies hit the pen, old G’s on parole 
Dice games in the back, air holes in the MAC
Leather on my seats, burners stashed in my Cadillac
Yellow tape, white chalk, 10th Ave, High Park
Young black males catchin' hell from them white cops
G-Rod on one, two homies, three guns
Hoppin' out, killin' shit, four-five semi-spit
Four-five niggas hit, my retaliation, go
Somebody got two dollars, just a part of gang bangin', yo
And Bush keep talkin' 'bout the war in the Middle East
But he don't give a fuck about this war in these city streets
So fuck peace, I'ma ride on my enemies

Let's take the block through my hood
Ridin'  63rd, flip work off the curb
Got crashed, cops that hop gates wanna hear the bird
Young flips give me head, tryna keep me in the bed
Once I get my nut, I'm out the door, I'm all about my bread
Westside killers ride, never seen a nigga die
Now he trigger-traumatized, humble from the homicide
Gang bang nigga shit, same day different shit
More drama than a soap opera where I'm livin' bitch
And everybody talkin' bout stop snitchin'
I was countin' from your street lights, so they don't need a witness
They come to court wit' a tape on your ass
With your face on blast, close cased on your ass
I let off ten shots, I got plenty to go 
Do a nigga like O-Dog, hit that bitch in the store, for real
'Cause when Caine was on the set filmin' Menace
We was servin' on the steps, no respect for the tenants

I'm young thug, get it straight
White teeth, Bathing Ape
I smoke big kush wit' S-Black and Big Wake
 thousand dollar jeans, mind on another page
Come and get money nigga, grind rocks from the cage
Violence in one time, hustle on another stage
Pop shops, crash cops, niggas livin' in a rage
Under street lights, in my district, get waved at 'em
, , I'm dope-locked, 8th Ave
I post up, set shop, go hard, and get cash
Lean on the gate wit' a K and a face mask
So if you think you touchin' us, not hardly
When the rifle blast it sound like the pipes on a Harley
If you think I'm new around here, I beg your pardon
I'm Slauson Avenue, I'm little Marcus Garvey

Let's take the block through my hoodChorus: 
Just cause I don't shed a tear fo my niggas that ain't here
It don't mean I ain't sincere
Just don't speak on how I feel
Let my clip cry for me bullets flying everywhere
As my chopper goes
As my chopper goes
Verse 1:
Look alot of niggas die young they never got to get old
Like two tall tiny sweez talkin n s dome
Like tomcat baby bow cap pilla n stone
Shout out to all my homeboys that's never coming home
Sup to all my niggas in prison, that's in the hole
I ain't forgot you, just out here trying to keep it going
Grinding to reach my goals n shit, what else do I know
Beside hustling gangbangin all us young niggas do
They got us stretched out
Wifey's flippin mama is stressed out
All for the crib we feel when, we yell the sets out 
Now let's count, too many dead noggas got x'd out
It's chest now two to your head in front of your ex house
And just how did these street rappers get let down
Stand up niggas don't ever sit down, spit rounds
Eternally for my niggas that ain't gonna get out
Shoot up your block before I let a tear drip down
Chorus: 
Just cause I don't shed a tear fo my niggas that ain't here
It don't mean I ain't sincere
Just don't speak on how I feel
Let my clip cry for me bullets flying everywhere
As my chopper goes
As my chopper goes
Verse 2:Uh-huh, yeah, hustle music
Break down your blunts, roll up your kush
Get your mind right
Y'all feel comfortable, early morning, check it out
I'm on the block with these rocks, posted, loc'in'
Low-key, so Johnny think I'm smokin', focused
On nothing more than getting to my quota, hopin'
The block roll before they start patrollin', I'm knowin'
They watchin' us, binoculars and scopin'
Bumpin' up the smokers, tryna ask 'em what I sold 'em
My mind state: money over everything underneath the sun
And death cock the barrel of my gun, it go bang
Don't ask me why I gangbang, no thang
It's easy, believe me, the coppers, they need me
I pay their salary, they know that
My calories were way too heavy to stop, I'm on the block
I'm choppin' down ounces, halfs, sevens
Boulders, dimes, nicks, whatever
I'm going, forever, I'm never gon' stop it
The profit, I flip it, the spots, I'm switchin'
The Glocks, I spit at any nigga lookin' like oppo-sition
And any action, it got conse-quences
And death around is about as common as sense is
Case it go bang, case it go spray, case it go pow
Case it go after the enemies I wacked out
Case it go before the guy owe ya knocked out
Case it go through the plywood holding up your house, it ain't
Man, I'm tryna hold your key to the city
The key to having cake, no break, full grizzly
Silverback gorilla catchin' cocaine frisbees
Cookin' up a cookie on a propane chimney
Nipsey, Hussle in the house, I'm 'bout my paper
If money is a bitch, then I'm a rapist 'cause I take her
It's funny niggas spit about the game like they a player
But they ain't Shaq and Kobe so they just another Laker
And they don't rap they life, so they just another faker
They frontin' for these hoes, hoes frontin' for the dough
And me, I'm front and center, with this hustlin', I'm a pro
Last name, Hussle, first name, Nipsey
See, I'ma stay fresh, y'all can stay bummy
Y'all can chase pussy, but I'ma chase money
You only live once, and niggas die young
You live by the bullet, you gon' die by the gun
Comin' off of Slauson, where niggas hate your guts
See you ridin' high, they wanna set you up
Probably jealous of ya, never get enough
Money ain't the root of all evil -- nigga, what?
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
I've been on the grind since the age of 14
Started with a quarter, bought my first bucket
Bought my first gun, said "Fuck it" then I bust it
It ain't the ones I fucked off, it's the ones I fuck with
It ain't the ones I tramp treat, it's the ones I trusted
Jealousy and envy, I see it all around me
Kill because I'm up, if I was broke, they'd probably clown me
But I don't give a fuck about this small talk
Road to the riches, they stuck up in the crosswalk
I blow past 'em, though
And burn rubber off Pirelli low pros
My leather's so soft and I'm ridin' solo
My sunroof cracked and I'm blowin' out smoke
All they said was "Hussle, don't light up no mo'"
All I do is hustle, so in light of my goal
I do what the fuck I tell myself to
Do not what the fuck you try to tell me
So nigga, fuck you, we could squabble, we could shoot
We could play the same game, we could act like it's cool
But you won't get me, before I get youLook I'm a all money in CEO
Which means that fly money is the life I chose
And they say I think I'm the shit
But I don't think I know
Cause ain't nobody gave us nuttin we just got our own
We standin on the coutches poppin bottles smokin weed
F*ckin bitches lovin life makin money countin cheese
Flow safe cubin links more cake u would think
It's our birth day bitches thirsty but we never let em drink
First class leather seats blue Gucci;s on my feet
Or either chuck taylors get money fuck haters
What's up to Chuck Taylor my nigga Compton Menace
AR BlackWall forever ya'll my niggas
Lax fifty cities wuts next volume thrizzy
Then december twenty second south central state of mizzy
I bet a hundred thousand that I fuck up the city
The king of L.A. is young Nipsey
And if I'm not I'm so hot I feel I got that right
A nigga slept him that day and he got shot that night
Choices to consequences if I chip him it's life
So gettin back for me is like... fuckin his wife
Imagine that to transition from Slauson to my position got a deal went to jail my bro wus fresh up out of prison
And niggas looked like I f*ck off wut I was givin
But the truth is I'm not used to this new way I make my livin
And since I can't rewind back to dime sacks and shoot outs and cadillacs a young nigga gotta rap
And goin through it I still knew that I was that, nigga plus the walls on my condo need a plaque
Look I'm a all money in CEO
Which meens that fly money is the life I chose
I'm a fly money all money in individual
Pullin racks out for a little bit of visual
Independent money but they swear we some criminals
CEO a couple mills is wut 'm gettin to
And I'm all ways workin deals in the livin room
Cannin dirty money still I think we need a bigger room
And when they see me they say quick wut do that nigga do
Bu they can tell that I'm all about some revenue
Spend quick never sit like residue
Or I can show these niggas wut my good credit do
700 or higher u can't clone that
Heard u on a record label already owns that
Something bout Brodee I ain't never gave a loan back
Never had to pay that
Get that money ASAP
Had a big dream like pushin up in a Maybach
On my J Brown shit yea the 'Big Payback'
Dirty money were I'm from never should u trase that
And we coppin property u losin we replace that
And I'm on
Friendinesh put that on the sinernet
All money in I'm droppin after Nip ain't that some shit
They can't believe it's not butter
The nigga in the mix like apple pucker
Fresh off the movie set, phil in her hooters next
Wut the f*ck did u expect

Meet me on the far way, huh 
Hussle, Hussle
Neighborhood niggas
Uh huh, you feel me?
Check it
Y'all niggas got me fucked up, thinking it's a game
You know my name, and nigga I ain't playing
So here's the program, you know Am
Right back on the block, with the sacks and the rock
Ready to rock, cause balling just my habit
You know my style, my locale is Cali
Westside, the best side
La, SC, the sixty blocks you know me
Nipsey is hot, for sure G
You heard his demo, all tracks
Naw, nigga not fixed and all that
What's happening? What's cracking?
Oh, now you talking soft and under your breath
Like you ain't ready for death
You should have kept it to yourself, he flowing
Yeah, he said he rapped it up too, he did, shit was beautiful
Know how he coming through with the crew
That's what he do
'Cause what's the business, you know what he do
But not ready though, she feeling me 'cause I got plenty though
This how we do it
From around the way, they know my name
They know how I get down and play
Around the hood, I afford dangles all day
And make my cheese check traps in every way
The mind I'm in when I'm coming through spinning
In it to win it, tryna make a million by dinner
Like my nigga the set dribble off the bg
You know the block, Ricky hot, shots pop
Niggas getting off them rocks
I won't say the name but niggas holding down the block
Nigga, my cast, I dropped out of class
Wasn't paying no attention, I wasn't listening
I was thinking of the plots with me and my henchmen
Let's go out on the block and try to get it hot
I really don't, keep it cool, keep it cold
Under rocks 'cause I'm not trying to be trapped
Deep in the country or the peninentery, you telling me
Used to have to work under my hood or under my tongue
Our kids are ready, I felt wrong
I wonder why, I made all my dollars fucking other cousinsYou know a nigga like me tend to keep 'em at arms distance length
I'll give you that, you got a little bit closer, but, you know
Yeah
Finna take you back around, like, '98, '99, you know
Slauson boy
Yeah, let's take it back then, when it was crackin'
We probably took your 10-speed and jacked your mags then
One on the handlebars and one on the pegs
Obituary pictures, I miss 'em, them niggas dead now
We used to fail tests, we used to steal chirps
We used to smoke stress, we used to sell work
Nigga, you're too cool for school, you ain't no fuckin' fool
You ain't gon' stay broke for long like them suckas do
That's when my moms trip, she told me "kick rocks"
My granny told me I could stay, that's when the shit popped
Rarely I came home, mostly I'm in the streets
Livin' with bitches I'm fuckin', bouncin' between the sheets
I hit a house lick, I got a little change
I bought a gold chain, a little cocaine
Focused my mind now, got on the grind now
I bought a bucket, a Cutlass, fuck it, it's mine now
That muthafucka rolled though, on hood
You know, nigga ain't have no license
Nigga be like four, five deep in that muthafucka
Shit, you know, nigga was just livin' fast, you know
I got my first taste of money and I was turned out
I was on the grind after that, you heard me
Look
That's when the cash came, life in the fast lane
Goodbye 211, hello champagne
Goodbye hoodrat bitches, hello dime pieces
They say money and women is known to divide people
I couldn't see it, but now I see it's true
Your bitch was feelin' me, my bitch was feelin' you
We both was gettin' money, you know how these bitches do
Show no emotions to these hoes, don't let it get to you
Now when we meet, I'm seein' jealousy behind your face
Like crooked looks on top of phony smiles and fake shakes
You used to front me quarters, you used to have the bricks
You let me try your shit, how did it come to this?
Your young homie done growed up on his own
Same nigga you taught to cook and how to blow up a zone
Same nigga you sent the pounds to when I went out of town
Same nigga when I was down you let me sleep in your house
What's happenin'?
You know, them times when a nigga got, you know, sick of just being in the hood every goddamn day
I got me a little ticket on JetBlue, got me a few pounds and I shook, you know
I was in ATL tryin' to do it big, my nigga, Stone Mountain, westside, Decatur
Peachtree, all that, tryin' to get my money out in the zone, you feel me
I guess you never know a nigga, 'til you catch a case with him
And it hurt me in my heart when they told me that you was snitchin'
If I wasn't up outta town, I'da been right wit'cha
Takin' that bank down with you — would you have still turned witness?
And I remember them other niggas, they had you cornered
You chirped me early morning, I hit that corner with burners
No license in my Regal, on my lap was the heat
I'm taking risks within this 'cause you would do it for me
Wasn't that the code? Stay down and never fold?
Through 25 to life or through the casket close
And now I put some space between us 'cause the path you chose
You got another nigga life for that little cash you stole
And mama told you this a long time ago
Don't do the crime if you can't do the time, and oh
At first I brushed it off and second guessed it
'Til the homie showed me all that paperwork with your confessionsYeah, we know you used to put in work that's old
Nigga and we seen your paperwork you told
All these niggas either sniffing glass or they living off the past
When i'm blowing money fast with my bros
Lately I been seeing niggas sell they soul
How you catch a case and bail out on parole?
I've been state to state getting money on the road
Had to reevaluate who I could to talk to on the phone
Switch it up, spit the game pay attention, you should listen up
Follow code and one day you 'gon get as rich as us
Seven digit, street nigga that ain't rich enough
Forty million on the crib like that nigga Puff
Niggas buying yachts, niggas buying jets, that make me wanna buy the block just to reinvest
Help my young niggas catch it before it's nothing left
Bury me the realest ever did it yet
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hunnid one until the death
Even when I'm gone they'll see I never left
Looking at the whip like, "glad I never quit"
Pass my niggas women thought we'd never hit
Stickin' to the script get rich and never switch
All my role models doin' sentences
Yeah

Frank Lucas push his roof back in front of him
Leave a nigga toothless when it comes to the loot
I go stupid with the butt of the gun, know where i'm coming from?
North Philly where Fraizer and Muhammad sparred
Last named Ahkbar they calling all cop cars
When they pull you over, they might shoot you over moving
Now that we Truman they know who we are
They took a king from us, they X'd Malcolm out
You kidding me? I did my own black history
Studied Illmatic, Reasonable Doubt that's the main reason why these rappers can't get with me
Fuck em all, I hear the whistle know it's time to ball
Y'all niggas throwing fouls but y'all don't wanna brawl
How you going on a mission with no vision? Fuck Stevies like a sight look at Stevie's ambition, we hood niggas that get it
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all
Fuck em all

Different nigga now that my pop's gone
Low tolerance promise you'd get popped on
Microwave the bullets sounding like popcorn
Grind heavy the cops come or the rocks gone
Same nigga, so what? The time's changed
When I couldn't get money I used to find ways
Counting thousands off the cavi in the hallway
It wasn't long before I figured out crime pays
We still in search of them bright days
Dark streets, only light when police raid
Where niggas stress out and let that shots off
Los Scan, like a skillet it'll pop off
I hit the ave and posted with the uncut raw
Sacked it up and told niggas I had the cake moss
Nothing fancy, protect myself with the eight ball
It wasn't easy I had to hustle on Hyde Park
Bury me the realest that ever did it yeah
Hopefully my day ones will remember this
Keep that shit a hunnid on until the death
Even when I'm gone they'll see I never left
Looking at the whip like, "glad I never quit"
Pass my niggas women thought we'd never hit
Stickin' to the script get rich and never switch

Doin' it with no punch, you feel me...
Look, lifestyles of the young, rich and famous
Money over everything, underneath the interest
I stay strapped cause they never stop hatin'
And I never stop grindin' cause they always want a payment
I pink slipped every whip I ever came in
And always wear a rubber cause these bitches is contagious
So talk money, cause money that's my language
If it ain't that, then nigga don't say shit
Holla at me, I'm prolly a boost some deuce deuces
Chrome feet, leather seats, and the coupe's roofless
A pick of broke niggas, man your crew's useless
You niggas having dollars like we born Jewish
Before rap I made a fortune off the pharmaceutics
And all it took was a Section 8 apartment unit
A mastermind, a little grind, and the heart to do it
Nigga breaking bricks like a martial arts student
Now picture me, blue pradas on a black pavement
Wife beater, blue dickies off my ass hangin'
Trunk bangin', gold chains swangin'
And all money in is the song that I'm sangin' nigga

Old nine dollar signs, crimes and violent times
Face like I don't play, bet they won't smile in mine
You in the business then you out of line
Send a bullet shower by 'em
See 'em? Yea, they bury 
You don't want them hollows flyin', bet I got my alibi
Goin' on an exotic island where all the models slidin'
You either ride or hidin', quiet or 'bout it 'bout it
Cakin' or  nigga hustle 'fore you cry about it
I got a crowded closet, chinchilla should be
Gated in leather, and my vehicle's 260
What up, Nipsey? Soon as I hit the west I know you
Comin' through to get me with a groupie and a blickie
Quarter P sticky cause I smoke like a hippie
6-3-5-51-51-TIPSY, phone ringin', a 100k blingin'

Niggas be on my dick just like they chick is on my chain
Thang grippin' my grain, paint drip as a drain
Dip in the lane, slain, slip and you crash
Fuck with Nip and the clip'll clap quick as a stripper's ass
My hoodie's a skeleton equipped with the zipper mask
And I wear to help me see through to my temper task
Got us a jabberjaw, talk or jab and his jibs slip
Resulted to give his jibs a jab
I'm all about the guap comma, the hot dollar
The mozzarella, the parmesan, the piccata
The cheddar, the whole guada
Strip shitty, skip cities for trips, kiddies
With henny fifths, plenty fiddies to skinny dip titties
Trying to get this money, dot point, simple as dot point
Make it simple, I got point, you know about it

To my side, Slauson Ave
Top of the mornin’
Ain’t nobody out yet
Paint this picture for you
I’m Slauson Ave. and everything on that street
Used to carve our names into wet concrete
Used to sell dope, and I still smoke weed
Just got a record deal, but I been had cheese
Lookin’ at my pieces, like I been had these
Lookin’ at these streets like there is no peace
Faded off a strain of that strongest leaf, like
If only these damn palm trees could speak
But they can’t, so they don’t, I could, so I will
Some people never do it, they just wonder how it feel
In the hour of chaos, come the water by my wheel
Like, it’s all an illusion and the only thing real
Is me, and we, whatever we believe
And that’s what we project, so that’s what we perceive
Embedded in my mind, it’s the code and the creed
Never went against it as I rose in these streets
We was, two deep in a cuddy on E
And Fats dropped a blunt and burnt a hole in my seat
Used to get butterflies when I roll with the heat
But, not for long, say goodbye to the sweaty palm
Young nigga on a mission, tote heavy arms
Young nigga wanna bang, it’s a heavy cost
Now what he got up in his brain, that’s a heavy thought
Turned a nigga out, had us murderin’ for clout, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit
Nip Hussle, look, look
And this is it
My reality is creep
Slauson Ave. gangbang shit
Nip Hussle
I’m Military Drive, everything on that strip
West Avenue and Fresno, heritage to the sticks
That ole trailer park out on highway 90
Or down on Colobra road, you might find me
Blindly pacing in the darkness, heartless
Livin’ out my car, gotta find a place to park it
Swisher full of dirt weed, spark it up
Lookin for change like a bum with a plastic cup
Like fuck the police, I been harassed enough
Where good men get turned to ash and dust
Where cash is lust, with massive nuts I hold
They bust AK47’s 'til their guts explode
And they stain the asphalt permanently
Daemons hold a player down when he determined to leave
But my kid’s graduation, I’m determined to see
Never knew how right Jeremiah’s sermon could be
‘Cause God damn America, the system is flawed
So we pump this d, avoid apprehension by law
Lay and brawl, and the black ice invisible
It’s either Mickey D’s or be a full time criminal
Yeah
And this is it
Cause my life is shit
Hip hop is all I got
Know what I'm talkin' about?

I said no, sucker duck inside, stay afloat
These so-so ass rappers get no dough
In the presence of this hip-hop Jacque Cousto
Nip Hussle, I’m the freshest nigga you know
Got the Palazo Vove lookin’ like a light show
Slauson boy, or even numero uno
Bitches on my dick like flies on a fruit bowl
I just take my pick and we slide in the two-door
Mix a little Goose with some Nuvo, you know

I’m slangin’ dope, for the love of the money
I’m slangin’ dope, for the love of the money
I’m slangin’ dope, for the love of the money
They say, “God bless the child that can hold his own”
So, I’m up early in the mornin’ off that gold Patron
I’m tryin’ to mold my bro’s, tell ‘em hold they own
And I keep a bad bitch, I tell her, “Hold this zone”
I hit the lot, drop loot and then I roll it home
Hit the rim shop, slap ‘em on and then I roll my chrome
Nigga, I’m on my own and I’m on the zone
I hit the block, nigga’s lookin’ like they need a loan
I say, “Leave me alone”, ‘Cause when I was dead broke
I was baggin’ up candle wax sellin’ fake dope
Now I handle that, Cadillac pull up at the saddle ranch
Kettle One Vodka, Granddaddy in a sandwich bag
And those a whole zip nigga
And those was ’06 nigga
And now it’s ’08, I’m gettin’ more cake
I’m Nip Hussle the Great nigga
I’m on my business, fuck these bitches
Pistol on my side, ‘case a nigga start trippin’
I’m hustlin’ all day
Now I’m slangin’ dope, gettin’ paid
Rollin’ Phillies, getting’ blazed
Smokin’ that kush and haze
Now, I’m talkin’ to them niggas really getting’ it
If you ain’t seen a hundred g’s, little nigga, stop listenin’
I do appreciate the purchase but
Get on your grind nigga, money is the purpose
And bummy ain’t ‘gon work this, deeper than a surface
Hood nigga, out in Tokyo eatin’ swordfish
Konichiwa ma-ma, lets get it jerkin’
She don’t know what I’m sayin’, but she know what I’m sayin’
Look, I live life like I’m on the run with three strikes
‘Cause if everything is times-two I need three whites
Sands beach white, and I’ma kick the punk bitch out the house
If I say, “strip” and she think twice
But I ain’t trippin’ ‘cause I’m oh so paid
I’m just watchin’ the world turn through my Dolce shades
I’m high as a kite off that coco-haze
‘Cause that’s the only shit a nigga smoke these days
Look, I’m just a nigga tryin’ to see my cheese
With Gucci loafs at the bottom of my PRP’s
When I step, them bitches be like, “Who is he?”
I be like, “Nip Hussle baby, move with me”
Now I could, show you some things that you don’t usually see
You could overlook the city from the sunset suite
Then we could float off on the Pacific off that Veuve Clicquot
Motion sickness from the waves, give her Pepto-P
I-S y’all, yes y’all, Nipsey is the best y’all
Front of the buildin’, with a house on my neck dog
Yes, y’all push block money to the limit
I be in them spots ‘til the cops kicked off the hinges
Get off my biscuits, all about that quick flip
Anything I put in it, I get it back with interest
I take care of my business
Slauson boy I am this
Fly nigga on some neighborhood Crip shitWhoo... Kid!
It's what I do
Ha, Hussle
Yeah, yeah
Listen, look
Hussle
I came in this game with a dollar and a dream
Posted on the block, blue collar wasn’t me
My momma put me out when I was left up in the streets
But I ain't mad at it 'cause it made me a beast
I come from the era of the Fuck tha Police
When Johnnys pick you up and drop you off down the street
They say I’m too street
I paint pictures on these beats
When all they ever seem to hear is R.S.C
We all we got, like C.M.B
Same legend, different letters, you'll be R.I.P
If you go against we, and that's on me
Stick a fruit punch nigga make him bleed, I see
I'm something like a stunna, tell him get like me
Yellow gold chain, blue chucks, white tee
You do what you can, me — I does what I please
And fuck with Jay Rock, blue and red make green
So holla at ya boy, cause I'll be on T
I'm prolly on stage, finna light up my weed
Remember back in '03, when it was just me
Rolling on Slauson, on a chromed-out piece
Wrong man, money, I was just a young teen
50 Cent and Dr. Dre on a television screen
But now look at me, your boy gettin' cheese
I deserve every blessing for the struggle I seen
Hussle!You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mind
Them hard times, leave them days behind
I'm gettin' big cake, Bill Gates frame of mind
That's why I'm stuck with my bitch, can't change my mind
'Cause she was right there with me through my slangin' and crime
Through the pain and the lies, she made the sacrifice
She ain't the act up type when I ain't actin' right
Just around the way girl, but that's my bitch
Stay down for me, she could have my kids
Half of my bread, have the keys to my crib
I'ma treat you like the woman you is, that's on my mama
Just around the way girl, but I'm in love wit'cha
Guess it's the hoodster and the overall thug in ya
Probably the way you talk back when I'm fuckin' ya
Tell me you believe in my dream while I'm up in ya
And after climax, smoke a dime sack
Then sip Andre Mimosa and get closer
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mind
Just livin' life one day at a time
The hustle had you wrapped up before I said one rhyme
The hustle had my state of mind on a constant grind
With no room in my thought process for lies
With no, room in them jeans, I'm thought, "Damn, them thighs"
Just sprinkle a little brown sugar in your devilish smile
I could see you was a rebellious child
So we relate on more levels than the evident, it's deeper than time
Would you let your guard down? She told me, "Seek and I'll find"
Let's get away for the weekend, hit the freeway and fly
Now, I let you cry, dig deep in my mind
My mama seen the route chosen and she said goodbye
I was a boy in man clothing, how could I survive?
I met you, baked a cake, then divided the pie
You're special, even with all the ornaments off you
Going back and forth to court to support you often
That's why, when you was pregnant and you made that choice
I wiped your eye, don't cry, you shouldn't rush the course
Take your time, in life, you'll be up, fa sho
The sunshine comes after the storm 
And it's somethin' 'bout you, baby, that, I just can't resist
In deep thought while I'm giving you dick
And then you, in my crib, my emotions provoke
Basically, baby girl, you're dope, yo
You remind me of my D, I wanna grind
Tell me hit the spot, it ain't hard to find
And if left up to me, I'll provide
I'll be on your team if you'll be on mine
And with you by my side, we'll touch the sky
'Cause you the only way we could multiply
So don't ever believe if I say goodbye
'Cause if I turn my back, I'ma change my mind
Change my mindMy face fat, that means I'm eating — where your steaks at?
Where your real dogs that love you, not them fake cats?
Where them girls that got your name as a face tat?
Know you by your first, can't replace that
Beefin' with your niggas, so you stay strapped
Believe me it's religious, where your grace at?
Jumping off the porch, where your faith at?
Where the blocks where you made your plays at?
I put Slauson on the map, you gotta face facts
Kept it hood like six braids and blue wave caps
Said I couldn't but I did, you can't change that
You can hate it, you can love it, I don't change, jack
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no
Haters tryin' to fuck with my mind
Keep on talking from behind
I ain't got no worries at all
Nigga, I grind for this 
Homie, I'm made for this
This is too my exes that be sayin' we don't get along
They can hate but I know they gonna hear this song
Oh, and you ain't ever found a young nigga like me, no
Yeah I did what you said I wouldn't do
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it 
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no
Look, from one way bus stops, bustin' ‘til the gun stop
To pulling up in young drop, and parking front of drug spots
Look at how your young popped, look at how these youngs flock
Looking out my living room, like, "Hell no, I won't stop"
All I need is one shot, that's just how we was taught
Sitting in a circle all silent, that's 'cause funds talk
Desperation rubbed off, found myself, I was lost
Sketched it out, architect, the blueprint of a young boss
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no
Yeah, sometime I think, that
All I do is break hearts, all these nigga fake hard
I ain't catch a state charge, so I just wanna thank God
See me in that new car, see me with that new broad
Everything I've been through, tell me I went too far
I ain't done enough, nigga — screaming out, "Fuck niggas!"
This ain't good luck, nigga — another good run, nigga
I'd done had two or three, and between you and me
I don't hate none of y'all 'cause jealousy ain't new to me
Hate it or love it
Hate it or love it
I will never let you stop my grind
I came too far to look behind
You said I couldn't — I did it, I did it
You said I wouldn't — I did, I did
And you can't stop me, you can't stop me
You can't stop me, no
I think it's stronger than faith at this point
It's like a constant, it's like gravity, you know
You don't have faith in the ground
You just know when you put your feet on it it's gon' stand solid
And that's how I feel about musicLook
Do I love it do I lust it? The struggle of a hustla
Life of a banger, and death is no stranger
I know 'em like it's kin to me, took a few friends from me
It all make since one day eventually
I guess so
Granny said it happen and it's meant to be, just let go
But I can't, this shit keep itchin' me, like
Them niggas outta line how they came through
Shot 'em in his face point blank, left his brains blew
Now who gon' go for 'em? Probably be the same crew
When bangin' is your religion, it's like a sin not to
A lotta niggas ain't cut from that same cloth
Them, I give 'em space, gotta play it safe
'Cause hard niggas turn holy when they catch a case
I still bark, real talk, I'll never fake
In Hyde Park late night, still chop a eighth
And grind with the homies
Serve dimes with the homies
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle way
I'm in a '85 Regal, no tint, you see clear through
Young nigga, lookin' life in the rear view
Burner on my lap, kush in my ashtray
And that's how I'ma play it 'til my last day
I'm used to gettin' money in the fast lane
And I only fuck with bitches that be nasty
Leather and wood, my money is good
And I'm like a young celebrity in every hood
Gold ropes for the crew, chrome spokes on my coupe, two seater
Then I take off the roof like Katrina
And slide like a Visa up Slauson in a Beamer
Call me what you want just don't call me a dreamer
'Cause mines is reality
Grind, no salary
I came a long way from sellin' grams off Gramercy
Boulders off Brynhurst and sevens off Slauson
Now I got options, now I got it poppin'
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle way
Look
Take away my granny blessings I'd be history
Them bullets cuz shot through my 'Lac wouldn't have missed me
Come to my hood, say my name, I ain't no mystery
I'm probably in the spot, feel the hustla's energy
In the kitchen countin' cash, watchin' cocaine chemistry
Cookin' into crack, I was lookin' into rap
Hard to focus on my dreams when I'm lookin' at the facts
Shootin' down the street, now I'm lookin' at my MAC
And you can tell just lookin' at the facts
It's a coffin or a cell if you young and you black
With your name on it
Still, every car pass, bang on it
If you gon' do it, do it right and put that thang on you
You too deep in it to quit, I know the pain of it
You love the game but knowin' that the game doesn't
Love you back, love the fact this the same struggle
City to city, we products of the same hustle
From dope spots peekin' out blinds with the homies
Still lookin' for a better way
The smokers keep comin', droppin' work in they bucket
Another day, another dollar to make
And I be on the block
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All day grindin', I don't take no breaks 
All night grindin', I don't take no breaks
 'Cause I do it the hustle wayUgh, yeah, alright, shit hard as fuck
Ugh, look, hustle, all I do is rap about the fast life
You can’t relate, you need to get your cash right
I must have been a flashlight, in my past life
Cause all I do is shine, so blow me like a bagpipe
Wood, grains, grams and gold chainz
I’m shutting down traffic I’m switching 4 lanes
I’m hanging out the window every which way
Every nigga not a pimp but every bitch pay
I’m hard on these hoes like every single day
And I got a lot of bitches in every different states
I get a lot of pussy but I never got to pay
And all money is in all a nigga gotta say look
Now one time for my young grind
I spend hundreds, I smoke quarters and fuck…
Got no love for broke bitches with no drough
I dropped out but I done fine
I know you heard about them stages I been murdering
Light my swisher up as they rolling my room service in
The shopping sprees, all this fly shit I’m purchasing
Tattoos on my face cause now I know I’ll never work again
The pretty bitches that know why they sell purposes
But still blame me for the emotions they be working with
And jealous niggas that was once..
The kush I’m blowing, inside the coop that I’m swerving
We get that green, Charlie Sheen

And anyone in my way is gonna pay for that

My niggas gangbang, ***** move dope
Expect a war every summer like school clothes

Big burners on our laps when we ride by
Shoot it out in broad day 'cause it's on-sight
That South Central state of mind'll have you doin' life
The dead and gone so why we're here, we gettin' head n zone
Presidential suite, kush weed, and cafe Patrón
As we overlook the city from the Renaissance
Poppin' champagne, spill it like it's Evian

You made it through the darkest, you're the light
Now the world is yours

My mama drive an S5, my granny drive a Jag
My big brother in the pen, I'm fresh out and that's that
Crime family, taught to stay down and rise gradually
I serve like Agassi just to make my mark annually
Now run credit in these streets
You see my status be untouchable, hustle, no limit like Master P
And God willin', he'll forgive me 'fore he ask for me
But I'ma rich roller so a hoodster's what I had to be
Huh, and crash cops still harassin' me
I'm young and poppin' so these old niggas mad at me

Nigga, who the next on the west? Just ask the streets
And I bet they tell you Nip Hussle
And I counted five hundred grand in a duffle bag with my brother
And I put this on my mother
Made a rap dollar off this shit 'cause I'm a

I'm a gangbanger with a record deal
Fresh out the county jail, worth a couple mil
Ask on the west side, my name ring bells
So many diamonds in my Rollie bezel, you can't see twelve
I see clear through the motive and your false words
Stack Bundle a nigga and do me like Mossberg
For that exact same reason, I get off first
And keep a long clip, somethin' with a strong burst
To back a bitch nigga up like, "Yup"
Like  bike, loud clap, bright light, night-night
Nigga, it's Slauson Av' in this motherfucker
Hussle, Hussle, look

'Til the motherfuckin' cops come
And shoot 'til the shot done
I'm servin' red rum from the shotgun
I'm bartendin' red rum from the shotgun
The dope potent hit your nose make your snot run
Certified pimp, I could probably knock your top nun
I'm from where if you don't knock, you get knocked on
Thunderdome, you don't sock, you get socked on
You come a boy, you leave a man, that's how I got grown
My real life is better than these niggas rap songs
Guns, money, bitches, and a fast car
Couple hundred thousand buried in my backyard
I'm a real nigga, I don't gotta act hard
Try me if you wanna, watch how I reverse that charge
Guns, money, bitches, and a fast car
Couple hundred thousand stashed in my backyard
'Cause I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
Look, look, black Dickies, gold Rollie, blue colors
I'm hangin' out the window wit' the tool bustin'
Some off-brand shit, I heard the fool fussin'
I'm certified, they still think I'm tryna prove somethin'
The murder high, the dope blow, I'm tryna move somethin'
The spot rollin', now I'm swollen like I bruise money
Nigga I cruise luxury, up and down the broken blocks
In the city pumpin' poison like a 
I'm focused on my vision
I'm way too young to live the life that I'm livin'
But that's the life I was given
And God'll never give me somethin' I can never handle
And my flow is so hot like wet wax off a candle
I still bag crack and clear rap like a sample
And send Pams out of town to Atlanta for the stamp, uh
That's my answer, life's like cancer
Nigga, and I'm serious
'Cause I'm from R.S.C 'til the day that I die
I be from R.S.C 'til the day that I die

Nipsey Hussle, ay, this that new shit
I know y'all niggas done had this feeling before
All my real niggas, you know
I don't give a fuck what hood you from
Know what I'm talkin' about, just feel me on this
Look, I got a question
Have you ever felt this feeling of paranoia from killing?
Knowing your days numbered and your freedom ain't a given
When the bounties that drop, cuz, the Johnnys is hot
That's when you sloppy niggas make your first mistake and get caught
Facing football numbers'll have him show his true colors
Pride reduced to nothin', got him cryin' for his mother
I spit that shit that make a nigga think twice
'Cause I got too many homies in the county facing life
Injunction gang, they call us terrorists now
We cliqued up with Osama to shoot the bird down
And now that you feds is listenin'
Y'all can suck my dick, I'll kill your witness
T.I.'s king of the south, but I'm from South Central
And I'm the next nigga out the West, pay attention
Pushin' pounds out of town in the rental
To sittin' on chrome, beats rattlin' my window
I done it all, I was young up in the game
Put a gun up in his face, take his money then his chain
How many times I risk trips to the pen?
Money, cars, and clothes with my adolescent grin
I never sniffed no coke, that ain't my thang, loc
I mix the Grey Goose with lemon juice and weed smoke
Crips say cuz hard, Damus say "Blood fresh"
I'm from a place where you the victim or the suspect
So when I spit that hood shit, you know I ain't tryin'
And when I spit that hood shit, you know I ain't lyin'
Two 12's in my trunk, let my speakers bang
Half a bird on my neck, let my chain hang
Go 'head and jock, bitch, I know you like them rocks
Whoever said time is money musta seen my watch
Them Alpinas on that Lincoln is nice
They had the diamonds on my cross, peep the passion of Christ
Hoo, hold up, hold up, hold up, homie

Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
Look, I'm married to this game, that's who I made my wife
Said I'll die alone, I told that bitch she prolly right
One thing that's for sure, not a stranger to this life
Got a safe that's full of Franklins and a shoulder full of stripes
I don't know a nigga like myself
I say self made, meanin' I designed myself
County jail fades, you can pull my file yourself
Bar raised, swallow rocks, I'm gettin' high myself
Damn right, I like the life I built
I'm from west side, 60, shit, I might got killed
Standin' so tall, they think I might got stilts
Legendary baller, like Mike, like Wilt
'96 Impala thug, life on wheels
Up against the walls, squabble at Fox Hills
Like a motherfuckin' boss, ask me how I feel
Successful street nigga touchin' his first mil 
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life
All my life, been grindin' all my life
Sacrificed, hustled, paid the price
Want a slice, I could roll the dice
That's why, all my life, I been grindin' all my life

It look like I'm just gon' keep on gettin' rich
I know that west side, RSC's is us
LAPD on my dick, I'ma squeeze and bust
If a rap nigga dead, switch cheese and bust
All this rap money, nigga, look I need too much
Money, loyalty and love, in the dream we trust
You be switchin' up the players on your team too much
Tiny copy, that's my loc, yo supreme, what up
And we travel round the world gettin' cream and what
Ain't you get off on whoever hustle, seem to rush
Las Vegas, strip pop, yeah, you creep them punks
After all that lookin' tough, all he see was stumps
50 Cent and Mayweather flee the scene with usMotherfuckers better duck when I get cracking
‘Cause I’ll shoot up your block
Double-back and asked the cops, "What happened?"
I’m from the era of the yellow-tape barrier
Double-homicide like a twelve-gauge barrel
Seen it all, done it all, but I ain’t dead yet
That’s why I look at life like a Vietnam Vet
Young nigga, selling work on the step
Workers smokin’ for his car, put in work for the set
I’m no longer only living for the purpose of the set
Even though at that time my whole life was a mess
Look, this hood shit is like a bucket-head bitch
Yeah, you know she ain’t shit, you still fuck on that bitch
And to the naked eye, it’s like you stuck on that bitch
But really how you see it, you just fucking that bitch
Truth be told, I really lost hope when I was sixteen
Like fuck life cuz, whatever nigga, Sixty
Man I put that on me
Young nigga, really came from nothing
Everything I got came from hustling
Man I put that on me
I was right there seven days a week
Four corners, one month, seven days a piece
Man I put that on me
I really bang, shot niggas in they own street
New killin’s in the city over old beef
Man I put that on me
Streets won’t let me breathe
I wish these streets would set me free
Man I put that on me
Take away my Grannies blessings, I be history
The bullets cuz shot through the ‘Lac, wouldn't of missed me
OT, on my way back home
Out in Vegas, nigga had to flush ‘bout eight zones
Two burners in the stash, 10 West doing ninety
Now what you think happened? Shit, Johnny got behind me
Eyes red from the smoke, Fats license revoked
Said, “Y’all two are straight, but the car got to go”
I’m like, “fuck.”
‘Cause I would jis up, I ain’t superstitious, but this is some bullshit luck
To make it worse, when we got dropped at the Truck Center
Two white boys, threw a bottle like, “fuck niggas”
Hotels, didn’t want to give us a room
Two cars in they lot, they try to say that it’s full
We musta’ walked ‘til we found Greyhound
Spent the last the tickets, we was right downtown
Man I put that on me
Young nigga, really came from nothing
Everything I got came from hustling
Man I put that on me
I was right there seven days a week
Four corners, one month, seven days a piece
Man I put that on me
I really bang, shot niggas in they own street
New killin’s in the city over old beef
Man I put that on me
Streets won’t let me breathe
I wish these streets would set me free
Man I put that on meLight that shit, nigga, smoke that
All the chronic in the sky
Feel me, feel me
Stop, look, and listen
Crank your box, turn up your system
Bang it on the block where you pitchin'
My synthesis is reminiscent of what rap missin'
My gold glisten due to the zones I sold in the district
I got bitches, that got niggas, that got digits
When she hit the mall, it's his cash she shoppin' with
She know my size, it's 36 and 10 in kicks
So she spend it, then hit the women's shit and shoplift
It's crazy how many ladies call me "baby"
Monica and Mercedes, Tamika and LaShay
We be up all night, fuckin', she suckin' monkey bites on my swipe
Smokin' blunts like this must be life
But then it's back to the grind and grizzly, ya'm'sayin'
With so much work, I chop rocks iwth guillotines
I want big things but them thoughts is still a dream
So I'm on the block until I get the cheese, 'cause
The paper, the cash, the dollars, the profit I'm after
You savin' a stash, shoebox and what's under your mattress
I stay on the ave, I've been watchin' the murders happen
I hit the alley, get a sack and burn a blunt and pass it
On the block, on the bike, on the handlebars I'm rollin'
Duckin' them choppers that talk and watch when they patrollin'
Chrome super soaker, pockets with rocks bulgin'
Double ups under Folger cans, don't let the man know this
Pull up, what up? What you need? Bounce
Eighths to quarters to halves to the whole ounce
My niggas use methods to stretch it and zone out
And connect with Mexicans sendin' pounds down south
Rimpau ain't a mystery, we blast them guns
I hold down four blocks just standing on one
My life is Russian Roulette and it's randomly spun
Put heaters in granny's house just to her my love
And yeah, my mama crazy but she pampered the funds
She knew that I wasn't just the average son
I'm Slauson, where if you criss-cross, get jumped
We drive MC's with Hammers that make you run, see
I was raised where all the damage is done
I'll shoot dice late night where niggas won't even come
It's murder, ever since Joe's Juicy Burger
Round here, cowards with Jheri curls get burnt up
Niggas, I'm from the slums
And down here, it's hard to breathe when you got a shell stuck in your lungs
And I do it for fun, the hood need me here
The smokers cheer when I run from the ones, come on
Since a youngster, always loved the hood
Didn't know the history but I knew it was more to it
Croker Sacks with Dickies pants, and hard music
Shorty hop to it, lovin' the movement, she true indeed
She puff weed like me, but she don't MC
High off the doja green, L.A. chosen scene
Back streets like, "Nigga, this is alley music"
Pump sacks how my niggas off in Cali do it
Often badly bruisin' haters 'cause they mad we do it
Get that money then fly just like a pack of poison
Then heatin' on 'em like Vicks
We QB, passin' the spliff, packages sell, tryna grip
From the ceiling to floor, how that dough growing
Mami fine, lovin' the hustle like I love to do it
Can't knock it, we back on the block with K-Swiss and Converse
White Tee and sharp creases what we work forPiss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Listen, look, walkin' up the block in Dickies
To hittin' corners on chrome, pocket full of 20s
Y'all know my style, from hittin' licks and splittin' 50/50
To all expense paid trips 'cause they request for Nipsey
Let's get this bread, nigga
Been on my grind since '99, and like I said, nigga
A broke nigga might as well just be a dead nigga
And when you starvin', you gon' eat whatever's fed to you
Bite the hand that feeds you, you deserve to eat lead, nigga
You pitchin' crumbs to these pigeons, you a breadwinner
All outta bread, they start peckin' at your head, nigga
The loyalty is gone now, so the game different
It's like we can't really ball 'cause we playin' injured
So many undercover niggas in the mix
On top of that, these cameras on these corners taking pictures
My niggas doin' time, I shoot a line and send a flick to
Have money on my mind, now, I, I, I get it
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
I came a long way from playing X to that bird cage
On Slauson Avenue, yeah, home of the real bird gang
Did my curb thang, sat in spots 'til the bird came
Locked me in them cold chains, all over the cocaine
Cold game, movin' with no brains
Got bags of the propane and I'm right back, doin' my own thing
I speak no names, I run with my own gangs
Stay puffin' the purple rain, some shit ain't gon' never change
Put the blow on the block, niggas lovin' what the weather bring
The palms of my young hands whiter than Kevin Federline's
Hallucinate for a minute, go hard off the amphetamines
I got the prescription you need, call me Mister Medicine
Distribute crack rock, you can call me Mister Medellin
Like Rafael Ochoa, 'cause he get that heavy green
I wish a nigga would try and get me
I'm going out like Rocket in Colors, you bitch niggas dyin' with me
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Neighborhood Nip Hussle, look
Impossible odds, every boss take a loss
Still I live for my people, and I die for my squad
See, I come from the struggle, I was brought up to hustle
Me and my mama and my granny and my big brother
My uncle Reggie smoke dope but we still love him
He pawned my granny wedding ring and she still trust him
If I ruled the world I wouldn't change nothin'
I thank the Lord for my struggle 'cause I came from it
Hustle
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw
Piss poor nigga from the hood but I blew
Now I bounce 6-4's up and down Crenshaw

Ha-ha, yeah man, it's that G.E.D shit, you feel me?
And I am the one and only el natural nino
Hittin' every dollar I holla, ha, let's go
Yo, it's that H-borough, too thorough
A block away from Melrose, the nigga's gettin' stuck like velcro
The prostitutes ain't the only ones that sell blow
Hell no, cellphone pictures with the jail pose 
I can tell yo, why these ladies love me now
Run me down, give her to my dogs like puppy chow
You couldn't touch my style, not on your best day
Comprende? Your men lay when the M10 spray
Fuck what them say, I'm tight quarterbackin' it
When I'm throwin' bullets I be accurate
Weekends on the bully, they be jackin' shit
That's why I be packin' shit
The only time you shoot is at a hoop when you practicin'
Runnin' drills, I dream to see a hundred mils
Stuntin' ill 'til my pockets heavier than Uncle Phil
Tell your son to chill, he ain't want to deal
Try it fam, I'm Iron Man 'cause I come wit' steel
I wish a sucka will, my dudes thugs for real
He probably think I'm George Foreman how I punch his grill
What's the deal yo? Talkin' what I'm livin' now
Wanna fuck these bitches I be diggin' out? 
Ay, niggas already know
Labels wanna fuck with these motherfuckers
G.E.D nigga, Gettin' Every Dollar, nigga, you understand?
Niggas got a bad tendency to hate on a young nigga out here gettin' it, you feel me?
I just tell 'em, look man, don't be mad at me homie
This shit ain't my fault I went hard at a young age, nigga
I stood on this block while you niggas was evading cops
Get Money or Stay Bummy nigga, Slauson boy, It’s Your Choice, Hussle
Yo, this Hutch, I ain't in right now but please– uh you know, I'm out, flossin', tossin', dippin', and trippin', you know what I'm sayin'?
Ay, Hutch man, they cleaned your momma house man
I don't know what they got–I'm broke man, and they lookin' for us man, call me over at  house
Man check this out homie
Look, it's 10 stacks on my neck and 20 more on my brodie's shit
I'm self-made, ain't no nigga ever throw me shit
Outside my enemies, I'm watchin' who I'm rollin' with
That .40 on me like a fucking Motorola clip
Shit, I feel like a million when I'm fo' wheelin'
That 745 parked in front of your buildin'
Designer jeans, Gucci loaf, wear my gold, kill it
I got a kilo on my neck, I'ma go get it
See what you lookin' at now that's my old vision 
Chess moves, my next move's to get more business 
I promise I be on my tip 'til my toes give in
I'ma always shine, I'll never let my glow blemish
I hear you talkin' but fuck what you niggas say
'Cause real niggas know a real nigga demonstrate
And real niggas know it's real 'cause I illustrate
That feelin' of a young hood nigga when he gettin' cake
Glocks and gauges puttin' faces on the newspaper
I can't get caught for old crimes and catch new cases
Blocks invaders spite rage just if you've made it
Homies in the holdin' tanks wit' no shoe laces
Back on the streets I'm rollin' weed and see through paper
Dippin' down the shore, S-types with the blue paint
Poppin' tops off bottles with the gold label
It's pretty good to say I dropped out the tenth grade
I'm better than ever, this rap shit is nathin'
This for my niggas in the county on the Mainline
Ay this dedicated to my nigga, J-Stone, you know what I'm sayin'?
Do your time nigga, don't let your time do you, you already know
Keep it all the way though, you know what I'm sayin'?
My niggas Shade and Blue, what's up cuh?
I'm out here in New York, turned up nigga, smokin' on this kush
Fuckin' wit' my Harlem niggas, my Brooklyn niggas, my Uptown niggas, ay Smoke, a lot of these niggas, man
We break bread like it's Hanukkah, G.E.D's my moniker
Every day I be scoured up, shit, my dollars up
I'm good, in the hood, nigga I'm okay
Steal my shit I'm comin' at you like O.J
And broad day them niggas comin' with them fists
Dressed in all black hittin' it for the genesis
Bringin' extra clips, finna catch a lick
Hit the connect spot, left me like half a brick
Niggas act as if my guys ain't hard
Homie we ain't petty, we don't steal, we rob
Niggas hit the ER when we pull that heat God
First, they hear the click-clack then they get the shit bad
Takin' jewels and be flossin' wit' it
9/11 kid, we run our own abortion clinic, huh
Got a .40 on my 40 waistline
Any nigga try and take mine gon' take nine, nigga
Ay, I'ma come through with the whole clique though
You might catch more than just nine nigga
Nah, niggas bustin' choppers at you nigga
You do the math homie, that's damn near a thousand shells cuh
You know what I'm sayin'?
And you know, I'm from the  murder capital nigga
South Central Los Angeles nigga, ain't no black Superman
We don't wear capes nigga, we chop eights
Yeah, I mean, we hop gates and run from them Johnny's nigga
Neighborhood shit nigga, we set Crips
Nigga this hood ain't no Crip or Blood shit
Nigga this Crip on Crip, Blood on Blood, real on fakeMusic
Cookin' Soul'
Uh, uh
It's Hussle
It's Hussle, yeah
Where we left off on volume 2, I'ma pick you back up on volume 3
You know, uh
You gotta get up and go make this shit happen, my nigga
I told you
Every day my shit get bigger and better, my nigga
I was just in the county jail, nigga
No bail, nigga
Look, look
That I would be the best rapper, yeah, I knew it then
Used to tell my mama 'bout the houses we'll be movin' in
'Cause fast money took my focus off this music shit
'Til Johnny Shines introduced me to his Jewish friend
Damn, before you ball, gotta grind first
'Cause the Palazzo's a far cry from Brynhurst
Them niggas never really figured that it might work
I had faith, gave my life, now my life's worth
So much more than money's ever meant
I'm gettin' love in every city you ain't never been
The Sheriff told me roll it up, was focused ever since
Dreams come true, young nigga, I'm the evidence
That's only if you put the effort in
Some of 'em gon' die, others'll get life in the pen
Now, just sit with that and let it sink in
Now get your money up and make sure you ain't one of them

Riddin’ with a young loc’, dippin’ through them trenches
My rap sheet, full of felony offenses
I feel her energy, she’s sendin’ me them glimpses
She only messin’ with them ballers and them Benz’s
Her taste is expensive, every day’s Christmas
You wanna taste, gotta treat
And thou’ll never trick, so we’ll never be
That’s what they all say, but their games so weak
Little momma want a real young nigga like me

Clear baggie, white powder, snowflakes
I can’t stop, freight train, no breaks
She’s so hot she make lanes, blow safes

I got spots, make drops, rotate
And when she ride passenger side it’s like a showcase

Slauson Boy Records
Ha ha, right
Ay, ay, my nigga, look, check this out, homie
Stop blowin' up my muthafuckin' phone, cuz
A nigga ain't gon' get there no quicker, you feel me?
My nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, quick to switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Always call me back, say they need a sack
So nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Blowin' up my phone, they need the zones
So nigga I be makin' them swerves
Look, I stay on the grind
That's why you see me on the BG, I stay on the dime
I stash money out of sight, but it stay on my mind
Sells blowin' up my phone, so I stay on my line
I see these dumb niggas, chasin' sales down the block
Fuckin' young niggas, takin' mark money from the cops
Every day I hit the turf, I'm like, "just come through"
Servin' quarters to the homies in the luxury coupe
I sip the Veuv and eat cake, and blow the kush through the roof
And play cat and mouse with CRASH cops, you know how we do
Stay off the radar, I dipped on Johnny in the Regal
Cracked a fat bitch, the next day I took her Geo
Green on green tint with Betty Boop in her window
Same block, same cop, they drove right past a nigga
I'm smarter than the average nigga from your set
Nip Hussle, muthafucka, I got traps to check
My nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, quick to switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Always call me back, say they need a sack
So nigga, I be makin' them swerves

These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Blowin' up my phone, they need the zones
So nigga I be makin' them swerves
I don't about y'all niggas but, uh, me, I got a quota every day
I wear the same Dickies short but stay with the fresh J's
Little hoodrat bitch, so I stay with the fresh braids
Keep a spot on the block to tuck when the feds raid
My network on the turf, it's like the mob
When I pull up on my block, all my workers on they job
I give 'em their work, they give me my cash 
They pay for a seven, I throw 'em a half
I'm tryna connects on the herd and spread like a rash
'Cause I heard in D.C., it's 500 a half
That's a thousand a whole  -- fuck it, I'll be out in the cold
And cook the quarters on a portable stove, my nigga
No, you don't live like this
You ain't never hit a lick and shook town for the flip
You never called UPS to track the package you sent
You never broke the bricks in a Motel 6, my nigga
My nigga, I be makin' them swerves

Always call me back, say they need a sack
So nigga, I be makin' them swerves
I do my thang, quick to switchin' lanes
These niggas, man, they get on my nerves
Blowin' up my phone, they need the zones
So nigga I be makin' them swerves
Why they sold bounce and grind motion pounds on the eastside
Cop before the cal backed and hopped out the G ride
Socked out niggas you thought was real killers
That Crenshaw summer school, Thunderdome in the village
Back in them days when Rack Capone knocked out Zay
And Nip Hussle had to pardon his fade
When robbin' niggas was the way that we ate
That check cashing, sock a nigga, ripped his pockets then shake
And Wet be my blue cuddie and that chrome .380
Young niggas havin' money, tuckin' thousands daily
Johnny was on us, rough, pulled me over on a dime
A quarter in my ass with a pocket full of cash
I had some Dickies shorts on, cop told me spread my feet
That's when a nigga like me thank God for briefs
Enough of that though, I'm outta here, I had a long day
I'm finna shake, cuz, and go do what the song say
My nigga, I be makin' them swervesYeah, look
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect
Khakis, Chucks, beanie, white tees
You can tell where I'm from by the strings in my Nikes
Hatin' niggas is mad, lookin' mean, they don't like me
A certified chipper in these streets, I'm likely
To shut down the block with hours of powder
Have burners in his spot, boilin' grease in the pot
Fiends leanin' like kickstands, they say he was a preacher man
The lady with that bag down there pregnant, pushin' bastards
Yeah, it ruined lives but they gon' die anyway
If they don't get it from me, they gon' buy it anyway
And enemies could take your life any day
Let's do it for Baby Bo and ride on these fuck faces
Foldin' the sides of my Chuck Taylors
Black, with the matching knob on my trunk bangin'
Black on black for the murder weapon
I'm from where they five years old and see a murder happen
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change
I love spending money and I love to gangbang
I like nice things, diamonds on my neck
Fuck bad bitches, show these hoes no respect
I call it how I see it, I'm never gon' change

West coast, gotta love it
Born and raised out the gutter
Came from the bottom of it
Nigga I was tired of stuggling
No more days of riding buckets, doe doe blaze and I done puffed it
Lowrider blue and chrome, two phones I done done it
Jaguar roof gone, new clothes riding rugged
Listening to my new song, yeah I probably gotta club it
I can teach you how to cut it, how to make the profit double
How to load it, how to bust it, J Stone hot as oven
Not to mention I spit pimping, proposition gotta listen
Dirty like the pots in kitchens, four 'lacs, tops missing
Dope tracks, not syringes, come and visit how i'm living
Houses and apartment buildings, all got the projects in them
We all got exotic women, baby mommas father children
Crazy drama robbing, killing, niggas rocking Dodger fitteds
Daytonas spinning, nigga, riding on them chrome wheels
Kush got me spinning higher than a phone bill
Bitch i'm getting paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid

Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid
Every club I walk in, bitch I get paid
They call me, G-I J-O, pay me cause I say so
Rather it be rap money, flocking or them quaaludes
Bank rolls and beemers mandatory when you're this on
Pat wine and ruby red, I gotta get my sip on
Bad bitch in mac lips I gotta get my dick on
Blue hundred dollar bills, Aye Nip I gotta get my crip on
Don't I walk like a gang of money? Talk like a gang of money?
Talk like I got it too? Sagging when i'm in these streets and i'm with a bunch of goons
The killers and gorillas the only niggas that I hang with
Slauson Ave, S-hat bangers who I bang with
Grab the microphone and I get paid to spit the same shit
Walk inside the club, we hella chunky bitch we gang thick
O.M.G. the brand, bitch and i'm sure you heard about it
I ain't showing up unless it's money or the bank deposits
What you think we grinded all this time to walk away with nothing?
Bitch stop playing with my money, let me hold something, yeah
Everytime i'm talking, bitch I get paid

I'm finna treat this rap just like packs and move it
Make true music, think I won’t recoup then you stupid
I been a hustler so I felt the movement
When it's time to switch rhymes, pull the blinds and blueprint
Had to open my eyes, see the signs and used 'em
How most of my niggas died or locked down, secluded
When devoted to the block, this is all you’re used to
Pledge allegiance to the present, fuck the past and future
We was brought up quick, would sit off Slauson and pitch
Start with the sack, we could all get rich
I was involved in shit, I can't hardly spit
I went hard for the chips 'cause the odds against us
Never listened to them old heads
On the block with two 11s 'til 11 at night
When told it's more to life than is evident sight
A dope head's on ten-speed bikes with more feds patrollin'
On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That’s where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black
On the block
Look at the Johnnys, they thirsty
Willin’ to harm me and hurt me
Had me in county's infirmary
On the block
And all the flippers is watchin’ us, flipping them rockers
They on it 'cause we gettin' it proper
On the block
I been know to keep the Glock cocked
Stayin' fully prepared, watchin’ for pop shots
And it's death for he, who test them three
One of the top five best with heat
Ain't no changin' me
I'll be the same 'til these lames blow brains for me
Yeah, staredowns and pounds
Keys and fleas and hoes that'll hold you down
Mishaps and craps
Crenshaw traps, lowkey homies on crack
We got sacks and MACs
Niggas who don't do daps and roll Fleetwood Cadillacs
And then there's that squad of us, that's hard to touch
We be so marvelous, no starvin' us
In the Porsche C2 hard on clutch
With your broad, givin' balls to her
And the porch seet to hard, don't clutch
With your pork, givin' balls to her
Come on
On the block
That's where the blammers explode

Look at the Johnnys, they thirsty
Willin' to harm me and hurt me
Had me in county's infirmary
On the block
And all the flippers is watchin' us, flipping them rockers
They on it 'cause we gettin' it proper
On the block
I'm known for bein' young and rebellious
So you can die with one flex of the pelvis
Been had the Glock 'fore Young Slauson was popular
Slauson'll pop ya frequently, families is singin' operas
Amazing grace, shoot accurate, no need for a doctor
Promise you'll leave Earth at the scene where they spot your dome
Fuck with cops, so I vacate in the Bens with a diva that's proper
Fuck colds backseats with a copper, feel me?
I been there, done that in the Franco Harris
Stayin' away from the sheriffs, pushin' the sack
On the block
The baby boy hustled from dusk to dawn
Don't be the one to think I'm wrong
And catch it with a heat bigger than Dustin Hoff's
Cut your circulation, tape your section off
Hit you, and it ain't even for respect at all
'Cause niggas already know that the 'Vette is hard
On the block
That's where the blammers explode
And young niggas turn pro from their amateur roles
On the block
That's where the smokers is at
They know the spot for crack, 12 noon to jet black

They on it 'cause we gettin' it properLyrics From Snippet
I see you naked with my eyes closed
Pull up on you, different time zone
Book a flight to keep the vibe goingLook, now I got
Big burners on my lap, I ain’t gonna talk it out
A rich killer, bet a thousand that I chalk him out
Since I’m the most talked about, on this block I walk about
Gotta keep that biscuit like Rosco’s Waffle House
Last squabble, knocked him out
Last shootout, shot him out
Last nigga in the club talked shit, we stomped him out
Champagne bottle to yo head like Steve Stout
Makin’ sure my enemies dead, that’s we ‘bout
Makin’ sure my peoples straight ‘fore I leave out
Crooked letter-i-x-t-y what I scream out
Wishin’ I could break my niggas Black Sam and Steez out
So we could back the matching black-on-black twelve-v’s out
My spot rollin’, so as I get it I’m tellin’ ‘em, “we out”
My Glock loaded, if I show it, I’ma squeeze out, believe that
Money on my mind, look I need that
I’m pissin’ Hennessy and Kush is what I breathe out
Big money, big pistol’s how I’m comin’ ‘cause I’m
Thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’
You talkin’ loud, but you ain’t sayin’ nothin, bitch I’m
Thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’
Fly ass sag, stupid ass swag, outfit’s sick, pocket full of cash
Posted on the block, marijuana and the crack, bitch I’m
Thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’
I’d like to welcome everybody to my state of mind
Murder my enemies one at a time, bitch I’m on the grind
Since I was small dog, man I been slangin’
Runnin’ though the alleyway, totin’ AK’s
A million ways to get paid, how you dog?
You got a bike? You got a car? You got a yacht dog?
You got a ‘Vette, or do you fly in a jet?
I am ain’t mad get your money, represent your set
Nigga’s ain’t learn the fuckin’ g-code yet?
Nigga snitch, you gon’ die, how we rock on that Southside
Yours lookin’ at me crazy, my teeth don’t come out
This ain’t no grill right here, me and my niggas pop pills
And I ain’t afraid to say, pouring in the jungle, so nigga I ain’t scared
Really thuggin with a ? around his wrist
I’m behind him in a Phantom with no shirt on in that bitch
Big money, big pistol’s how I’m comin’ ‘cause I’m

All I know is the block and how to get it hard
I serve it hard, flippers boy, I’m a whippa’ boy
Talkin’ loud? Get your issue, I’ll whip you boy
Christmas time all year, ‘cause I keep a toy
Since Pac hollered, “Thug Life”, shit, I been thuggin’
That explains all these golds and why I’m mean muggin’
The soft boss, when I talk, shit, it means somethin’
Why’s you talkin’ ‘bout what you did, but you ain’t seen nothin’
Been a G, ‘fore the O, shit, I had a beef
Known hood niggas who retired off of pushin’ d
Straight dog, ain’t no muafuckin puss in me
I told the muafuckin’ judge, “I ain’t rattin’, throw the book at me”
The g-code, what I live by, my own zone
I’m headfirst, like puttin’ muafuckin clothes on
The lead burst down here in the traps
That explains why we thuggin’ like that
Big money, big pistol’s how I’m comin’ ‘cause I’m
Thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’, thuggin’

Sometimes you gotta talk that talk to them Nipsey
Sometimes they can't handle it though
But we don't care
Yeah, it's a moment this special
This what happens stay down game bless you
This what happens don't fold the game test you
If you pass it you gone they can't catch you and its permanent
I been down I deserve this shit
Ruff Ryder Roc-A-Fella on my Murda shit
Tryna threat me with the fame ain't concerned with it
Only worry about the green I'm a herbalist
Even though next level look still achieving those
Seven digits model bitches and arena shows
Hundred-thousand make a transfer cause my visa low
Every week I send a text like that to GSO
In the back feeling like Jigga in the GS4
Me and Boogie on some need to know
Watching ATL nigga on the PS4
See they mad at us
They hating on us I don't even know
'Cause Nipsey Hussle in a league his own
Niggas lame but to each his own
Changed the game, now I need a throne
Half a mil to Uncle Sam hate to see it go
All money in the squad nigga even though
Man it's hot like a kettle
Calling from the ghetto
Live from the ghetto
Live from the ghetto
We ain't like you
We don't like you
We don't like you
We ain't nothing like you
Goddamn we'd snipe you
Calling from the ghetto
Calling from the ghetto
We need help down here food around here
Or we gon spray everything down here
Calling from the ghetto
Live from the ghetto
Pick up my call from the ghetto
Pick up my call from the ghetto
We ain't like you
We ain't never like you
We ain't even like your type
Man we'll snipe your type
Live from the ghetto
Man it's live from the ghetto
Came from nothing and made it something
Now I got the whole hood jumping
Tell me what you want now
Calling from the ghetto
Got the block hot like a kettle
Can't even come back to your hood
Everywhere and we here yeah we good yeahIt's so hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga, I ain't leavin'
Lookit, I show niggas too much love, not enough discipline
Now look at all this backwards shit a nigga in
Homies want my head, they'd rather see me dead
Than papered up on BET, that nigga gettin' bread
What you thought? What you think? What that shit do?
I heard Nipsey gettin' paper, is that shit true?
Yeah, he used to hustle off Slauson
Type of nigga probably deuce up on a coffin
'Cause homies' families was hurtin'
But what's it worth when these niggas want you curtains?
Yeah, I know, they probably smile up in your face
But I know you niggas phony 'cause there's sweat up in your shake
Nigga, jealousy, how easily niggas forget
Used to walk through the hood, nigga didn't have shit
I just hustled off the corner, and I stacked a couple chips
Then I hit the parking lot, with that brand new whip
How you love that? Ain't you 'posed to smile for me?
Why you hate that? Oh, you playin' high for me
They say cut the grass and the snakes'll show
Is you niggas mad at me or do you hate my dough?
Just let me know
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga, I ain't leavin'
I said it's hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
It's so hard out here
But my nigga, I ain't leavin', no
When I was 15, my mama kicked me out and changed the locks
Her husband used to beat on us and talk shit a lot
"You ain't my daddy, nigga, I ain't gotta listen to you"
Then my mama switched sides, like, "Nigga, yeah you do"
I used to wanna stay away, used to hate to come home
Outcasted from the family 'cause we wasn't his own
Now that's scandalous — how you let him hit me that hard?
And that's scandalous — how you let your two kids starve?
No lunch money, was bummy, and treated like a step-child
Let me loose on these streets, the nigga went wild
No direction, false concept of family
Quick to bust the first damn burner that they handed me
Mama, these white folks'll never understand a G
Cryin' to the judge and they still reprimanded me
Used to wonder why you act like you always was mad at me
When cuz was the issue, but mama, I forgive you
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga, I ain't leavin'
I said it's hard out here
But I'm still breathin'
It's so hard out here
But my nigga, I ain't leavin', noWhat's your life like nigga mine's great
I done made it out despite my city's crime rate
Every single rule nigga that's what I break
Hit me like a omen seize the moment Hussle why wait
One thing I never do is exercise hate
But I'm the illest nigga doin' this in my state
Probably my country, probably this world
Anywhere I see myself I bet I get there
If there's a throne to be sat on I bet I sit there
If there's a crown to be worn I bet it fit yea
Call me king nip c note you niggas is pussy
3 squares like C low
Blood suckin' people like man made mosquitos
Once a month a nigga still gotta see my p.o
Had so many cars but I ain't never seen a repo
Leather seat flow sippin' mile high mojitos
Before success is what comes after calico
Niggas chase fame like O.J. and clicquot
Quick sand stance pay attention watch 'em sink slow
In retrospect 15 was like cinco
Seconds in the spot light and watch 'em walk off
Know you official when the referee is in for you
And all your hip hop role models is startin' to mention you
Resurrect the west I'm just doin' what I'm meant to do
Two words then who? if it isn't dude ...Yeah, Neighborhood, tiny locs do the most
Nip Hussle in this muthafucka
Slauson Boy, you niggas already know what it is
Huh? Hood shit
Give y'all a little throwback, like this
Look, look
With so much drama in the RSC
Most of these niggas in L.A. ain't got the heart to beef, so don't
Come around my around my way
Young niggas in the back shootin' dice or on the roof with K's
Now as I, step out my closet, put my keys in my car
Dippin' down the 'shaw, made a left on Hyde Park
Seen some off-brand niggas lookin' shady
Threw my hood, they start laughin' tryna play me, pssh
6-0 degrees got me rollin' up my sleeves
Reachin' for my Ruger that's behind my AC, fa sheez
I pull up on 'em slow, and hell nah, I ain't hesitate to squeeze
'Cause I'm a tiny loc line presser
You might mess up, make the wrong turn off Slauson and learn a life lesson
MACs with extended magazine and suppressors
Strapped 'cause the police ain't on the streets to protect us
Trapped in a sting, it's all a scheme to collect us
Lock us up in cages that they know ain't gon' correct us
Y'all done F'd up — you from the West, huh?
You got it on your mind, you should get it off you chest, cuh
Lotta speculation who gon' be the next up
Block money, tell these rappers get they checks up
Before you hit the West, charger sock kicks up
So when you get took for your change you could text us
Between Draws and the homie in the red Chucks
It's safe to say we got this whole shit sewed up
We got this whole shit sewed up
I'm just looking for some more kush to roll up
Always smoking that la la la
To keep my brain maintainin' through drama, I'm
Not the one, we jackin' for beats on back streets
With aluminum bats, toe tags, and PD
That's any jurisdiction, in or out the district
7-7 division of crime scene forensic
My 9 blur the vision of material witness
20/20 to blind, now she need prescriptions, look
Cut the lights out and twist up a sack
'Cause the feds tappin' my hood, you get all that
From the birds to the squad to the cameras in the back
Of the routes by field where I handle the pack
See, a nigga like me just had to attack
In junior high, I ain't had no sack lunch, in fact
I used to flip a quarter, get like me for change
Now I flip quarter kilos of 'caine and cop againAll Money In, No Money Out

Top models fuck with me, I'm on

Laptop full of hits in this Louis duffle bag

UhFuck diss tracks, you get your shit splat
Before you ever heard me rap, I had to spit crack
Slimy rocks, crashed off, they find me shot
But doing numbers like Def Jam in the 90's pot
Much to their surprise I'm the fuckin' flyest
In the Chevy nigga playin' Pac, nigga, "Still I Rise"
Blue rag around my forehead, code red
Slauson Ave. infiltrate rap to take more bread
Quote it how you want, I just rolled a blunt
I'm sippin' lean in first class gettin' my shoulders rubbed
Streets talkin' so I'm listening with a loaded gun
Still all I hear is niggas sayin' I'm the chosen one
Champagne open one, watch it over-run
I heard him say a drunk mind speak a sober tongue
We're still adjusting to the changes
I been gettin' money but it's different when you famous
It been niggas famous but it's different when you bangin'
All these niggas hatin', all these police tryna hang you
What should you do? Decisions, your blood racing
Fresh out the county, trying to go platinum on probation
But no regrets, my nigga, just more bank
Just soak it all out, double back from both angles
Artists that label, no favors, no thank you
And rap about it all just to lace you
Pull up in cars with blunts large like Jamaicans
Sticky from bell sells, white broads named Rachel
Never broke code and I never made statements So the rules say, mute all false speculation
Greatness fooly, four words: self made, salute me
A lot of niggas watching now probably hate this movie, but fuck 'em
I'm so tired of the same discussion
I'm worth M's, niggas ain't made nothin'
No regrets now, I got it off my chest now
Since the womb, mama know that I'm a special
That's probably why she don't wanna 'notha level
Real never fall off, like fake bezels
Spirit over rebel, heart of a lion
All that's inside me, Is worth all this trying
Worth all this grindin'
'Cause I'm from the hood and we ain't scared about dying
Just want mine
Success, I just want my fair share in life
In that self made I ain't tryna hear life
Still proud of what I look at in the mirror life
Hyde Park hustle, half baked on a Paris flight
I'm sippin' hot tea before I hit the stage
Earl grey, mother of pearl face
Forever I'm the flyest, we fuck on Chanel sheets
Count cash after shows, I spazzed on the globe
I passed all my goals, then I mapped out some more
On this never-ending road, I fix flats in the cold, boy
Respect how I master my role
And I made it all happen alone
No regrets now, I got it off my chest now
Since the womb, mama know I'm a special
That's probably why she don't wanna 'notha level
Real never fall off, like fake bezels
Spirit over rebel, heart of a lion
All that's inside me, Is worth all this trying
Worth all this grindin'
'Cause I'm from the hood and we ain't scared about dying
Just want mineAnd all I rap is that real nigga, real nigga shit, yeah
Only rap it if I did it, shit
Look, on a mission on some killa shit
Huh, obligated by the ignorance
We was raised in it so we livin' it
Lifestyles of the lost, illegitimate
Kids of fathers who never was a figure in
They life, and not a world, 'bout to deal with it
They might lock him up if he innocent
But they won't explore ways to prevent the shit
You know, you was into small business
But you know through this gangbangin' benefit
Look, they got prisons on the stock market
This is not preachin', this is not smart shit
This is survival, nigga Noah’s Ark shit
Brynhurst Ave and Hyde Park shit, ohI ain’t got the patience to talk to these niggas ‘cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas now they now
Niggas won’t respect you ‘til you empty out your clip
‘Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
I ain’t got the patience to talk to these niggas ‘cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas now they now
Niggas won’t respect you ‘til you empty out your clip
‘Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
That’s why, that’s why, that’s why I’m still up in the hood
Burner on my lap, just to get it understood
Multi-million dollar deals just sittin’ on the table
On the dope block posted forty Glock by my navel
Get the picture nigga, I can take your life away
Plus a pimp nigga, I can take your wife away
Babies havin’ babies, kids killin’, yeah that’s life today
Better get a pistol, fuck praying for a brighter day
Crease up on my jeans, gold chain up on my white tee
I shine, that’s why them dirty motherfuckers they don’t like me
I promise I, try to do the right thing like Spike Lee
Despite these efforts niggas still got extras
So I’ma get it crackin’, bust off and let y’all have it
I’m comin’ from a hood where killin’ niggas is a habit
Everybody did it, everybody done it
Everybody with it, so tell me how you want it, blah!
I ain’t got the patience to talk to these niggas ‘cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas now they now
Niggas won’t respect you ‘til you empty out your clip
‘Cause actions is everything and words mean shit
I ain’t got the patience to talk to these niggas ‘cause they slow
Fuck around and bark on these niggas now they now

Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib
Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
And don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
But I could, show you the bounce
I could show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Set up shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustle about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriend with your French tip
And the MAC lipstick, and the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits
Is enough to have most niggas blind about the cash they spent
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
I flip ruffles until my chips double
Let's hit the Sunset Strip and get in some trouble, come on
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures

Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib
As soon as I stepped in, there's nothing fresher
Don't test him, the .4-5 under the 5X, it's a Heckler
The S500'll hit Sunset from zero to 60 in six seconds, quit flexin'
Plus mami in the red's interested
Tongue ring probably mean head's in the question
Back out, open toes, all around sexy
Invite her to the session in the VIP section
Come chill with some real bosses
I'll treat your inner thighs like Florence and Slauson
And stay all off and in between 'em
Cough when you hit the green, huh
Yeah, baby, take a breather 
Then she asked me to dance
With a spectacular, immaculate ass I had to have
The whole, not the half, she touched to the floor then damn
I could see your G-string through your pants
Bounce
Bounce, bounce
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out
She said we could fuck, but first, take a ho out
So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib
Now the scene switch from the bar to the barrio
Hopped in the car, on the floor, she let it all go
Stabbin' through traffic, she tryna get it crackin'
Say this ain't a habit, she just feelin' the atmos-
Phere, and I ain't killin' the cat yet
Here's an opportunity to do what I do
I, pulled over in the motel parking lot
Forget the room, I got tint and it's dark inside
The big body, you thick, hottie gon', get naughty
After you give head, give body
And don't think about it, just go with the flow
And I'ma act like I don't know you a ho
We could pretend, can't we?

Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause
She tryna hold out

So that's just what I did
I took her out the club right back to the crib
Ooh, she showin' her drawers
Touchin'  the floor, the thongs had the Juicy Coutures
She got me up on the wall
Ass clappin' like a round of applause without a pause

Hoppin' off the plane
Blue chucks on the runway
Hussle nigga yeah I only get it one way
Momma said boy you'se a fool stay in school
Last month I made more then every teacher at my school
Come kick it at my pool come swim in my jacuzzi
Watch my big screen you could fuck with all my groupies
Truly young hussle nigga like a boss now
Straight up Slauson to Fox Hills and tear them all down
Five thousand really it ain't nothing fuck browsing
Spend it all double back for more hustling
I'm so south centralised i'm accustomed
To envy I see hatred in his eyes I'mma rush him
Trust no bitches you'll be fucked over lust plus
It's six million ways to die that's just one
I'm one in a million mammas grab your children
Save 'em from the block and what's in back of them buildings
We'll be so on the coast fucking filthy
Rich off racks smokin' cohetes buying real tea
Gold medalist I got to bring the torch home
Speed boating and gettin' my Scott Storch on
Now Al Gore calling me up on my iPhone
Sayin' that the kush that I'm burnin' fuck up the Ozone
09er nigga trying to go fo golds

Hey if you hear me breathing kind of hard
Fresh off some push-ups, ya know
Uh, uh, yeah, uh, that's right
That's right
Uh, Hussle, look
Am I gon' make it am I gon' fail
And if I don't try, then how I'm gon' tell
They say that it's heaven, they say that it's hell
But we stuck here 'til we get there
Try to have more faith and less fear
Try to express it to your peers
I'm talking 'bout dreams
Better to do it and let it be seen, cause then it's so clear
Look at them flock, isn't it weird
Niggas is groupies, borderline queer
Fuck it, that's the nature of success, we all hold it so dear
How could you judge one if you was once one
Nigga that might one day become somebody
Who made good on his word and transcends where he come from
Nevertheless still come 'round, show face to motivate these young ones
Niggas will never give you credit, none
Some questions go unanswered, most of those I give to God
Some niggas can't be reasoned with, those gon' meet the squad
Normal nowadays, my life is anything but besides
It's a cold and lonely road, I knew it when I took the job
Progress on my heart, money on my mind
I got Rimpau at my CD changer, smokin' while I drive
Nigga, uh
It's not really about how you start, it's not about the lane
It's about the overall race
That's one of the reasons why
I'm a marathon runnerThe realest shit of a nigga life man
So gutter around here, ya dig?
When you gotta get it man
This rap shit be havin’  niggas goin’ every which way man
Confused ass niggas
They say rapping is good living huh?
You feel like when you get it, you gotta get it huh?
A lot of people think it’s easy homie not at all
It make the same nigga feel like he ain’t got ‘em all
And when you stop poppin’ off its like Tylenol
Until your single play out and you start dying off
Two choices, you either ride it ‘til the tires off
Or switch it up and start singin’ like Diana Ross
I’m still a nigga in the trap, so who am I to talk?
I just zone out and produce it, play the piano soft
Niggas don’t buy records, they try to make our asses soft
Off some pop shit, ‘cause Rap City in the basement off
This hip hop shit, done slowed down since it taken off
And you can sit and complain, but it won’t get you far
And you can pitch a hissy fit, curse and flip them off
Because to them, you the only, they depict you all
It’s fucked up nigga
Never promise what you can’t keep
‘Cause every day’s a constant struggle, struggle
When faced with reality, reality
Never promise what you can’t keep
‘Cause every day’s a constant struggle, struggle
When faced with reality, reality
Look, they got me feelin’ like
Fuck the world, ‘cause we livin’ in hell
Got me, pawning my chain, just to get him his bail
Yeah my brother, that’s my nigga, I’m supposed to be with you
Closest thing I ever had, to a fatherly figure
When my momma shook my pops, said he was a bullshitter
It was just me and my brother, look my brothers my nigga
So, you know I got yo back like yo spine
And I'm yet to see another nigga ever match your grind
Nigga, twenty four seven, twilight to sunrise
It was nothin they could tell us, it was money on our minds
It was triple Cuban links, all at the same time
It was bullet proof windows on them 745’s, nigga
You know the games got its lows and its highs in it
You know them people keep they nose up my business
Is it a crime for a nigga to see the skies the limit
Reachin' for the stars will have you reachin' through the bars
It's a trap
Show me a stage and I rhyme a page
Rap, sing choruses performin’ for the audience
They applauding, and record labels exploitin’
Tellin’ stories of pain and then recordin’ them
How they selling our slang and now they talkin’ shit?
Wish I could give them my shoes and tell them walk in this
Thugs singin’ the blues, and now they fortunate
Make them mad, flossin’ shit they thought we’d never have
Ghetto niggas pullin’ up in somethin’ elegant
I guess if it’s one man’s trash, others will treasure it
So that settles it, metals spit, quick to be devil for the benefit
Only if I’m gettin’ rich
It’s like a cycle these tracks that I’m blessin’
Is mirrors to my pain, so I’m rappin’ my reflection
Livin’ in the rain, got me blackin’ out, I’m stressin’
It’s like I’m relivin’ my vision, I’m repeatin’ my life
My words fight back in punch lines disrespectful
But I'd rather have my voice box the instrumental
I got a one track mind, puttin’ lines together
And get some glow before I go, I can’t shine forever, nopeOh, oh-oh-oh
Ooh yeah

Type a nigga probably  on a coffin
Cos homies families was hurting
But what's it worth when these niggas want your carcus
Yeah I know they probably smile up in your face
But I know you niggas phony cos there's sweat up in your shake
Nigga jealousy, how easily niggas forget
Used to walk thrugh the hood, nigga didn't have shit
I just hussled off the corner, and I stacked a couple chips
Then I hit the parking lot, with that brand new whip
How you love that, ain't you supposed to smile for me?
Why you hate that? oh you playing high for me
They say cut the grass and the snakes will show
Is you niggas mad at me or do you hate my dough
Just let me know
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathing
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga I ain't leaving
Lookie
When I was 15 my momma kicked me out and changed the locks
Her husband used to beat on us and talk shit alot
You ain't my daddy, nigga I ain't gotta listen to you
Then my momma switched sides like nigga, yeah you do
I used to wanna stay away, used to hate to come home
Outcasted from the family cos we wasn't his own
Now that's scandalous, how'd you let him hit me that hard?
Now that's scandalous, how'd you let your two kids starve?
No lunch money, was bummy and treated like a step child
Let me loose on these streets, the nigga went wild
No direction, false concept of family
Quick to bust the first damn burner that they handed me
Momma these white folks'll never understand a gee
Crying to the judge and they still reprimanded me
Used to wonder why you act like you always was mad at me
When cuz was the issue but momma I forgive you
It's so hard out here
But I'm still breathing
I said it's hard out here
But my nigga I ain't leavingLaaaa...

Finna pull it out, and show you how I feel
First we pop bottles and the champagne spills
They say, "Nipsey, what's that smell?" and I say "That's that kill"
Shank costs a kilo, girls look Creole
Smokin' on the good, sippin' on the Cliquot

Pitchin' every penny, I'm flippin' every dollar
So if you got a man, girlfriend, you should dash him
We heavy in the club, throwin' money, poppin' bottles
Your man ain't in the club, so when we leave you should follow
We shuttin' down the street, burnin' rubber, hoppin' hollows
Green on top of cheese, on top of chips like nachos

Seven grams foundations of a man
Smoking backs, black rebel chants
Living fast my niggas ain't even last fuck
In the back, .40 on my lap
Counting cash, anxious finna blast
Too committed to principals from my past
If you ever came from nothing that's something you understand look
Is it cuz it's nothing like me, she like me
From the future move at light speed
Standing like a giant only five three
Them magic words I move like Magic, Worthy
Stop lying nigga you ain't never heard me
Straight from the curb where 103rd be
Fuckin with Nipsey, nigga we nippin' niggas
The K's from close reach'll flip a nigga
Bullet sky blue tips like they crippin', nigga
If a nigga got 30 in it then I'm trippin', nigga
Refrigerated cup holders when I'm sippin', niggas
Fuck work, sell words, it was written, nigga
See the Staples Center from my kitchen, nigga
On the phone with Forbes asking how I did it, nigga
Snatched ol' girl it's official, nigga
Always been a man on a mission, nigga
Streets gave to me and it stole from me
But it paid the way and the road for me
Shhh moment of silence for the homies that's resting in peace
Cuz they gave us seasoning for the recipe
No new nigga just back on my B.I.Z
Thank god for locs I ran the N.I.P

And why yall stressed asking why we blessed
Nipsey just bossed the grind I'm a special guestHussle, hey

2 bad bitches, Roosevelt for the weekend
Walk past the pool when I got by the deep end
She asked to hit the blunt when I passed to push me in
Laughs, drinks and giggles
I got pink slip pussy couple freaks and retals
I got strip club hoes with the least potential
But they mind on a million once they leave then venue
I’m talking money motivation, let me press my issue

Please, you know, hustle keep it p-i
Lil mama flip game on you but I see why
When I think of you my nigga I don’t think pride
I don’t think swag nigga, I don’t think fly
I don’t think style nigga, I just think why
This ol' lame ass nigga in my freestyle listen
Marathon life the tradition
Every 2000 followers, I’ll make another victim- This is the time for us to come off of our knees and stand up to make a difference in our communities
- I am not afraid of them, and I'm trying to instill in my neighbors, there's no need for us to be afraid
- No matter what City Hall says and promises, people in this community, still very much intimidated by the Rolling 60s
One Rolling 60s hangout is just outside this grammar school, where parents are reluctant to go on camera talking about the gang or their fears of it
- You walk down that street?
- Nope, I don't
- Why's that?
- Um, well, it's too much activities going on down that street
Look, see, I was, born in the '80s and raised in the 60s
My pockets were full of 5s, shoe boxes were full of 50s
Slauson, nigga, come on, follow and get with me
Sellin' dope for that Rolex chain and some fresh Dickies
I was duckin' them choppers with burners in my stash box and
Swallowin' rocks while runnin' from them CRASH cops
Nights, I kept it on my hip, the Johnny hot, shit
Nights I left it in my dresser, homies got chipped
To be kill or be killed, and I ain't talkin' poetry
If niggas ain't snitchin', then how the fuck they know it's me?
Catch me breakin' nine zones down, nigga, that's a quarter ki
And sellin' work to big homies, my older G's
In a luxury set, my chrome thang's gettin' blunted
Fuck it, I'm feeling good, I got two per set of hundred
Money was never nothin' 'cause these blocks was Rollin'
And the spot stay poppin' 'cause my rocks was swollen
You know that I'm a hustla, so, you know

You know that I'm a hoodsta, so, you know

Niggas gon' ride to the shit I'm sayin', that's on the real
Niggas done died for this shit I'm claimin'
From over here to Western Ave, yeah we run that
Hop out and bust a nigga head, yeah, I done that
But I ain't braggin', though, really, it's about capital
And all this goddamn money gave me an attitude
No smiles like I'm mad at you
Late night grindin', posted on the BG

I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
City low on low, poles of the big Vogues with extended inches
So many colors hover, see your reflection, lose your senses
I blow your ear drums, my stereo is so expensive
Pistols killin' a wad of money up up in my britches
My creases rigid, my pinky frigid, I'm polar pimpin'
Ayatollah of tippin', DeVille with that tight suspension
And did I mention, coated paint with metallic flake
Boppers going blind from the shine that these diamonds make
With Nipsey, that boy B, I'm Question, you know you heard of me
Mad 'cause your baby mama wanna swallow this baller
Blow herb with me
Get throwed and swerve with me, king of bopper burglary
Don't believe that this 'Lac 'til I jump in and I turn the key
I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mayne
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
Listen, look, I drive slow down the block, no speakin'
No tints on the whip, you could see in
Thick cloud of smoke 'cause I'm chiefin'
It's easy to see that a young nigga eatin'
Chrome feet, I'ma roll on the low pro
I'm ready and willing if it involve getting more dough
Hittin' corners, white paint, leather cocoa
Stash spot, tell the cops, it's a no go
It's Question and Bun B, I'm Nipsey, I know you heard of me
Mad 'cause your baby mama flirt with me
But I don't never show that ho no courtesy
And every time you leave she chirpin' me
Talkin' 'bout how you be givin' her the third degree
How she wanna get gone, sip purp with me
Smoke purple trees, just swerve with me, 'cause
I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mayne
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
I'ma put my hand on the wheel, I'ma put my foot on the gas
I'ma shift my bitch into drive, and man I'm ready to mash
I gots the top dropped down, I got my trunk popped open
Sittin' sideways on stitch and tuck and them fuck boys scopin'
Hopin' they can knock my hustle but they muscle ain't swollen
So they gon' have to try again, tell 'em come back when they holdin'
Golden flex in my paint, and glassy rims on Vogues
Chrome, it lay up on the grille and my neon exposed
I'm a pimp, just try and get chose; for the stable, tryin' to get hoes
With friends, they fuck with foes; you already know how it goes
Those that ain't down with this move, play the sidelines or hit the showers
Just get the hell up out the way 'cause the rap game is ours
Said we don't roll with no cowards, scaredy cats or the 'fraidys
We just comin' down candy, on them fours and them 80s
We just straight south-sidin', broad day with no hidin'
Let the slab swang wide and
I'ma let 'em know that Bun and Question slow ridin'
I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mayne
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa
I'm ridin' slow with the fours pokin' out, mayne
I'm ridin' slow and I'm hoggin' up the city lane
I'm ridin' slow and I'm clean in the 'Lac
Ridin' so slow while I'm puffin' on some dro, whoa

        Bullets got blue tips like they crippin' nigga
Everything got 30 in it and I'm trippin' nigga
Refrigerated cup holders when I'm sippin' nigga
Fuck work, sell words, it was written nigga
See the Staples Center from my kitchen nigga
On the phone with Forbes, askin' how I did it nigga
Snatched ol' girl, it's official nigga
Always been a man on a mission nigga
Yeah, expect a movie, take the top off
'Bout to crossover like hotsauce
On this gutter shit, I never hopped off
Most calculated move by far
Always with a model in a fly car
Yeah thirty thousand for the pythons
Rockin' knee highs, sippin' white wine
Listenin' to In My Lifetime in the night time
Lookin' at the city skyline gettin' sky-high
Took the little bitch to Popeye's, she was top five
Excitement that she get from pop life could never top mine
Once you get the hustle locked down, you can stockpile
Level up another notch now, like a block now
Every time I take the top down she arch her eyebrows
Turnin' up the music hig now, she feel alive now
Love me like we from a small town, let's make a mall round
You splurge, I splurge, ball later and we ball now
Yeah, look, nothin' can save us and we realized it
Yeah, nothin' can save us and we realized it
Yeah, nothin' can save us and we realized it
Look, look, look
Middle of the night, kitchen lights is on
Roll me up a back then I light my stove
She told me stay calm when the crisis on
Said I die alone, I said 
 who speak in hyperbole
Translation, get the money, never wife a ho
Clip is full already, where these s- should go?
Shoulder full already, where these stripes should go?
These police got opinions how my life should go
I'm screamin' fuck 'em, make 'em suck a dick and die tonight, you know
Bullets rain on them cut the life support
My section ride for sport every night of course
Niggas dying every day, that's the price of war
Gang members spendin' thousands at the nicest stores
I levitate on 5-star luxury
Every time I ride shit come for me
Look, grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Stuck in this grind I'm stuck in this grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Stuck in this grind, Look
Nothin' can save us and we realized it
We knew the outcome and we still tried it
That south central state of mind I'm in the field logic
To be a real rider, you took this shit to the extreme and you ain't feel honest
Now this blood is on your hands, you hope these bills wash it
Sinkin' deeper in regret and that's the real faucet
See everybody go for self, that was the real Slauson
But do this, win, lose or draw, that was a real promise
'Til death do us, what's most important was rep to us
Set schoolers to love a lie and respect shooters
Reflect to it, this year I'm droppin' my best music
Hope you niggas get rich and then reinvest to it
I wish you niggas successes minus the stress to it
A lot of stages, lot of losses and regrets to it
The game of life, you ain't the type that would accept losin'
Whatever's left to it, flying in a jet to it
Yeah, stuck in this grind
Stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Stuck in this grind, yeah
Look, look, look, look
Money power and respect for the chosen few
Came through on low pros now they notice you
19, fuck rap, I'm the local trope
Me and Hump had the alpinas, we the only two
Promote the gang, live and die for my rollie, chain
Rich, gang banger music, I know my lane
Curb servin' off the corner, was a protege
I pop the trunk and I manifested my mogul ways
Do you know the pain
Brodie in the state, I'm on the block quarter ounce of cane
Life cycles in circles that bubble into rage
Turning self-destruction behavior, somebody light some sage
Yeah, stuck getting his grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Yeah, yeah, stuck in this grind, yeah
Cash out continuous
Mogul in the makin', autonomous black businesses
Broken culture that we all lost niggas in
Elevated innovation over ignorance
I represent it, Suburban tinted, five or less percentage
Closed crime but the mac-11 muzzle vintage
Go flourish, double back and come and get your niggas
Pass the power to your people, it ain't nothin' realer
Faced with this decision, it's a funny feelin'
Knowing when you tell the truth they gon' come and kill you
Knowing people need some proof, went and got the millions
Stressed a young nigga out but I'm so resilient
These champagne Honda Civics, they was takin' pictures
Young niggas front the buildings tryin' to make a livin'
Always figured they was jealous 'cause we made it quicker
And never asked for no favors, nigga
Look, hey, stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind
Look me in my eyes, call me on my lies
Stuck in this grind, I'm stuck in this grind

        If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?
Everything good go bad over time
It's a go cycle, life’s a twist
That's why I say fuck it, life's a bitch and I know
Me and money racking finna hit a lick and take it to the bank
Sick of sittin’ in the spot lane with a  in a hot place
Smokers thirsty finna hit a Thursday, nigga chirp me
You could meet up early on a five block
Front of granny house where they birthed me
Gotta fight for Friday, I seen that life highways
Flip or try me, two choices
One road to travel nigga where you going you could find me
In the front hood of the six-six
Used to pump good, got to G around the corner
Part waiting on this bitch, tell her come through
Enough guns for the whole crew
When I'm done what I'm gon' do?
Power move, get more pounds, send them out of town
Where a nigga finna touchdown to
Smokin' in the front room now
We get a car from a brawl with a getaway car
Said she cool now, never ever wanna hit another lick again
Said she wanna go to school now
Fucked up the whole mood now
Gotta flight up, gotta take a pounds waiting out of town
Now I'm gone
If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?
As soon as a nigga touch down
My I-95 say 5:25
Couple hours up now, I cut it off on the flight down
'Posed to hit the lick at 9
It's 2 o’clock shallow time
Said you hit a nigga up when you passed
Hit a nigga on the line
No response, kinda nervous
I know the nigga ain’t pay full
Celly  ain't got no service
Gotta make a quick phone call home
Let them niggas know the word
I hit my nigga Dom 
In the background I heard the bird
Nigga breath easy, they got away clean 16 gs each
Money mob  with a quarter 
But he left his phone right up on the scene
Right up on the scene? What you mean he dropped it?
Chirp yeah
Now we on the spot with work
It’s getting hot fo' sho'
I wonder if they watchin'
Middle of the night when the fiends knockin’
I try to get some sleep but the dark keep me up
On the couch 
Probably parked in an unmarked or a Kia around the corner
Debating with the evidence, picture taking
Real locations
If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I get off will I fall back in those traps again?
If I get off, get off, will I fall back in those traps and do the same things again
If I fall off will I get back in those traps again?

I don't tell lies, it's nothin' but the truth
Hustle music
Yeah, kush and Patron got me on right now, fuckin' wit' y'all
Shit is crazy to me how...
A nigga'll kill you 'cause you fuck his bitch
But you'll ride again and let it slide, feel me?
Or a nigga'll wanna come take your head off 'cause you fuck over him
Feel me, put tips on a nigga, put him on his pockets
Give him what he came for
Nigga wanna go get his burner and kill you, feel me?
Leave me to think these niggas got the game fucked up
See, it's not what you do, it's why you do what you do
Feel me, that's who make you who you are, homie
See, me, I'ma let my actions speak for me

My solution: All Money In No Money OutSlauson, Slauson

Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
And maybe have a one-nighter
It's the K-I-two L's, A-R, hood star
Kill 'em in the front then bury 'em in the backyard
Chrome gleamin' on the car, bangin', I show raw
I'm in the buildin', H and R, young black millionar'
Ghetto but a famous star, Perignon to calamar'
Haze, dumped a Shalamar and Chardonnay going hard
You're billy ain't nothin' without a Phantom or a Maybach
So tell the bartender, we need bottle service ASAP
Now it's the NH, two O's, D-S-T-H
No info from them CRASH cops and DA's
Gold chain swang, I just swag off the Cliquot
And every day we ballin', pop bottles on the weekdays
Fuck all that he say, she say, we paid
All Money In No Money Out, that's what we say
These fake niggas' worse fear was my release date
I hope they gettin' money 'cause I'm spinnin' like the DJ
Look, 'cause I'm a H-double O-D S-T-A-R
Everywhere we go, people know who we are
We bang, and we ball
And we bang, and we ball

And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
And maybe have a one-nighter
Listen, it's the N-I-P-S-E-Y, he fly
Hustle in Girbauds and Levi's, Dickies and Reeboks
H-U-double dollar sign-L-E
From 3600 Baker Row, cell three
To 9900 cash money on me
Keep it under 10 G's so the feds won't see
Spend a thousand on clothes and a thousand on weed
Damn it feel good to be from RSC
I'm still the H.R.O.B
Mr. VVS is still the freshest overseas
Tried to told 'em let him breathe, I need filet migneeze
St. Tropez to L.A., we G6'n with ease
Slauson Boyz, my ice shine like I'm on HD
That's on me, I'ma ride 'til I D-I-E
Turnpike in the V, it's just Nipsey and Reeze
And it's just for one night 'cause you're subject to leave
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
And maybe have a one-nighter
Lil mama wanna roll with some riders
I can't be your provider
Just wanna be somethin' beside ya
And maybe have a one-nighter
Look, I'm a H-double O-D S-T-A-R

        All Money In No Money Out
Neighborhood Nip Hussle
Bullets Ain't Got No Name Volume 2, nigga
That's all folks, until next time
I'ma leave y'all with this, man
Everybody wanna be somethin' out here
Everybody wanna have somethin' in life, right?
Lotta these niggas got the game twist
Thinkin' it's gon' come knock on they front door
Niggas better get up and go make that shit happen, my nigga
Feel me?
They gotta see that shit
Niggas gon' hate, niggas ain't gon' believe
They gotta get up and make that shit happen, my nigga
Or accept where you at, nigga, settle for broke
All Money In No Money Out, nigga
Take that and run wit' it
Get paper, nigga; stack now, ball later, fuck what they say, nigga
Get money and stay buckin', nigga
Nip Hussle, nigga, the underdog for real, homeboy
But look though, feel me? Hustle
Can I go on my way without you?
Whoa, how can I know?Car-Car said she made the beat, huh?
Wake up, wake up, wake
We ain't playin’ with the game
We ain't just no fools with Pro Tools
If you break down the music, you could find the truth
For every line that I write, it's ten dimes of white
For each verse that I spit, it’s ten purchases
Now, you do the math, tell you "Think again"
I get a Franklin for my statements, guess, I'll thank my pen
It goes deeper, blow reefer for the pain within
Niggas get popped then they stage ascend
Once again, it's me against the system, they hate a nigga with a pistol
But they blind to the fact I keep six to prevent history from repeating on me
Sometime it ain't what it seem to be, so peep the scenery
Dope dealers, cold killers, gorillas
On the corner stuck, wide open off that coke feelin'
I play my position, as a go-getter
Bossed up, hustle, daily quota like four digits
 Bank accounts that's endless
 Gold Rolex, chains from cocaine
 Smoking purple kush outta fat Swishers
 Livin' life as a young boss nigga
 Bank accounts that's endless
 Gold Rolex, chains from cocaine
 Smoking purple kush outta fat Swishers
 Livin' life as a young boss nigga
How many niggas understand this feeling of hundreds in rubber bands?
I never felt closer to the man, and
Counting paper, face of presidents past
Now I control 'em, I could when I cop a zone with hash
How many niggas understand, this feeling of losing a friend
That you've been knowing since he moved in?
Then you watched the block call him, hanging out, wrong time, caught him
The shots holler, spine locked like a Rottweiler
It ain't the biz, but it is, kid
I take it in and send it with the Ben times 10
When it's my time, I come running towards the sunshine
Bustin' at one time, screamin' like I want my
Freedom, like I'ma star, except
I'ma ride with the Ruger, like Shaka Zulu do you with the knives
I cock it back, caught your cap through your third eye
Hit the floor, ricochet and fly, penetrate the sky
 Bank accounts that's endless
 Gold Rolex, chains from cocaine
 Smoking purple kush outta fat Swishers
 Livin' life as a young boss nigga
 Bank accounts that's endless
 Gold Rolex, chains from cocaine
 Smoking purple kush outta fat Swishers
 Livin' life as a young boss nigga... just on this marathon, now there ain't nothing more to say, bruh...
Lemme hit you right back
Hussle
1 Take
Aye, look
Tatoo's on my faces
Cause i beat all my cases
Finally off probation, but im not on vacation
I'm young, I'm rich, I'm famous
Your bitch is amazing
She came through and fucked me good and told me not to say shit
Oops, lil ma, that's my bad
Filmed you on my iPad
Showed all of my bro-bro's
That big screen, your fine ass
I fucked her til she climaxed
That bedboard, she palm that
Turned around, threw it back
So i went deep inside that
Look... X-rated, highly anticipated
Drunk as fuck, I'm smokin' blunts, she's puffin' papers
Get pussy from these bitches. This shit is just like a layup
 just on this marathon, now it ain't nothin more to say but
"The more you pursue her, acting crazy, looking stupid
The more she's fallin' for this young nigga chasin' gouda"
Bulletproof black on black, I'm blowing circles out the roof uh 
Just smokin' to this music like, like...
And We ride...
Seat back, top down, music bangin', hands in the sky
And We Ride
Top off, seat back, music playin', blood shot eyes
And We Ride
Seat back, top off, music bangin', baby lookin fly, and We Ride
Top off, seat back, music playin', when ?I gotta shout out the homie, man
Ay, 'cause Game don’t really endorse nobody, man
But you know, I've been listening to this mixtape for about a week now, you know'm’sayin'
Nipsey Hussle, man, like
The next biggest thing in L.A., I swear before God, homie
This dude is like Snoop, Game, Dre, all in one, homie
And, you know, my homie Big U from 60s put me on Nipsey, man
He been in the streets, you see the posters up
Like, he grindin', man
And it made me feel like when I was first gettin' on, you know'm'sayin' 
So look out for Nipsey Hussle
And when I talk about his music, I say...
Whenever Nipsey name come up, just say, "I swear 'fore God this cat is crazy"
I promise...Hussle is my last
Hussle is my last name
Look I'm a stay fresh, y'all stay bummy
Y'all can chase pussy, I'ma chase money
You only live once and niggas die young
You live by the bullet you're gonna die by the gun
I'm coming off Slauson where niggas hate your guts
And... be riding high, niggas wanna set you up
They probably jealous of it never get enough
They say money ain't the root of all evil, nigga say whaaat?
Look into my eyes and tell me what you see
I've been on the grind since the age of fourteen
Started with a quota, bought my first buck
Bought my first gun, said f*ck it then I bust
It ain't the ones I f*cked off it's the ones I f*cked with
Ain't the ones I trap trade, it's the ones I trusted
Jealousy and envy see it all around me
Looking for nip hussle on the block is where they found me
Hussle is my last
Hussle is my last name
I'm like ooooh, get ready
I got my mind on a whole 'nother setting
When they see me they say Nip where ya heading
And I be like on my way to the cheddar
Look look look
Slauson boy swag
Check out my demeanor
Gold cuban links, bullet proof beemers
Duffle bag money I ain't never had a visa
And if sports was hip hop I be balling all season
Cops can't stop us
Rolex watches, homes foreclose when the popo's caught us
County jail state pen time is nothing
Bounce back and now I'm about to take raps top honors
Cause
Hussle is my last
Hussle is my last name
I'm on the block with these rocks
Posted loked, lowkey so Johnny think I'm smoking
Focused on nothing more than getting to my quota
Hoping the block well before they start patrolling
I'm knowing, they watching us binoculars is scoping
Bumping up the smokers trying ask me where I sold it
My mind state money over everything underneath the sun
And death out the barrel of my gun, go bang
Don't ask me why I gang bang
It's easy, believe me, the coppers they need me
I pay they salary, they know my calories with weight
Too heavy to stop, I'm chopping down ounces, halfs
Sevens, boulders, dimes, nicks, watever
I'm going forever I'm never gon stop it
So don't holla at me unless money is the topic
Hussle is my last
Hussle is my last nameLate nights and long flights
Gold chains and champagne, nigga
Cuban links, Rolexes
Coupes, hard-tops
Yeah, look
Now I'm smokin’ on some overseas Amsterdam shit
Kush weed, politickin' tryna make my plan stick
Push me, I'm too close to the edge, I’m smashed
I ain't that nigga thinkin' he gettin' a couple dollars a switch
I ain't your role model, I ain't on no positive shit
Emotional, by any means a nigga got to get rich
Ski mask schemes, my team's only logic is this
There's only one way up to go and that’s up outta this shit
Could you believe or did you see that I was the shit?
Niggas slept, I woke ’em up like an alarm after 6
Look, I'm a hustler, you could tell just by the cars that I dip
Extra features, fully-loaded, like the broads that I flip
There’s not a bar that I'm gon' spit that's not a part of my script
And why witness ass niggas get arrested and snitch?
To the niggas lookin’ at me like a lick you could hit
We take rap to last nigga but he rested in piss
I'm seasoned, I just do what comes so naturally 
I can't help myself 'cause I'm a G
You ain't never, ever seen no bitch in me 
While you talk a good game, I be in the streets gettin' this cash
Yeah
Some of them say I'm super fly, some of them say I'm super dope
Some of them say I moved a lot, some of them say I'm pushin' coke
I'm a bad motherfucker
You claim to be a gangsta but you act like a sucka 
No one really fuckin' with me
The type of hustler to get busted and still tuck a milli for a rainy day
Maybe just bail money
I love the Bay but the Bay actin' hella funny
I'm gettin' money now, you act funny style
I'm in the coupe doin' 'bout a hundred miles per hour
Drunk, full of powder
Bitch behind the wheel and a blunt full of sour
Long roadtrips and short-term relationships
Twenty five to life is the type of shit I'm faced with
And I ain't never scared, I'm just about everywhere
And I got platinum chains that I hardly ever wear
I'm seasoned, small things to a giant
I'm seasoned, fuck rentin', I'm buyin' that bitch
I'm seasoned, you can keep the change
I'm seasoned, catch me dippin' on the planes in the fast lane
I'm seasoned, I just do what comes so naturally 
I can't help myself 'cause I'm a G
You ain't never, ever seen no bitch in me 
While you talk a good game, I be in the streets gettin' this cash
I got a H-I-V flow, pocket full of hepatitis C-notes
Some bright light, big night Bino
Talkin' to police'll get your G-pass revoked
If Gs don't talk to police, that's the G-Code
I'm fully-automatic like Jordan from the free throw
Quick on my feet like D. Rose
I done broke the only damn key to the keyhole
It's M-O-B, but I love it when she deepthroat
Yeah, starin' at the sky as the sun fall
And all my life I ball, I guess I'm gamed up, y'all
If I had to do it over again
Got your boy reminincisin', feelin' chills all over my skin
In order to win, you gotta push a line
Yeah, I fuck around but only with my own kind
And I'm seasoned like chicken in a paperbag
And you could always find a nigga where that money at
I'm seasoned, I just do what comes so naturally 
I can't help myself 'cause I'm a G
You ain't never, ever seen no bitch in me 
While you talk a good game, I be in the streets gettin' this cash
I'm seasoned
I'm seasoned
I'm seasoned
I'm seasoned
I'm seasonedAnd now for my next number, I'd like to return to the classics
Uh, uh, yuh
West Coast 
Hussle, Hussle
Ya know
Neighborhood
West Coast, who ride?
Blanco
Labeled as a thug
Ayy, yo, B
West Coast 
Uh, look
Labeled as a thug
West Coast, who ride?
Ain't the type of white dude sippin' Bud Light
I'm the type with my nine screamin', "Thug life"
A bad bitch wanna fuck tonight
You ain't shit, motherfucker, so it's fuck your life
Fuck the D.E.A., I.R.S., and F.B.I
There, I said it, won't regret it 'til we start trial
I don't ever leave a paper trail
And best believe I'ma G, I will break the scale
I'm a hustler, give a fuck about a budget
I'm a gangsta, give a fuck about the judges
I'm a monster, middle finger to you suckas
I'm a mobster, Mr. Untouchable
Can't fuck with me, I'm so on some other shit
On a road trip, gotta bring my other bitch
Not my other bitch, my other, other, other bitch
Every brick I flip, the more I'm like, "Fuck, I'm rich"
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figga, west coast
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figga, west coast
Niggas hate daily, Glock is my protection
I'm the nigga that your mama told you not to mess with
Caught a interception on your bitch now that's a wridnap
Give her some dick quick, now watch how fast she collapse
Pusha Ink the label, yeah, been that way from day one
The hoes get around me and me? I just got to say somethin'
I let my chain speak, I ain't really gotta say much
If see me in the streets, holla, "Suwoop, nigga, stay up"
I'm all about my dollars, pop my collar on a hoe bitch
She say, "All you wanna do is fuck me," I say, "You know it"
My bitch rollin', my bitch bad
Don't trip 'cause the homies got the strap
Run up in your pad like the motherfuckin' police
With pistols in your face like, "Nigga, don't you owe me?"
I'm tryna steal the rap game like the house lit
I'm from the west but I'm tryna fuck a south bitch
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figga, west coast
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Look, look
I'm fresh off the block, I ain't really left yet
Best on the west, hands-down, no question
And my Adidas got the Slauson Boy etched in
And Black Sam keep the money invested
All I do is check rappers off the checklist
No beef, I eat beef for breakfast
No sleep 'cause these streets is hectic
I don't make peace, I just put 'em on my necklace
Real nigga, never ran, never snitched
The old lady of Fifth ain't raise no bitch
And we some real niggas, nothin' like the niggas in your clique
Always runnin' 'round talkin' about the little shit that you did
We'll never say nothin' 'bout that big shit we did
We just see eachother and nod, and you know what it is
And we don't talk about the big shit we did
We just see eachother and nod and you know what it is, nigga
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figga, west coast
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Lettin' niggas have it, I've been labeled as a thug
Fuckin' mob figga, west coast, who ride?Intro/Chorus  x2:
Don't worry 'bout what people gon' say girl do what you want to
The liquor got you open and yeah that shit got me on too
But we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun
Verse 1 :
As I travel across the world on these first class flights
I miss home, but I get those for my hard time but my gas right
But that's life, sacrifice, you chasin' dreams that's the price
These red carpets and bright lights and black surburbans and late nights
Ain't new to me, standin' on the couch with my wife beater on and my jewelry
I was young visualizin' what I grew to be, then it all turned out so
Beautifully and
Night times is usually a colorful sky and a quarter of weed, a bottle of ciroc and a couple of freaks
And then they drop it like it's hot 400 degress, wait, get with it
My hotel's killin' and my windows stretch from the floor to the ceilin'
My coupe, topless, the view, I promise, we fuck off a couple thousand, shoe shoppin'
My swag, Slauson, I laugh, often, remember when I told you I would have all
This?
Diamonds, flawless, we live, lawless, just fuck with me on some boss shit
Chorus  x2:
Don't worry 'bout what people gon' say girl do what you want to
The liquor got you open and yeah that shit got me on too
But we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' fun, we just havin' funAy, what's up wit' it', y'all

Ya don't wanna get wet then boy stop hangin'

Ayo black war murda, army fatigue socks
Hat seven and a half and a 44 mag, in my dickies
Straight outta bompton. Blood won't stop
See the block's finest, my hood gettin' tossed up
Out that convertible Phantom
Any drama let the Glock start bustin' at random
I stay flamed up
Drivin' somethin red, there go Game, blood
Eight million records and I remain gangsta
Walkin like a pitbull, watchin' my bite
I'm from Compton a.k.a shoot-it-out-on-sight
Cause I was raised by a G, my momma nigga
My heart pumps no kool-aid, so bring the drama nigga
F*ck niggas that's how I feel, straight up
Never run. Unless I'm runnin' red strings through my red Chuck's
Duck! Mothaf*cka it's The Game
Bustin' shots on ya block, and bullet's gots no name
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
The sun is shinin', but still it's rainin'
And you ain't gotta ask where he from just spray him
By the look up on his face you can tell we bangin
See the look up on his face when that thing start rangin' 
POW!
One down two to go, suspect usual
Murda scene the routine ain't new to you
Switch course double back, one down, double that
Yellow tape the gate, send 'em niggas back
See them niggas with a bullet 'fore they learn they lesson
You still ain't got yo gun you ain't got the message?
My enemies they know they say he got extras
When I come through I only got one question...
Why you niggas outside without no gun
You think this shit is a game
But no, no not at all, I hope out gunnin'
Show you niggas I ain't playin'
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name
Pull the trigga, shoot that nigga, make sure that you get 'em
Cus bullets ain't got no name

Wanna sit inside coupes, wanna sip on my Veuv
VIP, you starstruck, tryna get inside too
Other niggas tried to, just to slip and slide through
But that feelin' you provide 'em have them tryin' to wife you
I know you've been lied to but he don't wear my size shoe

Bounce 
Hussle 
It's Nip Hussle in the house 
It's real playa shit like 
Hussle music 
It's All Money In, no money out 
Girl, why you think it's a hole in your mouth?
Don't try to flip the question, I don't go down south
When I could show you the bounce
Show you how to flip that ounce
Tuck it in your purse and cover your blouse
Setup shop, bring the work up in your house
Really show you what this hustlin' about
That's if you game for it
You in the club, what you came for?
To meet a baller with a car and get all your drinks paid for?
You and your girlfriends with the french tips and the MAC lipstick
With the black Baby Phat fit
Knowin' that your ass and tits is enough to have most niggas blind 'bout the cash they spent 
But not Nipsey, you can't knock Nip's hustle
Convince you I love until I got a limp muscle
Why flip ruffles until my chips double?
Let's hit the sunset strip and get  in some trouble, come on
We could take the Benz and hit the street 
With the top down so they could see 
We could hit the clubs and party hard 
'Cause I just bought out the bar 
Return of the swag  
Return of the swag  
Return of the swag  
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back 
Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back 
As soon as I stepped in, it's nothin' fresh so don't test 'em
The four-five under the five , it's a heckler
The S500'll hit Slauson from zero to sixty in six seconds, quit flexin'
Plus mami in the rear's interested
Tongue ring probably mean head's in the question
Bad gal, open toes, all around sexy
Invited to the session in the VIP section
So come chill with some real bosses
My money come in lumps and I get it often
I came from havin' nothin' so I gotta floss it
And all this kush weed got me so exhausted
I pop bottles with broads that's full throttle
I could take your picture if you're tryna model
We could take a trip to the top of Colorado
Or ride shotgun through the neighborhood that I know
We could take the Benz and hit the street 
With the top down so they could see 
We could hit the clubs and party hard 
'Cause I just bought out the bar 
Return of the swag  
Return of the swag  
Return of the swag  
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back 
Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back 
Come ride with me
We could hop inside my old school that's on fours
Who's fly as me?
My diamond's shinin' and my pocket's swole
She's eyein' me
And now I'm tryna get her outta those
Designer jeans
'Cause that's what I do
That's what I do-do-do 
We could take the Benz and hit the street 
With the top down so they could see 
We could hit the clubs and party hard 
'Cause I just bought out the bar 
Return of the swag  
Return of the swag

Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
Return of the swag 
'Cause you knew it'd bring it back Pulling up in Benz's niggas covet my position
On the road to riches, tripping because I really did it
Guilty of a gang of sins but God knows my intentions
Covered by the blood of Christ but still I'm fly cripping
Rolly mint condition revving V12s in my engine
Camoflauge cobanas push the pedal to the limit
I don't trust these niggas I don't trust these bitches
I don't trust nobody Call it Baller superstition
I could still remember I ain't had no pot to piss in
And if its time to go they know to call me for the mission
Opportunity of window turn your folks to opposition
Coldest thing about shit I use to call it friendship
But I guess I was wrong
But the only emotion show what I express through a song
Real nigga just learn your lesson stay strong
And understand it all was a test to move on
What does life all of a sudden feel like hell for me
Its a cold cold world, a cold cold world
And every lasting memory living in this cold cold world, cold world
Remember that opening scene in Menace where
The house is turned up and popping no love is given there
Its a bad situation my nigga living there
Facing fears 2 years later his dad in prison well
No food in the fridge and ain't no silverware
Down bad in the pad ain't no chances given there
Look outside and you'll find him
Getting it and he grinding
That's how he living he violent
This ain't sinning this surviving man
I guess tired of it ain't tripping about no scholarship
He's trying to get a grip on his bond and find his way out of it
Made some fucked up decisions but he ain't proud of it
Its all a part of adjusting to how wild it get
Predicted the outcome when the funk started
In the hood we ain't looked up Malcolm or no Martin
Marcus Garvey or Huey P. Newton
Lil homie want in, fuck it recruit now he shooting
What does life all of a sudden feel like hell for me
Its a cold cold world, a cold cold world
And every lasting memory living in this cold cold world, cold world
Its a cold world so my heart cold
And my pockets where the money and the heart gos
Just a Garden block nigga with a star flow
Bullet proof ain't nothing coming through this car door
The streets show me love because I really did it
I don't sell a lot of records bra I still get it
Still in it, they don't want to see us win
The big homie C-Bo got to turn himself in
Again, trying to make it in this storm
X been locked since before my bitch was even born
So we saying free X-Raided
Fly Keeway that's why my BM hate me
Trying to get 100 racks New BM waiting
Up out the game
Shame they don't want to see Smigg make it
And keep my gangsters on deck in case any drama
Niggas put that iron on you like Penny mama
What does life all of a sudden feel like hell for me
Its a cold cold world, a cold cold world
And every lasting memory living in this cold cold world, cold worldWe be chasin' that coke money in the Bay, mayne

Outside, nigga playin' with this K, mayne
Somebody pray for us real niggas
It's a full time job not to kill niggas
It's a full time job not to kill niggas
Glock 3-8's puttin' faces on a newspaper
I can't get caught for old crimes and catch new cases
Blocks invaded, spot raids, just a few made it
Homies in the holding tanks with no shoelaces
Back on the streets, I'm rollin' weed in see-through paper
Dippin' down the 'Shaw, with the blue paintin'
Poppin' tops off bottles with the gold label
It's pretty good to say I dropped out the 10th grade
I'm, better than ever, this rap shit is nathan
It's for my niggas in the county on the mainline
Uh, I keep mine on my waistline
Whatever you want, bitch nigga, every day I'm *bang bang*
Ready for whatever, AC/DC, heavy with the metal
And never do we settle

And my muthafuckin' cup stay red, mayne
I don't fuck with square bitches that don't ho
And I don't give a fuck about a P.O
That's tellin' me come piss and I don't go
Am I going back to jail? Man, I don't know
Nah, for real, man, I don't know
I get caught with this banger, I'ma do four
I keep a dick full of pimp piss
On a blade, nigga, lookin' for a pimp bitch

Dope money, dope money, everyone stay ready
Why you muh'fuckas playin' with me?
Got a problem? Why don't you muh'fuckin' say it to me
I'm a killer, don't push me
The inside of my ride smell like a pound of cookies
And I just flipped an O-12
Fast life got me livin' out a hotel
I'm like, 'Fuck it, oh well'
It's back to slappin' bitches and flippin', whippin' these dope deals
All that hatin', I'ma take it with a grain of salt
You ain't gettin' my price 'cause I buy in bulk
Man, these numbers don't lie

        Uh, lights low
But I stay high
Yeah, look, look, look
It's ten racks on my neck and twenty more on my brodie shit
I'm self-made, ain't no nigga ever throw me shit
Beside my enemies, I'm watchin' who I'm rollin' wit'
Got 40 on me like a fuckin' Motorola clip
Shit, I feel like a million when I'm four-wheelin'
A 745 parked in front of your buildin'
Designer jeans, Gucci locs and my gold killin'
I got a kilo on my neck, I'm a go-getter
See, what you lookin' at now, that's my old vision
Chess move my next move to get more business
Climbin', I be on my tip 'til toes give in
I'ma always shine, I'll never let my glow blemish
I hear 'em talkin' but fuck what them niggas say
'Cause real niggas know a real nigga demonstrate
And real niggas know it's real 'cause I illustrate
The feelin' of a young hood nigga when he gettin' cake
Hussle
"The feelin' of a young hood nigga...gettin' cake"
("One muthafucka from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
One muthafucka...buckin' niggas if they fuck around")
I came up wearin' the same stuff
Who ever thought I'd push the Rolls, Lexus, and Range truck
Shine hard 'til the rain come
And when my mama died, shit left my brain numb 
A young nigga from the crack to the curb
When this young nigga's black, sellin' crack's to the birds
Hopped in this music with this rap in his word
If this music shit fails then I'm back to the curb
Hustle hard like my nigga Nip
Whether you a Blood or a Crip nigga, thug or a pimp
I was raised in the block where the shit gets thick
Where you're trained just to hit like a Rott or a Pit
My daddy died so 'Pac was my father figure
An attitude, didn't wanna be bothered, nigga
And grew up, thug niggas was my role models
At the house parties drunk off a whole bottle
"The feelin' of a young hood nigga...gettin' cake"
("One muthafucka from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
One muthafucka...buckin' niggas if they fuck around")
You think I'm playin' when I say I got a fully auto? 
Money dealin' drugs is my fuckin' motto 
And my bitch is a model
She don't say shit 'cause the bitch Italiano
And I'm a fuckin' capo
Yeah, a real desperado
Let's say a half-hour, meet at McDonald's
Bring fifty stacks in all crispy hundos
What, we got a problem?
Even my bitch be white girl mobbin'
Nah, I'm lyin', she be actin' all lady-like
But you the fag get in free on ladies' night 
The one get in, I'm crazy, right?
Some sorta wanna be Slim Shady type
I'm a drug addict, with a gun habit
I mean a gun addict, with a drug habit
"The feelin' of a young hood nigga...gettin' cake"
("One muthafucka from the underground
And Big Stretch buckin' niggas if they fuck around
One muthafucka...buckin' niggas if they fuck around")]
All Money In
I got my mind on a million 'fore I turn 26
But that's just what it cost for that condo at the Ritz
I got this European belt, European bitch
Ever seen an African in a European whip?
I got my top off in traffic sprayin' this, got 'em pissed
Police hot 'cause my operation's legit, suck my dick
All my life they've been shootin', thank God they missed, I'm convinced
That I'm for a reason, it don't make sense how they missed
All my niggas is gone but I still exist, I exist
So I got on my knees and I told him this, I repent more than a...

That's real talk, one in a 
We made it
Yeah, you seen me with two bitches but I always say I'm single
Pocket full of singles, watchin' bitches asses jiggle
I told her hit me up and then the bitch gave me a jingle
Took her to the club and made her hold my Desert Eagle
Yeah, they call me Blanco, but no, I'm not Latino
And yeah, I run the mob but don't mistake me for a guido
Pocket full of C-notes, poppin' bottles of the Cliquot
Boppers go where we go 'cause I'm walkin' like I'm Nino
Yeah, I got my swag right, a bitch is what you act like
And bitches look for bitches 'cause you bitches like to catfight
At age 21, I touched a milli on the scale
By age 23, I had a million-dollar bail, one in a...

One in a 
That's real talk, one in a 
Nigga made it
I got my first hundred thousand 'fore I turned 22
And then I went to jail for some shit I did not do
Them niggas think it's rap, huh? 'Til bullet make 'em back up
Know I'm in them movies, bro, but I am not no actor
Way before these contracts, I knew I was all that
Bet she sayin' it once, so if you ask her where that bomb at
She don't even smoke weed, she was just high off contact
Way before I launched that, I understood the concept
Got it from my bro-bro, never drove a 6-4
Used to push that Cut dawg, but now I drive that Benzo
I don't got no girlfriend 'cause baby I'm against those
We say that we just friends but really know that it's more
One in a...one in a...
Check it, I got a pocket full of money and a Benzo full of bitches
I told her I'm the one and she said, "Baby, that's the business"
I think I got that sickness, the sickest I have witnessed
I went to see the doctor and he told my I'm the illest
I'm ridin' with my bro-bro, smokin' on that OG
Right in front of popo 'cause I'm a fuckin' OG
My life is like a movie filled with gangsters and them groupies
Just a week ago, I had some suckers try to shoot me
You lookin' for your girlfriend? She probably at my condo
You lookin' for the gold mine? You need to holler Blanco
'Cause every bitch that I know is nothin' like your bunk hoes
And for you fuckin' haters, that's what I keep a gun for
]Yeah
Alright
Shit hard as fuck
Look
Hussle
All I do is rap about the fast life
You can't relate, you need to get your cash right
I must have been a flashlight in my last life
Because all I do is shine so blow me like a bagpipe
Woodgrain, grams, and gold chains
I'm shutting down traffic I'm switching four lanes
I'm hanging out the window every which way
Every nigga not a pimp but every bitch pay
I'm hard on these hoes like every single day
And I gotta lot of bitches in a lot of different states
I get a lot of pussy but I never got to pay
And all money in is all a nigga got to say
Now one time for my young grind
I spend hundreds I smoke quarters and fuck dimes
Got no love for broke bitches with no drive
I dropped out but I done fine
Right, I know you heard about them stages I've been murdering
Lighting my swishers up as they roll in my room servicing
Them shopping sprees all the fly shit I'm purchasing
Tattoos on my face because now I know I'll never work again
Them pretty bitches that know what their sole purpose is
For them emotions they be working with
Once curb serving in
The kush I'm blowing inside of the coupe that I'm swerving in

Go, it's 24's on the Range Sport
I'm accustomed to red carpets and champagne corks
Corks, we have cabana Armani exchange shorts
And gettin' brain in that Panamera champagne Porsche
Of course, braggin' game the business, bitch
In the VIP with Blanco, got my thang up in this bitch
Got no time for no lames, what you thinkin' in this bitch?
I lay a nigga out flat like you plankin' in this bitch, hold up

And get money, yeahYeah, ay
They ask me how I came up, I don't like to talk about it
And askin’ about my past just have us in an awkward silence
Fuck preacher, I'm off to the islands
You could look at the dope game as a plus or a minus
But I do fuck the finest, I do smoke the best
And I smell of kush bud with a just a touch of success
And they just don't know that I’m just that cold
Like I just got a cold, I got a sick ass flow
I'ma get that dough until I'm so so wealthy
Get this on my own, not a single soul helped me
All I see is jealousy, all I hear is hater shit
All I hear is bitches on my dick, yeah, that player shit
See me ballin' outta control, pockets on swole
But it didn't come easy
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to hustle hard for it
And that's fa sheezy, they just don't know
 What a player had to do
They just don’t know 
’Cause you ain't never been in my shoes
Look, fresh up out that bulletproof 745
Tipped a hundred dollars when the valet grabbed my keys, I'm
Runnin' through this money like these hun’eds is Adidas
They hatin' and I see why, we riders and we fly
You niggas is neither, you know the procedure
Hustle 'til we run out, we count cash and re-up
High 'til we die, so it's motherfuck a detox
And only thing we run is Louis belts through our Levi's
We the one, and I see what this become
They wavin' they white flag, I'm still bustin' my gun
No surrender, no retreat, my nigga, I got to eat
And keep thousand-dollar sneakers on my feet, Hussle
See me ballin' outta control, pockets on swole
But it didn't come easy
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to hustle hard for it
And that's fa sheezy, they just don't know
 What a player had to do
They just don't know 
'Cause you ain't never been in my shoes
Uh, listen, look
Cops can't touch a nigga, never been a sucker nigga
Fuck a bitch, fuck a nigga, All Money money-getter
All I really care about, is the women in my kitchen
Foldin' clothes, washin' dishes got me through them cold Decembers
Told 'em it'd be better days, so that explains the shit I'm into
I kept my word but details is confidential
Not too many niggas have survived the type of shit I've been through
And even less is this nice on an instrumental
Minus the pencil, just the info
They tell me that it's all a mind so I play this shit mental
They see the platinum plates and they assume that it's a rental
'Cause his album's yet to drop, so how he pull up in a Benzo?
Drop the top, bet the bitch got crop
Let it blow in the wind or I'ma roll 'em stock, yock, yock
The stop'll be the block
Grab a phat sack of weed then we hopped on a yacht
See me ballin' outta control, pockets on swole
But it didn't come easy
Ain't nobody gave me shit, I had to hustle hard for it
And that's fa sheezy, they just don't know
 What a player had to do
They just don't know 
'Cause you ain't never been in my shoesWake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I ain't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I don't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Fresh up out the hall for bitin' a nigga nose off
Back in population with gangstas who barely doze off
Try and make 'em think you a killer but said you all talk
Try and be patiently waiting until we called up
Hella people locked right now, they all dark
Never could erase who we were, cold thoughts
Race through my third eye
Niggas gettin' L's who don't deserve life
For tryin' to keep his kids' neighborhood nice
If he could take it all back, he'd probably do what's right
But it's over, so he schooled his soldiers with a date
About the new world's secret agenda
And it all starts here in this place that you've entered
Take a look around, see, they made it for niggas
Pray you make it home, man, 'cause this ain't livin'
How your world fallin' and be so gifted?
You could see the worst right here in them prisons, nigga
Wake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I ain't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I don't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Fresh to the death, fly 'til we die
On the road to riches, I've arrived at Cloud 9
Foil on my wall in the kitchen with my nine
Choppin' work, I had a dream I'd sell records like Sublime
Money over bitches, that's the hustler's design
And self-made success is like sniffin' up a line
I was the underdog that ain't nobody wanna sign
Now I'm the hottest nigga out my city, next in line
Mo' grind, mo' shine, less time for the bullshit
Act up if you want, put your face upon the pulpit
Only closed caskets, I'm givin' you the full clip
Here to let you know, I ain't the one to fool wit': Get it
Hussle, nigga, I don't even understand these bitches
'Cause broke ain't a word that exist in my manuscriptin'
I was helpin' your position, I would have to flip it
Used to wake up in the dope spot with no mattress in it
Wake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I ain't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I thank God that I'm alive
I don't got no 9 to 5 but I'm not out here wasting time
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5 
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5
Wake up on my grind, I ain't got no 9 to 5
I wake up, I make up, I'm ballin', bitch
Get your weight up, no, wait up, I'm hoggin' this shit
So straight up, you haters, is all on my dick
She caked up, she break it up, she roll me my spliff, yeah
Yeah, I'm countin' by hun'eds by the hun'eds
I only smoke joints but I'm feelin' kinda blunted
You did it, I done it, you walk it, I run it
I rise, you plummet, your stack lookin' stunted, ugh
And I keep one hun'ed
I know I'm gonna make it, I can feel it in my stomach
They ask about Guerrilla, and how was it funded
Don't ask about no packs if you still get 'em fronted
And I be goin' dumb wit' it
And after ten mil' then I'm done wit' it
And I be goin' dumb wit' it
And after ten mil' then I'm done wit' it
Haha, yeah, Guerrilla, bitchLook, look, look
Stop, look, and listen
Crank your box, turn up your system
And bang it on the block where you pitchin'
My sentences is reminiscent of what rap missin'
My gold glisten due to the zones I sold in the district
I got bitches, that got niggas, that got digits
When she hit the mall, it's his cash she shoppin' wit'
She know my sizes, 36 and 10 in kicks, so she spendin'
Then hit the women's shit and shoplift
It's crazy how many ladies call me 'baby'
Monica and Mercedes, Tamika and LaShay
We be up all night, she suckin' monkey bites on my swipe
Smokin' blunts like 'this must be life'
Then it's grind and grizzly, nam'sayin'
With so much work I chop rocks with guillotines
I want big things but them thoughts is still a dream
So I'm on the block until I get this cheese, cuz
I don't ride with the work, I leave that to the white bitch
I'm so fly that the judges say I'm a flight risk
Too fly, I'm on the no fly list
How it feel to be a gangsta? Priceless
And I'm sippin' on a Mai Tai
They shot me once but I shot they ass five times
Say goodnight to the bad guy
I'm 'bout my cake, yo: fat guy
And I run California
And I don't need a bodyguard, just a couple lawyers 
I mean some hungry ass lawyers
The type to take a dope case and beat the shit for ya
Benz all black, pistol on my lap
I lost five mil, I'ma get it all back
Benz all black, pistol on my lap
I lost five mil, I'ma get it all back, BITCH!
Yo, since I've been a young nigga, I've been slappin' how niggas goin' hard
All these bitches scorin' goals with these kicks, bitch
50 round K's, young Hus, I'm amazin'
You tongue kiss sluts, put you highly as a player
Say you lettin' off choppas but you're aimin' in the air
In your mind, you's a killer, but on the block, you's a square
I really don't give a shit, stuntin', doin' hella shit
Your girlfriend's favorite, slap low, figure 8 it
My brodie hit me on my line, he say the shit barely made it
When they broke the shit down and notch hit the shit and fainted
I'm iller than ill, bitch, I'm dope than dope, bitch
Your wife is a ho bitch, a ho bitch, you know this, oh shit
Most this, ho shit is fake, so I'm beastin'
Knock you suckers down, come up with 30 shots at least, bitch
Suckers be runnin' around hollerin' this 'money over beef' shit
Husalah Husalah, bitch, I do it 'cause you need itMy face fat
That means I’m eating where your steaks at
Where your real dogs that love you not them fake cats
Where them girls that got your name as a face tatt
Know by your first can't replace that
Beefing with your nigas, so you stay strapped
Believe me its religious where your grace at
Jumping after portswherel you’re faith at
Where the blocks where you made your plays at
I put slauson on the map You gotta face …facts …
Kept it hood like 6 braides and blue wave caps
Said I couldn't but I did, you can’t change that
You can hate it, you can love it that won't change jack
You can hate ot you can love it
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn’t, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn’t I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me
Haters try to fuck with my mind, keep on talking from behind
I ain’t got no worries at all
Nigga I grind for this, homie im made for this

They can hate but I know they gotta hear this song
Ooh, and you ain't ever found a young nigga like me

Hate it or love it

Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn’t, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn’t I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me
From one way bus stops, busting ‘til the gun stop
To pulling up in young drop, and parking front of drug spots
Look at how your young popped …Look at how this young flock
Looking out my living room, like hell no, I won’t stop
All I need is one shut, that;s just how we was taught
Sitting in a circle all silent thas cause funds talk
…desperation rubbed off…find myself I was lost
Sketched it out,architecht the blue prints of a young boss
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my gride I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn’t, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn’t I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me
Some times i think that..
All I do it’s break hearts, all this nigga fake hard..i ain't caught a state charge
So I just wanna thank God, see me in that new cord see me with a new broad
Everything I’ve been throught tell me i went to far
I ain’t have enough niga, screaming out, fuck niggas
This ain’t good luck nigga, another good run nigga
I’d have too or three, and between you and me
I don’t hate none of yours
Cuz jealousy ain't new to me
Hate or love it, hate or love it
I will never stop my grade I came too far to look behind
You say I couldn’t, I did it, I did it
You say I wouldn’t I did, I did
And you can stop me, you can stop me, you can stop me noHey, money, money

My brody made it home, now we back in the zone
First make a hundred thousand, then do it on parole
A nigga stop hatin' even on probation
I hustle harder, hustle smarter, and bring more cake in
Death to all talkin', watch demonstration
It's true the root of forced love is crew's infiltration
Watchin' niggas watch me as I stack this paper
Ain't no one chop a nigga down like I'm half Jamaican
No exaggeration, 'til then I ain't asked to take it
Now I'm the new crown holder and these streets is waitin'

Or pick another nigga 'cause I will not lose
These are Louboutins, they are not shoes
Who want it, nigga? Duck, duck, goose
Four-door Aston lookin' like a coupe
I 'member when I used to dream about the paper
Now my mama open magazined and read about me, Paypa
Lookin' for the money? Everybody meet Paypa
Coldest nigga out, full-length mink, tailored
I never said I was the hardest or the illest
Just the realest to you midgets, I'm a giant in the buildin'

455, I drive by doing 100
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!
Hustle hustle Listen!
Look Black on Black Mercedes tattoos on my lady friends
...
I turn these hoes to lesbians
Make a fuck or best of friends
Get here for one hour, smell the blood and catch my second...
I've been on my tour bus
She probably just had sex with him
She's out of your possession
You cannot protect her...
South Central that's my residence
Barely like those...
And if I'm not the king of this
I must be the president
O M G I'm in a shit!
Money is my medicine
Shout out to my niggas in the pen Text Messaging
Shout out to them bitches gettin it in, in they crevices
... Make sex scenes so irrelevant
Forget about the risk we took, I never can
Rebel in this white man's world until they bury him
Being broke is so un-American
That's why I'm screaming all money Till the End!
Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!
Pull up the old school, me and lil Shady Blue
Fresh up out the County jail, they held us up without no bail
Ten stacks to my lawyer, said a plan so we prevail
Jealous niggas hated that love to see a nigga fail
Miss me with that "Bro I love you"
Suck a nigga beef for real
Fake as 4 dollar bills
Hit the gas, we out of here!
Oh no, wait! A fox heels, spinning like we got a meal
Smoked so mush Kush got us feeling we off a Pill
They know we got dollar still
And bitches know we got the bill
Eating ..  Been here daily, drive my baby momma crazy
Name a nigga that could faze me
Pussy dad does not persuade me
I swear I'll make them hate me
Plus we never shop at Macy's
Louis V, Gucci, maybe
... Blue Mercedes
We were both familiar faces
Spinning faster, dogging cases
... Bring the cases, that's what we told the waitress
... For all you try to play us
Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shot!
Plus, plus, straight pants,...
You thought that I'll be dead doing life, cause what I rap is true
Just another you know who
Sam had some time to do
And yea, Steve is cool, but I heard Mick used an animal
Fuck with what they were talking about
We just did what we had to do
It became the most valuable, after I dropped that on you tube
From the West Coast at least, and for the West Coast I speak
Cause I'm filled with guilt,...
Where I'm supposed to be
I'll be yours... Been this shit
You all forgot to...
And like the... My pistol will smoke for free
If money ain't got no on streets
Got to keep her close to me
Put that on the man that's on the cross...
It wasn't always banking but I speak about it openly
No shame in my game
I did my thing, go in... Streets
Who's the hottest on the West
All you niggers know it's me
So tell whoever had the luck that Nipsey Hussle stole the key
Chorus:
...
And I stay...
Cause I do what I need
And that's the reason that they love me
Cause I've been making money
The keys to my city!
It feels good to be on top, I got the keys to the city!
This is how it feels to be a big shotI'm just a nigga tryna see my cheese
Gucci loafs at the bottom of my BRB’s
So when I step, the bitches be like "who is he?"
I be like "Nip Hussle baby, move with me"
Now if I could show you some things that you don't usually see
We could overlook the city from the sunset sweet
We could float in the Pacific off the 
Motion sickness from the waves, give her Pepto B
I act smart, yes y'all, Nipsey is the best, y’all
Front of the building with a house on my neck, y'all
Yes y'all, push block money to the limit
Be in them spots till the cops kick offf the hindges
Get off my biskits, all about that quick flip
Anything I put in it, I get it back with interest
I take care of my business, Slauson boy I am this
Young nigga on the road to the riches
And I'm higher than a kite, 24 7 nigga, that's my life
Bring the hook in
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
It's the D O Double R!
Ticed up, iced up, hoes they be like "damb"
 so fresh, 
Get it in, oh yes, go to sleep, oh no
 get it done solo
 just me 
This ain't high school, bitch don't test me
Do it bigger than I ever done it, shit let’s see
Been throwed in this game, niggas can’t catch me
Money over everything, business over money though
Shining so hard, that they call me Mr. Sunny Glo
Y'all niggas dead broke, what the fuck you fronting for?
I’m a straight track star, what the fuck you running for?
Shit getting real though, niggas want the same life
Ain't shit free, niggas pay the same price
Hoes come, hoes go, most of them the same type
Meet a bitch one day, knock her down the same night
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
One milly, two milly, three milly four
How many millys can I stash in the floor?
Five mill, six mill, seven maybe more
I live the life that you cannot aford
I wake up every morning to a joint of the cookies
Acting all hard but you look like a sissy
I stay strapped up like a motherfucking Wooky
Nd one word describes you motherfuckers, pussy
Where's my motherfuckin money at?
I'm like a banker holding the money back
And I’m just feeling myself
I treat you like my stepson, hit you with my belt
Until they scream "Blanco, don't hit me no more"
I shoot my last bitch, cause that bitch was a whore
Flipped the new bitch, and this bitch is a whore
I used to be rich, but shit I'm kinda poor
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my money
Bitch better have my money, bitch better have my moneyUh! What? Yeah
Turn me up a little bit
Where yo money at?
We gon’ smoke a hundred sacks
Shootin’ up your block
Switch cars, then we double back
You a funny cat
You ain’t made a hundred racks
You ain’t nothin’ like Nip Hussle
That’s a fuckin’ fact
Puttin' on for my city, got 100 stats
I’m the realest nigga in it, can’t front on that
A lot of fake niggas hate me cause they wanna rap
But if they dumb enough to say it I’ma fuckin snap
Big guns, big guns, I got big guns
AR’s, AK’s, nigga pick one
This young nigga on that shit you should get on
And I promise she get fucked if yo bitch come
Know some Inglewood niggas showed a crip love
He was like that nigga Nip kinda sick blood
Know them east side niggas bang my shit tough, it's all of love
Even to my homeboys that switched up
Funny thing is they swore when I get rich
I would turn my back on em but I’m still up in the mix
God damn, ain't that a bitch
Can a young pull up in a six gettin' his dick sucked
Where yo money at? 50’s and yo 100's at?
Drop my new shit, tour the world then we double back
I be runnin laps 'til I’m runnin rap
I don’t want no help, ain’t no fun in that
Like the type of raps make you wanna stack
Make a nigga want a Benz, make 100 racks
I heard yo tape, where you done it at?
Where you ever grind? Where you stunted at?
You wasn't full time, you was comin' back
You was like I’m finna roll, it was finna crack
Cause you ain’t want none of that
Give me love, give me cash, give me respect
Anything, other than, I’ma reject
Give me time, give me space, give me a sec
On the real, what you gone get is the best
You lowin', I ain’t fuckin' wit' it at all, you know it
Niggas ain't standin' this tall, you know it
All money in the name of the squad
That's how you niggas know we came to ball, just watch
Big guns, big guns, I got big guns
AR’s, AK’s, nigga pick one
Big guns, big guns, I got big guns
AR’s, AK’s, nigga pick oneStreets on lock, Beamers on stop
Bullets bounce back, leave the drivers unshot
City on my shoulder, Slauson Ave. soldier
So to all my enemies, my dead body is a trophy
Talkin' ’bout trophies, I think I deserve one
Hotter nigga in these streets, holla if you heard one
Know a nigga sick 'cause I'm the shit with no surgeon
And them Roc Nation rumors ain’t true, but yeah, I heard 'em
Swervin' in that new Lexus with the shift kit on the steering
Wheel, step, 'tronic, got muthafucka purrin'
One thing's for sure, two things for certain
West Coast, Nipsey Hussle, game over, closed curtains
On my pursuit of happiness, I made the cash double
And introduced Italian shoes to German gas pedals
Like Gucci and Prada, here's Benzes and Beamers
All Money In, let no materials come in between us
I know they hopin' they could BMF and Big Meech us
But I got lawyers paid up and off last features
I singlehandedly became the man in my region
You would think it’s a crime how they witnessed my genius
Streets on lock, Beamers on stop
Bullets bounce back, leave the drivers unshot
City on my shoulder, Slauson Ave. soldier
So to all my enemies, my dead body is a trophy
Talkin’ 'bout trophies, I think I deserve one
Hotter nigga in these streets, holla if you heard one
Know a nigga sick ’cause I'm the shit with no surgeon
And them Roc Nation rumors ain't true, but yeah, I heard 'em
Swervin’ in that black Beamer with them button-pressed curtains
They go up and she go down and serve a nigga like a servant
Pull it out her mouth and she gon' ride it like a surfer
Phone ringin', she pick up and tell her man she workin'
Slurpin', everything a nigga got to urfer, offer
I'ma fuck once and I'll be off her
On to, bigger, better things like the dollar
Amount that Epic want versus what Def Jam offeredYeah, fuck you
Fuck you, too
Fuck you, bitch
Fuck you, motherfucker
You ain't shit anyway, fuck you
You ain’t shit, you fat motherfucker
Yeah, whatever whatever
Whatever
You wasn't sayin' that when you was suckin’ my dick
You wasn't sayin that when you was eatin' my pussy
You nasty bitch
You a nasty motherfucker
Check it, uhh
Bust it, look
Nip Hussle, dope flow like yayo
I'm a boss, nothin' move 'less I say so
I'm a business, you a nigga on a payroll
Here come recession, there go your J-O
B, but we fly high
On more chrome than ever every time I ride by
MACs and Berettas tell you niggas no lie
From a hood so hot, it's heat waves in the sky
Remember, every day was like the Fourth of July
At war, so you had to keep your pistol in your ride
Lean low, kush smoke in the sky
Watchin’ out for blue cars driven by white guys
Now it’s like, white clouds with blue skies
Dumpin' out the blunt through the roof of my ride
European grille with the letters inside
Ain’t a nigga this fly comin' out the WestsideYuh, look, look
Who fuckin' with me? Tell me one name
And ask him if he came from dope spots and gunplay
Finally off the runway, damn it feel good to spend a thousand on my son's shades
Look, with street smarts who I dumb paid
Seen the brake lights, I had to swerve off the runway
Uh, I knew that I would make it one day
Know I gotta be a real nigga 'cause I'm unphased
I got a Beamer with a whole lot of trunk space
 fuck face actin' mad 'cause he unpaid
And I been out here since a young age
I never been the type to complain
I'ma let my gun bang
By any means to make my funds raise
I'm on this money marathon, nigga, so I run things
Check out this status that I obtained
It's ten racks and four tickets if you want me at your club, mane
And in the scheme of things, that's chump change
When you doin' ten a month and savin' up when you done things
I Crip hard and get love from the Blood gang
Blue Chucks on the Red Carpet like, "Fuck fame"Yes, Nip
Montana
Wiz
Uh
Roll up a blunt

Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah

Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it
Got the proposition with no pot to piss in
We the hardest out, it ain't no competition
And I be's the jungle fever
Get the hard chiba, lower than a dark caesar
Unbeatable, unbelievable and the drug dealers love me
Told me I ain't need the blow
Here's a half a brick, nigga, you don't need to show
But I took it easy like I don't see the toll
Jewelry 3 below, niggas get pita rolled
Tunnel vision on that money, I don't see a hoe

Yeah, uh
First nigga to put it down, rep the city the way I do it
Got these niggas rollin' they drugs, bitches with they hand out
But we don't feed nothin' but champagne and zigzag stuffers
Takin' pictures with my campaign stuntin'
Nigga, I ain't showin off, them niggas tuck they wings
I'm the flyest in my course
High as fuck at the game, sittin' courtside with my bad bitch and she roll up too
Just a couple names you should fear
Nowhere near tired but had a good year
If bitches still choosin' niggas hatin' on me
If you ain't talkin' paper, that's another story
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it
Yuh, Hussle, listen
Look
See I'm the type of nigga they know not to push
Plus I got them type of choppers leave Osama shook
Real crook, you would think I'm was some type of Bush
Those bitches open their legs so I octopus
It's all money in, but that's just common sense
I wish that y'all could see these checks I be depositin'
We drives in, bitches rides in
Bitch times ten like fuck who I offend
We just do us, you just copy them
Two X's, one L, we the top ten
And I ain't never been too big about what the critics say
Unless the critics say that type of shit that get me baked
Hussle
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it
I just, I just, I just want the money and the power 
And I get 'em both ten thousand miles an hour 
That's why your girl would leave with me but you will not allow her
Fuck your lil' section, bitch, I want the entire
My nigga Wiz roll up like we cripple, respect
Man, I bet syou call big when I'm little 
And she gone' call me big when she wiggle
Me and two hoes and I'm just chillin' in the middle 
Bitch, your whole life is fictional
Your bitch want to play doctor on my dick, she want my physical
Smokin' medical marijuana, my shit's medicinal
I love it, love it, love it
Bitch, I love it unconditional 
Roll up a blunt
I got what you need
Bitches they love it, bitches they love it, haah
Roll up the weed
Everything's on the house fuckin' with me
And the money call, nigga I'm on it
Nigga, I'm from the streets
Bitches fuck and leave, haah
And, nigga, I'm on it
Nigga, I'm on it
HaahYuh, me and my nigga Rimpau was on the way to the studio
And cuz had that, um, that Wiz and Curren$y mixtape in the tape deck, the CD changer
And I heard this beat I'm like, "What the fuck?"
Yahp!
Ya know, only thought it’s right for my 58,000th leak
Shit, hear we go
Like this, look
7 days a week, 7 different freaks
But I got tired of fuckin' hoes so I just smoke and count my cheese
Watchin' Godfather, leather couches, flat screens
I say I’m on this marathon, she ask me, “What does that mean?”
Ain't no puff and pass, please roll your own, I do the same
Girl, get on that Marlon Brando and stop tryna pick my brain
Yo boyfriend is a lame, that's why you're not used to this game
And if you lookin' for me, I'll be first class on a plane
Ixnay my landin' gear 'cause I don’t need no runway
My final destination is a cloud, it’s a one-way
Fuckin' with them streets, ain’t no stranger to this gunplay
But I now I eat these beats and I don't never take a lunch break
Back to back Swisher Sweets, never on no sober shit
Post-traumatic stress, I feel like that's what I'm copin’ with
So I smoke the best, impossible not to notice this
Thirty thousand feet up, I cross the Atlantic Ocean with a pack of Swishers rolled
And if my time ain't even over yet
I'm tryna live my life so when it's over I got no regrets
The keys to success, multiply what you approach it with
Got to roll a dice but the first time that you can go legit
Seize the opportunity, believe and take control of it
Then get on your marathon and grind it 'til it's over with
Napa Valley Dolce, my cup runneth over with
My trunk is in my roof, ayy, you know who you rollin' with
Hussle
I know a place we can go where you can be yourself
You ain't gotta worry and we ain't gotta rush, 'cause we not in no hurry
You can't be afraid to let go, you gotta let go of yourself
But you ain't gotta worry, 'cause this gon' take some time
But we not in no hurry
Fifty-eight thousand

Was you born in the 80's? Did your mama smoke cocaine?
Have you ever seen a whole thang?
What you drove through to the streets 'cause you grew up on short change?
Fucked up when the dope age
It remind me when these rappers drop duds and they clothes change
Had the part with the low fade
I would stand in front of Nix wit my sack for the whole day
Drive-by's, that was road rage
Then we park and hop out, learn levels to this whole thang
Old school play the O'Jays
Tryna make a slow change, mama still slavin' for a low wage
Tryna

Lucky I ain't get caught up in the twist
Young nigga, blue pager on my hip so

The muthafuckin' marathon continues
Every thousand followers on Twitter, got a leak for you niggas
It’s 'cause I do this
Hussle
Gossip, gossip, all I hear is gossip
But everybody know that I'm from Crenshaw and Slauson
In this marathon since my mixtape dropped in
This is for them niggas wondering if I can top it
Uh, I’m I'll as shit, fo' sho' tho'
My Benz coupe stupid, dodo
Showboat, give me cash fo' sho'
If it ain't, my nigga, no go
Fresh back from the fuckin’ UK
I stayed for one week and got paid each day
Shopping in Harrods heard the white boys say
"That, that’s Nipsey Hussle he's massive in the States"
Check out the odds and the obstacles I’ve conquered
Therefore my progress makes me a monster
First one to make a name without the Doctor's co-sign
I'm fine, the streets is my sponsor
And they hold me down quite well
Can't ya tell, pound sign fell
Follow me, holla my name at the show
This is dedicated to the girls front row
When I’m rocking stages and my pants sag low
I ain't mad, go and grab, and go for what you know
Bright lights, different cities every night
Livin' that type of life all the pretty girls like
Fuck but don't wife 'cause they just not right
The type to sell their soul to stand in the spotlight
Long flights got me thinking 'bout the type
Of thoughts through the heads of my niggas that caught life
We all got balls, they caught strikes
And we don't got swag, we got stripes
I took my turf to new heights
And I'm so Slauson Ave. I got it tattooed twice
Nigga, huh, the, the marathon continues
Oh, the marathon continues
Oh, the marathon continues
So act like you know, bitch
Bitches, niggas, hoes
Crips and Bloods
Fake Crips and Bloods
Rappers, singers
All you niggas get on this marathon
Road to the riches, you know, huh, huh
Hussle hussle
Gossip, gossip, all I hear is gossip
But all you niggas know that I'm from Crenshaw and Slauson
It's the leak, nigga
See you niggas at 55,000Hey, soon as I step out on the scene
Cameras flash, get my cash right
Livin' like I'm stuck in a dream, must be that new money
Large and on the turnpike, shootin' up the shine bright
Mama how I wish you could see this new money
When I hop up out the jet jet, new money
Out the friendly skies, hey, know it's new money
Never goin' broke, my bank got new money
Mama how I wish you could see this new money
I stack rubber band racks, all tax get evaded
My sort of way of saying 'Fuck the system that enslaved us'
We want it all but won't let it all change us
So we don't respect players that's playin' to say they played it
To confident fools, I choose not to say shit
The rocks in my jewels are viewed as my language
I've been the shit, so I don't take it to the brain
When these pretty flight attendants compliment me on my fragrance
Louis on the baggage claim, Pirellis on the pavement
Yves Saint Laurent, Jean Paul Gaultier scent
A hundred thousand plus monthly, yeah, I make it
But kept it on some S-dome on top of six braids shit
They see me on TV and swear to God I'm changin'
But ask BET if I was backstage blazin'
This new money got these old niggas hatin'
You better know my aim is amazin'
Bow, nigga
Hey, soon as I step out on the scene
Cameras flash, get my cash right
Livin' like I'm stuck in a dream, must be that new money
Large and on the turnpike, shootin' up the shine bright
Mama how I wish you could see this new money
When I hop up out the jet jet, new money
Out the friendly skies, hey, know it's new money
Never goin' broke, my bank got new money
Mama how I wish you could see this new money+Fast money, fast women
Fast cars, black leather, black denim
These streets, I was in 'em
Stack money to the muthafuckin' ceiling
Got no feelings, it's fuck bitches
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah
All Money In No Money Out, we get it, yeah
Look, All Money In No Money Out, we get it
Fast cars, fast money, fast bitches
Marijuana scented, got me smellin' so suspicious
Runnin' through the airport 'cause we always last minute
Yeah, but they know I'm that nigga
So they rush a nigga through security, no hassle him
Nah, first class black nigga
Robin Jeans, black denim, pockets got cash in 'em, nigga
Fail a drug test like I'm Barry Bonds
'Cause I'm the type to keep the kush inside the carry-on
Look in my eye, I'm very gone
Flight stewardess tell me she knows every song
Signin' pictures, last year I was barely known
Now I'm booked up, so I'm barely home
Rockin' stages, sellin' out each and every show
I killed the game with bullets, this is the burial, nigga
Uh, yeah, Hussle music, hotel room shit, niggaThey hit your ass up like motherfucker, where you from cuh?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
My niggas crooked, though it seems
My every single, thought is caught up, in collectin’ cream
A made nigga, Picture me dyin’ in the blaze, or gunfire
Will not retire ’til I’m paid, turn the bass up high
When we ride, we fly by, bitches blow me kisses
Niggas from Compton to Brooklyn come on get your riches
From Crenshaw to 1-2-5 and do or die
Rollin’ with niggas from Long Beach, to Long I
I hardly smile, cause my heart froze
Once I, commence my show, I rip apart foes
Now I, got one nation its a crooked compilation
Just to end the bullshit let’s get back to money makin’
Tell ’em bustas that I rolled on, controllin’ our house
My shit’s so wicked when I flip, niggas closin’ they mouth
Them Cocoa brovaz, Buckshot the BDI thug
Greg Nice, LS, Asu, so show a nigga love, Outlaw
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
A nigga had the nerve to walk up on me ask me where I'm from
I told him I ain't bang, didn't listen so I gave you one
Not the cididy one, nigga try to hit him up
Now you only get him up, set it up and wet it up
Nub from the hood, checking niggas on the daily
Started off BG, OG, baby
Real life homie, two heaters in my seat
Had to check a nigga at the Compton Swap Meet
Where you from? I don't bang
Where you live? Where you hang?
Say the wrong thing, get banged
Lights out, kites out to the homies in the pen
Crip'ing in the city, we ain't lettin' the cuz in
A lot of niggas camouflage, try to blend in to fit in
Get a hood rat so they sit in
But if she got a brother, a daddy, or a cousin
They hit your ass up like motherfucker, where you from cuh?
What they call you where you from, nigga?
In my city, that was question number 1, nigga
Looking at the legend I become, nigga
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
What they call you where you from, nigga?

What they call you where you from, nigga?
I can't help but feeling like I am the one, nigga
Felt entitled to this fly shit
Felt like every bad bitch should be on my dick
Felt like niggas lying to us on some fraud shit
Fuck it, that's just how the ball bounce on some boss shit
Right here with all my brothers, on some squad shit
All money, one nation under God shit
Neighbourhood, Nipsey Hussle, on some boss shit
AKA nigga born broke, gotta die rich
What they call you where you from, nigga?

Yeah
Hennessy make plenty enemies
You feel me?
Throw you’ girls up
HahaOne thing I promise I’m gon keep on ballin
Bitch all in her feelings wishing me bad karma
Drop my yellow bone and came back with a tropic
500 horses when we park on slauson
I can’t understand how you act all salty
She said I can’t understand how u act all cocky
I can’t meet you at Delilah’s
Can’t meet you at Papi’s
I like my bitches bossed up and my dick sucked sloppy
Italian silk from Versace
Opens went up at wallies
I made my first million dollars
I ain’t change my persona
Yeah we came up retarded
Dickie shorts and impalas
Yellow tape them apartments
Gang enhancement them charges
Can’t forget how I started
My success was symbolic
My finesse was iconic
How I glowed up out the darkness
She said I can’t understand how you act all cocky
I can’t understand how you act all salty
One thing I promise I’m gone keep on ballin
Bitch all in her feelings wishing me bad karma
Drop my yellow bone and came back with a tropic
500 horses when we park on slauson
I can’t understand how you act all salty
She said I can’t understand how you act all cocky
I can’t meet you at Delilah’s
Can’t meet you at Papi’s
I like my bitches bossed up and my dick sucked sloppy
I like lil baby how she hold it down
She play that shit cool
You ain’t gon bring at least a hundred thou
Don’t fuck up my mood
Pull up and spray you wit a hundred rounds
The fuck you gon do?
Say you ain’t tryna get the money now
When the fuck you gon do it?
I need me a bank
Couple bad bitches
Bussing up Ben Franklins
I ain’t give da shit to none of my niggas
We hide da real estate or on my lawyer
I’m just sitting on the block with it on
The hood on the day up there
It be hard to talk to God
Pray my nigga good when he go up there
Ain’t no love for the weak
You ain’t thuggin like me
I got money on me
I’m a selfish individual
But I ain’t gone eat 
If my brother don’t eat
I’m a nigga that lost alot but
I ain’t gone sleep til I’m up on my feet
Ask that lil shawty I’m programmed
That shit be irritating
I ain’t no nigga that liked to post no memes
I’m gone handle business baby
Gotta envision they handed us nothing
Look at what niggas made it
But I’m still standing up can’t be
Penetrated
Real nigga
One thing I promise I’m gone keep on ballin
