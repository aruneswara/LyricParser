Make that thing pop like a semi or a 9
Ooh, baby like it raw with the shimmy shimmy ya, huh?
A$AP , get like me 
Never met a motherfucker fresh like me 
All these motherfuckers wanna dress like me 
But the chrome to your dome make you sweat like Keith
‘Cause I'm the nigga, the nigga, nigga, like how you figure? 
Gettin' figures and fuckin' bitches, she rollin' Swishers
Brought her bitches, I brought my niggas 
They gettin' bent up off the liquor 
She love my licorice, I let her lick it 
They say money make a nigga act nigga-ish 
But least a nigga, nigga rich
I be fuckin' broads like I be fuckin' bored
Turn a dyke bitch out, have her fuckin' boys, beast

Ooh, I know you love it when this beat is on
Make you think about all of the niggas you been leadin' on
Make me think about all of the rappers I've been feedin' on
Got a feelin' that's the same dudes that we speakin' on, oh word?
Ain't heard my album? Who you sleepin' on?
You should print the lyrics out and have a fuckin' read-along
Ain't a fuckin' sing-along 'less you brought the weed along
Then ju-, okay, I got it
Then just drop down and get your eagle on
Or we can stare up at the stars and put the Beatles on
All that shit you talkin' 'bout is not up for discussion
I will pay to make it bigger, I don't pay for no reduction
If it's comin' from a nigga I don't know, then I don't trust it
If you comin' for my head, then motherfucker get to bustin'
Yes, Lord, I don't really say this often
But this long-dick nigga ain't for the long talkin', I'm beast
I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem 
And yeah, I like to fuck, I got a fuckin' problem

If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it
Uh, yeah, ho, this the finale
My pep talk turn into a pep rally
Say she from the hood but she live inside in the valley, now
Vacay'd in Atlanta, then she goin' back to Cali 
Got your girl on my line, world on my line
The irony, I fuck 'em at the same damn time
She eyein' me like a nigga don't exist
Girl, I know you want this dick
Girl, I'm Kendrick Lamar 
A.K.A. Benz is to me just a car 
That mean your friends-es need be up to par
See, my standards are pampered by threesomes tomorrow  Kill 'em all, dead bodies in the hallway
Don't get involved, listen what the crystal ball say
Halle Berry, hallelujah
Holler back, I'll do ya, beast

If findin' somebody real is your fuckin' problem
Bring your girls to the crib, maybe we can solve it, ayyUh, feelin' like a vigilante or a missionary
Tell my A$AP killers, get they pistols ready
Send 'em to the cemetery with obituaries
Don't be scared, nigga, is you ready?
I've been thinkin' 'bout all the O's in my bank account 
Extra hoes in my bed is 'round the same amount 
Ever since this new star fame came about
Or ever since me and Drizzy started hangin' out, huh
Young boy, let his gun bang, let his nuts hang
Transition to a Lamborghini from a Mustang
Drugs slang in the drug game with the hustling
 Anything is better than that 1 Train
Bag made of Goyard, cheffin' like I'm Boyar—
Dee,probably sellin' D in your local courtyard
Braids like I'm O-Dog, my la familia go hard
Down to my inlaws, they outlaws with no laws
We outlawed then I bogart, any pros that got 'proached at
With a toe-tag, get broke off in the projects with a skateboard
I roll past and I blaze y'all like, "Doo, doo," I hate y'all
When the beef cooked, I ate y'all like, "Mmm, mmm!"
Let's play ball in a ballpark with all sharks and a blindfold
I rhyme cold, my K hot, your 9 cold, that bark like K9's on
That banana clip, straight from the rip
I'll make that shirt say R.I.P. I'm on some shit
If I'm not the hottest then Hell must have froze over
You thought it was safe then forgot what the code was
I carry traits of a traumatized soldier
Don't look in my face, I might snap, I might choke ya
Spine right out of place, give me dap like you 'posed ta
Darts at your posters, dark nights like this
I metamorph like I'm 'posed ta, I might slice my wrist
Or pretend like a vulture and drop off this cliff
Barely even conscious, talkin' to my conscience
Gettin' deeper in these flows like conches
I'm on my convict, don't drop bars, I drop prisons
Don't sell rocks, seen the spectrum through the prisms
Somehow bypassed the bias and the -isms
The violence and the killin', so given
They seen my pigment and thought that was the ign'ance
Unfortunately, I am not that type of niglet
But pass the pot, let me skillet
Just got back to the block from a 6 o'clock with Jigga
And I'm thinkin' 'bout signin' to the Roc
But my niggas on the block still assigned to the rocks
And I swear it hurt me soul
I try to prevail, but when I preach, I only hurt their sales
Like you're only gon' end up either dead or in jail
But you my nigga, wish you the best for real
When you mention my name amongst other white rappers
Or for that matter; any fuckin' rapper, fuck it; Painter
Skater, musician, trailer park, dirt-ditch-diggin'
Burger-flippin', eat; sleep; shittin' human bein', you would be in
Trouble to body-double or couple me to these others
'Cause comparatively speakin', my reach is beyond the bubble
That they put me in, my vision's beyond the Hubble's
I huddle with Nubians, new beginnin' again
You in school at 10, late, Radioactive's goin' gold
And so? Great! Do I give a flying duck
If I'm applyin' love to my rhymin' plus alignin' us?
Alabama's climbin' up—wait! No, I don't give a
Flying duck nothin' but a buckshot; ch-pow!
Motherfuck your life, pussy blood-clot
Ain't never been no rapper this cold since 2Pac was froze
And thawed out for a spot date at a Coachella show—Yelawolf
Weed a different color like a hoodrat bra and panties
And my flow be overhead like pots and pans in pantries
Antsy 'cause I'm high like Michael Jackson, penny loafers
Moonwalkin' on the sun, barefoot, with shades on
Bitch pussy smell like a penguin
Wouldn't hit that shit with my worst enemy's penis
Bitch, when I say this, I mean this: Ho, I'm the meanest
Dick so big, it's like from Earth to Venus
That molly got me nauseous, aw, shit, no off switch
Lawless, obnoxious, on that "suck my cock" shit
That is my synopsis, ostrich's posh shit
Hoes on some goth shit, stop it! You not this!
Novice, regardless, heartless and awkward
Cryin' tears of vodka, prima donna at the concert
Adonis smokin' chronic, 'bout to vomit gin and tonic
Just bein' honest, tell me, isn't that ironic?
Swiftly, I shift the Bimmer 860
A heavy smoker, so you know I brought the Blake with me
The moon’s reflection off the lake hit me
You should have stayed with me
Now many Asian bitches lay with me
The face is silky like a tablecloth
My shorty gallop in the mornin' on the beach like a Chilean horse
Red roses dropped from boxes very often
Confetti torchin', drinkin' Henny like I'm Kenny Lofton
Outstandin'
I fixed the game between Georgia Southern and Gramblin'
You see us scramblin', sellin' Susan Sarandon
The cloud of smoke like the phantom
Damn, this shit tastes like fantastic, uh
You see me comin' through in each state
Just so the lord could put the fork inside the cheesecake
Cuffed to my wrist, I've got the briefcase
The gavel slam, I'm a free man, try not to eat ham
Big K.R.I.T., shawty
Spit like my last breath: casket rap, six deep
Eyes closed, the black is back, out come the 'lac with flats
After that, bottles I can't pronounce, like, “How you ask for that?”
Why you ask for crack and all you had was scratch?
All I had was rap, when all they had was wack
All I wanted was love and all they had was dap
Fuck them haters and fuck them hoes, a championship win is
The aftermath, ask LeBron, open palm, slap a bitch
Walk the plank or break a bank, I've been in the business of sinkin' ships
Chokin' niggas out with the anchors that they anchor with
Resuscitations cost the label, I'm taxin' if you want a hit
Clear, fuck your career, bitch, I was born here
Been a killer, '86er nigga, that's my born year
Get the fuck from 'round here, that's just my country ways
Suckin' on your momma's titty, bitchin' while I was choppin' blade
Grippin' grain, fuckin' hoes, candy paint like Everglades
Miss me with that rapper chatter, take that shit up with my bass
I put that on my soul, how could you ever doubt me?
Most rappers hopin' the world end so they won't have to drop another album
B.B. King saw the king in me, so why can't you?
In order to come up close, you'll have to dig up Cash and Elvis, too
Muddy water flow, Dixie rebel past
Fuck your Louis flag, poppin' benji tags on your wifey's ass 
That's out of line, but in livin' color?
I'm more like Miya Bailey on you rap motherfuckers: a true artistAha, aha
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Let's take it to the basics, you in the midst of greatness
My Martin was a Maison, rocked Margielas with no laces
Cristal go by the cases, wait hold up that was racist
I would prefer the Aces, ain't no different when you taste it
A 40 ounce to chase it, that's just a understatement
I'm early to the party, but my 'Rari is the latest
Somehow it seems girls in they late teens
Remind me your favorite jeans cause they naked cause you famous
Life's a mothafucka, ain't it? These other rappers ain't us
So tell me what your name is, I'ma tell it to my stainless
You aim it 'fore you bang it let that banger leave you brainless
It's just me, myself, and I and mothafuckas that I came with
Miscellaneous niggas wanna hate on me
Until I tell 'em to they face they ain't no G
Low key, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Yes, I'm the shit, tell me do it stink?
It feel good wakin' up to money in the bank
Three model bitches, cocaine on the sink
And I'm so 'bout it 'bout it, I might roll up in a tank
Cause my chain came from Cuba, got a lock up on the link
And them red bottom loafers just to compliment the mink
Eyes chink, rollin' up that dank, blowin' on that stank
What you mean? Tell me what you drink, I'm on that kissin' pink
You could call me Billy Gates, got a crib in every state
Man on the moon, got a condo out in space
Open up your legs, tell me how it taste
And them niggas talkin' shit so tell 'em, “Tell it to my face”
Tell that bitch, hop up on my dick, rolled up on her quick
In a six, told her suck a dick, motorboat her tits
I'm the shit, niggas mad cause I'm smooth puffin' Zig-Zags
Tell 'em quit the riff raff bitchin' with your bitch ass
I said it must be 'cause a nigga got dough
Extraordinary swag and a mouth full of gold
Hoes at my shows they be strippin' off they clothes
And them college girls write a nigga name on they toes
Niggas talk shit 'til they get lockjaw
Chrome to ya dome 'til ya get glockjaw
Party like a cowboy or a rockstar
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off
Oh, yeah, oh, right
Oh, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh, yeah, oh, yeah
Oh, yeah
Everybody play the tough guy 'til shit pop off Get it
Text a message, I don't know the number
Flexin' on these niggas, every bone and muscle
Steady taking shots, but never hurting numbers
Even then, y'all don't worry nothin'
And I'd like to give a shout-out to my niggas with a game plan
And shout-outs to my niggas with escape plans
Uh, twenty bands, rain dance
We could either rain check or we can make plans
Pockets loaded, rocket loaded, okay, let's rock and roll this
It's time to go, Lock, Stock, and Two Smoking Barrels
Locked and loaded, diamonds glowing, chart-climbing on 'em
You'd think I'm jumping out the window how I got 'em open
Line around the corner, line 'em up the block and over
Sometimes I even stop the smoking when it's time to focus
My shades, Dior, my pants, velour
Create, explore, expand, conquer
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
Yeah, I sold the pack, the loose, the hard 
I listened to X, I peeped the bars 
The snakes, the rats, the cats, the dogs
The game's a trap, protect your heart 
I waited in line, return, refine
The new design, it's time to shine
To shine, to shine, to shine, to shine
I hustle, I flex, the world is mine
So please believe, allow the greaze
These niggas disease, don't speak, we squeeze
I make the devil go weak the knees
You hate, you're lame, your loss
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
Uh, she came, I came, now what's my name?
My chain, my pants, my pants with the chain
They know it's me, the hat and the shades
They heard my voice and they ran to the stage
My Vans, my braids, my mans, my babes
My girls, my ex, my hoes that I left
The way I stepped out the car, that's a flex
Give thanks, get fresh, praise the Lord then finesse, bless
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it pours
I came, I saw, I came, I saw
I praise the Lord, then break the law
I take what's mine, then take some more
It rains, it pours, it rains, it poursWake up feeling blessed up, pistol on that dresser
Ain't afraid to show it, I'll expose it if I dress up
Riding in that Testa...rossa, nigga catch up
Sipping on that syrup, till I'm messed up, like yes sir
So now I'm getting change, people looking at me strange
Like nigga switching lanes, never changed, still the same
We fuck bitches, get paper, you fuck niggas on papers
We walk around with lasers, you prolly own some tasers
Lame niggas disgrace us, they girlfriends want date us
Got different hoes, I'm pimpin' hoes, you could tell by my paystubs
My niggas gettin' right, smokin' weed with dirty Sprite
I'm going wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Finna wild out for the weekend, me, myself, and I – my three friends

You know we finna kill it, A$AP we the trillest
You don't really want that Glock boy

Six shots got me feelin' like 'Pac, boy, party all night, shit don't stop, boy

Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'
Wild for the night, fuck being polite, I'm goin'

God my witness that I only wanna kick it
And your girl just said they with us
So we rolling in them Benzes

She got drunk as fuck and swallowed all my kids-es

She flat on her back and it's back to the trap
Fuck your pack, A$AP where it's at
Fuck nigga act, get clap lay flat
Fuck your dreams, leave a punk nigga dreamin'

With this coke that I imported, just important as your President
Swagger so impressive and I don't need a necklace
But these bitches get impressed when you pull up in that 7
Them 6's, them Benzes, I gets get the freshest
Raf Simons, Rick Owens usually what I'm dressed in
Blowing blunts rolling doobies up, smoking sections
Groupies rush hold they boobies up, in my direction
Quit with all the fronting, you ain't 'round my clique for nothing
'Cause our presence is a present, just to kick it is a blessing
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos 
This is the way it goes, this is the way we roll
'Cause every day we on our pesos 
'Cause every day we on our pesos
Yo, yo, yo, your bitch just said I'm hot, man, I told her I agree
She gon' really think I'm hot if I told her my degrees
Pull up in that hard-top, showing off my keys
Graduate school of hard-knocks, I can show you my degrees
Couple A, B, C's, bad bitch, double D's
Popping E, I don't give a F, told you I'm a G
A.S.A.P., Stevie got it on his sleeve
But I got it on my chest, my nigga, this is what I breathe

Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go
Off again, there he go, to another dimension, my mind
Body, soul imprisoned, my eye probably goin' ballistic, but, listen
I'm missin' a couple of screws, they ain't never do drillin' true
You been sippin' away at the truth, a double shot of wisdom'll do
Do, do, rollin' through, hittin' switches
Rolling ditches, blowin' kisses, to the bitches, holdin' biscuits
What's the business? Beat the system
Co-defendants, blow the sentence, go to prison
Go to church and pray the father, Lord forgive us 
And only God can judge me 
And he don't like no ugly
I look so fuckin' good, most dykes'll fuck me, buddy
Yeah, I'm a piece of shit, I know I plead the fifth
I tell her, "Holler if ya need some dick"
The devotion is gettin' hopeless, but, hold it, I'm gettin' close
As my soul is, I'm seein' ghosts, a solo is now a poet
Hypnosis overdose on potions, adjustin' to the motions
And gettin' out all my emotions
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I should take it slow
Here I go, here I go, here I go
Uh, this type of shit
Make a nigga wanna flip September through August
This type of shit got 'em bustin' out the clip
In the middle of the office
And a message to the bosses
The Misfits' new outfit is on the bloglist
Gorgeous hoes keep on the sayin' that they 'caused it
'Cause the Porsches get 'em nauseous
Plus I ain't even mad yet, niggas caught me in a good mood
Paparazzi wanna nag a nigga chillin' at the bag check
Hope they show me in my good shoes
When papa got the brand new bag
Flacko got the brand new Raf, that's good news
"Hood dudes usually don't look like you"
How it feel to get a deal and come back
And the whole hood look like you?
Screamin', "Pimp Squad, hold it down!"
Can't drive, bitch, I'm legally blind, bitch
If I live or die, it's up to me to decide
Shit, niggas coppin' guns like they legal to buy
The only key to survive and get a piece of the pie
Is to agree with a lot or just believe a façade, bitch
And I'll be fine just-a drinkin' my wine, bitch
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
So every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waiting here to find the sign
That I can understand, yes, I am
Every day I spend my time
Drinkin' wine, feelin' fine
Waitin' here to find the sign
I don't care if I ever know
Here I go, here I go, here I go!
I got the lovebirds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slow
I got the love birds chirpin' at the window
But I don't need love no more, oh, no
I'll be fine, sippin' wine
Takin' time slowI thought I'd probably die in prison, expensive taste in women
Ain't had no pot to piss in, now my kitchen full of dishes
Nose bloody from that sniffin', your heroin addiction
Trigger finger itching, fuck parental supervision
This be that murder business, little Timmy got that semi
I ain't kidding, hide your kittens, hit your childrens with that Smith and
A bunch of ignant little niglets, hardheaded, never listen
Purp-purple sippin', finger twistin', teeth glisten like it's Memphis
A bunch of hypocritic Christians 
The land of no religion 
My Santa Claus was missing, catch you slippin' then it's Christmas
Motherfuck a wishlist, my ghetto was ambition
For my Benjis and my Bentley
And them bitches now I gets-gets
On the road to riches, a diamond ring, designer jeans
Choking on that biscuit 'til I'm no longer existing
I wonder if they miss me, as long as I make history
Now my soul is feeling empty, tell the reaper come and get me
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live
Riding through your city like that motherfucker mine
Or toting on that semi, rob a motherfucker blind
License plate says wipe me down, car from 1989
But a nigga sits so pretty call that motherfucker fine
Lost your motherfucking mind, what's on your mind?
Niggas talking down
Never talk to cops
Make him talk to God when I tote that 9, he ain't talking now
Tell 'em watch your spine, I mean watch your back
Better guide your track, better not look back
Now stay in line, don't step on cracks
So you break her back, I'm talking 'bout your mom 
Cause there's killers in my town 
Making hits, sniffing lines 
Out committing crimes 
Wait for shit to simmer down 
Corrupted little minds 
8 and 9, finna shine 
On the grind
Do you dirty with that shimmy shimmy ya 
Where they shoot without a purpose
Services 'n hearses
Kids who ain't deserve it
Can't survive a thing, you're worthless
Strangers make me nervous
Who's that peekin' in my window with a pistol to my curtains?
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live
Pretty nigga rich, Flacko be the shit
And that bitch know we poppin' so she poppin' on this dick
Nigga, RIP to Pimp, can't forget Little Flip
And I take it out to Memphis so shout out to Triple Six
Who said you can't live forever lied
Of course, I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll live long
You can't ever deny my force
I'm living forever
I'll forever, I'll liveHer pistol go…

She got a lot of Prada 
That Dolce and Gabbana

And that Balenciaga 
I'm sippin' purple syrup 
Come be my Aunt Jemima 
And if you is a rider, we'll go shoppin' like mañana

She get it from her mama 
She jiggy like Madonna, but she trippy like Nirvana 
'Cause everything designer 
Her jeans is Helmut Lang 
Shoes is Alexander Wang and her shirt the newest Donna

Wearin' all the Cartier frames
Jean Paul Gaultiers 'cause they match with her persona

Vena Cava from the store

Rick Owens, Raf Simons, boy, she got it by the stock 
She ball until she fall, that means she shop until she drop 
And Versace, got a lot 
But she may never wear it

Scoop back tees 
Breeze in coupe 
Smiling is your treasure, you're so well put together 
Bags and links 
Jeans and shoes 
Spikes and patent leathers, different fabrics mixed together
Baby, you and me 
Me and you 
Go away together, we could get away forever 
All emotions clashing, thrashing, someone turn the light out
I met my baby expressed my passion on my fashion night out
Her pistol go…

'Cause she a fashion killer, and I'm a trendy nigga
I said her pistol go…

'Cause she a fashion killer, and I'm a jiggy nigga
I said her pistol goI know I dream about her all day
I think about her with her clothes off
I'm ridin' 'round with my system bumpin' LSD
I look for ways to say "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSD
She ain't a stranger to the city life
I introduced her to this hippy life
We make love under pretty lights, LSD 
I get a feelin' it's a trippy night
Them other drugs just don't fit me right
Girl, I really fuckin' want love, sex, dream
Another quarter to the face system
Make no mistakes, it's all, a leap of faith for love
It takes a place in, feelin' that you crave doin' love, sex, dreams
It started in Hollywood
Dreamin' of sharin' love
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
Party just started up
Dreamin' of sharin' worlds
Held this feeling for way too long
Said, "I really wanna let it go"
I've been gettin' fly because the gimmick's so dope
I've been getting high cause I figured Lord told me
I've been drinking, driving, now we'll never go home
I gon' stay in doubt because the weather's so cold, oh
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
Feeling low sometimes when the light shines down
Makes me high
Can you feel it?
Can you feel it?
It started in Hollywood
Duh, duh-duh
Dreamin' of sharin' love
Duh, duh-duh
My tongue at a loss for words
Cause my feelings just said it all
I look for ways to say, "I love you"
But I ain't into makin' love songs
Baby, I'm just rappin' to this LSDWho the jiggy nigga with the gold links?
Got me reminiscin' 'bout my old day
Three 6, suck a nigga dick, no foreplay, all day
Boomin' out the trap through the hallway
Tell me what you niggas know about it
Auntie sayin' turn it down, or she finna call the cops
We be plottin' on the ops, she the one who got the drop
Just a free quick fix of the A, and it's okay
They gon' take me back to my old ways
I was tryna chill, poppin' seals ever since I got a deal
Kick it with my model chick, sip Cris, fuck niggas wanna diss
Now I gotta let 'em know who's really trill
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
I ain't never lookin' for no handouts
Broke ass niggas never helpin' with they hands out
Find out where the fuck nigga live then we camp out
Screamin' fuck the world, never catch me with my pants down
Always been a stand-up guy, I'd rather stand out
Raf Simons, Stan Smith edition with my bands out
I'm the trillest one to do it since Pimp, nigga hands down
If a nigga put his hands on me, that's a man down
Trick, what? Pimps up, hoes down, whoa now
Slow down, see they runnin' with my old style
Grow foul, gold smile, you ho now, thuggin' with my old style
It's a shame how they low down
Dirty like Adidas on my sneaker feature, uh
Trappin' through the speaker, peep the beeper ringer, uh
Turnin' off phones, just to reach 'em, gotta beep 'em
I'm a Lord motherfucker, better greet him if you see him
Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye
Tell these fuck niggas how you been
You been crossin' our minds, niggas talk down every now and then
On the side, who gave em style 9 times out of 10?
It was Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, Jodye
Flacko, Jodye, Flacko, JodyeFuck niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
'Fore the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
Fuck niggas won't multiply, fuck niggas won't multiply

Back in the buildin', sold crack in the livin' room
Niggas toe-tagged, sold gats for a livin'
Doo rag, keep a red or blue flag in the denim
One you be with be the one to shoot at ya in a minute
Come to Harlem if you never seen Baghdad
First place I seen a nigga sell crack at
Where the hustlers don't sleep, take cat naps
Shorty with the shotty limpin' like he got a bad back, back back
Even in my will, keep it real, thuggin' in my field
'Til the day I peel, keep it trill, anything I feel
Youngins trained to kill, aimin', bangin' steel and slangin' krill
She shake it all for Satan just to paint her nails and pay her bills
I ain't really fuckin' with that Been Trill
Swear them niggas booty like Tip Drill
Nah I ain't really into throwin' shots
But these mothafuckas better give me my props, word to Pac
We're the reason that these niggas gettin' throwed
Reason why you niggas wearin' gold
Jail pose in the pictures, prayin' fingers to your nose
I remember, if Pimp was alive he'd tell these hoes and these niggas
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I peel
Even in my will, keep it trill, to the day I...
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
When all the real niggas die, fake niggas gon' multiply
But if the real niggas live, fuck niggas won't multiply
I'm the original Balmain badass, nigga
I'm the original Margiela madman, in the words of A$AP Yams
Smack the shit out a nigga in these skinny pants, feel me?
Don't get it fucked up, nigga, we been jiggy, been pretty
Still tell a bitch suck my dick, swag swag nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
Shit, I might fuck around and bring the Jeep back
No doors on it, flexin' with the seat back
B-Boy with the G pack, might fuck around and bring the mink back
Word to Big Boi and 3 Stacks, nigga
If you deaf bring the beat back, nigga
Fuck with a nigga like me, RIP my nigga Pimp C
HBA shit is weak, you can keep that
I'm a trendsetter, you ain't even peep that
Where the hoes, where the weed, where the cheese at?
Fuck the FCC, tell 'em bleep that
(We ain't no fashion killas nigga, we fashionable killas
Y'all got Flacko fucked up)
I'm the motherfuckin' Lord of this fashion shit
Don't I deserve just to brag a bit?
Set the blueprint, fuck your two cents
Number 1 stunner, ask Tumblr if I'm accurate
My motherfuckin' swag is immaculate
Plus I got enough style just to mack your bitch
I think back to when pockets packin' lint
It's like a nigga got rich on accident
Now back to Pimp, bitches lie, killers never lie
Triggers on the side by side, bet I'm down to ride
Prosper said let's ride to the sky, call it catastrophic
We don't ever die, we just multiply, bitch
Fake ass niggas, you know what I'm sayin'? These niggas be out here talkin' 'bout they a street nigga and shit, man niggas be gettin' extorted like a mothafucka out here man, you know what I'm sayin'?Bloody ink on my pad spelled suicide
Michael Jackson even passed cause you scrutinized
Fuck Illuminati lies, say I'm lucified
Baptized in the gutter, motherfucker you decide
Cause the ride come with doors that be suicide
Or the thighs on my whores, they be super-sized
Good and bad having wars, nigga, choose a side
Now all hail to the Lord like you do to God
Who am I? Lord Flacko
Painting vivid pictures, call me Basquiat, Picasso
Capo Head Hancho, now my following's colossal
Ain't no boxer, Pacquiao, but got the chopper todo caso
It's like you heard God spoke, I seen the ghetto gospel
The choir like my reefer and the preacher got my eyes low
Sister Mary Jane to make me sleep from singing high notes
The bible or the rifle, goodnight folks
Bloody ink on my pen spelled suicide
Kurt Cobain even died cause you scrutinize
It's a fine line between truth and lies
Jesus Christ never lied, still was crucified
That's why I never judge another nigga
Life's a bitch, but that bitch in love with other niggas
3 to a bed, sheets, no covers nigga
Dirty kitchen, no supper in the cupboards nigga
Sucker niggas, wassup with niggas?
So my new attitude is like "Fuck them niggas!"
I grew up with niggas but don't fuck with niggas
I don't trust them niggas, ain't got no love for niggas
Had the gold grills shining like them southern niggas
Kept it trilla, now the whole world fuckin' with us
Meanwhile, you treated all of us like other niggas
Now your world is in my palm, take cover niggas
If I shall ever fall, Lord pick me up
Ever since a baby, two deuce in sippy cups
Ever since them diapers and my zip-me-ups
Now I'm walking on my own, y'all, wish me luck
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the plan
Where do we lie
Tell me where do we stand
Where do we go
It's all part of the planYeah, live through the strugglin', life's a every day 
I hustle every day in life, thinkin' back
Takin' packs up the block, them older niggas said I couldn't 
Man fuck 'em niggas, I'll be back, strapped backpack
Bitch, I'm flippin' work, hand in hand, I think they call it track 
Racin' laps, re-up went to waste, it pays to make it stack
Face the fact, there's always niggas out there, tryin' to knock the 
I guess that's why they say we trap, don't let niggas hold you back
I'm just a kettle from the ghetto with no pot to piss in
So who am I to call it black? Black man, black male
Black ball, black opsy, black diamonds glistenin'
Attract the pigs and all the rats, kitten scratch
I went from roaches on my bump to red brooches on the cuff
Of my tux, chauffeur pullin' up, no if, and's​ or buts about him
I went to Paris for my trunks, 100 thousand spent on Goyard
Used 'em once, couldn't give a shit, damn or fuck about 'em
Hit Canal Street, vintage gold medallion
Smokin' blunts in front of public housin'
Wildin' 'til they throw me in them cuffs
Mouth full of fronts, look like Master P up in my Cartiers
Diamonds shinin' in the frames
Changed the game and made them say 
Ain't no limits to this shit, life's a flick, you're stickin' to the script
My life is like a movie, they should film me through it
Take a pic, be sure to frame the shit, forever me, was always G
Way before this famous shit, y'all just pretend to do it
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang

You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play

Rap game like the crack game, swear it's all the same 
Whippin' soda through the pot, watch it bubble
Flexin' muscle, hit the block, I bet I teach you niggas how to 
Sellin' coca on the charts, watch it double
Uh, takin' meetings on my bus, this shit my mobile office
Gettin' head while at my desk, this shit my oval office
I remember when I got a hundred for recordings
Now the sum of my performances just put me on the Forbes list
Fuck jiggy, I'm flawless, fuck pretty, I'm gorgeous
Your favorite rappers' corpses couldn't measure my importance
My mind is out in orbits, plus my ego got endorsements
Heard the people want that raw shit, but y'all be talkin' bullshit
You say you got them guns, but I've never seen you bang
You say you got them drugs, but I've never seen you slang
You say you in that game, but I've yet to see you play
You say you going hard, but nobody feels the same, yeah

In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
Cause smokin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose
I put A$AP on my tat
I put New York on the map
I put the gang on the flames
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains

But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you

Shout out Harlem, man

AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen
Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs
I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses
Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers
In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel 
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop

You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead

Napped up nigga, I been down since birth
Backpack full of random work
With two bad hoes, I'll teach you how to jerk

Killing careers make these cupcakes remember
My objective is to serve your agenda
Biggie and Nas put they ass in a blender
Sprinkle some 50 and came out this nigga
Equipped with a gat and the dick in your mouth
Balls in my hands and your bitch in my house
Twisting up weed, I'm digging her out

A rebel I be one day
On that track with Gunplay
Out-outcast my whole life so I decide to spit like André 
Beef is on my entrée 
Gin and juice, that's Bombay
Driving fast the wrong way, I swear life is like a one-way 
Pussy on a Sunday 
Business on a Monday 
My new crib came with feng shui and my closet is like a runway 
Come be my fiancée
She fuck me in a Hyundai
My rooftop got a lounge, just sit around and watch her sunbathe 
Dinner date for one K 
Shopping date for two K 
Bougie-ass bitch made me wait to fuck for two days 
Finally got it today

Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Whip-whippin' Whitney, my mama as a witness
Bitches lickin' and lockin' up my Swishers
Once she blow my whistle, she know it's dismissal
Spread the news, I'm official, now hop out my foreign vessel 
Before I get aggressive forget it, war-ready
Already tested, tears and blood invested
'Til my cardiac's arrested and my 40 ounce is empty
Show me what you owe me and a porterhouse with that 
Black magic on the tires, only I
Roll-rollin' down a lonely mile, phony smile
Warrants, police on me now, still tourin'
And my chain, it may slow me down, cheer for it
Pain in its purest form
Don't complain, I came to reign from here forward
Still 'noid so crib got clear doors
Burnin' planes in my Air Force
And all I can see is Clearports 
Stop
Louder
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer
Don't come in any closer 
Since Rocky spit like André
I'm gon' kill 'em like Big Boi
These rappers is on my entrée
Eat 'em like cookies, Chips Ahoy
Mm, enjoy, when I get annoyed
Know a couple niggas that'll kill for joy
Either Gunplay, runway, trip avoid
Body get found by a little fishin' boy
Arnold Schwarzenegger, toss a nigga
Like codeine mixed with a 'roid
Slow punch make a nigga chin collide
Fuck talking, how fast you could grip a 9?
Damn, look at how the hollow tip hit his spine
Little motherfuckers that commit to crime
These niggas had the sidewalk sippin' wine
Guess that's why the ground sip the wine
Pouring liq' so I soak in lift and shine
Tip tipped and toe, I miss the sky
My soul gets cold when my niggas died
So and so, niggas live and die
Beneath shoe soles you will reside
Rappers get a mil' for these freakin' lies
Sign a couple deals for these freakin' lies
How many times in your eyes has a nigga died?
Never
Spittin' it like a Beretta, nobody do it better, niggaAll I think about is life, nights, sipping on Sprite
Little codeine, nigga get throwed right
Two blonde dykes wanna kiss all night
I just pray to God that the shit go right
Little argument, and their fists don't fight
Fuck a dog ho and the bitch gon' bite
A$AP nigga, sip Cris all night
So them R. Kelly hoes getting pissed on twice
Damn, how a young nigga get so nice?
Young nigga cold like he sitting on ice
Fuck broke, tryna be rich all life

Fuck around and bring the hush puppies back
She fuck me and the homies, she was cool with that
The block hot so I'm shaded in my bucket hat
Pause a little bit, I gotta little advice
If you fucked her once, then you could fuck her twice
And don't get head from hoes with overbites
Just giving out game, nigga show your right
Born stunna nigga, turn night to bright
High as a kite in my Nike Flights
Made 30 Racks it was just a flight
Flew a bitch out too, it was just a night
Shorty got the booty make a nigga say, "Whoa"
Can I suck your titties, tryna see how far I can go
Try again and then again and she ain't telling me no
Sweetie tell me how you feeling, can I feel on you more?
She said, "I ain't fucking for free," but ain't shit I can't afford
Shit, I'll pay you for it, now bounce that ass on my bungee cord
Yeah, whoopsie daisy, put a good kid in your Section.80

Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new ass?
Fuck I'm 'sposed to do with all this new cash?
Thousand dollar drawers just to hold my balls
All I ever do is let my jewels sag
Pac gone, but the "Juice" back
Get your popcorn, juice, snacks
It's a movie nigga, with a new cast
Get the news flash, that the truth back
This is boom bap, mixed with new raps

I been impatiently waiting to show you niggas Satan
All this talk of Illuminati ain't got a clue about me
Bitch, I'm Trillmaluminati and got my crew behind me
Shooters round me, keep them looters round me
Keep a tool around me, it'll keep you fools from round me
Couple of them dudes surround me
With a gat, with a strap in a backpack
When they cap cap, leave you flat, better back back
On a fast track, ratatat, nigga that's that
Nigga pass that, finna ash, where the hash at

Alright, A$AP
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is love
All you need is loveAnd I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know
She the type to seek love and make it everlasting
I'm the type to wake up and say you never happened
I mean, I fucked the girl with hella passion
But it's cold how we smashing, left her sleeping on a separate mattress
I think her body makes for better practice
Good excuse for my absence like, "Flacko, where your ass been?
Heard you done with fashion, now yo' ass is acting"
I'm tripping off the acid, now yo' ass is looking massive
This ain't the shit equipped with columns from my reckless swagging
This that dark house party with this record blasting
Rolling spliffs, clique beside me, fingers Liberace
When I seen this bitch in vintage Tommy and some mid Huaraches
I'm all alone though, mood music makes me bop slower
Trippin' on how I shifted pop culture, changed hip-hop on ya
Smoking like a rasta was my pop's culture
I be damned if I die sober, I'll be sure to visit Pac for ya
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know
And shout outs my pretty womens in the spot tonight
Let me see them fuckin' hands
And for the freaks that love the niggas with the Jeeps
Lex, coupes and the Bimmers and the Benz, come again
When my death calls, I pray the Lord accept collect calls
'Cause I be playing with these womens like they sex dolls
Call my Prada prior, cause it's dropping next fall
Don't you short the next ball, my closet like the Met ball
She said, "I just love it when you speak soft-spoken
Up in the magazines with your teeth all golden"
Took the whole year off just to learn to make beats
Dropped the flames on my release and leave the streets all smokin'
That touch your soul music, I get you higher
Grab your lighter fluid, might add a preacher and a choir to it
I speak the father's music, hallelujah
Always Strive & Prosper, stupid
Even Montell can't tell you how we do it
Sit back and watch me do it
And I'm a man of my word, that I got nothing at all
So tell me now does it hurt or is it too late? I'm a man of my law
I gotta keep my weight up, but where do I land if I fall?
But never mind, I'm fly, you know
Okay, let's get past all the swag trapping and fashion talking
You want that take it to gats or keep it in rapping talking
They rap impulsive, get embarrassed, it actually happens often
You my son like my last abortion, I'm just laughing off it
I changed rap, pushed fashion forward, yeah, I'm that important
You jack my style, she jack me off, and y'all both acting awkward?
Jiggling baby, nah, go ahead, bitch
Ain't nothing better than the pretty big forehead bitch
Listen close I got some shit to tell you, motherfuckers get familiar
It's not just model bitches on my genitalia
Did Azalea's from Australia, trips to Venezuela
Cinderella's under my umbrella for different weather
Ella, ella, ayy, just play it like I didn't tell ya
Niggas taking pictures any time we get together
And hope to fly away just one day like some love birds
Only one word that I'm afraid of is the "love" word
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lonely one
More power to you, more power to you, my lovely one
What's up, bruh? That all depends
With friends like you, who need friends?
Sometimes the best advice is no advice
Especially when it's your advice
Oh! Man, remember
Your man was on stage dressed like a family member
Man, everything basic to Ye Guevara
That means Saint Laurent is my Zara
I remember Rochelle ain't wanna fuck me with the polo
Ayy, bitch, you missed out, #fomo
I got one child, one child
But I'm fuckin', fuckin', fuckin' like I'm tryna make four more
They wanna throw me under a white jail
'Cause I'm a black man with confidence of a white male
HallelujahI swear this famous shit just happened overnight
For sure these hoes was so uptight, but now they so polite
All I see is fake love, smiles, and overbites
But I'm pimping, nigga: Dolemite
I remember when, I was like ten, maybe nine
Ricky had a deuce-deuce, two shotty pumps with a baby nine
Busta had the rhymes, Puffy had the Shyne
Bone Thugs had Mo Thugs but that was the shit, that made me rhyme
What's up, what's on your mind? Hold up, I'm feeling fine
Locs got me blind, thugging like I'm Eazy-E up in his prime
Another young nigga with a attitude
I guess that's why the crackers kept me after school
Roaches on the wall, roaches on the dresser
Everybody had roaches but our roaches ain't respect us
On the park bench playing checkers, sipping nectar
Girbaud jeans with hologram straps and reflectors
We had cookouts and dirt bikes and dice games and fistfights
And fish fries and shootouts like one Sig with two rounds
And one click left two down, that's four kids but one lived
Left three dead, but one split, that one miss, that one snitched
That's everyday shit, shit we used to that
Add it up, do the math with your stupid ass
Don't view me as no conscious cat, this ain't no conscious rap
Fuck the conscious crap, my mac'll push your conscience back
I do this for my culture, penny, nickels in the sofa
Mommy watching Oprah, Daddy in the kitchen whipping soda
Cook-connect named Sosa, Spanish chick Viola hit it in the chocha
With the Testarossa, hit Daytona, fuck the law, we soldiers
I'm 'bout it 'bout it, nigga ain't shit sweet about me
The baddest bitches on the block be even speaking 'bout me
I'm so thuggish ruggish bringing ruckus, knucking if you bucking
Young and thugging, bugging showing out in public, but you love it
I only got one vision, that's for kids in every color, religion
That listen, we gotta beat the system, stay the fuck out the prisons
They try to blind our vision, but we all God children, we siblings
You my brother, you my kin, fuck the color of your skin
Back once again
Chilling in the back of the 'Lac with a pass or the gin
Finna ask can I pass to her friend
Then a nigga smash, I'll be damned if I ask her again
Gold slabs on the 'Lac when I spin
Then it's back to the back of the Benz
Lean back in the back with the Henn and a crap
When I tap that that, then attack, never tax, never that that
Max on the ends, spend ends, I remember way back when
A mothafucka used to have to borrow cash from my friends
Friends, just to put a snack up in the fridge
When I'm on, I swear to God to pay you back
Now the kids all look up to me
Them bitches wanna fuck with me
My idols say what's up to me
From ugly to comfortably, suddenly
It all changed man, it was just like yesterday
Times was so ugly and now I'm comfortable
I just only can thank God, suddenly
Everything changed before my eyes by my surprise
A$APClams Casino, A$AP 
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup 
See me in the hood the gangstas saying wassup 
Back once again, sipping Henn, mixed with juice and gin

Spinners spin, on the 20-twins that Mercedes-Benz
Dividends made a change of plans well that all depends
Shout-out my parolees and I smoke that OG
Kush mothafuck the police, all my niggas rock gold teeth
So hood and we so street, sipping on that codeine
We hustle hard no sleep, your bitch loose that's no leash
I ain't talking 'bout no money, I ain't talking 'bout no cars
Talking 'bout no diamonds cause that shit is a façade
Times is really hard, I fucked a couple broads
Smoked some purple out the jars, let me tell you who we are
I be that pretty mothafucka', Harlem's what I'm repping
Tell 'em quit the bitching, we gon' make it in a second

Blunt smoke, smoke weed, codeine, cough
Tell that bitch that I'm awesome, better back the fuck up off me
Coco, Céline, Tiffany, she flossy 
Ain't concerned with who bought these
Can't forget that she bossy
When y'all was buying surfboards trying to ride the wave
I was cooking up another fucking tidal wave 
Had to get entitled motherfuckers out the way
Had to take another title, sorry for the wait 
Barely ever took a break on, fashion like my time need
More hours in a day, I apologize if I'm late
Tap the vein, whoa, barely look like I'm awake
Darker shades, bluer veins, bluer money in the bankroll
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
I remember I was poor and
When I was young and living homeless
Now I rock the Ricky Owens
Eyes lookin' like he rollin'
Got new bags under my eyelids
New bags up in my closets
New bags like I went shoppin'
New bags on new bags
Mind's better at seeing two now 
Needing up on my downtime 
Hit the waves with the new sound 
House tunes but it's screwed down
That's dope 
Take a sec to thank the Lord, 'nother one to call my folks
Hit my momma on the phone, she like "Son, you the boss" 
Focus, don't get caught up in the moment 
Can't forget that I'm golden, don't forget that I'm chosen
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin'
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know it
They called me a vitch, burned me like saffron
My matter is golden, a child of the oldest
My touch is righteous, like virus my Midas
I'm golden
He told me when I'm present, chosen
So hold me tight, I swear, I'm golden
Fuck home, fuck sleep, come clean, zonin' 
Can't forget that I'm golden, can't forget where I'm going 
Fuck popo, police, enemies, fake homies 
Can't forget that I'm a OG, better act like you know itP.O
One time for A$AP Yams
Let's go
What's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least 
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both, girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed, comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded, I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded, shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer
Can't impress with them diamonds though, them diamonds
Talkin' about M's
Talkin' bout M's, nigga, M's
Make 'em talk about, make 'em talk about M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Nigga, talkin' bout M's
Make 'em talk about, talkin' bout M's, nigga
Talkin' bout M's
It's like lately all I ever seem to think about is M's, nigga
Talkin' 'bout M's
See the same thing all up in my bank account
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
And my YouTube account say the same amount
M's, nigga, talkin' 'bout M's
Money talk and dogs bark
I got a pocket full of stones in my stonewashed
Lambo, brand new Lambo
With tiger stripes on it call that bitch a golf cart
I'm outchea, I'm so outchea, I swear niggas have no idea
I swear niggas better wear riot gear
Cause I appear and pow loud and clear give 'em diarrhea, oh
I re-up tonight, I'ma be up tonight, cookin' a key up tonight
Niggas de-up I slide to the right, throw a three up in time
Put a B up, let's fight, don't get beat up tonight
Feet up in my European, I ride with me heater inside
Kill you and your dog then go put on a shirt that say PETA for life
Like you sneeze you on tight, you got beef I got white
You got beef I got white, I got green, I got white
I got pink, I got pints, I got lean, I got ice
I got needles and pipes, I got clean, I got right
I got mean, I got nice, that's that Tina and Ike
I don't lean on her price, I don't cheat on her price
Try to cheat on the dice, you get beat on the spot
I get keys on the spot and I keep it on lock
And I keep it up safe, what you keep in your safe?
S'what I spent on my watch and I wave it like Ma$e
Bout to redo the face, get a see-through AK
I eat seafood and steak
But girl, I'ma treat you like cake til I get a sweet tooth tooth ache
But wait let's talk about M's, not about them
I love my BM's, I love my YM ain't no more CM
Let's pluck out the stems, let's fuck like a nymph
She walk out, she limp, it's dark and we dim, yeah
We dem niggas, handcuffing him niggas back up and skim niggas
See that we strapped up we cap up your brim nigga
Fill my cup up to the rim nigga, TunechiI've been busy 
I've been fuckin' busy, I've been busy fuckin'
I've been all kinds of busy, or sorta kinda busy
Like shorty is we fuckin'? Well if not then fuck it
Apologies to the fam, we thought we ducked 'em
Said I was in a rush but I was busy rushin'
It's busy shit, busy that, busy this
And I need a minute 
See this what that voice in your head says
When you try to get peace of mind
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
Spendin' time spinnin' out toward a desire that wasn't pure
Born before the virus was cured, pitch perfect, violins on the floor
Fast forward, linings on my skull
This the type of design I could afford
Fast forward, bands out
Got they hands out like they acknowledgin' the Führer
I rewind, Nas track 6, rewind dance crazes
Read my mind, freed my mind, feed my mind, makes sense
Just like mirrors on the wall, just like sittin' on me
Raw in mirrors seen it all, could make two, a piece of mind
Flickin' ash, pourin' a half, don't pour in a glass
Pour it in foam, this white got eggshells in my omelet
My earlobes, they yellow like the yolk is runnin'
Brain on drugs, I still ain't got no peace of mind, fuck
Woof, woof—dogs in the place, loose tooth—lost in the fray
Roof lost on the Wraith, roof lost on the way
Freeway, no Rozay, brute force, Brüt champagne
Tell the front desk to cut new keys
Reserved in the Mercer for two years, in two suites
Took out the bed like it's fuck sleep
I'll smack a bitch like it's hot hands
Fired the label like fuck brands
Comfortable low nigga, fuck Xans
Comfortable slow, who the fuck ran
Nothin' is sweet, nothin' in tank sweet, it's just a tank P
Salt on a slug, soda on slugged teeth, chewing on nothing
You're tweakin' or somethin', you're reachin' for somethin'
You're speakin', speak up then, you're thinkin', you’re overthinkin'
One blink and I'm pre-cummin'
That could turn every no one into someone
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
"I gotta find peace of mind" 
I just need peace of mind for my purity
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
"You make my desire pure, just tell me"
Memories burn the roaches
Cheer Hennessy for my old heads
Amphetamines for the dosage
Keepin' me up and focused
Jewelry cloth, my gold caps
NY throwback like the old Fab
"I'm undone because"
Lost in the Google Maps in your iMac, think my phone tapped
Hold up, hold that  thought
Nigga, pour up soda, nigga, hold that cough, tryna hold back
The call had dropped when the FaceTime paused, don't call back
Can't cope when your heart broke
Soft-spoken, roll somethin', cop somethin', Narco
Saint like Joan of Arc, bro, ring barcode
Two of everything, should have been to blame when Noah's Ark broke
Two more drinks of everything before the bar closed
Face-to-face with my demons at a barstool
Haven't checked on my niece in weeks
Months past and months in between since me and my sister would speak
Not a call or visit in weeks
Lost nothin' since September
Last seen her September '16
Man it feels like
"I'm undone because"
Lose someone every release, it feels like the curse is in me 
Press is gone and I grief, I share with you my peace
"I'm undone because—"
"I'm undone because—"Gang! Gang
They tryna front on the gang!
They going to remember my name
Ayy, anybody ever took the time to ask Rocky what A$AP mean to him?
Well if so, he'll probably tell you, "Always Striving and Prospering"
A$AP, partna'! Free my nigga, Cap
R.I.P. Big Phil, R.I.P. A$AP Yams
Ya dig? 
Come fuck with the Mob, shout out to the Lords and the Gods
In love with my bitch 'cause she bi
My ice like the stars, I tell that bitch, "Cover your eyes
'Cause fuckin' with me, you go blind"
She losin' her mind, we kiss to Frank Ocean and Blonde
Convincin' my bitch to go blonde
Was born in the dark, I kill you, you open my blinds
On Yams and that's word to my moms
Margiela Madman with cases I'm still tryna beat
A bunch of shit from a long time ago
The bigger they are, the harder they fall
Like dominos, nigga, Geronimos
When it's my time to go, adiós, vámonos
Flacko no Dominicano but eat the tostones with plátanos
Dealing with life and its highs and lows
I'm just pimpin' like I'm supposed
I guess it's called livin', shit, I suppose
I'm on my live alone, die VLONE
Ain't talkin' 'bout spending or buyin' clothes
I'm 'bout my business but I'm alone
I still had the vision when I was broke
Fuckin' on bitches and foreign hoes
Flyin' out womens to boring shows
I pray to God I don't overdose
I put A$AP on my tat 
I put New York on the map 
I put the gang on the flames 
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains 
I got Goyard by the sack 
I got the boof by the pack 
I fucked your boo on her back
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
Hmm
I'm free as a bird, I wanted this shit my whole life
But had all this stress on my mind
Until I realized, things pan out when it's right
In the meantime I'ma grind
I think of them days when I was so young on my plight
Party and bullshit and play
Was up in the city, the one that's surrounded by lights
Wanted to burn it away
Get out of his lane, got no time, don't need no advice
Except for my momma
Ride for my daughter, she's all I need
She got her father, as I grow
Hell yeah, I did it, I'm on a roll
Thought I'd be up with my nigga, no
I'm just gettin' warmed up, let's start the show
I'm schoolin' these niggas, so in the zone and I'm rigged to blow
A$AP and Cud Life forever though
And I'm flossin' and bossin' these silly hoes
Learned the codes, serve up the magic for all of those
Kids that ain't had someone on they own
Hang on the words, you each have your song
Grab on and hold on, won't steer you wrong
Sing along, sing along, hmm
I put A$AP on my tat 
I put New York on the map 
I put the gang on the flames 
They gon' remember the name
They robbin' boys for the chains 
I got Goyard by the sack 
I got the boof by the pack 
I fucked your boo on her back 
Gang! Gang! Them boys not flexing the same
I'm done with adjusting to fame, pull up on your set, leave a stain
Gang! Gang! I tell her come fuck with the gang
I tell 'em don't fuck with the gang, it's time to fuck up the whole game!
Gang, gang
They tryna front on the gang, they gon' remember my name
True to truth somehow 
But never truly lied at all, then and now
They tryna front on the gang
Truth somehow
Gang, A$AP boys come with the flame
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all, then and now
In my dreams, I'm dying all the time
True to truth somehow
But never truly lied at all
Then I wake, it's kaleidoscopic mind
But never truly lied at all
But never truly lied at all, then and now
I never meant to hurt you 
I never meant to lieGoddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a bliss
Goddamn, how real is this?
I know them Harlem niggas gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?

Stone cold, rolling stone, I'm a stoned nigga
Write it on my tombstone, I was stoned nigga
Don't remember me as a wannabe New Orleans nigga
Slash lean sipping, Tennessee nigga, nah
Influenced by Houston, hear it in my music
A trill nigga to the truest, show you how to do this
My all gold grills give her cold chills
Said she's got a coke feel cause I'm so trill
Two dope boy scales, but I sold pills
No deal, put her on her feet, toenails
Them vampires, them bloodsuckers, them thirsty killers
We 'bout it 'bout it, we rowdy rowdy, that Percy Miller
For really real, we chilly chill, don't sport Chinchilla
No bounty hunters, I'm 'bout to killa, I'm bout my skrilla
Give me the title, then give me the cash
Fold it then bag it then move to the trap
Follow my stash, stealing my swag
Niggas is wickity wickity wack
Like Kriss Kross, her lip gloss
Slip-ons get slipped off
My bitch boss, Cristal
We smoking then thinking then burning that hash
Puff it and pass, making it last
Walk in my shoes and then cross in my path
Game was for grabs, making 'em crash
Took in a section ain't giving it back
Fuck the money, fuck the fame, this is real life
An insight to my trill life
Clams
Goddamn, how real is this?
I know the whole world gon' be feeling this
East Coast nigga, but how trill is this?
Still, don't give a shit, my ignorance is still a blissSo recognize that shit, you better fuckin' recognize that fuckin' name right now...

How I could just kill a man, anyways
Nowadays everybody's stressed, yes
Animosity is better off your chest, yes
Guess everybody want to stay blessed, stay fresh
Take a nigga threats, but I'm up next, take debts
Light it, light it, puff it, puff it, pass it, pass it
Inhale, exhale, relieve your mind of stress, bless
Smoke some one time for your boy A$AP
I've been puffing, rolling up
Cop a lot and pourin' up
Plus my niggas know the plug
A generation's thrown on drugsUh, my mic sounds nice, check one

But I don't give a fuck, roll another swisher up
Cause I just came here down South so I could get these pounds out
And move my mother nice somewhere closer than a townhouse
And my beats banging, kicking harder than a roundhouse
I spoke with my old head and this is what I found out
Life is just a bitch, a bitch is like a ho
Hoes want the money, money come and goes
Friends turn to foes, foes they be fake

And I'm so high I could fuck around and grow wings
And we sipping on something purpler than Soul Plane
We sip slow, slow swing, tip foes, and chrome wings
Told me I should head home and do my own thang
Then I heard my phone rang, hold up that's my old dame
Pick it up I hit you back, miss me and I miss you back
She said Harlem miss you too and they can't wait to get you back
You should come on home leave the drugs alone and stick to rap

Young nigga from the southside of H-Town
Fat Tony up in this bitch, fuckin' with A$AP Rocky in this bitch
Out in NY, Harlem in this bitch
You know how young niggas connect from state to state
Feeling great, nigga, puttin' it in ya face, nigga
Out in the morning making this shit happen dawg
Young niggas ain't never understand
How we stay so throwed in this hoe, nigga
Niggas so throwed like we don’t know no better, nigga
We disobedient, nigga
Mama wanna grab the switch
We like "Fuck that, nigga, we out here, mayne"
Coming down, coming liveLove on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
So, so
My ears are ringing, my palms are shaking, my heart is racing
Somebody's mama's heart is aching, can't take it, partly fainted
Found his body parts in awkward places
Like apartments, basements
Garbage, vacant lots, garages, spaces
Harlem's far too spacious
Sometimes I wish I could get away and charter spaceship
To get away from my inhuman race with hearts of Satans
Kick off my Maison Martin's, lay on back like Martha Mason
Smoke away my iron lung 'til later die at 71, uhh
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
I pray to Lord my soul to keep
Gentrification split the nation that I once was raised in
I don't recall no friendly neighbors face on my upraising
Back in my younger days of razor blades with gangs
Who bang and never stood a chance
Them boys don't dance, but left 'em Harlem shaking
On the pavement, and my generation fucked, and my society
Very trippy pages in my diary
It's the irony how LSD inspired me to reach the higher me
Used to never give a damn, now I don't give a fuck entirely
I think my pride died in me, somewhere inside of me
It's gotta be, a whole 'nother side of me
If you seen the shit that I'd have seen in 26 years of living
That's how many fucks I'd give 
So
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belong
I lay down now
There's someone's journey in the streets
Who gotta keep a piece, peace
I lay down now
As I lay me down to sleep
I pray to God I rest in peace
So, so
Love on the low, love everywhere I go
And I can't face that all I need is right where I belongI ain't scared, uh
Real niggas put the clip in and let it go, uh
Real niggas wanna run real, uh
Real 
Real niggas from the roll 
Real niggas from the end
Real niggas from the home 
Homeboy, you ain't know 
Had a bitch suckin' on a lollipop at the bus stop
Green Glock, red Glock

They ain't really ready for me when I

Nigga, push up, now we on your block 
Bitch, I'm off the bean and the damn Wock' 
Got a clip and it's full 
Leave a motherfucker in the 
Man, I was grown up since a young blood 
Now I'm bustin' off shots 
Back in my younger days, all I want was braids
All my mama want from me was grades 
They ain't really ready for me when I 
One stop, nigga, get some drugs and a damn Glock 
Uh, got them bullets aimin' at your head top
AK-47, try to run up, bet we send shots 
Walkin' with my chains out on a opp block
I'm with Drippy Drew 
Don't try run up, you get dropped off 
Oh, yeah, huh, pull up flexin' with the top down, uh 
I'm with gang with some baddies on that yacht now, uh, yeah 
Bought a brand new Mulsanne, Gucci-d down now, huh 
Nigga, you ain't in my lane, you a clown now, yeah

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace 
Uh, Schwarzenegger I, straight slaughter niggas
I'm offin' niggas, screaming off with niggas' heads
They all surrender, better call for niggas
Come at all you niggas heads, talk 'em off a ledge
I'm arguing with 'em, I'm done talking with 'em
I order coffins for 'em, call the coroner for 'em
Get a comforter for 'em, I did all you niggas' beds
I want all you niggas dead 
You want oil nigga money, royalness, and bread
Royalties instead of rollies for your boys, but loyalty is dead 
Now I'm only up again
Kick... kick a man while he's down
Looks dead; can’t be safe to say it
Everybody's getting punished
Looking down to sell with you, how have you been?
Probably an undercover, had them undercovers with you
People buying and selling for you
I'll only sell with you if you're blind to sell

Lord Pretty Flacko Jodye stepped up in this piece 
Bust my Glock to ensure that all you niggas rest in peace 
Rep my block, quick to draw on all you niggas if there's beef 
Blow your spot, better pray to Lord this shit don't hit the streets
Jimmy DeanPeople think you're stuck up, but we're all super good friends
It's only natural, I suppose, but we're all super good friends
Um, I get the feeling that you're admired, but, um

I got so much beef, I could barely sleep
Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze
Bad company's bad for your company
Bad company's bad for your company
Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
Got the Mac and the ski mask in case you come for me
When I say I got beef, they don't want no beef
When they say they got beef, they don't wanna eat
If he said he wants smoke, they don't want no steam
She put a V on her tee, bad bad bad bad bad
Had a bachelors degree, Ph.D. while sellin' speed
Fix the face then fix the weave, now workin' on her self-esteem
Hit up Bloc , "yo' this Flack, nigga, where you at?
Pin the drop, uh, my new map location be the block on the app"
I need money and company, nah nah

Hit 'em with the Tommy, now that nigga crumpin'
Why—why these niggas playin' games? They don't want no problems with me
My shooters got good aim, you know I brought them shottas with me
Might have hit a bad stain, they say that someone top was missin'
Them niggas were opposition
They move wrong, so I shot them bitches
Dark shades, too much smoke, I could barely see the fumes
Actin' brand new like I don't see you when I do
Who them folks? Who want smoke? You too close, give me room
Phony folks, play it close, do the most, don't they?
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Bad company, that's bad for your company
Mad cow disease, now you in a ton of beef
Black Mac tucked underneath my new blue dungarees
Flintstone bust down, color Murakami
Fruity pebble bezel, Wilma, Betty, Fred, and Barney
Bad bitch from outta town, I think she model Abercrombie
Wrist game Lucky Charmy, told my jeweler Leprechaun me

Paranoia got me rollin' up my sleeves, okay
Niggas hatin' 'cause I'm uppin' up the fees
Whole team got V's on they tees, all day

Paranoia got me losin' all my Z's, all day
Good lord, momma prayin' on her knees, all day
If you still frontin' when I up it, I'ma squeeze
I'm above averageIt's so easy to fall in love
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
A$AP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how
It's so easy to fall in love
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Testarossa, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get in and get chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her
It's so easy to fall in love"I'm so happy, you know um
You know I looked at the crowd and you know
I look at my fans, I look at their faces, they expressions
And I know that damn well, we are some partying mothafuckas"
Tired of these rappers, tired of these jackers
Tired of these dances by these fucking backpackers
And I'm sick of all these hipsters, I'm sick of phony niggas
I'm sticking to these bitches, cause I'm sick of all these sisters
I'm sick and tired of tryna survive
I'm sick and tired of my environment
Sick and tired of feeling deprived
I'm one of a kind, when in my climate
Sick and tired of your facade and all of your lying and your diamonds
Basically, I'm tired of feeling sick and tired
A$AP, born in money makin' Manhattan
Every nigga on my block wanna be a Main Attrakion
Shout my nigga Squadda, shout my nigga Mondre
If you disrespect them niggas, then I'm polishin' the nine-trey
And I'm coming to your casa for your madre and your padre
Comprende? Most of these niggas been gay or they strange
They say I sound like Andre mixed with Kanye, little bit of Max
Little bit of Wiz, little bit of that, little bit of this, get off my dick
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me
Once again, Mister Back Selling Crack
It's an honor keeping real nigga music on the map
Street raps, new face, sampled with no credits
Doubting myself cause I don't think the world can relate
To my surprise everyone does, so have faith
Half of the other side don't live it they push play
The young illest alive, Harlem world to the Bay
It feels good waking up to money in the bank
Cause last year it was shoe box and lint
I only write raps just to give you niggas hints
Every verse a gift, as you smoke like a chimney
My album coming November, that's 20 years of memory
And that's assuming I'mma live that long
If I don't, don't cry cause I ain't live that wrong
Just an artist in a purest form, I live that song
An artist in the purest form, I live that song, Bambino
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me
Why fuss? I'd rather fuck
Treat her like my enemy, I just wanna bust
Seven deuce, waiting on the bus
Before the boys bend the corner, tryna make a bust
Tryouts, I'm tryna make the bucks
Purple and the green got me on stuck
So I two-step, move my feet and keep it pushing
Always bouncing back, got it keep the cushion
And that's something fat, like eating all the pudding
A$AP we got it slap, bruh good looking
Fuck That, A$AP where I come from
456, Ice City slums
Weed in my pocket, coke in his tongues
Buying swisher sweets, no more honey buns
Fresh white tee, bright like the sun
Only nigga round here rocking Мишка
I'm in your hood, you ain't got no ticket
I'mma down to Earth nigga, we could kick it
Take a hit with me, take a hit with me
Ain't on stage behind the scene, I'm probably mixing lean
Chilling with my niggas, with my team
Come and take a sip with me, take a sip with me
"This go out to all the rappers, this go out to the little darlings
The little kids running around in the schoolyards, I love you
Keep it good, keep it good kids cause you know I love you
I'mma always love you, forever"Changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes
I'm goin' through changes

Always changin' faces

*Changes
I'm goin' through changes
All those changin' faces
I'm goin' through phases*
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Love comes with a price tag and a barcode
Still love you when we part though
Blame me like it's my fault
Still o-, still okay
Walk around like your heart cold
Hop around like your parkour
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay
Still o-, still o-kay 
Still o-, still o-
Look, I got a text from this girl I used to see
Sayin' that she chose this other guy with whom she wanna be with
Look, I apologize, but this message fucked me up
Then I would skeet-skeet every girl after replying, "Best of luck to ya"
Fast forward couple months I'm like, "Wassup witcha?"
'Cause somethin' changed I know ya feel it 
But really it's been a lil' minute
Ain't nothin' changed but the address
My neighbors hate how I be livin' 
Mad it's a loud rich nigga in the buildin'
Like fuck all the other tenants 
Bought mines, boy, you rentin' 
Rich niggas in their feelings 
Rich niggas in their feelings 
Bags packed, knapsack packed like I'm leavin' home
They ain't wanna let me go, I guess you need me more
I was on the road on tour 
She just said I changed for the worst 
Rain flags, rain backs, fact guess you need it more
Had to let your heart go, I guess you need it more
I'm going through changes
Sweetest smile
Always changing phases
Upside down
I'm going through phases
I'll be cruel to you
I'm going through changes
Don't know if you love me or not
These ain't monkey bars from no fuckin' kiddy parks
Itchin' with the chicky pox, nigga
Shittin' on 'em, need my litty box
Mink on, see the fox
'03 Bentley Park, by the candy shop, Vicky, Vicky Fox
Time to give them what they want
Rakim Allah mixed with Biggie, Pac
Weird nigga from the block, ugh
Square bitches give me box, ugh
She pussy pop to Iggy Pop
You pussy niggas really pop
Thanks for the light, waitin' for the light
Change for a lifetime 
Thanks for the night, drinks for the night
Waitin' for the right time 
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes
So far I done been and feelin' change, changes
My biggest distraction is that I get distracted
People suing me for shit that didn't happen
I wonder how the world would be if they didn't have me
Wake up to my explore page
See my exes engaged, or either gettin' married
Or had a baby with some nigga
Or either three months, post-natal, postin' up that little nigga papi
I wonder if they really happy or just gettin' at me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Change, she could feel a change in me
So long since I’ve seen her, she can feel a change in me
Changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changes
Goin' through changesGet money addict, I'mma get "Money" tatted
Money in the attics, money in the stashes
Money in the cabinets, stuffed in the mattress
Safe full of guns, more money up in that shit
Taz Arnold TI$A, Jeremy Scott Adidas
Maison Martin Margiela, three strap sneakers
Riding with a leecher, student and a teacher
It's money over bitches, no room for a skeezer
Thinking of a Lambo, Bathing Ape camo
Play with the money, turn Rocky into Rambo
Patience is a virtue, life is a handful
Friends, they'll hurt you, learned that from my grandfolks
Me under a lamp post while I got my hands closed
Haze to my brains like eggs, got it scrambled
Yeah I feel Rihanna and I understand Hov
What you think I rap for? To push a fucking Land Rove?
Now I'm looking back when you said I shouldn't rap
Some slept on me, other niggas took a nap
Now I'm in the basement, probably cooking crack
Gave you teaspoons full but instead, you took a cap
They say Tyga and Diggy but Rocky been Jiggy
Curren$y from the Wiz ain't enough to get me home
Can't really hate when they compare me to Drake
Could have been J. Cole if I met J-Hov
 But I'm fly like I never left
You's a lie, like fly without the letter F
If hip hop is dead, fuck it, let it rest
Reincarnated through me when she resurrect
Long hair, Blue jeans, live on U-Stream
High top boots like Pac in a Juice scene
No, it ain't a movie, diamonds in by new gleam
Dead tone cause the redbones is my new thing
Nigga, I do things, let the coupe sing
Niggas say I'm insane, Saddam Hussein
Niggas still jokers, me, I'm on my Bruce Wayne
Fly kicks, my shit, yeah, I'm on that Liu Kang
I ain't bragging but I do this, my shoes is Bermudas
I'm bougie in that Gucci but my nudies is my newest
And your foolishness and rumors, I give two shits
I only hear the money, save the bullshit for the q-tips
Swag is the coolest, my bitch is the rudest
My jeweler is Jewish and my wrist is the bluest
And I get it poppin' on the block like Whoo Kid
ASAP standing on the block like the new kidsHuh?
We got London On Da Track
It's Guwop
Uh
It's Gucci
21, 21
Uh
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
I got so many M's in my bank account, I can't even count 'em
Too many whips, way I switch my car, I can't even mount 'em
Too many zeros with Versace pillows in my Phantoms
Too many bad bitches, I don't cuff 'em, I just hand them 
Off like a lay-up , I don't got time to lay up
Met my accountant at Ruth's Chris, she told me that I'm way up 
I already back for seconds, I ain't even clean my plate up
Ran me up a hunned M's and then I put my bay up 
Way out in the hills, I just sign the deal
I ain't take no advance, so you know that split was real 
All my diamonds carats, them lil' pointers be too lil'
Glaciers in my ear, I need a cup, they 'bout to spill 
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I feel like I'm Rocky
Huh?
How you gon' play D? Can't even take D
Too many fake me's
Way too many fake daps, way too many fake '$APs
And I put it on me  and I want another ring
Girlies buckle at the knees, swerve 'em like the other team 
You can still hear the sneaks 
Ballin' in some Dungarees
Make a cheerleader cream, so what she on the other team?
For the cameras say your cheese, rap game like the league
Heard you the nigga overseas, but that's only overseas
I'm the one who oversees shit, "Oh man, it's him again"
I'm up in the rim, Gatorade and M&M's
Ball on you in my favorite Timberlands
My girlfriend got a little friend
All the way on the other end
'Cause she don't deal with the middle man
Harlem world stole my flow, friends and my foes
Got my hoes in my clothes, they want ten like my toes 
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby , I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky 
Just pass me the rock and watch him go
Just run me the play and let me know
With a broken leg, I let it go 
I ain't gotta say it 'cause they know 
Gucci is materialistic, he's too fuckin' flashy
He smoke when he wanna smoke, think the world is his ashtray
So, so deaf to these suckers, I'm like JD in '03
My hoe said that I'm too cocky, I don't play nothin' but me
These girls got nothing to show you, I'll give you something to see
These dudes keep comin' up short like they a pair of capris
Don't group me with these rappers, these boys embarrassin' me
Them dudes ain't got nothin' on me, I got a money disease
I'm too cold for these suckers, they ain't got more money than me
I wear my mink in the summer when it's a hundred and three 
I make a bitch feel self-conscious like she too shiny for me
I know that bitch want to fuck me, but she's too tiny for me
It's my way or the highway, you either like or leave
This Rollie cost us the G's, a couple bricks on my sleeve 
When I first fell on the scene, I drove a Cutlass Supreme
A half a brick, a pint of lean, and a new money machine
It's Wop
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky 
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm too fuckin' cocky 
Too fuckin' cocky, baby, I'm so fuckin' cocky 
We got London On Da TrackI thought you said you’d never leave
I think back as I took a puff
Know what happens every time you leave
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuck
Always come back ‘cause you wanna fuss
Holdin’ back, ain’t no turnin’ back when you fall in love
Know what happens every time you speed
Always fall flat ‘cause you wanna rush
So we could take it slow
Separate the highs from the lows
Separate the evens from the odds
I just hope you put me back together when I come apart
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
I woke up today high
Felt a little less pressure from you
And I’m here to say I
Maybe even learned a lesson from you
If you find a way to fight the pain which we endure
If you fly away then rest assured
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last forever
You’re the eye, but I’m tearing all the time
Always there to catch me, but I’m never coming down
Reconstructing all the pieces I left in my way
I guess you know, in control
Chaos I create
I come apart
You made a bet with me, now you’re in debt with me
Made my bed, lied in it, then you slept with me
It’s ruthless, she the closest thing next to me
The truth is, that she blew it and you left with me
Especially hard to express to me
European attitude but born in West Philly
She just have a smokin’ ‘gina, where the Wet Willies?
I come apart, I’m in her heart on her left titty
I come apart, and you keep it together
I come apart, and I can’t stand the pressure
In all your grace and favor for me, I cannot compare
I come apart, this can’t last forever
Can’t last foreverSmoke
Ty Beats 
Back in this bitch mothafucka', yeah it's me
SpaceGhostPurrp and I put your bitch to sleep
Me and my twin at it again with this phonk
Sipping on gin, living in sin, lean in the trunk
RIP to Screw, rest in peace to Pimp C
Shout out to the H and that fucking SUC
My fucking brain is purple, nigga
Everything is purple 
Everything is purple  
I said
Everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
It be that pretty mothafucka' sipping that throwed
Gripping my pistol, my chrome
Hidden to hit you then splitting your wig into something
I spit it and flip it like Bone
Niggas ain't ready for the flow switch
Only Harlem nigga on his Bone shit
Tippin 4s since back in 06
Won't you see a nigga getting throwed bitch?
Two middle fingers to the showbiz
Cause they selfish in the showbiz
Cause they shelf kids and it's hopeless
Career dying quicker than a goldfish
I be the fly young fella , Maison Martin Margiela 
Bitches Cinderellas under my umbrella, I go and tell her
Everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
I said
Everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
Ugh! All hell here, bitch it's Satan talking
Told her to take it off, give her the D, she take the offense
Skinny nigga balling, trip but never falling
Who said to make it rain ? Bitch I make it pouring
I'm a cake-o-saurus, go study my nature
Big chain on me like Treach from Naughty by Nature
Fuck what you saying, no way
A hater don't faze a gangster
Brought up in danger, all about paper
Smoking on purple, bitch, I'm dangerous
Nasty crazy, 90s baby, momma I made it
Up to the sky, goodbye to the pavement
Hoes get caught in amazement
I'm stuck in my ways
So fuck 'em up, I fuck 'em and duck 'em for days
What more can I say? I'm chasing this paper
That's purple, nigga… Through the spot
Everyday was like a beef to me
Little nigga said he’d make it hot
You don’t wanna draw heat with me
I got niggas that’ll run up in your spot
Cooly nigga, you don’t really want beef
I’m Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
My bitch now tryna comfort me
And baby I wonder, baby I wonder
Uh, buccaneers of rugged gear, nigga fuck a fair
One, since year one, I've been thuggin' here, yeah, uh
Whole shit is ours, you in awe, please don't get involved
This is war, walk around a frame with blaze up in this jawn
Behind prison walls, niggas lickin' balls, pause
Different cause, stricted laws
Damn if I don't break up in the mall, prison yard, prison guard
No principal, detention on your friends and all
Commissary missing like your sibling's paw
Uncle Tom, please don't make my sentence long
Granted what I did was wrong
Pigs don't show remorse if you admit it all
Missing ma, hope that she don't miss the call
Admitted that she'll never visit
Like the hard-headed never listen, Lord
So tell me how the fuck I'm supposed to eat? 
If the richer's getting richer, the poor's growing weak 
My brother died up in the streets, may he rest in peace
Niggas got heat like Pusha T, get it cheap
Flacko how you been, where you at? I've been kickin' back
Relax place down my favorite thinking cap, scratch my nigga neck
Hitta chit and chat, this and that, A$AP diplomats
I'm missing Max, wish that they could bring the nigga Bigga back
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
It's like I lace up my boots and call my troops lately
Traded all my hoodie rap for all my suits lately
I'm 26 but I've been living in my youth lately
Pull my wisdom, but I still spit it like my tooth ache me
Duck shots, motherfuck cops, what the blood clot
All I gots my words and my balls and my one cock
Pause, buckshots fly, my young buck died
Passed away from a stray, from some fake tough guy
Now this the kind of story that should make doves cry
Fuck that, this the story that should make thugs cry
Dry your eyes older sis, held 'em close, watch 'em twitch
Gave 'em kiss in the midst of all of this
Ain't too late to pause or skip...
And I wonder, laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
I'm Biggaveli, I could do this in my sleep
Baby I wonder, baby I wonder
And I wonder, as I'm laying in my bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
And I wonder, as I'm laying down in bed
Am I still too young? Am I still too young?
And I hold back, thoughts running through my head
Did I fuck it up? Did I fuck it up?
Sorry guysThe hustle continues
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
Put your mind to, something you want
Gettin' money is, gettin' money is
It come true
Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is 
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is 
It's what I do
Gettin' money is 
I remember all the nights
On different corners spittin', pitchin' water
Now I'm richer off the shit I thought of
From the home of the richest ballers
I'm Richard Porter mixed with Mr. Porter
This picture all the jiggy shit I ordered
I went to France and almost got deported
The fans is screaming when I hit the border
I visit Nice like it's my sister's daughter
Vision broad, I thought of all the different kids and all
Poor without a sip of water, time to get my shit in order
And do somethin' different, gettin' tired of the same old shit
When I'm spittin' lines 'bout the section lines
I sit you kids who listen for us
I see prison for us until we pull back, that's a true fact
Get money, yeah I do that, thought you knew that
Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is 
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is 
It's what I do
Gettin' money is 
Candy low slider, I'm a soul survivor
Keep a Sweet in my visor, bitch I'm keepin' it liver
Than the average Joe, I think fast, talk slow
He think he want a war but he don't really wanna go
Need to get me some head from Sheryl Crow
A helluva blow, from a millionaire snow
You can waste your time, with the goody goody two shoes
Now I'm puttin' em on the spot, I give a ho the blues
I'm touchin' on her cot, I put her on the block
You think I'm startin' over, bitch I ain't never stop
Poppin' the trunk, and testin' the pills
Don't give a fuck 'bout where you're from
Don't give a fuck 'bout how you feel
Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is 
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is 
It's what I do

Taylor Gang, blowin' money, $50,000 on wrist watches
$100,000 in a plastic bag, we takin' off, bitch pack your bags
Bitch I came from having nothin', damn right I have to brag
Try me and I'll pop your ass, stupid nigga, get a body bag
All I talk is money ho, rich niggas don't lollygag
Gettin' money is 
I thought you knew
Gettin' money is 
I thought y'all knew
Gettin' money is 
It's what I do
Gettin' money is 
Gettin' money is the main reason most people wake up
The root of why most relationships is startin' breakups
While niggas get haircuts, and bitches do makeup
While we take their penitentiary chances, we shake up
It's an everyday struggle for the almighty dollar
Some is in the streets and some is workin' blue collar
Real up in your field and man it make you wanna holler
Say your prayer for a player, amen, inshallah
Been like that, ain't a damn thing change
Money on mind, the red of my brain
Candy paint is gonna drip that stain
Lean on left, the grip of my grain
See, ain't a damn thing change but the weather
So If you ain't breakin' bread then we can't even sit together
Gettin' money is Ahh, pain
Ahh, pain
Ahh, pain

On wax, spitting heat to melt the wax off
I'm Mr. Miyagi in Issey Miyake
Asshole flow, fuck name brands, past logos
Now I'm onto grand raps, hands so low, uh
It's like my fashion style is the life saver
Guess she wasn't satisfied with titties that Christ gave her
Bragging that her new ass shots is a life changer
Head is so good on that girl that I might pay her, or nah
Super laid back cat, opposite of fat black, Al Capone

Uhh, Father, Lord forgive me as I load up the semi
Roll through the city, that chose to resent me
Hold it, don't load it, reload it on plenty
Any foe or a  that ever voted against me, dissed me
Pissed me off then tried to hold it against me
Or wish we off the worst of luck that ever hated
Never hesitated, the designated, all of the wrong that they did me
Is stored in my memory all of the thoughts that I thought of
Means more for my enemies
Sippin' holy water like it's bore from my kidneys
Load the smoke like a chimney, make a toast for the memories
Make a toast for the Henny, it's the best for the remedies
Energy, synergy, frienemies, industries
Finna get advantage on him and his nemesis, bitches been sniffing
If I, if I ain't the greatest, bitch I'm one of em
How in the fuck could you front on 'em?

Pay the hoe my dues, I brought my own funds
When it's time to war, I brought my own gun
Difference is I'm ghetto but I'm wholesome
Nigga say I switched up like I'm on some
Why you always treat me like I owe some?
Truthfully you only wanna hold some
Whip it like I've been a slave
Bucking from the twelve like I've been afraid
Motorola, burn out, couple minutes saved
Kept a pre-paid on my hip them days
143rd in front on Minisink
Cam'ron had us wearing pink
From the cradle to the grave
Putting work, hustle round the corner where my nana stay
Couldn't work, open up shop in front the corner store
Make 'em renovate, with the killer stain
Fuck a lemonade but they cook it by the Minute Maid
Couple niggas hate
But the best form of flattery is when you imi-
When you imitate, ayy

Get like me, tell me how it's gonna, how it's gonna be

From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
From the cradle to the grave, I'ma put in work
With my back against the wall, nigga, I'ma ball

My cougars had me lit, kept a PYT
Your mama on my dick, prettier than a bitch

Bow Yeah this is my story, my struggle, uh
My bittersweet symphony, my pain, check it
Food getting lower, money coming slower
Damn land lord keep bitching cause you owe her
I'm too afraid to grow up, I pray to God I blow up
And roll up in something foreign where the front doors go up
I wonder if my peers could hear my prayers
The only nigga got me scared is the man upstairs
When my back against the wall, I'mma face my fears
I'll swallow my pride 'fore I swallow a tear
Cause I be going hard, Stevie on his job
I'm praying until something happen, I'm answering to God
These wolves got me scarred
I try so hard to survive, guess just to prosper gotta strive
Then I hit the stage, all gone and blazed
Everybody know my name and the song I sing
I rejoice my pain and they doing the same
And the haters gonna hate, I'm just doing my thing
Got my bad bitch with me she so dangy
Said she love ASAP cause we so tangy
Living life fast so I feel like kids
And I'm blowing up quick so I feel like B.I.G
With the Super Nintendo, Sega Genesis
Now we doing deals with the major businesses
Get a little change, niggas feel a little strange
Uh-oh truck flow, pull off in a range
Niggas say I changed but I'm living it up
Shit if money didn't change you, you ain't getting enough
Fuck coppin a car, I'm Tryna fly to the stars

Cuz the nights we was ill, y'all ain't help me with shit
Ooh now my money change drastic, The coupe do gymnastic
The doors lift up and the roof do a back flip
Zooming through traffic, probably with a bad bitch
Slash actress soon we on our way to Saks Fifth
Life was so tragic, all of that was past tense
Now I'm living lavish, this got to be magic
If I should die before I wake
Pray the lord my soul to take
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord my soul to keep
If I die before I wake
Please rejoice this song I sing
As I lay me down to sleep
Pray the lord I rest in peace"Mo—money and the power, money and the power"
Eyedrops, 
Teardrops

Sittin' in institution, I  done lost my baby
If nan' ain't ever woke me up, then it's gon' wake me
When them people ran up on my spot, and they took my baby

A random kind that's ridin' the pine, something you free—something you free—something you freeUh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? uh
My whole life I just wanted to be a rapper

And my older sister made me wear the golden wrapper
She said, "Watch out, 'cause you know the hoes will trap ya"

Sneaking, talking to my girlfriend way up late 
Mama on the mothafuckin' line, "Boy, you cray"
I was trappin' since a young nigga by the way
Back, way back then, boy, I was a different dude 
Standing on the corner like I ain't got shit to do 
Nowadays  feelin' like I ain't got shit to prove 
All the beef is lookin' minuscule 
And I modeled Dior, but I'm still a rapper 
Took a little detour, but I'm still a rapper 
Used to be a D-boy but I'm still a rapper
My whole life I was livin' like a trapper 
Shacked next to Casanova, locked up on the island
I don't brag about it 'cause it never really matter
Knew that I would never go back, don't hold back
Just shine my golden teeth
Just throw my dubs sack, that boof pack
That specimen, I could beef with OG beepers, nigga
Uh, posted on the corner like a trapper, uh
Why he move his hands all around like a rapper? Uh
Why he move his pants up and down like a scrapper? Uh

Pray I make a little extra cash for my dues 
Like all she ever wanted was some ass for her boobs
Sneaking, uh, why she freak you?  uh, why she geeking?
Uh, when she see me  why she kinky? Uh
Why she wanna be my—

Stay up in the bitches while she dozing
When I went to my brotha, told him, "Help me please"

The Man with the Iron Fists edition

But right now check out these new hot weapons right here
Driicky Graham, A$AP Rocky, Angel Haze, Childish Gambino and Joey Bada$$
C'mon, splash em son
I came here with one intention: to kill this
I'm talking head in my hands, mouth on that drill ish
I be on that wired insane, ultimate trill shit
And there is not a soul that can see me
Like I'm not real trick
Listen up niggas I'm tired of you lames
I'm hungry and you looking like entire food chains
And uh, it's to the point that I ain't even got to try hard
Spittin' like a lake in hell, but bitches like my God
Plus niggas flicking lenses on me like a tripod
'Cuz they know there's only one eye, like cyclops
You know I beat 'em to the count, to the points love
I swear I never even lost in a coin toss
So bow down mothafuckas, if you talking deep shit I’ll out drown mothafuckas
Somebody find my rocker cause I'm literally off it
I'm in the murder business I just spit you bitches a coffin
Yo, til the day I die, I be puffing lye
Fuck the world, fuck it dry
Tell them government spies I won't cover my eyes
Won't cower, won't move, cause I don't move like a coward
Knowledge is power and the flower of life is ours
Get as high as ours, maybe you can see the towers
Scour your dirty mind and maybe you'll unleash the power
We all got the potential in our body and soul
Probably you know I found mines right through the pencil
Started bodying flows, but fuck that
This be the preview of primeval hip-hop retrieval
I hold illegal like them coppers hold weasels to Squeal
This one for my people, heading to the top, no re-do
Thinking up evil but see no evil just be Knievel
You can't be this good they just made me better
They told me cheese at the cams and they made me cheddar
And the green only made me better
See, God made three Bigs, 2 Pacs but he only made one era, The Era
Swear you guys slipping like some ice on a bridge
Since diapers and bibs
The light skin has been quite nicer than how Mike was to kids
Cypher rhyming, Rikers Island, spending nights with the pen
Either that or cyber-Skyping with a dyke and her friend
She telling me, she gon' take my cock to her lips
Suffice to my wish, saliva and recycle my kids, gulp
I'm the best, it's hard to lose hope
I'm spitting rappers out like orange juice pulp
And looking in the mirror like aren't you dope
You so clean motherfucker you should hardly use soap
Something sinister, raps that minister
You mortals don't want combat, I'll block and finish ya
I'm seriously dope, I'm crack, I'm venomous
And you are seriously poked in your crack by ministers
Eww, these days rappers on my TV
Are braggers about their swagger rocking karats off of Ebay
But I ain't tripping, I like groupie women
Who be sendin' chills up your spine when you see they booty switching
Fast cars with the kufi missing, that's top off
Pop off, I'm with my dawgs like Stewie Griffin
Niggas hear me, be like ooh he be ripping
And if your girl see me she catch that Driicky spank me, do me feeling
Over the money I be pooky twitching
And honestly about the beef I gives a fuck what who be Twittin'
Still good with a pen, no Joe Paterno
I count Ninja Turtles, my cash flow concern them
Gambino you meet him, repping east side of the A hard
Got the Black AMEX, I gotta pull the race card
Niggas move that Kreayshawn, naw I don't carry mine
Why the game fucked up like my hairline
Ay girl, you ever smoke a bowl out with Kid Cudi?
You ever gotten D like you don't study?
Rap game in the fast lane, with a gas tank
Filled with half of these trash lames
I have to say I'm such a Joey's last name
Bino boy, why you spit so mean
Why the flow so rich girl, them sweet sixteens
He on BET and he got White people problems
"Like, Whole Foods doesn't have the juice I like so I have to go to, you know
Trader Joe's and have it shipped to me"
Victory, history
More G than a kid's movie, Royalty
My name is Rock in the new drop, my destiny's to be the new Pac
That nigga Rocky gotta die, he too hot
It’s dead on, must've been tripping and stepping in heron'
Cause I’m cripping the lead on
I’m getting forensics twisting your head on
Traffic, mad clips, caskets, pass this, ashes to ashes
That shit, backwards, tactics
Bitches only like me for my status
Living ghetto fabulous and I’m still acting ratchet
Twenty-four karats, no dressing with my salads
Nigga with the Patch kids, steady talking cabbage
Got a chick red like radish, have it
Bitches think they bad til I drop them like habits
No one in this cyph' has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Ever since a baby, ask my old lady
My first four words was, fuck you, pay meWhat's this I see? Niggas tryna act like G's
Got A$AP, got Fergy with me
It's a new day, no Black Eyed Peas
That's that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, that's that shit
Mothafucka better blast that shit
Niggas drink quarts of the Clicquot
Bitches sniff raw of the kilos
Flacko makes sales of the perico
She knows, went to ATL for my C-Note
'Member, I ain't ever have no home
Now I got a penthouse and a beach home
Back when I was rockin' least 
I was trappin' off at least like three phones
Me and Yams made the plan
Then I paid myself and I gave myself advance
Way before I became myself
I'd like to thank myself because I made myself the man
It's like lately I ain't myself
I'd rather hang myself before I play myself
I tell her, "throw on the dress with the pinstripes"
Know the one that fit the booty all skin tight, that's right
Yeah, you that shit, mhm, mhm, yeah, move that shit
Frontin' like you did it for the fellas
Get all the bitches jealous when you do that shit
But my neck is gold, the rest is froze
Sex and hoes, best of both
Girls and girls, perpetual
Sippin' slow, Texas throwed
Comma, I'm about decimals
Chill and get faded
I'm surprised that we made it
Young niggas know the sky's the limit
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
Chill and get faded
Shit, I'm surprised that we made it
Nowadays stress overrated
All I ever wanna do is chill and get shaded
I wanna see you take it all off
And she just wanna make it harder
And we just end up takin' longer

You could be light, dark, mixed or fair skin
Just light the candle
Cold sweats down the handle, life's a gamble
And she know
Love with me is like a casino, outside of Reno
A couple white lines
A cup of white wine of Pinot, Italian Grigio
House keys to P.O
Ride from overseas but that's basic
Wasted, high on the West Side Highway
Drunk enough to fuck with, face it
Hangovers, leftovers in the Range Rover
Shame on her, make up or get a makeover
Think over, Glenfiddich start to takeover
When I brainstorm, all the hoes ain't got a thing on her
Audemars, season order like summer fall
I throw the Audemars, then I throw out all the ball
New Dior from the boutique store
Only thing in common that we got is that we want it all
Little cutie pie, saw her looking super fly
More Justin Timberlake on my suit and tie
Try to scrutinize, cause I keep two inside
Suicides? No sir, hoes get the Uber ride
Or we can kiss 'til the sun come up
Or, sit on my lap 'til somethin' come up
She ain't really wanna club, I don't really wanna judge
Girl just wanna have fun 'til the fun run up
On the highway to my place
It's higher than you ever been
By to my way, be all day
Me, you and all your friends
In love, fuckin'
In love, just too much, ohh

Anybody want it, they can get it, come correct though
Talk behind my back but when they see me it's respect though
Still got the crown, so I never give a F though
Everything is wavy, I'ma hit 'em with the breast stroke
Then I'ma get high, I'ma get the best dope
Yeah, I make the rules, I ain't following the dress code
I-I ain't do the mess though, I'ma put a hex though

Peeking out the window, but they’ll never win though

Tell me what we praying for, too many gods
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me 
Tell me why we go to war, too many gods 
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods 
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God 
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me 
It's just too many laws
Misfits, too many wars
Battle scars, too many swords
Knight in shining armor, such a pretty horse
Strange screams down the corridors
Divide, conquer, call it yours
Another false prophet's on the thrones
 Had a dream
I woke up a king in a peasant body
Killed my pride, I felt less embodied
Still inside, writing papers
Flying ravens with a message 'bout me
On my knees like I'm rectifying
Hand on my heart like I'm testifying
Want the beef, I go prime on it
Fuck a king, I turn God on it
Tell me why we go to war, too many gods
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me 
Tell me why we go to war, too many gods 
Tell me what we praying for, too many gods 
Feel like things will never change, I swear to God 
Sometimes I wonder if God ever prays for me 
Uh, head start
Sword so sharp, take his head apart 
Ready for war, I grew up with soldiers like Ned Stark 
Dragging my name in the dirt and I'll bury 'em
Playing with fire but I'm no Targaryen
Dire wolves with me, these ain't no Siberians
What's a king to a God? Ain't no comparing them
Bent the flow harder, Valyrian steel
Nobody move or somebody get killed
I got the pole, aim my scope at his head
Look in his eyes and he knew he was dead
This ain't no Dunleavey but he be said
I pray to God, but who pray for the kid?
Life is too short to be living in fear
Especially when you know winter is here
UhWhat it do, baby?
It's Paul Wall, come on
Purple pint, that's Gucci rap
Driving slow, black on black
Backwood lit, windows cracked
Dime in my lap with her hair pulled back
And a hand full of diamonds all on my wrist
Mouth full of ice, pardon my lisp
World full of hate is fear a few rips
So I open my mind and stack up my chips
Lollipop grind, whole lotta licks
From paper planes to a house made of bricks
Big ol' cold cup with codeine mix
So I'm so throwed and I'm still gettin' lit
And everything is purple, baby
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
Trill OG and I rep the South
Nigga, I rep the streets and I rep the hood
And I'm grippin' grain, grippin' stains
And I'm flippin' mane and it's kinda good
I'm holdin' wood with diamonds on it
Hittin' the block and I'm grindin' on it
With a big ol' chain and a big ol' piece
‘Cause when I'm in these streets I be shinin', homie
Haters better get they ass behind me, homie
‘Cause I'm in the front and I'm takin' charge
And when I'm done, I'mma have a homie run
And they be hard to find like they's El Debarge
And my swag is large, extra large
I can barely fit it up in this room
But don't sweat the size and don't be surprised
When your bitch reminds that I'm the shit to swoon
I lick the blunt and I pass the 'dro
Spit my game and I smash your ho
But no, I ain't trick, it's no passin' dough
Then I hop up in this slab and I mash it, bro
I got a passion for this Southern flow
This that purple life and we thuggin', bro
These haters might not really understand it
But that's all good ‘cause we love it though
This PAT, that's where I'm from
That's what I rep and that's how it go

Everything is purple 
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
Purple swag, purple swag, I'm in the zone, I'm getting throwed

That big booty, juicy fruity, yellow bone, I wanna bone
I'm getting dome, I took her out, dick in her mouth, she getting on
I'm flexing steel, I'm flexing still, I'm sitting high, I'm tipping slow
I'm Texas trill, Texas trill, but in NY we spit it slow
I got these boppas going crazy, they see me comin'
Robitussin, quit discussin', A$AP, tell these niggas somethin'
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
Ha-ha-yeah

Fast money man, I get mine ASAP
Always stacking and I'm paid, that's ASAP

Thick like Serena, my pockets on Venus, nigga!
 Everything is purple 
Everything is purple 
I said, everything is purple 
Everything is purple Back through the door, bag full of smoke
Sit back, relax and max with the hoes
Chat with my folks, laughin' at jokes
I’m hard to the core and she bad to the bone
Ask her to bone, chats on the phone
Her three friends with her just'a tagging along
As for the flow, back to the song
Flashbacks only bring me back to that thong
Cause we been getting, we’ve been getting high all week
Smoking, drinking, I’m her drug and she get high off me
Now I’m back to the store
Blunt wrapped, full of 'dro
Roll it back in that Backwood
Pass it and smoke
Want to get her high so I pass her the most
She want that bread and butter so I pass her the toast
That A$AP motto is "party, get high"
We back to the future
That Marty McFly
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la
Back to the future, that Marty McFly
Back through the door, back from the store
Back to the wall with my back to the wall
Rollin' up a blunt, passing it off
Ass on the floor, cash back on the floor
Mack with the broads, chat to the whores
"There go my niggas" dap to my dawgs
I prey on that pussy, chat with the Lord
Seem how it seems like I had it before
I think back, way back ran with my memories
We was getting high, sippin' on Hennessy
Now it's like lean
Thinkin' back seat
Way back riding on something clean, knamean
Twenty-tens
We don't do the teens now it's twenty-eleven
Let me know something take her back to my session
Back to the pad, now I’m back on that ass
Back to the future, back to the past
Sometimes I think about the past
Seems like the time is flying fast
So how my presence always last
The future’s always going back
La la la la la la la la la

Fuego, beef up on my plate is no mistake
Hahahahaha, check out the Chopard

I know you feel alone, but I'm gon' get you high now
Now that you high, take your clothes off, and lie down

We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she tripping
Come, listen, yeah I can be your E-pill

She say that my pipe is crack and you know I'm gon' get very ill
So I just penetrate and hit her with my needle

Put me in your nose, inhale my aroma
Shit so potent, shit stronger than ammonia

We get high 
We smoking reefer, got her open, now she hoping
We get high 
We smoking reefer, I got her sipping, now she trippingUsed to call me Push ‘cause I pushed by the quarter
Used to push keys ‘til the D's pushed harder
Push “start” – push buttons, start the car up
Push me, push your wig back like barbers
Off with your toupee, I boss hog like two lanes
Fuck red dots but my bullets come in Blu-ray
Pussy-ass niggas and they sweet like Kool-Aid
Married to the game, tell them niggas catch the bouquet
Don’t fuck with hoes, sometimes I’d rather beat off
My kicks so fire, burn the skin up on my feet off
Tell ‘em turn the heat down, they tell me my mink off
She’s so abusive, the boy she wanna skeet off
Fancy, fancy, met her on Delancey
Pum-pum so good I eat her through her panties
Every Jamaican bitch always trippin’ off of Xanny
Wine Slow, so I give her gold like Santi
Bapes on my feet make the cypher complete
Margielas by the week, say my style is unique
Picking bitches by their teeth, for my bitches be heat
Put the pussy on lock, I remind 'em of sheiks
Cuttin’ niggas with my lines like a barber with Zekes
Burnin’ niggas with my rhymes, let the arsonist speak
I’m tryna have a Nicki Minaj every week
And fuck makin’ her cum, Imma fuck her ‘til she pee
And if she was a midget, I would fuck her on my knees
‘Cause that ass fat, I will fuck her ‘til she sleep
It’s Trap Lord Sunday every day of the week
A-S-A-P ‘til I D-I-E, ma’fuckaShe was coming on to me, I was coming on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don't you fight the curse
She was making love to me, I was holding on to her
Hit the town and shoot the breeze, baby don't you fight the curse
Ah, just give me that bass
She listening to Ross now, give me that face

I ain't tryna spit game, maybe we can hook up
The Aston out front, so my nickname Kutcher
Dinner date time, down inner state 9
I'm in the state of mine like a dinner date's fine
We can go to the condo and drink wine
She wanna to be my girl but it'll take time
She like where the cognac, why we drink wine?
Cause the wine get you open, heard through the grape vines
First dim the lights close the drape blinds
Then I scratch that kitty word to my K-9's
Don't spur show fur big grill gleaming
Polar no firm when the ship season
Got 'em red bottoms look like your heels bleeding
I fuck a hundred bitches to these day we still speaking
And they still creeping, got 'em still cheating
Got 'em still cheating, got 'em still creeping
Text me on the phone said the panties still leaking 
She came four times, had the bitch tweaking 
Jump up in the ride, loud how you reaking 
Then she went down, on lookers peeking 
I had them dark tints it’s hard for them to see in
She bust 'em all loss 'em rollin' we was leaving
That's another reason, to only let the freak in 
That type of action, happen every third weekend 
Took all type of trips, 'til my mileage got frequent 
Shit, and my proposals came indecent
She musta told her friends cause I here 'em ki-ki'ing
 About this money and V's that we be in
We getting money new V's each season 
The champagne caught me, vision kind of sloppy 
Kickin' it to this broad but my speech is kind of choppy
I told her let's split, her reply was copied
So when a nigga split, you know we jump up in the high V
Damn, I think she caught an orgasm
This gold diggin bitch caught a whore spasm 
I’m a cold nigga bitch and I the Porsche spazzing
You know the Porsche waggon, four door cabin 
I’m getting money so of course I’m braggin 
I had the bitch high like she was on saturn

Let it out, let it out, let it out
I foresee the jealousy all in your eyes for sure
Sure, they don't want to beef with my physique or my .44
Sure, life is sweet, I'm by the beach, sand all on the feet
By the seat, the time we meet, we'll leave em' by the shore
Sure, pop a bean em' right to sleep sheets of my decor
With privacy, she grind on me and sweep on my rapport, whore
Drama by the front door, pushing out the back door
Trapping out the bando, leave em' by the trap door
Money bags, money bags
Ten bands, ten bands, ten bands 
Drop the babies in the car seat, must be the Courvoisier
Tap on your bustier, valeting Cartier
Car keys to the Murcielago and Courtier
Wake up thankful everyday, feel like Sydney Portier
Ayy ayy, soundbite, soundbite, woo
Cheat code, cheat code, L1, down, right
Damn right, damn right
The nigga who your sound like, sound like
Demons fucking up my focus
Head vultures, precious death, death rows
Pockets full of dead folks
Prada soles full of dead roaches
And some cud I stepped on
Waiting for her to get left
On the same place, dead bodies get left on
But woke niggas get slept on
Broke niggas get flexed on
I really wish she had less on
I might fuck her with a dress on
Scratching on me with her press-ons
We ain't stopping til' the next song
Next song, next song, next song

Ricky Owens on me look like Dom Pér
St. Laurents on me, I don't wear VansI'm something out this world, nothing like the rest
Nigga, win the fair game, fuck with the best
Just a kid with the grown men, rep to protect
Since it's so rare so there's a whole land left in distress
I'm coming for your neck, hey, I ain't indirect
They in debt, pay respect, now I'm coming to collect
They regret what they said, that's when I become a threat
Make a bet that the next time you niggas come correct
This the type of music make a nigga flex
Start so gangster, move it throwing up the set
All the pretty niggas feeling only breasts
And the government are cutting only checks
Everybody stressed
If knowledge is power and power is knowledge
And then you divide and conquer, I devoured and conquered
The youth is my environment, inspire responsibly
But they rather drop it like it's hot, that wobbity wobbity
If you ever thought of robbing me, my mob on me probably
I believe this highway robbery, get the fuck out the driver's seat
Honestly part of the problem, you deprived of your privacy
This is private property, you part of the poverty
You forced just like the prophecy, that's part of the policy
Obviously just plain technology, democracy's mockery
My doc made a hypothesis, he said that I'm obsolete

Mister, nosy reporter, ain't missed ya
Fuck off my line, get the fuck off my dick, I set trends
Been legit, since a lil' git
Hoe by my side and fo-fo on my hip 
When I hit the lean, it gets the best of me 
Won't let this LSD get the best of me 
Won't let amphetamines get the best of me 
Won't let my legacy be the best of me 
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny 
Working on a better me, do what's best for me 
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me 
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me 
Penitentiary visions, my chemistry pitch a flux
I mean, "Who are we kidding?" Surpassed my grade and above
Ain't a mil? Then I'm walking, be sure to pay me my bucks
This ain't the NBA baby, you can't 2k me, I'm up
Can't NFL me like Trump, just "Gucci Gang" me like Pump
Like Gucci Mane with a cup, my Gucci came with a pump
My Coogi fit me like Puff, like Gucci rap off the snuff
Try and take pics of me in clubs, those end up off the drugs
Won't let the lean get the best of me 
Won't let this LSD get the best of me 
Won't let amphetamines get the best of me 
Won't let my legacy be the best of me 
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny 
Working on a better me, do what's best for me 
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me 
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me 
Won't give niggas my back just for a nigga to stab
Or wife one of these nats, just for a nigga to smash
Behind my back, on my behalf, I ain't hearin', "Oh my bad"
Tryna take it on, expect to give them your last
Ever since my sobriety, it's like I've been in my bag
Toast with a glass, invite the ghost of my past
I'd rather smoke opponents, your grade was closer to ash
The masses taking notes, so why nosy folks wanna ask
Mister, nosy reporter, ain't missed ya
Fuck off my line, get the fuck off my dick, I set trends
Been legit, since a lil' git
Hoe by my side and fo-fo on my hip

Won't let amphetamines get the best of me 
Won't let my legacy be the best of me 
Blowing through my desks of trees, my destiny 
Working on a better me, do what's best for me 
Won't let these haters be the fucking death of me 
Won't-won't let me get ahead of me There was a family of quicks on my block
A family we all knew
I'm talkin' bout John, Damian, and that boy Jrue
They had an unfair proof that lived in their shoe
Technological truth made'em quicker than you
Their quick was quick
I'm talkin bout the quickest quick ever seen
From outside the gym you could hear the crowd scream
Challengers and challenges brung'em to the floor
They cut and crossed over until there wasn't no more
Competition that is
People keep asking you what's up in that shoe
First draft pick, rookie of the year, all star games too
Looking back on the sell homie, who would've even knew
That all of that quick could come from inside of a shoe?
Those kicks made these cats rare
And when you crazy quick, man quick ain't fairMarble floors, foreign whores, finna order more
Play that French Montana song, the one with Ross 
Ordered new Raf, it ain't from the store
Came with a piece, bangin' peace if it come to war
She takin' somethin' off, what you stuntin' for?
Fix your WonderBra, my style is rubbin' off
Swear that pussy Oasis if I'm in it raw
Out in London Town paintin' all the wonderwalls
Yeah I'm underdog, spring, summer, fall, winter
Niggas run to law, gun in drawers, gettin' bundles off
Takin' trips to Baltimore, with the raw, door to door
Fender boss, want the vintage Porsche with the oven doors
I just wanna have a little fun with y'all
But on the real, no, I kill folk
Growin' up I had a best friend who used to mail coke
Successful with the shit until the day they heard the seal broke
My other partner got a million dollars and he's still broke
My thot a primadonna and she whinin' cause her nail broke
Niggas comin' at me sideways like they heel broke
And I'm just glad I ain't ever gotta deal dope
Cause the vision was this tradition and pants
Whole squad in this bitch, all we missin' is Yams
Caught a wish and got bitches in France
Chain swing, see the king and they kissin' my handHow do I know it's real?
Barely keep my composure
Love me with no disclosure
Tell 'em all how you feel 
Notice this
Electric charges flowin' through your fingertips
When your hands on my thighs
Do you feel this energy when I'm near you?
Do you?
Do you?
Do you?
Oh, it's not just me
Don't deny all this energy
Oh, it's not just me
Undeniably, wait and see
Oh, the pressure

I don't even rest,  even at a rest stop
I toast with the Gods, tell these haters take they best shot
I'ma be that motherfucker 'til my breath stop

Made a change from the whips, shackles and the chains
But nowadays man seem a little strange
Trade his soul for the whips and the chains, what a change!
No, I couldn't tell you what the difference is
But I could tell you what the business is
I was getting dividends, probably spending Benjamins
Both kind of synonyms, in the same sentences

I'm rhymin', I'm shinin', Fuck that shit this is blindin'
And you know we just grindin' until we eatin'
And Rocky is the best it ain't no mother fuckin' secret
Westwood, Westwood what's good? Freestylin' off the top of the dome baby
A$AP, Long Live A$AP in stores, Go get it today baby
A$AP Harlem World nigga
Hey Westwood, what you want me to spit about? Say anything
 Yo, Being A$AP Rocky kid
Rocky kid, and you know I'm that cocky kid
Fuck that made history just look back at what Rocky did
In one year alone, no protege, you better hate
Can't relate, Fuck that these wack niggas they led astray
Paper chasin' and chasin' paper, fuck that these niggas haters
Got the lasers, they got tasers. We the greatest, we the Lakers
We the Knicks, get off our dicks, these bitches tick tick-tock on the clock
On the dot, when I'm on my shit won't stop until the fuckin' cops come knockin'
What's poppin'? What's happening? Turn down this music?
What you mean nigga? I gotta be a legendary influence
In my mother fuckin' culture, my mother fuckin' era
And you should just admit it can't nobody do it better
Gotta Hood by Air sweater, this shit is M3
And I'm in a M3 till my nigga Benji's we throwin'
We ballin, it's snowin', we glowin', it's rainin'
We came in, we changes, it's ours for the takin'
We makin' Jamaican bitches shake it, what's happenin' make it
Because we money makin', Manhattan ain't no shit takin'
Mistakin' you crazy, you flakin' I mean they wanna say what they be sayin'
Illuminati all he sayin' oh that gay shit that they say
Shit I can't be with these mother fuckers talkin' crazy about us
Nigga better bring the ruckus. Niggas know I'm west coast
And I got them chuckers and I bring it up town, up to Harlem mother fuckers
Wassup? Yeah yeah A$AP nigga
Off the top. Next time we gotta do this for a hour straight
Blow down, I gotta bring the Mob out here, A$AP Mob out here one time
Westwood, A$AP
 Crazy, crazy manUh alright, 
Uh, uh, uh
A$AP
Uh, bachelor with no tux, still got my shirt cuffed
Still got my sleeves rolled up and my shirt tucked
Grown up? Sure enough, sipping on that syrup
Purple Label shit, yeah, I wear what I sip
Scarface vision, see my visions on a blimp
And a quarter key will turn a G into a gent
All-purpose flow, we are the great
I'm so Kurtis Blow, and these are the breaks
My Christian Louboutins got nails, give me hammer toes
Niggas get shy when that camera rolls
Drop crotch pants will remind you of them Hammer clothes
All-yellow Phantom, I'm like Yeezy in that amber Rolls
"Ah-ha-ha-ha-ha," but who am I kidding?
No way I could afford it so for now I'm just pretending
How these gold diggers digging without a single pot to piss in?
Cause my pockets full of lint and my heart is full of vision, I'm grown
I don't do kid stuff much
Niggas say, "Now, nigga all grown up"
I don't hear y'all much
I'm all grown up, tough luck
Curtains drawn and six dudes back
The chauffeur ride in the front as we speed to the dot
Deanna waits along with the classy mist
My waist my shoulder blades the type you can't resist
Picture this: being 21 with a gift
Bamas don't understand how I'm swift
Or I'm MJ-nice, like Jordan up on the mic
Amen for the new saviors of rap
My birth's 3/89 but I'm 30 up on the track
That's grown man, little homie, that's real rap
Y'all trying to switch up the style, I'm bringing Versace back
Giovanni, Medusa, and all black
Hot boy, I done ran through hell and walked back
Passport is stamped from sightseeing the map
And to think, I'm asleep but won't blink
I'm dreamin all this within, Young Leo, Inception
Come again? No offense
But fuck whoever said wearing slims was a trend
More like a lifestyle in the rawest form
All grown up, nothing like beforeLyrics from Snippet
I see things in my sleep
This past week 
I'm on a cloud
I think they runnin' out of rappers to compare me with
Ain't a bitch out bad enough to pair me with
Usually only fuck with niggas that you hear me with
My jewelry dance like rubies skipping on canary bricks
On some donkey shit, nigga I bought me this
Shooters love me from Canal up to 40thLife is what you make it
They say time is money
If that's the case
I don't got neither for your broke ass
Life is such a dark image that I can't dream
I used to give these hard visions, in my near teens
Yea I'm getting dirty money, but my hands clean
Making money stretch, Ben Frank pull a ham string
Another get rich quick hair brain scheme
Just so we can shine like sterling
Time goes on, consider me the new guy
Walking in the office, brief case and a new tie
Rocky is the flyest on the banner when I cruise by
 The motherfucker too fly
Shit change mane, act yo age not your shoe size
Last of the dying breed, the game got her tubes tied
Niggas selling true lies, I'm all about the mula
Stressful, so every now and then I gotta woo sah
Bout to turn it up, see I'm hot as fuckin' July
Smooth suede shoes, I'm Busta Rhymes yelling "Woo Hah!!!"!
Snacks on the menu, it's best we continue
ASAP turn up events in the venue
And these fucking critics do their best to offend you
They don't care about your dress, and your veteran credentials
Motherfuck em' all, motherfuck em' all
We only shop boutiques, like motherfuck a mall
And I'm bright as stars, fresh as death in these McQueens
My outfit is deceased, Alexander rest in peace and I'm GoneWalls slowly closin' in
I feel the time slowly runnin' out
I think my mind slowly losin' focus
Lately, I've been through the motions
I'm on another level this time
Levels in my bezel, rich time
They ain't on my level this time
Think it's time we settle this right now
And if I keep goin' back to fuckin' with her, with her
I'ma end up with her, oh
Always first to finish last, time to quit her, quit her
Time to give up, bitter, oh
This time, I'm...
This time...
I'm your first, I'm your last
I'm the best thing that you've ever had
This time...
This time...
Last time...
I'm the best of all time
Last t-Lyrics from Snippet
Woo
Smacked the shit out your bitch ass midget girlfriend, nigga 
Shittin' me?

Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me
Shittin' me?
Gotta be kidding me
How could you shit on me?
You ain't got shit on me
Why they choose my pubes every time they wanna sit? 
Couldn't ride the wave and now you ridin' dick 
These bitches got no chances, they rely on dick 
Show them how to tip 
Ride around town on meds
Louis belt got the check
A nigga gon' die on this
A shorty gon' ride on this
Rep the set, I ride on this
Take 'em by the leg
I been feelin' like I could shit
And a nigga still bump his shit? 
Stay to what's mine, state of mind
I say to myself, mostly
I stay on yo' mind, I stay in yo' mouth
You stay and you loud
Mosh it out, I need a new towel
Jump in the crowd, oh shitAs I maneuver through the streets
A policeman and then they seize bodies of those who disagree
I pray the soldiers get release
The price of grief wasn't cheap
Hoped you kept to your receipts
Where there's beef
On the side of the feast, I'm a beast
Said it's me now, hold your peace
Don't hold your breath
Load your piece
And then squeeze
Then release
Rest in peace
No relief
And that's why
The fucking martian to the fucking fucking, nigga
Well my devil won't let me out

Finger on the trigger
Pour the shot down
Now there's one less nigga
Hold up
Including everybody in this bitch
I off 'em with my fingertips
And force apart his ligaments
Be sure to wipe your fingerprints
Restore back to your innocence
And reminiscing ever since you feel the sentencing before the sentence ended
I'm in the slums my nigga
Not just for bragging
I'm in the field my nigga
This shit for practice
This shit is trill my nigga
Kill or be killed my nigga
Cops is killing children
Get off, only get suspension
Man, this shit's suspicious
Consequences never in this
Fur these fucking pigs and dirty politicians
Dirty money, wash the business
It's them early birds that'll prolly get it
Pull up on you, shut up
Shut the fuck up
Learn how to run or mind your business
Well my devil won't–
Well my devil won't–

Thought I made that apparent
That's a hundred for a 'Claren or something

Cop my Karats from Carring dammit
Make a bitch wanna stare or something
Niggas stare, you queer or somethin'?
You's a bitch, yeah we stay done
Chose a whip but I'm staying sunny
Diamonds sunny like I'm Cher or something
Smiley faces with the glasses
Fashion brands invite you to Paris
Boy you late that's a demerit, dang it
Fucking maggot brain having
Rappers claiming the trap and the fashion
They only got Louis and the trap
I'm causing the flood and the traffic
The way that you be moving is whack
All of them rumors is facts
They've been in clap for the clap back
Your baby mama a nag nag
Nag nag nag nag nag nag

See, my tailor's the shit, got me tailored like Swift 
Name on her lips  when I came out events
And got razors like barbers, don't play with them clips
Shirt collars like Carlton, I don't stay at the Ritz 
Fresh as a bitch so they named me the Prince 
Just had a date with this ratchet lil' bitch 
And broke up with my chick, so I match with my friends
And she can't pronounce what's on my kicks
Engine loud, blame it on my kit
.40 with a lot of kick  on my hip 
Let it rip, on my mama, on my kid
At my performances I'm jumpin' on ya kids
Fuck a stage, I'm moshin' in the pit
Gun license, keep it on me, bitch
Had that shit before a learner's permit

I didn’t really notice it until I got home and saw it. I apologize to Jason for that, because people was laughing and shit, and you know… I really don’t think that’s funny. I saw they were making all the memes and pictures and making fun of him. There’s people out there that think I was doing that to be funny, and truthfully I got gay people in my family. I don’t give a fuck if you gay or you not, I just found it odd that MTV wanted to stand me next to this nigga when they are talking about gay people, that’s all. You know what I’m saying?Yeah, yeah, yeah

Now she a blur in my memory
I remember what we was finna be
Now I know her as my enemy
'Member it was so friendly
But she just wanted some sympathy
I just wanted some empathy
I wasn't feelin' her energy
They ask about me in her interviews
I just want peace and tranquility
But now that hoe can go suck a dick
Yeah, Lewinsky no Hillary
So weird,  the enemy
I can tell she was gon' handle me
Tryna act so innocent
Now our love is so bittersweet
Now she just a blur in my memory
Not a little but literally
Can't read between lines, you illiterate
I hate her a lot, not a little bit
You befriended all my frenemies
You fuck with my ex, are you kidding me?
These hoes is best friends, are you shitting me
Hang out every day just to get to me
They fuck with me but don't fuck with me
The games that you play ain't offending me
I'ma just sip on my Hennessy
And now you a blur in my memory
Now you a start with a lemony
They spillin' out they tea, ain't no remedy
Tell your man I want smoke like a chimney
Now you gotta deal with the penalty
Damn
Ooo, ooo, ooo, yeah

No more waiting when we , don't follow
So much change over weeks of your horrors
Peel back the layers and then
We're finally free
And we are headed into the stars
And we are never looking backI can never read minds
I can tell what's 'gone be
Looking in your eyes, I can tell you 'gone see
Things you desire, you can settle off greed
But it doesn't really matter to me
Uh, I'm feelin' good

How you feelin'
How you livin', bro I'm livin' good

These hoes say I made it, that just mean I'm up
Got an old school Chevy with a styrofoam cup
Got a mouth full of gold, got a pocket full of hoes
Got a closet full of clothes, rocky my jewelry with no stones
I be gettin' gold, I be, I be, gettin' throwed
I be sippin' 'till I'm old, I be pourin' 'till I'm floored
Tell these bitches "hit the floor"
Take of the panty, give me them clothes
Bitches know they only hoes, X and O's they couldn't 
Queen-ass nigga, pretty, pretty, motherfucker
Pop that fucking pussy, show it, show it, to these motherfuckers
When the fat lady sings that means the show's over
So I'm leanin' 'till I'm fallin' over, uhhPsychedelics heal my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
A garage is a arcade
Two whips in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it
Concentrate, say it, creep up into my space for it
Now I drip sauce like dry steak
Lookin' at a nigga sideways
Can't read 'em like my car plates
Car speed like my heart rate
Know I seem kinda irate
I just wanna see with my eyes straight
Got a blind date with a bad bitch from a dark place
On the highway to Hell in a i8 on the I-98
Never mind what they say
It's only all about what I think
They say drugs kill the brain cells
Guess I'ma boost the crime rate
Guess I gotta take time, fine
If I make mistake
I guess I gotta find the peace of mind like the last track on my tape
Psychedelics help my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
Turn my garage to a arcade
Got two cars in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it
Might board a private jet, aight, bet
Better yet, I'd rather fly commercial
Save a lot of money, less time, but patience is a virtue
Why you buy those new LVs from Virgil?
Boy, them pockets gonna hurt you
Why you so good to a ho, don't deserve you
The nerve, the nerve of you
No purple lean, just purple weed, shit got me on turtle
Homie sniffed a new eight ball, he evolved like Squirtle
Mix the pink with the Pikachu, if I sneeze, better say bless you
Don't picture me, just pinch of greens, psychedelic drugs in my vessel
Psychedelics help my brain
Marijuana for the migraine
Both hands to the wood grain
Drip candy paint and octane
On the black tar on the highway
Turn my garage to a arcade
Got two cars in the driveway
If I cop more gotta find space for it
Need a IV, eyes burnin' like chlorine
Body like morphine, sip more lean, true story
Nigga, don't eat so he more lean
But codeine make you slump like a dope fiend, leanin'
Sweet dreams, now you fall asleep
Man, since you had the Sandman singin'
Molly dick, so I can't nut
Popped a Molly so I can't cum
X pill make the sex real
Adderall make my dick numb

I'm the king of the underground they call me A$AP Rocky baby
Let's do it! Oh we 'bout to spit for real
I be that trill kid, that pretty mother fucka you know
Worry about who hot, talk about who hotter
Harlem globetrotter, his shirt stay Margia
Black harry potter, couldn't get with me like your father
Green coop looking like guava
Couldn't get with me, look its Spike Lee on the scene
And I'm balling out of my league
Camoflauge on cause I came up fly guys
So I do dirty money, hand sanitize fries
What's that you eating? Throw some salt on it
You know they like pigs throw the pork on it
And I see them in the road throw a fork on it
And I, rest in peace throw the corpse on it
I can floss on it word to ?
And I stick them in the gutter and I get at your lil brother
Never start a ? coming at your mother
And you know me and A$AP we gon' just ride for each other
What's up?
Like a goblin, tell them keep slobbin' on my knobbin'
I don't give a damn because I'm mobbin'
With my crew came down to London town, shut it down
Give me the crown I got the sound, whatever
I come through with the lever and I hit you with the mother effer
?
And you know I'm like a marksman with the Glock 10 and I put it to your cartman
And I bring it to your door, give it to you raw
ODB, shimmy shimmy shimmy ya ooh!
And my hat say "calm the f down"
Came to London town, came to shut it down
This is off of the tippity top and the dome and I'm comin'

Got these niggas singing it oh!
No curses on the verses whats worse?
Put them in the hurst, bad bitch red skirt
You know that she flirt, I'm smoking on that purp
And I like that purple drank, I would put you in the dirt
Never talk never chirp, use a bird
Don't want it with me kick them chickens to the curb
Girls got nerve and the fiends got served
And you know the D's on me cause the D's got served, word? Ok
This is off of the top and
A$AP Rocky came off of the block
Bandana around my neck, money signs on the grinding
You already know Harlem world we shining
I day dream pretty women out in Beijing
Paris say ling hop up in the saline
I chase dreams, man white but the face green
Same thing everyday, everything green
F my reply, ? through the statements
Help me with my statements, I was saving in my savings
From a three bedroom shack I was raised in, the condos out in Jersey full of J. West paintings
Talk to the boy how you talk the lord, talk to these broads how I talk to my dog
? plates, Margiella rugs, my boys make smores out you marshmallow thugs
Hop up out of first class, hop into that E-Class
Cut raw cut school I ain't ever see class
If so I was cutting in my nigga Steve's class
School of hard knocks graduated with a G Pass
G Code, Street Code, Fake niggas, cheat codes
Niggas trying to turn fake shit green cheap gold
I don't know how they do it for the freak shows
But I ain't gonna be smoked, so we toast
A$AP, A$AP
Yo we could do this all day alright?
Yo I could do it all day I could keep going man
Let me know whats up
Keep doing your thing!
Yo I'm on to the next-ist, you looking at the bestest
Married to the game treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in the Porsche, niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules but my status like the author
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Probably getting brains, chilling in my penthouse
Slackin' on your mackin' and I'm bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louis Vuitton red bottoms come in mens now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fitted
Pull up to these shows and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
Little do she know I got a big ego
On the next and gotta order a protection
Killin' feelin' all these records so my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons so these rappers feeling threatened
They the hip hop patron, I'm a hip hop felonUh, yeah
I was just a youngin' with nothin' and doin' nothin'
Pocket full of buttons and hopefully you niggas push 'em
Banana clips are my Republic, while we on the subject
Wrote this with my feet up on the table, I was on my tushie
Hopin' they swim with toughin' 'cause most of you niggas cushion
High school was where they flunked 'em, I was failin' every subject
My favorite class was bathroom, the hallway and lunch, gym
The skeletons in my closet, no Indians in my cupboard
Only time it was YMCA was when we was hoopin'
See a baddie with some Prada and baby heads, we was cuffin'
Fuck it, appreciate the pretty things, but shit is rugged
Came into the world with nothin', best to leave with somethin'
Fuck it
Ooh, uh, uh
Moves, make your moves, uh
Ooh, uh, uh
The game is all, uh
Ooh, uh, uh
The game is all-
She was just a youngin', the beginning days of lovin'
Before she desired clubbin', nails and designer luggage
Before the extra baggage, shortie would travel with no one
She was posted up with moneys, but cellphones came with the buttons
You don't wanna pick up my call, bitch?
You send me to voicemail, bitch?
Where the fuck you at, bitch?
I pay the motherfuckin' rent, bitch
Where the fuck you at, bitch?
I love you baby, please call me back
Her mama boost and smuggle, her daddy knew how to hustle
This shit is like a circus, either die or learn to juggle
The concrete jungle, every day was a struggle
Weave down to her navel so they call that ho Rapunzel
Name plane, Erin, name plate on her buckle
Name tatted on her arm, fluctuate from muscle
Fast forward to all the troubles, who knew the future would crumble
Just a kid blowin' bubbles, man look at what the world has come to
Got to fuck on random tricks, when she don't want to
Got to suck on random dick, hopin' that he comes soon, damnWayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride
Double cupped up, jeans with the cuts
Bottom double cuffed up
Lookin' for a model who I can cuff up
I wonder if those Bronx bitches let me holler
A bunch of strippers or beauticians from the beauty parlor
A couple scammers boostin' Prada, Dolce and Gabbana
I'm finna squad up, hit the mob, and call up all my partners
I die my young bull, it was Young Lord, seven knocker
I might head to hoop, rather party next to Yonkers
Real money cool with all the hoes, G shit, be shit
Crip niggas came with these snips
I go, detour, snuck the heat in
It was ladies' nights uptown on the weekend
So they drink for free
Think of G when you think of me
Niggas play pimpin', I ain't into make believe
Syrup sippin' way before the make believe
Bitches in the place to be
I wonder where to take to make 'em shake for me
I'm a motherfuckin' G
A-dollar sign, A-dollar-A-P, uh
Hunnid gold teeth and a hunnid gold teeth
I was young, and I was hung
And I was runnin' in the streets, that's G
Meet my motherfuckin' peeps
Wake up in the morning, brush my fuckin' teeth, go freeze
Before the other niggas throw sleeves
Nigga run the streets we don't run from police
That's G
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas ride
Wayside, on the east side, got my hands tied
No time to be inside wasting my time
We'll slide into nighttime when my niggas rideYo, bro, I'ma come clean, bro

Nigga, I ain't have a heads-up myself, my God!
You gone put me under the bus while the bus still moving
You gone put me under the bus while the bus still moving
How you gon' stop the beat when my raps still grooving?

Hows you gon' choose and you ain't no chooser?
How you gon' be snoozin' and you sleepin', bruisin'?
I'm just going in my Jeep, Jeep is cruisin'
I just doze off to sleep, countin' the sheep
Going off to sleep and I be countin' my Zs
All I need to sleep is my beauty rest
Tell that chick that her coochie stretched
All this time I do be blessed
And I deliver like I'm UPS
How y'all know about the boy
Hit 'em with the emergency, need the vitamin C
All these other girls want my vitamin D
In spite of my teeth, I'm smiling so clean
Like how I gleam, she like how I seem
Tell her that, man she can have a nice dream
A wet dream, a sex scene, we sexing
And detexing, caressing
Her best friend want the same thing but I just curved it
Fuck it, y'all niggas be smoking on that sherbert
You don't wanna admit I'm cleaner than detergent
Yes, straight like I left the permit
All my semen started swerming
To her eggs, between her legs
She in the daze, going crazy
I'mma come clean I can't-
I can't, I can't, don't look at me, I swear to God I can't do it
Yes you can
Not like that
You just had a scare, so you just gotta relax a lil' bit
Nah bruh, I could never
He had a scare you a lil' tramatized still

If you like, bro if you fall you gon' get right back up we got you
Oh I like that
It's time for me to go
It's time for me I know
It's time for me to
It's time for me to go
He said this a smash, I said this a pass

Better get in a cab
Take an LSD, I'm sipping a tabSittin' in the mornin' sun
I'll be sittin' when the evenin' comes
Watching the ships roll in
And I watch 'em roll away again, oh
Just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Watching the tides roll away
Ooh, I'm just sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
I left my home in Harlem
Headed for the 'Frisco bay
'Cause I got nothing to live for
Looks like nothin's gonna come my way
So I'm just gonna sit on the dock of the bay
Watching the tides roll away
Ooh, I'm sittin' on the dock of the bay
Wastin' time
Look like nothing's gon' change
Everything remains the same
I can't do what ten people tell me to do
So I guess I'll remain the same, yes
Sittin' here resting my bones
And this loneliness won't leave me alone
It's two thousand miles I roamed
Just to make this dock my home
So I'm just gonna sit at the dock of the bay
Watching the tide roll away
Ooh-wee, sittin' on the dock of the bay

Back when the music was the singles

Kept the dope fiends itchin' like it's ringworms
Baskin', married to the game without a ring, though
You was precious to me, I was Smeegle, goddamn
Fast forward, you was everything, I was livin' for
Only thing soft was your chest, I was restin' on
Through them rough nights, love is what I did it for
Did you wrong, back then I couldn't do nothin' right, goddamn
I'll admit it, you the reason that I'm in it
Be the reason you be queefin' while I'm in it long
Take a minute, 'cause you're grievin' hard 
When the liquor bleedin' through your pores
Sleepin' on the floors, damn it, Jim Morrison doors
Starin' at the ceilings and the posters on the walls
So outgoing but we was indoors

Turf's gon' help me get wealthy

'Cause they love how I do it
I ain’t never been no faggot
And I gotta habit, tat off this habit
That I do and I get lettuce like cabbage
You talk about me, you up in my passing
And I got gliss on, you can call it carriage
You look embarrassed, tell me what your name is
Blat, blat, now a motherfucker famous
I ain’t change shit, leave you brainless
With this stainless
I’m on the same shit, that gang bang shit
Niggas who I hang with, is my crew
And I do, do the do, what it do
Chilling with Raheem, and I come through, with the high beam
And I’m sitting on that lean, and I got two bad bitches
But you can call them Siamese
Niggas know my name, niggas know the name
A$AP, Ant tell them what it is mane
I said flow like the ocean, sour weed potent
White girl actress, we fucking on Saturn
Henny got me blacking
Roller bands stunting, billboard fronting
Free clothes for nothing
Fire plate orange car glowing like a pumpkin
Low behind wheel, bucket hats hell
See you hundred horses, do it for the pleasure
Higher than a feather, coke that I measure
Put it on your tongue, it get no better
Flying over dodgers, chilling with the lowers
African soul, black diamonds boy
Got it from the source, be by the cake
I’m a boss, never take a loss
Who shot them, red dot them
If I spot them, Raheem Duvaughn
You can call em Raheem dot them
'Cause he hit them with the beam not mean
Sitting on the top, looking at the top
Of the throne, better watch it
Keep your hand out my pocket, your crew
And you say I chew, so I bless you
And I got a new flow
You could call it special
And I might hit you with the TEC, TEC-2
And I got a bad bitch, who I sent a text to
Niggas know my name, it be rocky
And I’m flacko man, so call me papi
And Versace or Givenchy, I’m a fly nigga, GG watch me
On Vogue and I did it in shows
And I’m a fly nigga, might step out in a robe
Niggas know how I come through like Hov
Like B.I.G and I see y’all on that DVD
I’m on MTV, 'cause I’m sucker free
And you know your bad bitch she be sucking me
Nigga, wassupWe took it from a Lamborghini to a dressing room
We took it from the dressing room to her mama room
I get deep in the box, I didn't even set the moods
Call it California cuddling, California cuddling
I told the baby not to worry, I’ma cop her some new boobs
Stay in your jurisdiction, I bring everything to you
I told her not to worry, I'm no nigga without a clue
Pay her little sister tuition, she don't need no night school
She don’t need no night school
Mmmm, hey, hey, hey
She hotter than soup
Hotter than Loubs, higher than Coogi suits
Uh, wheeze
They ain't even my speed
Flexin' on these niggas got me throwin' on my tee
Got me jumpin' in my crowd
Got me throwin' up money
Got me goin' in my golds
Got me showin' off my teeth, like
Black privilege gotta mean somethin’, uh
Dark liquor for the weak stomach, uh
White styrofoam cup with lean on it
Pull up microphone out, let her sing on it
Aggressions, comparisons
To fake knees is embarrassing
Give ’em classic, if it matters, I'm embarrassed
I think about a state of mind and how my state is more passive
Few milli’ spend on bad habits
Other half on taxes

When this someone spoke I listened, yeah
All of a sudden has less and less to say, alright
Oh, how could this be?
All this time, I lived vicariously
I can't sing for shit
Who's gonna save my soul now?
Who's gonna save my soul now?
I wonder if I live to grow old, now
Getting high 'cause I feel so low down
Lemme freestyle
It made me feel like somebody
Like somebody else, yeah
Although we was imitated often, yeah
Felt like I was being myself
Oh, how could this be?
All of this time, I had to keep this shit G
Pardon my language, I'm sorry, y'all
Who's gonna save my dro now?
Who's gonna blaze my smoke now?
I wonder if I'll be pretty forever, ya'll, oh, shit
Feeling high now I feel so low, now
I need the marijuana, where the trees? Leave the trees
You're chillin' in the Live Lounge and you with me
A-S-A-P, got a hat to the back
And it's white 'cause I got a white collar shirt to match
Got a blue trench, chickens on my uh
Never gave a uh 'cause the clock won't tick
If my --- don't stick, all up in your chicken
Everybody know me, I'm here, take your flicks and
And I love the UK, shoot at your toupee
Riding round, Chicago like Lupe
And it's a Fiasco, your man is an asshole
And I could get busy, but they dizzy like Rascal
And this is off the top, when I'm chillin' in the Live Lounge
You already know, A$AP in the spot now
I gotta come, shut it down, up in Londontown
I need to beat to loop, man, I need another round
Oh, how could this be?
Yeah, I feel like a whiner when I'm singin'
I live vicariously
Ya'll ready?
Who's gonna save my hoes now? Haha

I wonder if I live to grow old, now
They say I move fast, so I gotta slow down
I hope ya'll liked that right there, manIt's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Purple kisses on your neck, thinking 'bout the day we met
Body dripping sweat, eat that, beat that pussy wet
Purple silhouettes, purple drank and cigarettes
She is my addiction, nigga need a Nicorette
Trill-ass misses, fuck her where a nigga rest
ASAP tat cause that's what a nigga rep
Style fresh to death, show you bitches how to flaunt
And the Yves St. Laurent, or her Isabel Marant
Like when Jay Z out, tryna take B out
All these magazines try to play me out
All my ex-girls tryna fade me out
By the ending I was finished, so it's crazy how
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
Okay wait, now hold up, let me switch that flow up
Call her to come over and you just try to control her
Ever since I growed up, I been got my dough up
Now I'm smoking more blunts and I'm sipping 'til I'm poured up
Tore up from the floor up, tore down from my toes up
Get throwed 'til I throw up, but I'm pimping like I'm 'sposed to
Got the illest chocha, reason why I chose her
Mami is a rider and see me I be that roller
She hate a rap nigga walking with his nose up
She date a rap nigga walking with his toaster
So take your picture, get your close-up
Another fake imitation, just a poser on a poster
I did it again for my culture
Went Tesla roadster, traded it in for a Rover
Just to get a nigga chauffeured
Driver pull over, tipping and picking these hoes up
I'm slipping from feeling this sober
Window is rolled up, this purple kissed on my shoulder
Undress and I sex and I hold her
Caressing her breast with my head on her chest I'm all on her
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love
It's so easy to fall in love call the Holocaust
Jumpin' off and I'm off the drop
Pop a hole, I'm the reigning champion by the court
Still might find me in a moshpit and I still ain't even…
Ayy, make the place look like a moshpit
Ayy, ayy, mazzaleen 
When I'm pullin' up, money dungarees
Ayy, make the place look like a murder scene
Ayy, when I make moves I'm a money fiend
Ayy, make the place look like a murder scene
Ayy, when I make moves I'm a money fiend
Eyelids, body shaped like a goddess
Popeye with the spinach, pop a molly 'til she 
Drop a dollar up, damn, plus the Lyrics from Snippet
Comin' with the crocodile seats
TVs or rappin' 'round screens
Fear or respect, how you act around me
If I'm here in the flesh why you asking 'bout me?
Chains so big, make me tuck your shit
Bitch so thick, make me touch your shit
Go fuck yourself while you at it, fuck nigga
Been had it, let's get this shit crackin'
Now I'm back like I never left
Yeah, niggas thought I was away, how I could do that?
I'm the wave, I thought you knew that
I'mma be paid till my braids got greyYeah, last track on the mixtape
'Preciate everybody listening, you know what I'm talkin' bout?
And we'll see you on the next one, you know what I'm talkin bout?
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can cry me a river or cry me a ocean
Maybe the Pacific, that's just to be specific
I gotta keep it pimping these hoes they say I'm tripping
I don't care about your nails and your new hair, do your lipstick
Dip-dip next ho, they be on my dick like
All on my testicles, I can't even piss right
After we fuck you won't see me again after this night
Real niggas know what I mean
'Cause I go, I go all around the world
Fuck different girls, cause when they see ya boy
They scream and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
'Cause I know, I know there's the perfect girl
Who I can share my soul with but I can only see
In my dreams and as sad as it seems
It doesn't really matter to me
Don't cry dry your eyes call me a jerk
Not cause the size of my jeans but how I hurt ya
I know this relationship is never gonna work
But I plant thoughts in your head that only do ya dirt
And I said this once before, we make the perfect team
We barely get along forever making scenes
Your crying on my sleeve what does it really mean
It doesn't really matter to me
Now you can go go where you want front who the one gotta get that vibe
Did I hit that? Quit that? How did I hit that? Niggas know how I keep it live
Live try this suprised but she just say I'm on her eyes
Whenever get it in that Prada or Del Agua
Now I be the man Peter Pan, I fly high cause you like my drift
She know how I do it cause I got possess and I'm so swift
Get her girlfriend in this whirlwind how we spin
It don't really matter cause I'm pimping bitch until the endSee that black man, say peace
Leave that black man, say peace
All I'm tryna say is in the streets
Keep the peace, man, I keep the peace
If I gotta pray God, would you?
Different color jewelry look like different flavor color popsicle, uh
Summertime, like Slim Jim, hot pickle
I'm hot nigga, uh
Potato chips is five nickels
Same for the sunflower seeds
Promotin' love, bro, power, peace
All green, like the Garden of Eve
Popping like a hot pot of grease
Overseas like I'm European
Hold my nuts like I gots to pee
Hold my waist like I got to peace
Gave her D, put her right to sleep
All my chains, they 'bout it 'bout it
Open up my mouth like doctor teeth You know, growin' up... I had this beat stuck in my head
Just no matter what I could never get it out
I guess when you're young, you can be anything you wanna choose
Hey kid you want an autograph?
Cool? Gimme down!
But as you get older all of those options start to narrow
And before you know it every choice you made comes with a consequence
And whenever shit got rough... this beat was always there
But one day man... it just stopped
My brother moved on but...
Beat came back, passing through every vein in my body
You know, my older brother Ricky
Is responsible for me growin' up and having a real job
Com'on Rocky! Just go for it! Just rap!
A$AP, A$AP, A$AP...!!!A$AP ROCKY FREESTYLE

        First off, shift off, get high, lift off
Sold models, look at the gold bottles, thought it was crystal
But after that I’m like chris cross
Jump, jump, got the funk, got it packed
From the back, to the front
What you want? Leave you slumpted
Know me, I’m a leaker, got the sneaker
See a diva, and she painting, for a feature
I don’t care, I carry pick wards, and you wanna mess
Hit you up, with the twizzer
Listen, jesus skizer, I be heating with a breezer
Never had to leave her, and I leave her at my leisure
I hit you with a twizzer, sorry gotta go, it was nice to meet you
Chill, ah hahahaha

I apologize
I'm apologetic
I apologize, yeah I'm sorry, I'm sorryI said I'm on to that next shit
You lookin' at the bestest
Married to the game
Treat you niggas like my step-kids
Pull up in that Porsche
Niggas feel nausea
Didn't write the rules, but my status like the arthur
Just crashed the Range, so I pulled the Bent out
Prolly gettin' brains, chillin' in my Penthouse
Slackin' on ya mackin', and I'm 'bout to lay my pimp down
Christian Louboutin, red bottom come in men's now
On to the next one, skinny jeans fit in
Pull up to these shows, and these hoes know to get in
Said they like my fitted clothes down to my split ends
But little do she know, I got a big ego
Automatic weapon, need to order a protection
Killing feelings on these records
So my charges is molesting
And assault with deadly weapons got these rappers feeling threatened
Ain't a hip hop veteran, I'm a hip hop felon
I need a crib by the mountains
Chest look house lit
Limbs get frostbit
Brand new outfits
If you less fortunate, you really ain't about shit
So much cribs, a nigga friends got to house sit
So much money, can't weigh it by the ounce shit
Weigh it by the pound shit, too much to count shit
Paparazzi taking pictures
Newspaper topics, magazines gossip
Villa in the tropics
Rockstar pop shit, made by toxic
Inside hot pink, outside gothic
Rag-top roof made of fishnet stockings
Black candy paint look fingernail polish
No one in this sight has swag like I do
Church with this verse, I'mma hit em with the gospel
Hit em with the rifle, I'm higher than the Eiffel Tower
Hustle harder, snow, sleet, showers
Age worry about who's hot and who's hotter
Like crabs in the barrel tryna pull you to the bottom
You get em, I got em
Point him out, I spot em
Red dot em, I shot em
I hide em, you find him
Roll to the club, and I order gold bottles
Shawty get low, but I'm no Flo-rida
And this 6-4 spokes like a lowrider
The coups so special, you could call it mo-rida
But I'm a known rider, and I'm a provider
Black on black Bent, fire like the Ghost Rider
Don't need a ghostwriter because my flow's tighter
Your careers nose diving, I'mma pull an allnighter
So hood rich, Hollywood bitch want me
Don't look hood but a hood bitch love me
Hood niggas hate Hollywood niggas hate me
Prolly why I never keep the burner off safety
You could never ugh, you should never try to play me
On a scale of one-to-ten, sick is what they rate me
No homo, but these labels wanna rape me
I tell em four words:
Fuck you. Pay meYou know these big mouth niggas don't know how to act
I got my West Coast connection
These dead-in-the-street industry muthafuckas
Talkin' 'bout ''We can't eat,''
Talkin' 'bout ''We brand new guys,''
Tell them niggas ''Suck a dick!''
I'm camo' down to my boxers
Gold teeth, a bathin' ape
Inner moves of my projects
Like monkeys, orangutan
Banana clip on that chopper
I hold heat, fingers bang
 better keep the peace
That little  brringading
I don't care if you glue
Or you red flaggin'
Hair swingin' my pants saggin'
Hoes all on my bandwagon
Your bitch gaggin' she jet laggin'
On my cuz nigga what's crackin'
On my blood niggas what's poppin'
I ain't set trippin' I just have no click-clackin'
You mismatchin' fuck swaggin' you been jackin'
Fuck fly I am fashion
Try'ina cop that Benz wagon
My bitch drive and my friend scratch it
Niggas threat with the chit-chat
See a nigga don't shit happen
I'm finna blow on that Bin Laden
So talk money, Pig Latin

No horseplay when we quick draw

They all collecting my residents

I leave you here bleeding in fetal position
Don't believe I can beat you
I see you in minute
Same generation but me and you ...Sending couches, and taking over bounces my nigga
Cuba with wilder as it get, swear paranas and shit
He a lame I took his bitch, looking like I flick my wrist
Don't feel like I wanna quit, don't look like I'll ever miss
Hit it once they not my switch, you just want the life I live
I just wrote a  smoking weed everyday
Know where I came from, straight from the birds nigga
Reppin my day ones spin it then say some
Hit it don't play none, engine got something in it
Enter my business I gotta run
Uh, as I lack off the yat Vincent Bach send 'em at
At my pack with your bitch, give my Jack hit me back
Off the lime, all the time, hit the lime mixed with Jin, off the Henn'
That's my slime, call the ones hit it 9 
Count the paper get it now I can do it later
Smoking out the roomies smell it from the elevator 
Want me to beat that pussy up? I now later
Want me to beat that pussy up like a drunk major?
Want me to beat that pussy? Looking so player
Say she ain't a basic bitch got a lot of layers
Shorty 5'6 braids with a baby hair's
Niggas be chilling at the Raf tryna make it fair
I'm throwing signs to my niggas, tryna make a play
Came out of nothing else, balling in the major way
You see me stunting out, never come inside the place
You see me even hella good now you wanna play
Bitch look like a French May, Porturican, different
On her knees but she don't stay, diamonds dancin' in the face
Got a couple questions, here's a fast one if you wanna race
Say that she can't deal with the whole thing, so she just wanna taste
I make them Tsunami waves, learn the perfect time and page
She gon' do what Simon says, put her legs behind her head
Let me head it on the bed, fuck me good but never said
Lot of cake at where I'm at, smoke a pound of never win
Niggas never gettin' out the place because it go down
Snorted up she a pro now, we've been fuckin' for a while so she can give the code now
If you niggas wasn't with me, then you ain't my bro now
Count the paper. get it now I can do it later
Smoking out the roomies, smell it from the elevator
Want me to beat that pussy up? I now later
Want me to beat that pussy up like a drunk major?
Want me to beat that pussy? Looking so player
Say she ain't a basic bitch got a lot of layers
Shorty 5'6 braids with a baby hair's

Energy undeniableLyrics from Snippet
Gang!
Gang!
Gang!
They talkin' down on my name
Don't let 'em run off with the name
Man I just run with the gang
A$AP boys came with the flame
Gang! Gang!
They talkin' down on the gang
They wanna rep with the name
But this ain't no regular name
Gang! Gang! They tryna run with the name
I might pull up with 3K
But I do not fuck with no Klans
Gang! Gang!
Them boys not flexin' the same
I'm done with adjustin' to fame
Pull up on your set, leave a stain
