Menoh
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need 
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend 
I got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green 
Shawty say she like my style, I be dripping with ease 
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased 
Say she got that super soaker, well, girl, just let me see 
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me 
I was destined for this life, it's in my destiny 
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most 
How you tell me you my bro, then you went out and told? 
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes 
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul 
I roll up the mary jane, no, they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping every day, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout, get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl, but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a pornstar, a rockstar
Tryna skrrt off in that fast car like NASCAR
Girl, you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart?
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki, yeah, she like it sloppy
Oh, you got a hottie body, come ride on my johnny
I'ma go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste?
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights, I'm flyin', no, you can't see me
Say you need me, but you deceive me
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need 
We get high to pass time, but bitch, I ain't no fiend 
I got money on my mind, I be stackin' my green 
Shawty say she like my style, I be dripping with ease 
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased 
Say she got that super soaker, well, girl, just let me see 
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me 
I was destined for this life, it's in my destiny 
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most 
How you tell me you my bro, then you went out and told? 
Niggas say they down to ride, but be folding like clothes 
Now purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul 
Said I ain't never forgotten not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rockstar
That blunt ash on the floor
Well, she ain't that far off
Said she ain't that far off
Roll, smoke
That's all we know, toke
Took a drag out that 'Wood, now she goin' for my wood
So we goin' to my hood, yeah, she gonna get it good
Yeah, she know who we are
She want this rockstar life, and she said I'm going far
And she off a bar
And she can't feel her face no more
Yeah, she off a bar, and she can't feel her face no more
She said she can't feel her face no moreCashMoneyAP
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so
Ayy, it's so lonely on the east side
I don't give a fuck, I keep it real, I'm not gon' let it slide
Now she see me up, she let me fuck, want me to cum inside
Broski going dumb, hopped in the car, he said he down to ride
You a little pup, stop playing tough, ain't make no sacrifice
Yeah, smokin' cookie for my appetite
I don't trust nobody, people talking and be telling lies
We just wanna win and shock them all and catch 'em by surprise
I was saucin' down until we up and then we all rise, yeah
But niggas don't stick to the G-code, balling on my haters
I think that I'm stuck in beast mode
Make it through the foul run to the line and make the free throw
I think that I'm D. Rose
Do 'em like I'm Deebo
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sin
Nowadays shit's not the same
Life switched lanes, now these hoes act strange
And I lost my grip on the world in bliss
It's so, it's so
I think it's so damn strange what these people be saying
I can never even listen to a word that they say
I'm on the west side, that's the best side
By the cliff smoking blicks, that's the best high
And I got a shawty with the best eyes
Talking shit girl, why you putting up a fight?
I'm in my own world, far from the satellites
They want my information, they get no conversation
'Cause nowadays everybody calling
I need a manager 'cause I can't really fuck with nobody 
Ayy, but I like to fade away
I got these diamonds on me, and these bitches all in my face
And you wanna be a star, and you wanna win the race
But you cannot rock with me 'cause I was caught on the chase
Nowadays I'm too cool for a girlfriend
Nowadays I don't know when the world spins
Live your life like we die when the world ends
So it's alright every time we fuckin' break a sinAyy, ayy, ayy
Get in my way and try to block me, I'ma show aggression
Slide on your block like Danny Glover with a lethal weapon
I fucked your thot, she gave me top, I guess that's my confession
Got no regrets, I made mistakes, but I learned from my lessons
Trappin' by the stu', villains pull up to the coupe
My car ain't got no roof, thought this shit was bulletproof
I can't feel my face, smokin' on Gorilla Glue
Zoomin' in the coupe, that's the shit I like to do
These is yellow diamonds, shinin' like I'm Pikachu
I'm a boss nigga, get that bag and make the moves
No, I don't like to lose, so I be goin' in, yeah

You tryna chase the life  well I'm tryna chase the bands, yeah
She wanna fuck with friends, yeah, I got 'em in the trance, yeah
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck
It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, I stack it up, can't get enough
Seen your shawty with you, she look at me and she blush
I'm a jiggy nigga, I don't take her out to lunch

It's a lot of lust, not a lot of love
Ayy, bitch, not a lot of love

Rollin' in the coupe and she was rollin' off the drugs
Lookin' for the one, girl, you know that I'm the plug
I be booted up with my shooters in the truck
Ayy, and broski keep it and it's tucked
Nigga talkin' 'bout it, but he never runnin' up
Put this shit in motion, so I'm never stayin' stuck
Don't be actin' starstruck every time they show you love
Ayy, but now they tell me I switched up
Take this Backwood to the face, then grab my cup
Shawty say she comin' through, she on the way to fuck

Fuck that, we gettin' loose
Pussy sweeter than some juice 
I slurp it like it's soup
Ayy, she a naughty type on the weekend
Perfect night, she gon' let me start to creep in
Baby goin' offense, I'm playin' defense
You on top, I swear that's the perfect sequence, ooh
Why you like to lie, shawty, you know you impressed
See you fuckin' with me now 'cause I bossed up, and I flex
All they liked to do was talk, when I knew that I was next
I just come up with these hits and lay low, collect my checks
She fuck with solid niggas 
She don't be fuckin' with broke boys, I ran it up, that was my choice
She call me up when she need pipe, my girl ain't playin' with no toys
Watch my back, niggas lurkin', my girl look better in person
And she still picture perfect, ooh, dip and dash when we swervin'
Oh me, oh my 
Put my hand on your thighs 
If I come through tonight 
I'll make you touch the sky

Hold my wrist up out the coupe, two bitches switch-a-roo
That pussy good, I'm blamin' you, you drippin', shame on you
She got real water , head real smarter 
Think that bitch from Florida , you probably can't afford her 
Bentley truck might park the coupe , I'm livin' comfortable
Told money then I'm stuck with you, no, I'm in love with you
Plug pull up in the UFO, no small talk, I'm the CEO
My bitches is bad, they do the most
She way too foreign, straight off the boat
I put her on top, she leakin', she leakin'
Turn to a freak on the weekend, the weekend
Blame on me, no, shame on you, girl, you can't hide the truth
I might get a 'Rari coupe, but just to flex on you
Blame on me, no, shame on you

I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose
Long nights I sold drugs just to hit the studio
Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo
Shawty wanna fuck me 'cause a nigga wearin' gold
I came up and made it happen, I was trappin' by the store
Big dope inside this Backwood case this nigga want smoke
Do me dirty, I'ma find you, lay your ass out on the floor
19 with a bag, I got rich by myself
Rather do this shit alone, I wasn't askin' for no help
They keep askin' how I'm winnin' with the cards that I was dealt
Boy, I worked hard for this seat and I ain't bucklin' my belt
Call my brother on the phone, he said, "Broski, you a star"
I said, "Brother, hold it down soon we'll all be livin' large"
And it's crazy how last year was sellin' coke out my garage
Now I'm in a good position for this life, can't sabotage
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole

Now I'm eatin' steak and shrimp, bitch, I ain't eatin' sloppy joe
Look into the mirror, flex, and now a nigga in his glow
Bust off like a Smith & Wesson, welcome to the rodeo
I got tattoos on my face, I use that shit as motivation
I could never get a job, so for my dream, I'm dedicated
For a second lost myself, I was too busy gettin' faded
Now they see me out in public and be knowin' what my name is
All these rappers want the clout and the life of bein' famous
I just wanna be stable, tell my family we made it
I was comin' for my spot, a young nigga had to be patient
Now I'm runnin' up these bands, can hit the island for vacation
I've been shittin' on my haters, you could say I'm constipated
Five racks on this fit just to stunt while I'm in Vegas
Gnarcotic on my body, shout out to my nigga Caleb
Young niggas got the cake up, now these bitches wanna date us
I ain't foldin' under pressure, I ain't switchin' for no ho
I ain't talkin' to no cop and I ain't tellin' on my bros
Ain't no killer, but don't push me, fingers itchin' on that pole
Niggas plottin' on my come-up, gotta watch, they on my nose

Danny, I see you

I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind, I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm an ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push to start
Climb right in, let me break your heart
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober
Still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders
Comin' out bolder

She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, no horoscope, I-I-I
I don't want the fame
I don't want to play these games
Tired of hiding from the pain
Never hanging with the lames, I
I'm not the one for the stupid shit
We shot a scene on some movie shit
And she came right through on some groupie shit
Be surprised how they act when they know you lit
I don't wanna get close
I haven't been the same since I loved that ho
I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
And I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't

Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Duck from the flashin' lights, watch out when the tide comin'
All these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really tell me somethin', ayy
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'
Take a sip out the double cup, can't tell me nothin'
I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'
Rollin' cookie in L.A., I think I found my bae
She roll my weed, so she gonna be hard to replace
We takin' shots of that Henny, I don't need a chase
Almost forgot where I'm at, can barely feel my face
Rockstar lifestyle, might just die tonight
If I was down and had nobody, would you sacrifice?
They said loose ends break friends, I ain't tryna fight
Fuck bein' sober, girl, come over and enjoy the high
So don't fuck up the vibe, don't ever waste my time
And when I'm feelin' down, will you come stay the night?
And if you far away, then will you book a flight?
My neck flooded with ice, she grip it like a vice
Can't ever play it nice, the world so full of lies
And I'm not bein' them, 'cause I'm just not that guy
You wanna be somebody, so put aside your pride
So open up your eyes, they talkin' from outside
Ayy, girl, never lie to me
Girl would you ride for me? Pull up on the side for me
Duck from the flashin' lights, and watch out when the tide comin'
I know it's hard to be yourself when all these people judgin'

I know it's all for the better and I'm never stuntin'
I just want a girl who gon' really show me somethin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'
Give you the time of your life if you would stop frontin'

Why you frontin' on me, shawty, better stop the bluffin'
You better stop the bluffin', I really know you want it
You push that thing up on me, so I'ma jump up on it

You want the cars and the purses, baby girl, tell me is it worth it
I'm in a spaceship, get ready for takeoff
Can't fuck with lil' shorty, I know that she basic
She makin' my dick soft, these niggas hatin'
Said I wouldn't make it, I shine with a new floss
I got his girl in a room gettin' naked, she fuck with a real boss
When my gang walk in it's lit , legit 
Give her the D then she dismissed , no kiss 
You test me then you getting hit , lil' bitch 
I take my shot and I don't miss , my diamonds piss 
And girl, that's funny 'cause I know you
You just come around and make a name

Don't you? Don't you? I know you
Look, she want the money and the fame, told her you gotta go
I ain't gon' give your ass a thing, she want a pot of gold
Back when I was young I had a lot of hoes
I'm talkin' back before I got this dough, now I see how they rockin'
I know how you roll now, ain't no need for talkin'
That shit gettin' old now, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these goals down, left me with no option
But to keep knockin' these hoes down 
Gucci down to the socks , that's a beach boy, baby
Pull up to the party, shawty all up on me, now she wanna date me
Said she wanna have my baby
I ain't know that was your lady, oh no
I've been workin' off the clock for this shit, did a lot for this shit

Girl, don't you? Out here fuckin' with all of them lames
Don't you? Don't you? I know youYeah 
Yeah 
Yeah
I don't think I love you, my emotions aren't the same
I'd rather be alone than go hangout with some lames
It's funny how they judge you when they see you made a change
I poured another four just to take away the pain
My friends weren't my friends, they was lookin' for some clout
I had what they wanted so they always came around
You told me you would be there but you never held it down
I'm out here bein' loyal, now I'm lookin' like a clown
I popped another Addy, now my heart is speedin' up
And I don't wanna love you, shorty, I just wanna fuck
Got angels on my shoulders, I got demons in my cup
I'm hardly ever out because it's hard for me to trust
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here
But I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
I can't do no fake friends, I can't do no fake hoes
I can't do no fake bros, I just need the pesos
Roll a blunt and relax, ease your mind 
I'ma be here for a while, take your time 
Lock the doors, spill your heart, never lie 
And they talk about me now 'cause I'm that guy 
They say I needed help but I did this by myself 
Smokin' all the time, hardly thinkin' 'bout my health
I just been alone, I'm not thinkin' that it helps
They threw me in a fire and expected me to melt
I came out a warrior, I had to make it last
I'm not the type to worry 'bout a problem in the past
And I just keep on movin' knowin' that I made this path
These bitches say they love you but will switch up for some cash
I put myself in college, I was taught that that was right
Well, now I'm 18 and I see that's not my life
I'm under too much pressure, feel like I can't take advice
You only live once, fuck the rules, I'm takin' flight
My niggas in the cage, free 'em out, fuck the law
I swear when they get out, on my life, we gonna ball
You wanna be a great, be yourself, fuck them all
Explain myself too much, now I'm feelin' lockjaw
Runnin' through my cellphone, jottin' down these notes
I remember times when they thought I was a joke
The people that surround me acted like they cared
They see I'm doin' good now, wish that they was here
But I can't do no fake friends 
No, I can't do no fake friends 
No, I can't do no fake hoes 
No, I can't do no fake bros 
I just need the pesos Ayy, ayy, yuh, yuh, yuh
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy
Getting money, I'm gone on a chase
Fuck a ho, I be stacking my cake
I'm no hero, they gave me the cape
First place when I finish the race
In her room and she giving me face
When I nut, she gon' give me my space
You a lame so you cannot relate
Hittin' licks, had to hide from the jakes
Crack the code, then I open the safe
Get my money, then go out the way
Charged up, I feel like triple-A
Think she loyal, I'm fucking your bae
Let 'em talk, I don't care what they say
Niggas pussy, be riding my wave
Ain't my nigga, then get off the stage
Kick that boy in his shit, Johnny Cage
Pom-pom ass nigga
Ol' Uncle Tom ass niggas
Boy, I don't wanna take a picture
All these niggas talking all on Twitter
Talkin' 'bout pulling up with hitters
You a goofy, just look at your image
I'm in the game like a scrimmage
Stack it up, I can't let it diminish
Ayy, I sip the lean in the car
My shooter rock out like guitars
Take his girl and I'm breaking her heart
Me and Gabe, we be shining like stars
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the bars
I think I landed on Mars
They be hating cause we living large
Ayy, why you hating on me?
It is so easy to see
Showing signs of jealousy
And I know it's not meant to be
'Cause you turned to a memory
And you said you was down to ride
But now you're my enemy
Ayy, and now you're my enemy
You said you was down to ride

But these niggas pressed on me
And they tryna copy the swag
But they cannot get it from me
In the kitchen with recipes
Money long like a centipede

So, I sit back and watch, pray I see another day
Got Gucci with Supreme, shawty different in her way
Rock Chanel all the time, we go shoppin' in the Bay
East side in PA, they ain't loyal where I stay
So I'm out here layin' low, dodgin' vibes that I don't need

Thumbin' through this cash, yeah, flexin' on my ex
And I can't get no rest, nah, I'm tryna be my best
I'm a monster in the flesh, think she want me 'cause I'm next
And I don't worry 'bout her moves 'cause she know I ain't pressed
Lately I've been stressed, press reset

And separate me from the fake ones
I'm poppin' off like a handgun
Cops askin' questions, we don't say none
Designer on my fuckin' body

Lil' shorty got hit with the real pipe 
Now she don't want you, we don't feel right

Money in my hands, spend it all then I replace it
She know I’m the man, why she in here gettin' naked?
My gang in the buildin', we came up from dirty basements
Nigga try to beef with us, we left him in the pavement
Take a puff and all my feelings go away, I'm painless
Opps want me dead, we gon' hit 'em with the stainless

Crack another blunt, now I’m higher than a spaceship

Smoke a ton of grams, I'm in love with bein' faded
Stand on top of everything I do, yes, I believe

I turned nothin' to somethin' it's crazy how it goes
From same clothes, to now I'm fuckin' the baddest hoes
From bein' lazy, to now I'm focusin' on my goals
From bad grades, to finally makin' honor roll
I made my mom proud it feels good
My chest hurts, guess I smoked too many backwoods
I'm tryna blow up do an interview with West wood
Until then I'm workin' hard because I know I should 
 It's okay, and it's alright 
I made my way and still I fight 
All the pain and all the lies 
I spread my wings and still I fly 
Tell my momma, yuh, tell her, yuh, no bad vibes 
Look, fuck your feature I don't need your clout
'Cause to be honest I'm the greatest thing comin' out
I work hard when I say it I don't have no doubts
I took chances when they told me we was in a drought
My little brother looks up to me, gotta be cautious
I brought the wave to you niggas, made you all nauseous
My dad got himself a girl, glad he doin' well
Remember six years ago when he went through hell
As times change and my little sister is growin' up
It hurts my heart knowin' that I'm not around as much
Remember when she was little, was playin' barbies with her
Perfect Kodak moment, I wish I could paint the picture
But life's short so I'm livin' mines day by day
I'm askin' God to look over me so that's why I pray
And people look at my tweets like is that really you
Actions speak louder than words and here's my fuckin' proof
 It's okay, and it's alright 
I spread my wings and still I fly

 No bad vibes

You not in my position, I work for this, I was chose
Sacrifices made me the man that I am
If I had to do it, I would go back and do it again
I got money, now they love me, be acting like they my friends
Fuck that shit, I block them out, I'm not letting them people in
Red eyes, layin' low behind the tint

Shawty used to be my main thing
Let her walk with me on the stage
Throw the water out, let it rage
Write my pain in every single page
If I knew you would've fucked me over
Then I never would've made my way
I can't stand when you lie to my face
Texting back, be like, "Give me my space"
All alone like I'm locked in a cage
Run it up 'cause I like to get paid
Moved on and you still throwin' shade
Back in the day, leave it back in the day
On to the future, I learned from mistakes
Playin' for keeps, I'm not playing it safe
But it's okay for now
If you try to take me down, I might have to take you out
All the time that I invested, I'll stick to this paper route
I'm up somewhere in the clouds, make it rain when it's a drought
I guess it's okay for now
Put my pride to the side, don't wanna let you down
Take my heart and crush it, leave it splattered on the ground

Yeah
Da-da-da one time, uh-huh
Woah, yeah listen
And lately I've been a mess
I really think that I’m depressed
You try to tell me not to worry
When you knowin' I be stressed
I looked on the bright side just to see you love me less
When I was down and had nobody
You was the only one I'd text, I know
It’s hard livin' life on your own
I'm on the road and I just gotta go
I'm really stuck in my zone
Workin' hard, barely keepin' control
Through this life, see it's highs and it's lows
You didn’t want me to grow
Everybody act like something I owe
That’s why I'm gone and I don’t want you to know
My location, I be chillin' by myself, I be stuck all alone
Tryna figure out where I went wrong
But I ain't do nothin' wrong
I put my feelings and my pain in these songs
When I die, I hope they all sing along
I ain’t do it for the fame, I just did it 'cause I had to be strong
Nobody was helpin' me or my mom
I had to blow like a bomb
I ain't really wanna go get a job
I had a plan that I could beat all the odds
I wasn't playin' my part
Too many people tried to fuck with my heart
That's why the rose still came up through the dark
You call me crazy, I'm smart
Bet some time I'm still up on the charts
How my music motivation, I look back at the start
How the whole situation really got me this far
Are we gon' shine forever? Will we go out stars?
That's the greatest, in the latest
This a drop top foreign, yeah a Mercedes
She said that she like my eyes, wanna have my baby
But shorty I can't have ties with you, my lady
I'm seein' things different, the vision gettin' clearer
I'm tired of havin' battles with the man in the mirror
I'm prayin' every night, tryna stay in good spirit
I'm only bein' me, I'm not tryna be different
Set a good example for the world and the children
They didn't let us in, now we runnin' the whole building
Haters see me win, now they mad and in their feelings
Age of 19 when I touched my first million
I can't explain to you how it feels
And they talk down on me and all my skills
They gon' throw shade on you when you real
Well, I mean
Just lately I've been a mess
I really think that I'm depressed
You try to tell me not to worry
When you knowin' I be stressed
I looked on the bright side just to see you love me less
When I was down and had nobody
You was the only one I'd text, I know
It's hard livin' life on your own
I'm on the road and I just gotta go
I'm really stuck in my zone
Workin' hard, barely keepin' control
Through this life, see it's highs and it's lows
You didn't want me to grow
So I just let you go

Okay, girl, let's put this thing in motion
She like the way I go in, I be in it like a Trojan
Back-to-back backshots got her eyes open
I'ma dive in it as if that thing was an ocean
Young nigga, but a grown man
I got my mind made up, follow my own plans
And I don't trust nobody so I don't shake hands
I had to cut fake friends so I could make bands 
If you ain't wit' me then you against me
Don't tell me you love me because you tipsy

They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares, somethin' that we run around

I'ma grab the chopper to let off a couple rounds
Nigga think he ready 'til he see what we about
You can miss me with that weak shit, ain't no talkin', ho, let's get right to it
Nigga thought I was a bitch and wasn't living all of my music
Get the bag and just ran through it, I don't care, I truly do this
Try to film me like I'm Truman, pay attention, I ain't stupid
We a long way from home, we still goin' up
Shorty came in with her man and she still tryna fuck
Like I don't care, I cop a foreign like a Ford truck
Still never sober, smokin' clover, come and try my luck
Never know why they hatin', tryna get the best of me
In the 'yo cookin' with a master recipe
Leave me with the rock and I'm scoring from the three
Overseas, smokin' weed, I can't feel a thing
They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares, somethin' that we run around
No, they cannot compare us when we come through, shut it down
They said I got next, nigga, I got now
I flooded my Patek, my wrist is bust down
Your circle full of squares, somethin' that we run around
No, they cannot compare us when we come through, shut it downI don't wanna get close

I haven't been the same since I lost my bro
I say I'm gonna change when I know I won't
I get high, I love to smoke
She gon' lie like I'm a joke
You wanna take flights across the coast
Remember those times, the horoscope
Life goes on, I can't take breaks
I need face, no, I need faith
In my mind I can't escape
I climb these heights like I'm a ape
Shine so bright in a world so dark
Break the bank, I'ma break the chart
Two door coupe, just push the start
Come right in, let me break your heart
I don't need no one, I don't need no one
I don't need no one
Still never sober, still never sober
Got the world on my shoulders

And I stay down even when them hoes don't show me love
That nigga flexing with no money guess he thought he was
I was driving down the street I had to meet the plug
I'm at the crib smoking pack 'cause I don't do the club
Let her roll my Backwood, she want the lavish life
I just bought a pint of lean so lemme grab a sprite
In the cloud with the stars like I'm taking flight
Up all night working hard tryna find the light
Lifes a gamble when its ready gotta roll the dice

Cops lock my brother up they tryna give him life

Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending

Tell me you got me but I know you just pretending
Waking up chasing money, it's a new day
These niggas fake I see right through them like its Blu-ray
And I ain't never paid attention to what people say
When you don't have it you gon get it so I made a way
In the field like a quarterback was making plays
Three seconds left I'm shooting I ain't fade away

Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise 
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah, yeah
I walk outside
I just caught the wave, seen attention in their eyes
Flying like an owl, I stay confident and wise
Smoking all the time just to hide my bad side
Mama said that she gon'-gon' pray for me, but I know how that goes
I spent too much time around fake niggas and fake hoes
I feel like time flies when your life's on a tightrope
I see my problems and think I got the antidote
And yes I'm still faded
I wish I could make it but I ruined my relations
People think I'm playing when I tell 'em I'm the greatest
So much on my mind, it's hard for me to even say it
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma gon' recieve, everything that I need, but my

Let my heart spill, I know you can hear my cries 
Demons in my eyes, seen them hiding in disguise 
Yeah, paranoia for my life, yeah, yeah
I'm counting all my blessings
Praying every second as I fall in deep depression
And lately I been gone, feeling like I'm second guessing
Everything I worked for, is that even in the question
And I know they act like they care but they all show fake love
I need to get high so point me to the plug
I need a strong buzz so give me the right drug
I feel like nobody and that I'm good enough, huff
I had to make some changes
Wake up every morning mad because I haven't made it
See my family stressin' out, I'm working hard to change it
Go and get the stainless, take a shot until I'm painless
'Cause I, wear my heart on my sleeve
Four grams in my leaf, blessed up like I sneezed
They don't know what I know and I know I believe
So I'ma gon' recieve, everything that I need, but my

Skies got his clout up, he finessed up out the check
On god I be grinding like I ain't got nothing left

And I smoke the loudest pack, think a nigga going deaf
Busting juggs, got my bread up just to make ends meet
Mama told me stay inside until I walked out in the street

I'm a man, I'll never lie to you, I come prepared
When it's time to ride, you know I'm there, and that's rare
Fuck what a nigga think, they can't flex like this
I know they jealous 'cause I stunt when I'm with my clique
More money, more ice, living life for the risk
Tell my brother that I got him, put him on 'cause I'm rich
I ain't running from my problems, I'ma face 'em, I promise
I get higher than the stars, while I'm watching the comets
Critics always on my dick, I'm never reading the comments
I got more money to get, no time to hate, I'm just honest
Twenty-five hundred what I spent to sleep in pajamas
Long nights in the streets, with the sharks and piranhas
Ever since I found a way, I try and solve all my problems
Grandaddy in his grave, I gave my heart to my Mama
Think I'm always to myself, so I avoid all the drama
Nigga say he was my mans but went and told on my partner
I can't trust you, niggas even switch for a dollar
I can't trust you, yeah
I remember when I said that I would ride for you, yeah, I was there
When I said that I would die for you, showed you I cared
I'm a man, I'll never lie to you, I come prepared
When it's time to ride, you know I'm there, and that's rare
Fuck what a nigga think, they can't flex like this
I know they jealous 'cause I stunt when I'm with my clique
More money, more ice, living life for the risk
Tell my brother that I got him, put him on 'cause I'm rich
Say you know me like we homies, I ain't passin' assists
I was broke and working hard, I wasn't stuck in the mix
I hop in the I8 like I was born to do tricks
Opps lookin' sideways like, "What the fuck he done did?"
Put my family on my back and give my all to my kid
Plenty times we had to struggle with no food in the fridge
All the times I had to hustle made me stronger and big
Sent my family on vacation just to laugh and live
Think I'm always to myself, so I avoid all the drama
Nigga say he was my mans but went and told on my partner
I can't trust you, niggas even switch for a dollar
I can't trust you, yeah

They'd rather see me broke but I'm thumbin' through a sack
They never show me love, I don't know how to react
So I always gotta keep my eyes open for the rats
I came up from the bottom, I ain't even gotta lie
I scream, fuck a job, I don't do no suit and ties
I'm always with the guys, rollin' dope, gettin' high
If a nigga think I'm lackin' then he's in for a surprise
Smokin' Pump 93, that's that fire flame
Shawty say she fuckin' with me, I don't know her name
Niggas beefin' over bitches, they some fuckin' lames
Shawty wanna take a picture wearin' all my chains
In Morgantown, hit the club, blowin' hella dubs
And I'ma turn his girl down if she ain't tryna fuck
And niggas hate but when they see me tryna dap me up
I got my brothers with me, they be on that savage stuff
Two pills in the hills with a foreign jawn
Shawty say she really love me but I know she don't
Countin' money, layin' low, the type of shit I'm on
She like the way I freak a beat and how I make a song
And I'ma always be that nigga, they don't understand it
Crash Bandicoot in the whip, I'm a bandit
Fuck her good, before she go she make me a sandwich
She call my phone like beat it up, I come and do the damage
Niggas talkin' like they know me, they don't really know me
I be ballin' left hand up, I hit the Ginobili
Twenty-four step back, they thought I was Kobe
I'm to myself, I can't trust you, you is not my homie
And every time I wake up I see some fuck shit
Check my phone, roll my dope, start the function
Nowadays everybody so reluctant
I can't blame you, got no time for that fuck shit
'Cause I remember back then, mobbin' on the low
We still hustle, we still grind, I ain't never goin' broke

Niggas foldin' under pressure, swear these rap niggas weak
I ain't changin' for nobody, when you switch you get deceased
And I ain't gotta flex, I got money in the stash
You say she hard to break, bro, I already smashed

The real gon' survive and the fake will never last
I pull up in that coupe, I'ma flex with your ho
I swear I'll never fold, on my brothers that's a no
We smoke it by the O, get the package for the low
Westwood with the flow, countin' up my C notes
Nigga, I'm the one in fact, I put my town on my back
They'd rather see me broke but I'm thumbin' through a sack
They never show me love, I don't know how to react

Eating steak and caviar
With a foreign bitch by the bar
Drop the top just to look at the stars

Don't come around and start playing your part
Look at my diamonds they shine in the dark
Labels keep calling they know I'ma spark

Lately I've been trippin, I've been going through some bullshit
I don't care if bitches leave me 'cause I always got my music
I remember when they'd judge me, used to say that I was stupid
Now these people say they love me, I just find it as amusement
We can go there
We don't think the same, we don't feel the same
I remember when they used to doubt my name
Sunny days, full of rain
Ain't no shame in my game, I'ma bring that pain, knock the beat out with some Novocaine
I just hit a left hook, God, why did you do that?
Always been a cool cat, I'm hanging with the Rugrats
My mom on some other shit, she don't seem happy now
I just wanna get this money so I can buy her a house
I don't know what I'ma do, I don't know where I'ma go
Too much hurt in my chest, I feel like I should let y'all know
When it comes down to this, I'm grindin' for my family
At the end of the day nobody's understanding me
Cigarettes and weed always seem like my remedy
When I'm down in my feelings they just always there for me
But I know it's killin' me, but it makes me feel alive
Never been the type of guy to feed into all the lies
I just want a hunnit mill, I just wanna live life
Stressin' out like every day, lately shit don't feel right
We could say it's all good, but I know it's all bad
I just wanna speak the truth, that's why I'm always in my bag
Used to gettin' no girls, yeah, that shit was so funny
Now I got a white girl, she my little snow-bunny
She my Lucky Charm, she would never split that pole on me
All these niggas switched up, went and sold they soul on me
I remember cold days, I remember dark nights
Say I'm movin' too fast, mix that lean with the Sprite
Searchin' for some paradise, in the field with my guys
We just tryna make it out, and we ain't comin' for the ties
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
I'm just out here grindin', I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas 'cause I know who we are
Mama told me, "Dream big", so I'm shooting for the stars
Fuck your opinions 'cause I know who we are, who we are, yeah
Look, I scream, "Fuck you and your speculation"
My dedication got me shining with no hesitation
I'm nobody yet, but I know it took some patience
Catch me writing music, focus on my education
People bashin' me, people steady harassin' me
I'm tryna be the best and they just wanna see a casualty
No picture perfect nigga, but I know I'm worth it, nigga
Thankful for a father figure, he just made me see it clearer
Damn, times change, and my friends too
All this shit I been through make me jump out a window
See the man in the mirror lookin' lost, I'm just tryna live life
Not worried about the cost, to me I'm my own boss
I hope you niggas get the message, I'm just speaking from my heart, I'm tired of all the regret
And used to wake up every morning
Get to yawning, get to stretchin'
Now I wake up every morning thanking god for all my blessings
Middle-fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
Middle-fingers in the air, no
Fingers in the air
Put your middle-fingers in the air
I'm just out here grindin', I just wanna make it far
I ain't worried 'bout them niggas 'cause I know who we are

Menoh

Now no rainy days 
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days 
It's gon' be a long ride if you comin' with me
I just threw two fingers up and did it for my city
I would never tell a lie, know these niggas play it 50
Park the coupe they hop inside, they know we 'bout to get it litty
Know we gotta get it one way, some way
I'm a superstar, get the fuck out my face
Who are you tryna put me back in my place?
I didn't come to conversate, I came to get my cake 
Keep my brothers by my side, they the only ones I trust
How you say you loyal when you left me in the dust?
I find it kinda funny how they sayin' I switched up
Keep a bag inside my bag, remember bein' broke as fuck
And we made it through them dark nights, it's no joke
I would give up everything before I let this go
You say you understand, but I don't think you really know
I ain't worried about opinions, only did this for my folks
And that's why
I made a way
Now no rainy days 
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days

I got people fuckin' with me just because a nigga lit
I know I had to do it like I'm Drizzy from the six
She wanna hop inside and have sex behind the tint
My doors are suicide, she didn't know how to get in
Everyday I be workin', learnin'
I live a dark life, it can be a burden
I don't got no time for these birds chirpin'
Talkin' but be silent when we out in person
And that's why
I made a way
Now no rainy days 
Now I made a way
Now no rainy days 
It's gon' be a long ride if you comin' with me

Don't be talking because niggas be police
They gon' judge me and act like they know me
But I know that these people be phony

They was laughing, I was never joking
Driving fast in the coupe and I'm going
Rolling OG and Kali and smokey, yeah

Cause all of these people be lying
And I see that shit as defiance
And this shit is not rocket science
I answer my haters with silence
Cause this shit could end up in violence
These niggas be talking and wildin'
Get this money and go buy an island
Mama told me she want all Italian
Ima' get and buy medallions
Never changing for money and wild shit
Never fold on my bros on the pilots
Swerving fast in the coupe, I got mileage

And I got ice all on my neck, feel like a chandelier
And when they see I drop a song their faces full of fear
And everybody thinks they know me but they not homies

And all these niggas claim they hard but sweet like creme brulee

And you can judge me call me ugly but my money fine

'Member when I used to hide the work inside a soda can
Cops pull me over, I ain't going, I ain't getting jammed
Stanley hitting licks just to get some money in his hand
Back on Garfield, I used to like those days
Hit the pool, fuck some hoes with my A.I. braids
Me and Cam fighting niggas, had our psycho ways
God had me in his plans 'cause my life done changed
I used to sit and think about how my ass could make a mil
I was working on the plan like, "fuck the critics and the deal"
Hate asking mom for money 'cause I know she got bills
So we started robbing niggas, but I didn't like to steal
Saw my uncle sell drugs, back then he was the plug
Everybody showed him love from the hood to the club
I used to think that shit was cool until he got locked up
And to me he was my idol, yeah, that shit fucked me up
My grandmother used to cry every time he had court
I used to hide behind the shed just to smoke a Newport
Stopped smoking cigarettes 'cause it was hard for me to breathe
Now I'm tearing down stages, making waves they believe
Fuck a trend, I don't need a friend, I just need a Benz
My loose ends knotted up, now they can't comprehend
Pray my shit stay afloat, but if not I'm gonna swim
I'ma ball on these niggas even if I'm wearing Timbs
And my mom go to work every night of her life
Her back fucked up, but, for us, she making it right
When it was dark and we ain't have it she still gave us the light
Smoking weed, hardly sober, but my future is bright
And I'm still making plays like I couldn't get a job
I ain't want no nine to five, tell me I'm my own boss
Fucked up my own bread so I had to take a loss
I ain't like these other niggas doing shit criss cross
Where I'm from it's hard to make it, but I know that I'ma make it out
Stay inside, stack my bread and figure out a safer route
Now these hoes wanna fuck me 'cause they see what I'm about
Tryna buy my moms a crib but you can sit and have your doubts
I got no time for the games, I got no time for you lames
I'm a soldier to this shit so I ain't fearing no pain
Had my head in the rain, no, we ain't feeling the same
I been working on myself, I feel I needed a change
I got shit to lose, but I ain't got shit to prove

They leechin', suck me dry, just like a parasite
I'm at the mountain view, they tryna reach my height
My trap phone jumpin', I don't need no satellite
We left the spot stankin', we had the club jumpin'
My pockets full of money, that bitch she wanna touch it
My brother really clutchin', he up it like it's nothin'
Let me make a phone call, Stanley come through, get to bussin'
It ain't no back and forth, we ain’t gon' argue with you
If it ain't 'bout the money, then nigga what's the issue?
Say you want war with us, then we unloadin' missiles
I ride or die beside my shit, I see it with a clear view
How you change on me? People lame and phony
I'ma go out like I'm Tony, nobody can come control me
Rockstar on my tomb, I be by my lonely
Zoom past, smokin' on some OG, word to my OG 
My car is red and my diamonds yellow
I shoot like I'm Melo, her booty like Jell-o 
You are not my mans, nigga, you're not my fellow
You askin' for favors, look at you like "Hell no" 
And my car is red and my diamonds yellow
I shoot like I'm Melo, her booty like Jell-o 
You are not my mans, nigga, you're not my fellow
You askin' for favors, look at you like "Hell no" 
We ahead in the race, I do the dash
Know these haters tryna take my place but they in last
Lil' shorty, thick up in the waist, I'm on her ass
Never settle down for second place, I'd rather pass
Suicide moshpit, I'm in the crowd with the fans
If my brother down bad, you know I'm throwin' him bands
He hit the trap, make it jump, with the pots and the pans
I know you rather see me broke but that's not part of the plan
I'm a grade-A nigga, I leave you where you stand
Never mind the bullshit, I never hear what they're sayin'
Mob ties with the fam, we ain't shakin' your hand
All we got, never flop, we rock out like a band
I put my team on with this, used to dream 'bout this shit
Manifest with my gift, they believe in my shit
Butterfly doors, you can't see in this whip
Feel like Trippie Redd, this life is a trip, bitch 
My car is red and my diamonds yellow
I shoot like I'm Melo, her booty like Jell-o 
You are not my mans, nigga, you're not my fellow
You askin' for favors, look at you like "Hell no" 
And my car is red and my diamonds yellow
I shoot like I'm Melo, her booty like Jell-o 
You are not my mans, nigga, you're not my fellow
You askin' for favors, look at you like "Hell no" I-I live my life like I'm Gucci
Rolling my drugs it's a movie
Unload the clip out the Uzi
She popped a Xan feelin' groovy
Show me her titties she motivated
I'm off this weed feelin' medicated
We took some time gettin' hella faded
Back in the day she was educated
Back in the day we go to the land
She Tinker Bell I'm her Peter Pan
I-I count the money, she roll my grams
She wanted sex cause she is a fan
Panties and bras on the ceiling fan
She gave me neck didn't use her hands
Backwoods and condoms stuffed in my pants
I know I got it cause I'm the man
Lately I know, I go to places that niggas can't go
I had a girl but that bitch she got old
I'm in my zone so please leave me alone
I got a buzz of the lean I feel slow
Niggas be talkin' I know they be broke
I hustle hard this the life that I chose
Girlfriends get boring and so do these hoes
If I am smoking it's straight out the O
Kush my cologne cause it's all in my clothes
If she a thot than she will be exposed
Kicked her ass out without wearing no clothes
I'm in the hills watchin' y'all from above
I hang with thugs and they all show me love
Ride for my niggas, I'll let off the slugs
And fuck everybody who killin' my buzz, you killin' my buzz
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky
I look at these niggas and tell them to stop me

I shine like a diamond I shoot like I'm tommy
My goons right behind me
I did that bitch grimy it was perfect timing
I'm lit like a lighter, my whole life a fire I fuck like a tiger
No Tony the Tiger, to me she a liar
I'm back to my old ways, back to my old ways
She want some foreplay give her that Monday
She comin' back Tuesday, today is a new day
Her diamonds Blu-Ray, she drinkin' the D'Usse
She got on top gave me head like a toupee
Her lingerie gucci, we shootin' the movie, shootin' the movie
She is a thotty, she movin' her body
She all on my dick, now I'm feelin' so cocky

Niggas thought I wasn't shit 'til I stepped out, got it poppin'
If I want it I'ma cop it, tell 'em that's just how I'm rockin'

Hit her all night, let her take away the pain
I got money on my mind, now I'm 'bout to make it rain
Know you wanna ride but I gotta catch a plane
I don't want a bride, I need mary jane
I don't wanna lie, you and me we ain't the same
She a runaway train, that's a thottie on the loose
She won't leave me 'lone, girl you probably off the goop

She just want attention, say it's easy to expose her 
I'm all in her pussy, you would think I was a Trojan 
2016  I'm coming for the win
And I smoke a lot of weed, I think it is my medicine
If the cops pull me over, Imma hide the evidence
And the way she gave me top, she was so intelligent
I want hella bands, I want hella fans, I smoke hella grams
I'm just on some different shit, she like the way I hit my dance
I just fucked a foreign hoe, got a few out of state
I can never save these thots, I just gotta say my grace
Call my nigga Rahi, said lets go get it poppin 
I can never switch up, I remember how I got it 
I just spread the love, all these hating niggas toxic 
When you on your grind, you can't let nobody stop it 
Paradise and a pair of Nikes, shawty very nice
Blue berry ice, she the cocky type, she can't stay the night
Diamonds piss yellow, make it rain like the umbrella
 She say she like my sauce, guess I am a jiggy fella 
Mind state like Kanye, but I'm on another level 
Niggas want to be alike, like that shit ain't very clever 
Plug put me on, now my lifestyle is so better 
Shawty like my voice, it's the type to make her wetter 
Tryna disappear and buy a house in Tokyo
Have a closet of designer and a bitch to roll my dope

I got it back now it's all in my hands
Stayed on my toes I ain't switch on my mans
Kill em, be humble and stick to the plan
I'm in the cut, I don't fuck with the VIP
These females ain't loyal, they always on dicks
Stay in the job, I can't be in the mix
They want me to fail but instead I took risks
Look at me now like I'm making them sick
Fuck all the diamonds, I shine regardless
I got the vision, yes I'm an artist
I tell em pull up cause we got the bargain
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk

That nigga talking, I know he ain't real

Work my ass off till my hands touch a mil
Rollin up dope, getting high for the thrill
Gave her the D now she all in her feels
Hitting my phone all the time cannot chill
I do not love you, ain't paying ya bills
She want some clout but I ain't Dr. Phil
We got in late when we came in the door
Hoes in the couch money all in the floor
Ain't running out keep the bag in galore
I shine like a star in the clouds where I soar
Funny thing is I was just by the store
Trapping with bro making plays to get more
Now I'm on flights taking trips to explore
Give me two years and I'm going on tour
It's all we got, bitch you know what it is
Now I'm the man you can't call me a kid
No looking back on the shit that I did
Hitting them licks, laying low from the pigs
Rolling up gas drinking lean like i'm sick
Bro trappin hard making plays out the whip
I'm in the studio making these hits
Chasing my dreams while they sit back and wish
Nigga you know what it is 
Nigga you know what it ain't
And these niggas ain't felt all my pain
Tell that nigga just stay in his lane
Smoking gas and it's smelling like dank
And my shooters pull up in a tank
And she love me, I'm fresh out the bank
I can't save you, girl I ain't no saint
Bitch I'm ballin on these niggas, Jordan when I dunk
She popped a perc and sipped my lean, she thought she was drunk
My niggas savage, riding with the chopper in the trunk

I'm running fast to that bag all I know is flex
I need that work, I need that bag, give me my fucking checkUh, one time for the, one time for the
Huh, one time for the
Look
I'm wearing all gold like a king
Rubies with the diamond rings
Fuck the bling, chasing dreams and serving them to the fiends
I'm a minor in his cold mind with the cold mind of Einstein
Dropping knowledge every line
I'm god, they can't tell me nothing
Why is you bluffing? I'm the topic of discussion
Faded off this robitussin
I'm a Nikon to my youth, lyrical in the booth
Captain of my troops, letting loose, I'm busting on her tooth
My flow nasty and grimy, promise I'm back at it
Smashing all you rap faggots who always been backstabbing
Teachers told me, "Focus", but fuck it, I'm writing lyrics
Raising spirits, holy and gifted, I hope you hear it
I only fear god in the odds of being odd
Without a prod, rappin' everyday like it's my job
I know that's the motion, wrap my Jimmy in a trojan
Before I swim in the girl's ocean
It's funny how they think they know me
My mind's suicide, yet, I'm feeling too alive
See me and Neek we rise but y'all hate
Niggas faking, wanna be a Jason
Working on my education
Tryna make it to my destination
But me, being me, I just wanna get high
Ride past pretty bitches here in Malsay High
But, hey!
Life's a game but this ain't no fucking 2k
Don't give a fuck about what you say
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Said, I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
Im chucking up th-
I'm having visions of givin', givin' up on this competition
And saying, "Fuck it man", and givin' in to the opposition
But then I start having visions of how I was sitting
At my desk in sixth grade writing rhymes in my composition
Of the curvin' life I'm livin'
If that ain't too fulfilling than I don't know what's appealing
It's like everytime I write
My future life becomes revealing
But, it's crazy 'cause the future is still so concealing
Layin' back with my eyes on the ceiling
Can't even tell you what I'm fuckin' feeling but I'm thinking 'bout a million
A million damn ways to help my mom care for the children
New cup, new crib
Yeah, that's a good-ass feelin'
Givin' up on the world
And no longer givin' a fuck 'bout a girl
'Cause when you worry 'bout girls
That shit will fuck up the world
'Cause you gon' say, "You my world"
Then buy her diamonds and pearls
But in the end, she gon' switch up
Man, that's the way of the world
So don't be trustin' these girls
They all they slick but greasy like Jheri Curls
On a scale from 1-10
We masterminds with the pen
As we sit in the wind
Write rhymes they comprehend, so!
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, bitch
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
I'm chucking up the deuces, deuces
Bitch, bitch, bitch, ha-ha!
I'm chucking up the deuces
Neek, we ballin' in a new way
I pull up with a new wave, a new wave, a new waveUh, I'll punch you in the back, my hands come through your belly button
These rappers got dope beats but their lyrics ain't nothing
They talk about giving love for their town and think they stunting
My team hit it out the park when your team be bunting
See, I'm a kid who's trying to live a dream
This lifestyle is a movie and I skip too many scenes
But when I look back, it's not as good as it seems
But I started from nothing and turned it all into a thing
But Illuminati tryna tie me in a knot
But I'll never go to hell 'cause I don't want my soul to rot
Cause I'm only thirteen, in five more years I'll be a man
And I'm gonna work hard, there's no defeat in my plans
But I stand tall, stay strong 'cause I ain't done son
'Cause I pray to God that he lets me be number one
'Cause I give more time and I think with my head
I popped up in this rap game just like some toaster bread
But on these beats I devour anybody
Who thinks they raw when they know they sour
You work for a couple minutes when I work for eight hours
Go home, eat my dinner, than I take a long shower
They ask me why I act gold, 'cause I feel I really am
I go past the limit, go up high like I'm Peter Pan
I go hard, young bull, homie and I never sleep
These rappers fourteen days 'cause they all too weak
But I just give it my all and I hope I never fall
But I'm destined for up so my team we gonna ball
When you ask me do I want to be famous, no
I wanna be legendary, that is the kid who makes the changes
I studies all the greats and gave it a lot of time
To let my bars lock up, I ain't committing crimes
Instead I'm sitting back putting my pain up in these lines
You feel the deepness in my songs as I flow along
But you can stand under me if you don't understand
Growing up so fast, I swear it's hard to be a humble man
I'm wise, you could tell when you look into my eyes
You see nothing but stars, that's me up in the sky
I worked hard in my academy, you see me building strategy
I give effort, I don't care who's mad at me
'Cause all this rap music is really helping me
And one day, I wanna be known as a prodigy
Forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat, uh
I said forget being famous
I wanna be legendary, the kid who makes the changes
I'm going down in history
I'm tryna be a beast
When it comes to ripping beats
Lil Skies'll bring that heat, uh
It's legendary, yeah
Making good music from the soul
We don't believe in illuminati
Just keep it real and let the beat flowLook, niggas hatin' on me, I'm just trying to make a way
My bible and my demons make me pray for better days
Dark liquor, cigarettes, and some purple sprite
My life's a gamble, roll the dice, I had to pay the price
Cold hands, foreign bitches doin' slow dance
She a freak, but I don't like the way she romance
Poppin' pills, catching chills from these xanny pills
Shawty say she get a thrill, love the way it feels
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man, my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different, boy, you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different, but you never knew me
Sippin' forties, rollin' doobies, man, my life's a movie
I fucked a groupie, got the nudies, handprints on her booty
And niggas say I'm actin' different, boy, you never knew me
And bitches say I'm actin' different, but, you never knew me, huh
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts, huh
Let me light another newport, dinner by the food court, ballin' I need two courts, huh
Cigarettes, and henny bottles, yuh
Cigarettes, and henny bottles ,yuh
Cigarettes, and henny bottles, woah
Ciga... Woah
Okay, hold up, wait a minute, menace like I'm Dennis
Lil Skies, I'm in it, want green I'm talkin' spinach
See this is the beginning, the story that I'm livin'
I'm makin' bad decisions, still in my mind I'm gifted
I come from Chillenburg, crack needles on the curb
My niggas servin' herb, cops come don't say a word
This is the life I chose, I'm juggin' with my bros
And we don't love these hoes, they all about that dough
And she use me to get high, but that ain't catch me by surprise
Used to hide her from my guys 'cause she was always tellin' lies
And the way she rolled a blunt, bro, she had me mesmerized
Used to look into her eyes and thank God she was mine
Now I'm smokin' good livin' great, took some time to concentrate
Rollin' up, takin' flights, Superman without his cape
Pourin' up, double cups, gettin' rich and buy some bape
Yuh, I'ma get rich and buy some bape
Until we end, until we fall, I'ma keep it real, girl, I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, I'ma keep it real, girl, I just want it all
Until we end, until we fall, I'ma keep it real, girl, I just want it all
Gold diggers and a bunch of broke niggas
I took some time to realize I was a born sinner
Now wash my hands before I sit and thank God for dinner
I know my heart is cold but it's shining like some spinnas
I told myself that I would make it if I stopped gettin' faded
Screamin' fuck my education, boy, I'm on my way to greatness
Victim of the slave ship, work harder for a better payment
Trying to find my placement in a world full of basic
Until we end, until we fall, I'ma keep it real, girl, I just want it all
Until we endLyrics from Snippet
They all gon' sing along
You ain't ever say you was proud, you just pointed out my wrongs
So, get the fuck out of my face
People be annoying, tryna' envy my space
I don't wanna hear it, I am not the one today
I would like to change my ways, that's what I told you
But, these niggas love to hate, I'm going Goku
I ride or die for my clique
Ain't switchin', I ain't no bitch
Me and NBA, we ball everyday, they wanna live like this
I'm a superstar, I got rich
I done did this shit with no wish
Hard work, I had to take risks
Now my crib got a big fence
I don't trust people, that's lameLyrics From Snippet

We smoking please don't crash, the cops be on my ass
Oh, you gon' do the dash, nigga what you want
My nigga, what you want, don’t put on a front
Rolling up the wood, that's the stuffed crust
She said she fell in love, I think we fell in lust
No I don't give no fucks, I been about my bucks
You know it's hard to trust, they want me to fuck up
That's why I get so high, I'm working in my zone
What's real is hard to clone, my heart made out of stone
Put my life in these beats, make sure I bring the heat
They gon' jump out they seats, I’m building memories
They want me to fold, but I remain the same
And I’ll die for my bros, and that will never change
You switched up for some hoes, but say you're with the game

Hating on me dog, I am not to blame
Don't compare me dog, I'm not the same
Dope shirts and fresh shoes
Bad woman, that's good news
Got my own style, I pick and choose

I grab a double cup, I might just die today
And I will never change 'cause they don't feel my pain
Her lipstick on my chains, she rocking diamond rings
I like the way she taste, she's so full of faith
We some rockstars, so we don't follow rules
I know you like the juice, but do you have a clue?
They hate to see me win, so I don't like to lose
I gotta stick the move, 'cause I can't be a fool
You say you love me, but never trust me
You wanna fuck me, but how could you judge me?
I live a dark life, a shadow in the light
I'll come in through the night, if you give me advice
I lay you on the bed and give you all of me
Not just a part of me, girl, take it all from me
And people talkin' down, it never bothers me
'Cause I'm a prodigy, I know I got the keys

She a bad bitch, I don't know what to say

Hip-hop
Shout out to my pops
Mike Skies
And guess what, I'm back nigga
And I'm back nigga
I'll take you back to the 90's, I'm a 90's baby
White T's and black beanies like I'm Slim Shady
Sipping Mellow Yellow while I feed my dog Jell-O
She got twelve heads and tryna talk, oh hell no
Flip the script on hip-hop, now you can't read my words
Added verbs, now my punctuation curves
Sitting by the curb eating Nerds while I'm feeding birds
Better swerve or get served
Boy you ain't got the nerve
I see demons try and take my soul
I fought a leprechaun just so I could take his gold
The greatest ever told is really getting old
These boys nothing but mold around the 
But check my method, I just perfect it, never neglect it
You get the message
My fan base fat like Precious
I be writing rhymes in school so I don't pay attention
In detention mind floated to a new dimension
Hip-hop's my medicine, I love to overdose
Flying coast to coast with the Holy Ghost in a silver boat
Spent my weekends writing rhymes in my basement
Now my flow dangerous, I'll leave you in the pavement
Vamp life so we never sleep at night
My mind's full of parasites
Is that what you call paradise?
Dudes be looking shook like a pair of dice
You claim you dope but these other niggas don't think you're nice
Middle fingers to the niggas that be hating
Out here making changes but we ain't the ones that's changing
We steady elevating
It took some patience
Now bow down to greatness
You say your flow's sick but honestly it's constipated
Listening to some Big Daddy Kane
On my way to play basketball with my nigga Blaine
We ain't the same but we think like we got two brains
Maintain to spit flame, now we bout to reach the fame
Yeah, I'm eating donuts with your mom
And that's just how it go
Hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop, hip-hop
Shout out to the fat dude that shoots my videos
I forget your name though
By the way what up Phil
Peace to all my 'nillas, let's goAyy, yaaa, ahh
Menoh
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Yeah, I'm going in for the kill
And I don't care how niggas feel
They get mad cause I'm keepin it real
Need a house wanna live in the hills
Mom stressin, I'm payin her bills
Fuck a opp, we pop him like a pill
If you try me, bro aim with the still 
I was still in the phill
Run it up, just to get a mill
Why your mans do it for the thrill
And he slippin like banana peels
Good gas, tell her how it smell
I was making money off the scale
And I still got clientele
And I still get it through the mail 
I was moving all the grams, runnin trap just like a band
Smoking dope, I don't fuck with the xans
Free Keen, ain't switch on his fam
I got money, it's all in my hands
I was broke working hard on the plan
She a model, just look at her stance
Big guap, big nots in my pants
And you can miss me with the bullshit
Don't compare me to these rap guys
Grew the name off of hard work
I should probably start a franchise
I'ma buy my brothers gold chains for being with me through the hard times
And we ain't sellin' drugs no more
Got a white girl off of coke lines
And I'm taking wins like Jordan
And you takin' L's 'cause you boring
Off ten woods and I'm soarin'
Only fuck with her if she gorgeous
Up next, nigga it's important
Drivin fast, dash in the foreign
Give me the ball 'cause I'm scoring
And she give me top in Ralph Lauren
Young niggas at the wave
And I don't like to follow trends
Nigga I ain't have many friends
Only one account, dividends
With my fam to this shit and the end
I'ma rider I break all my sins
And all black when I slide in the tint
We gon buy it with stress for the rent
People tell me that I changed
But never knew me from the start
I put the numbers on the chart
That's when I started breaking hearts
That's your girl and she down for the gang
I stay loyal, I don't fuck with no lames
Need diamonds, like water my chain
And I know you ain't feeling my pain
Yeah, I'm going in for the kill
And I don't care how niggas feel
They get mad cause I'm keepin it real
Need a house wanna live in the hills
Mom stressin, I'm payin her bills
Fuck a opp, we pop him like a pill

Good gas, tell her how it smell
I was making money off the scale
And I still got clientele
And I still get it through the mail 
These days go by, I roll one, get high
Look me in my eyes, don't tell me no lies
Take a part of me, this no fantasy
Not the one for me, show no sympathy
That's why we don't show no sympathy
Fuck that hoe cause I know she ain't meant for me
Say I'm crazy, I don't know what got into me
I could never give a fuck about a enemy
That's why we don't show no sympathy
Fuck that hoe cause I know she ain't meant for me
Say I'm crazy, I don't know what got into me
I could never give a fuck about a enemyBased1 got them bands, ho

You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me
I know there's times when you thought I was leaving
Now that I'm gone, no repeat, just deleting
Tryna find a purpose, can you tell me what's the meaning?
Let them talk about me, swear these people so deceiving
I can never understand it, livin' like a rockstar, I'm not from this planet
Got a lot of battles, I don't need a bandage
She say he won't  with us pull up 
Yeah, shoutout the ones who really hold me down
These circus rappers actin' like some clowns
I put in work cause I can't joke around 
The whole team meetin' even when I'm not in town
You gotta understand, as a man, I had this plan my whole life
I used to, sit on my porch with a pen and just write
I used to, stay up late and study music all night
And for my dream, I'm all in, I never think twice 
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need meLyrics from Snippet
Get close, they seeing a full clip
These Gucci, they came from Boston
Bad bitch, I paid for her boob lift
We had to trap out the Honda Civic
That was right before the record deal
Smoking weed, waitin' on the sell
They can never feel what I feltLyrics From Snippet
Your love is sky high, it's so hard to find

And she in love with the top shotters, nigga
We ain't fuckin' with no broke bitch, why you with her?
I just hit her with that dope dick, I don't kiss her
Why your mans like sneak diss on Twitter 
He claimin' that he really pop shit, he not a hitter
Bitch I'm sweeping backwoods, this is not a swisher 
Rolling off the opp pack, this another victim
I'm going crazy, fuck you playing?, we can't get along
I caught you switching 'cause I'm winning and you claim them wrong
I got so much up in my head, real shit in every song
If I was lying, kill me dead inside the shit I'm on
They don't know how to keep it real, these niggas know it's facts
If I can't trust you, that is fuck you, I can't hang with rats
I ran it up and I'm still me, I cut my soul in tact
My family eating every season, it's a better snatch
And that's why
I had to elevate
Walk in the party, my pockets overweight
You say that's your shawty, why she all in my face?
I don't fuck with these niggas, I know they gonna hate

Ooh, top floor we smokin' gas with a couple bitches
I just landed in the city, now I'm bouta' get litty with a couple of bad bitties', now I'm off again
I came a long way with 2 Glocks, I had 2 Glocks again
I had 2 Glocks up in the trap, but them bitches were twins
Then I would dress up in the trap, doin' hands to hands
And all these niggas in my DMs tryna beat my mans
And pussy nigga if you lame you cannot hate
I'm gonna hit 'em with the choppa, let the 30 bang
And all these niggas y'all are pussy had to elevate
A couple years ago a nigga was not livin' straight
I had to get all the pussy and the money back
And all these niggas talk shit and say I'm up tight
And all that shit you cannot cop no worth
And if you come on fuckin' sure then I'm gonna go berserk
I had to elevate
Walk in the party, my pockets overweight

Lil Skies another verse to kill
Mac Miller, let's go
It goes 1998, 1998
See I be steady rhyming, my timing is always over shining
Mix the rhymes up with some coke and lace the verse, I call it science
Niggas be lying in this jungle just to be the king
Diamonds and pearls, my  they rocking the finest things
Define my name, Lil Skies about to change the game
Gold chains and a smart brain, I swear we not the same
Broken promises and shattered glass in my past
She drinks Ciroc out the bottle, she don't wanna pass
Forever showing my effort, you dudes irrelevant
No weed in my lungs, my thoughts straight intelligent
I hopped over an elephant like I'm heaven sent
Remember when I was broke and didn't have a cent
But now Lil Skies on that old school shit
My fans heard the song and they like "This that hit"
Keep the beats coming, I can write real quick
Hold up let me try and change my flow a little bit
My team is rebels, we throwing the finger to the devil
Pedal to the metal
We toss these niggas just like some peddles
Eat 'em like he's Jell-O and treat this nigga  just like a 
We don't got no time for you fakes so we hit 'em with the kettle
We making money and smashing all of you dummies
My squad's full of gorillas, your squad is full of bunnies
We came up from being bummy
They laughing but what is funny
We eat 'em just like some gummies
While the day is bright and sunny, look
The dope spitter with Phil, see I'm a mic killer
I'm high on life and I promise I don't need skrilla
I smash Insta, Facebook, they all shook
Rappers stealing my style, they act like straight crooks
My shawty got a nice body, she say I'm cocky
I meet her all in the lobby, we stunting like it's a hobby
I walked in, walked out, she calling me "Papi"
By the way I beat it up some kind of like a Rocky
I'm sicker than your average, average
Who's really the shit?
1998, 1998
And it goes like
Sicker than your average, average
Who's really the shit?
1987, 1987
Seizing the moment
These pussies rapping I don't condone it
Just step up and own it
Hit the track fast like a locomotive
And my tactic splash back cause my style is so explosive
If you need the white boy with the heat, then I'm the one to go with
The dope spitter with Lil Skies, it's Dirrty Phil
We been making hits like the Thriller way I'm vanilla 'nilla
No second guessing, I'm spitting just like a llama stressing
Hotter than some lava shooting from the  ArmageddonAyy
I don't see nobody in this shit, that's all I know
Remember we was broke and we ain't had no where to go
And we ain't had no where to go
Ayy
I don't see nobody in this shit, that's all I know
Remember we was broke and we ain't had no where to go
Said she love me now because I'm stunting at my shows
Money on my mind, I stack it up, can't let it fold
That's my little shorty, think I like her on the low
She bug me all the time, think I be worried 'bout these hoes
I just wrote a gas up to the face then I smoke
Hit it one time and you probably gonna choke
Flexing on these niggas, I don't even mean to brag
Shitting on my enemies, I step out with a bag
You showing your true colors, why you out here lookin' sad?
Broski want a Rari, I'ma cop it, fuck the tag
Out in Cali with a shorty that's from overseas
She said she really love me but she not the one for me
I treat her like a queen, let her live in royalty
Niggas love to hate, but they don't show no loyalty
It's alright, are you the savage type?
I like to catch a vibe, Uber and catch a ride
No, I'ma put it down
King me, give me the crown
No, I'ma fuck it up
So just don't make a sound
(So just don't make a sound
So just don't make sound
So just don't make a sound
So just don't make a sound
So just don't make a sound)
I don't see nobody in this shit, that's all I know
Remember we was broke and we ain't had no where to go
Said she love me now because I'm stunting at my shows
Money on my mind, I stack it up, can't let it fold
That's my little shorty, think I like her on the low
She bug me all the time, think I be worried 'bout these hoes
I just wrote a gas up to the face then I smoke
Hit it one time and you probably gonna choke
No one, no one
Ever come between me and my play
No one, no one
So it's a family, only family I trust
Roll one, roll one
Smoking fast, getting gassed, 'bouta pass out
All homies all up on me but they backed out
Living fast now, pedal on the gas now
And they don't know how to act now
I just laugh, watching everybody crash down
Living fast now, pedal on the gas down
Woah, woah
Woah, woah woahAll I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
All I wanted was a million
Getting money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazilian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread, I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate 'cause we the villains of the village
With my new bitch, she wearing foreign
And she don't fuck with him because he boring
I be in the clouds, bitch, I be soaring
Off the ENG then I just pour it
Smoking loud, she just wanna party
She drank too much and now she actin naughty
I let her hit the tookah and now she floating
Her friends fuck with the gang because we loafing
Cooling with some older niggas who gon' ride for me
I had to get it by myself and now they copy me
Them snakes maneuver through the grass just like a soccer team
Niggas changing over green, I seen some crazy things
And I'm a young nigga, I got no regrets
I never trust an opp, especially when they tryna flex
I got people hit my phone like I was dropping next
My gang the coldest, bitch, we flyer than a fucking jet
All I wanted was a million
Getting money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazilian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread, I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate 'cause we the villains of the village
I'm tryna stack a million, so you never catch me chilling
Don't give a fuck about nobodies opinion
He say, she say shit, but I don't ever hear them
Can't fear them, riding with a bad bitch, she steering
Riding by, these niggas mad, you could tell by the way they staring
When it comes to me and these niggas, there ain't even no comparing
Yo gang got the city popping, we got them bitches cheering
Every time I step out I be looking like a billion
I be killing, give a fuck about your feelings
Way these niggas copy you would swear they were our children
These niggas swear they rapping, but on the real these niggas squealing
I come from a real small town where everybody is drug dealing
I was taught from a real young age, that street shit ain't appealing
Ever since that day I knew I had to make some millions
There's people out here killing, they stealing for the million
All I wanted was a million
Getting money is the greatest feeling
I be with the hoes that look Brazilian
All my niggas jiggy, we be killing
I just want the millions
Stack my bread, I wanna see them billions
Fuckboys be mad, caught in they feelings
They hate 'cause we the villains of the villageLyrics From Snippet

All this money got a nigga in his bag
Now I can go out and get the things I've never had
I ain't trippin' on no old bitch, that's on my past
Run it up and let it stack, I wanna make it last
Let's be honest know I got these niggas mad
I was taught the game is everything that I had
I can never be another nigga goin' out sad
She like my demeanor, know I'm dropping from the swag
It's hard to make it
I'm the only one that's famous, I know
Exploded like volcano
Take a beat and rap my life, that's how I let my pain go
Fifty thousand on my neck to let my chain hang low
Got stars up on the roof, look up they see a halo but we don't talk about that
When my momma told me, I'm the one
I can never let her down, I'm her first son
And I remember hard times now it's time for fun
My brothers got the heat I know I'm not the only one
And that's why
All this money got a nigga in his bag
Now I can go out and get the things I've never had
I ain't trippin' on no old bitch, that's on my past
Run it up and let it stack, I wanna make it last
Let's be honest know I got these niggas mad
I was taught the game is everything that I had
I can never be another nigga goin' out sad
She like my demeanor, know I'm dropping from the swag
Ayy
And she put trust on no one
Coming from a long trip
Hoping to see someone
I'm looking for comfort
Maybe a vacation
Somewhere in an island
Rollin' and we blazin'
But let's just stay back and just get faded
Know a lot of niggas fakin' and we've been working hard for greatness
I know this life is amazing-
..
All this money got a nigga in his bag
Now I can go out and get the things I never had
I ain't trippin' on no old bitches on my past
Run it up and let it stack, I wanna make it last
Let's be honest know I got these niggas mad
I was told the game is everything that I had
I can never be another nigga gone upset
She like my demeanor, know I'm dropping from the swagAll this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
Let me spit that shit
Yo, yo
Drug dealers, slug pillers, and young niggas
Sixteen in a world full of cold killers
Times are hard, moms stressing, the bills are due
We have problems with niggas who hated on my crew
Chuck Taylors and hookah pens with water vapor
Dress like a skater but smoking mics like a doobie paper
Ain't got no time for the bullshit so I let it fly
Family wanna see me go far so they yelling "Kie"
Sometimes I feel like I'm really fucking up
Then I fall back in my ways, just really depressed as fuck
Every day I wake up with a vision in my head
Tryna get my life right, I ain't worried bout the bread
It's like nowadays all I wanna do is write
And since I'm on now niggas really tryna fight
It's funny how you get cake and niggas wanna slice
Spend nights with my niggas steady rolling dice
And I say...
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
See I just can't live my life like this
That's when I wake up in the morning and I write this shit
These girls on my D cause they love the life I live
Radio shows and videos, I'm not that big
My fan base growing every day
Girls sending me nudies and I ain't even saying hey
It's like damn this is the life you get when you live this way
Niggas pull up on your side with that gun, don't play
It's crazy, I'm just so focused right now so take me seriously
Keep my head up in the clouds, there ain't no fear in me
God put me on this earth to spit this shit lyrically
Heart full of gold, music's really in my destiny
Lil Skies I'm a young legend
Praying to the lord on my knees to the reverend
I really wouldn't reckon, watch where you steppin'
Niggas tryna make hits but forgot the message
So I say...
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga
And I'm just really working, I'm just really working
I'm just really working, and I'm fucking hurting
All this pain in my chest make me hurt nigga

Me and my niggas stayin' hungry, ya bish, ya bish
Out here workin' for our money, you bitch, you bitch
Niggas prayin' I fall off, ya wish, ya wish
Gettin' full off success, no dish, no dish
I want gold models with gold bottles
Two fast cars at full throttle to drive me through my fantasies, uh
I need good rhymes, no dried lines
And 30 cups of red wine to understand my destiny
See me I'm floatin' in the ocean
Never coastin', they can't hold him
Fast life in the slow lane
Running'through the bread so fast they say I'm loafin'
Came up from the bottom
Young kids, we didn't really even have no options
Now thots be thottin' and all of you foo foo niggas plottin'
Came up from a came up
Lil Skies done changed up
But I'm still on the same team
Doin' things y'all afraid of
I-I've been workin' hard, but I'm still learnin'
I-I don't get no sleep, now my head hurtin'
We tryna get it, ya bish, ya bish

Part II: All of My Remix
Look, okay I'm all about my peso, nigga who are you?
Always gotta hustle so I watch where I move
The bills past due, the money on the table
We couldn't pay for cable, now all my niggas stable
I used to sell shoes, I used to sell hats
I tried to make that come up, but never ever trapped
These niggas straight wack so I can't trust 'em
Turn a good girl bad, had to adjust 'em
Money, power, fashion, my only motivation
Niggas tryna test me, deep down they hatin'
People quick to judge me, somethin' like I'm Satan
I've been at the bottom but I'm patiently awaitin'
To smash you nigga, I'ma nigga trash you nigga
You be rappin' like you nice, boy you ass, my nigga
Ask around boy, they tell you Lil Skies that nigga
I been grindin' too hard to come in last my nigga
So I go, spittin' rhymes, they dope
Levitate and I flow
Greatness they know
I'm a prodigy
Probably rocking everybody in the crowd
And I'm known to be wild so I'ma be here for a while
Chambersburg born legend
I'm bringin' niggas down like 9/11
And my verses pop off like MAC-11s
Uh, and it's love
Uh, shout out to P.A

Here we go
Team watch me win
I feel like 50 man
16 16's in 16 days

I might just touch the sky
And she fucked up the vibes
Menoh
And she fucked up the vibes 
We trappin' out the whip
Aye
Trappin' out the whip , I came up from the sticks 
The feds they need to face and my bitch look like a lick 
So smokin' out the zip 
I text, I need my shits 
And I don't fuck with them 'cause I'm just too legit
Broski, he gon' stay equipped
Keep that thing right on his hip
Nigga trying and gettin' ripped
Do the dash and swerve the whip
I can never save a thottie, get my nut and leave the bitch
She tried to stalk me in the back, couldn't believe this shit
She say I'm cocky, kick her out 'cause I can't see this shit
Like fuck opinions, hit the wood, I don't believe in splif 
Remember when I used to dream about this life I live? 
Now I'm the man they showin' hands, I got no fucks to give
Trapped inside my mind and went through something I'll never speak
Now these kids look up to me, I can't show signs of being weak
Even when I drove the Benz, I knew I was the MVP 
Now these niggas love to envy me
She told me she DTF and we didn't even meet
She followed on my IG, going off with what she sees
Girl I'm on some other shit
Spend the money overseas
Backwood full of blue dreams
I just like the finer things
Live life like a king 'cause I can't be a bitch
And I will never switch
And he the type to snitch
He shoot but that's a brick
He shoot but that's a brick
And we get all them hunnids
I know they hate this shit
She off a xanny bar
She wanna hang with stars
And I got superpowers, I ain't no avatar
Thought I'd get in the car and then go vroom vroom
I like her attitude, now she like move
I pull her in that mood, I gotta stick the mood
And yeah, that's the crew, that's what the bullets do
'Cause he gon' do you wrong
So girl go take that bong
She wanna see my lungs, no, I don't smoke no bongs
He smokin' on the reggy
I'm smokin' on that hempty
I'm smokin' on the salad
I'm setting up a palace
My bitch look too bodied
My bitch look so bodied
My bitch is too exotic
Yeah that's my bitch, what's poppin?
This ain't no Mary Poppins
I like the way she drop it
The clock tick in and tock it
You really gotta watch it 
You really gotta watch it
These pussy niggas plotting
And I see where they droppin'
Yeah, I got the options
That's why we in the tropics
So we gon' pass your bitch
We do it like we boppin'
And we will never stop
Green light like we never stop it
And it's the fuckin' cops
You know the niggas watchin'
And I'm still with my girl
That mood that can never change
And we stay away from these lames
Tryna see brighter days
I stick in my ways and I'm still with my bae
And we stuck in LA
We smokin' Mary Jane
Next up, I'm getting paid
Niggas hatin' everyday
And we don't give no fucks 
'Cause this is how we hate 
And we don't give no fucks
And we don't give no fucks I'm swagging out the building, swagger on a hundred trillion
A lot of people talk but Lil Skies be chilling
I'm writing rhymes til my hands ain't got no feeling
I been writing dope flows and now these rappers I'm killing
So I don't plan to stop
You'd rather see me at the bottom but I'm at the top
I always told my bros "Homie one day we'll make it"
But we wanna be legendary so forget famous
I told you dudes I hit this mic just like an uppercut
And half of y'all are fake like Nicki Minaj's butt
I try to keep it real but half of y'all are phony
And I normally spend time writing rhymes but that gets lonely
But man these dudes have no clue what hip-hop is
It's not about the drugs, girls, or the money kid
Dog it's about that realness coming from the heart
See these rappers is all talk but they stink like fart
Illuminati getting trapped inside your brain man
Y'all stand tall but sink fast like it's quicksand
I don't understand where we went wrong dog
But you rappers are wood then I'ma saw off
See homie Lil Skies I probably be that man
To take your Tinkerbell but I ain't no Peter Pan
I'm growing up now so I really understand
That I'ma write real hip-hop and I don't need a hand
I love this music but I don't love the rap game
Cause all of you rappers are talking bout the same things
Nobody cares about the girls and we don't need the chains
We just need a little help where we could make a change
But Lil Skies dog I'm lyrical, people say I'm a miracle
Cause I'm making them spiritual
No need to get technical like I was digital
Physically and mentally eating them like it's cereal
Only time will tell who's the best and that's the deally though, for really though
This is how I do
I am chemically combined to this game like an atom to a molecule
People try and challenge but it's nothing to a boss
When I'm on this mic I'm killing rappers like the HolocaustYeah-yeah, bitch
Raw, ooh, yuh
Aye, red light red, red light red
Screaming fuck the feds, nah
Red light red, red light red
Screaming fuck the feds, nah
Red light red, red light red
Screaming fuck the feds, nah
Red light red, red light red
Screaming fuck the feds
Aye, I smoke a pound of the boof 
Aye, I got the pounds on my roof 
Aye, she love me 'cause I'm the truth 
Aye, I do not fuck with yo crew 
Aye, I'm at the top making moves 
Just look at me, I got the juice 
Love my brothers, I ride for my troops 
Oh, you snitching, you tying your noose
He be ducking, he look like a goose
Laying low, counting bands in my coupe
We got snipers can't climb on my roof
I can't trust you, no, I ain't no fool
She got wet, I fuck her by the pool
Fuck my teachers, I knew I was cool 
I sold pack to my teachers at school 
I need bands, so I hang with the Goons 
They got ratches, they play with the tools 
I lay low, I got too much to lose 
If he try me, he making the news 
Cop designer and fuck on my boo 
These hoes working, just watch how you move 
I got sauce like I drip through my jewels 
Kicked her out, sent her looking for clues 
Lean, red light red, red light red
I'm screaming fuck the feds, aha-nah
Red light red, red light
Aye-aye-aye
Nigga's hate, but they act like my mans 
I can't trust you, ain't shaking no hands 
Nigga's goofy be off of the xans 
You got robbed, that was part of the plan 
You forgot, guess you don't understand 
People switch, why I don't have no friends 
I'm the G.O.A.T, these lil nigga's my lambs 
I can't answer, my trap phone is jammed 
Got the pack, double up if I can 
If I gotta give it to my mans 
I don't trip when it comes to my fam

I pull up on a nigga like I got some shit to say
And we like bands, fuck a friend, they get in the way
True like religions, see no difference, where my competition?
I had to hustle off the muscle just to say I'm livin'
Mama said it's green light so it's time to get it
Bad decisions, fuck opinions, why your boy so vivid?
Not with the bullshit like a nigga name with Scottie Pippen
I cut you off, baby, I don't do no reminiscin'

        This is the way I feel
Uh huh, one time
One time for my beautiful ladies
One time
Look
Damn she hates that I smoke cigarettes, but fuck it, I do it
She wants drugs and tons of liquor just to make her feel clueless
Smokin' Newport's off her balcony, her mom says I'm stupid
She fell off with all her looks because the drugs she abusin'
I used to pick her up from work when she was havin' bad days
Blowin' haze, gettin' faded, what a beautiful way
She using niggas only for money, for clothes and they pay
Wasn't feelin' school so she said fuck it and walked away
I was busy in the studio workin' to be a great
She's hurt but hide pain behind the makeup on her face
Used to fight for her like a lawyer tryna beat the case
Only time she was happy when makeup was on her face
Mascara, tons of lip gloss
Dark rooms full of shattered mirrors
And girl I hope you know you don't need no mascara
Cause when I look at you I could see the better picture
Girl you got me like oh no, oh no
Girl you got me like oh no, oh no
Girl you got me like oh no, oh no
Girl you got me like oh no, oh no, baby
She's fine wine, I'm sippin' her out the glass
See more behind them tight yoga pants around that ass
Flyin' in first class, I remember skippin' class, teachers lookin' for the hall pass
We used to sit outside in the parking lot, she used to smile dawg
I swear I made her laugh a lot
Takin' cute pictures for her Instagram, she my number one fan
And don't give a damn, she tellin' niggas I'm her man
She roll somethin up so we could ride to it
My bitch jiggy, she get high and just vibe to it
She's feelin down, so I take her to my place
But girl you're beautiful without that makeup on her face
So take it all off, no time for the bitchin'
I just need you to listen, I'm spreadin' words of wisdom
I grab my Newport's, put my Vans on my feet
But without her, I swear my porch isn't complete
Girl you got me like-Lyrics from Snippet
Fuck nigga say he got a problem, hold up, tell him "keep yo head up"
I'm a young nigga, got my bread up, I'm fucking his bitch with my leg up
We pull up in Descersions, 2020 nigga in a suburban
I'm shootin that nigga, I'm swervin, I'm fuckin his bitch while she slurpin
We shoot his lil brother in a hoopty, and why we shootin a movie?
I'm fuckin on all these groupies, these niggas be actin like goofies
I dance on a bitch like fivey, give her percs she call me papi
Tattoos all on my body, let her come ride on my Johnny
These bitches, they say I'm cocky, look at em likе "who gon stop me?"
Been ballin on niggas like Kyrie, big boss shit likе John Gotti
In the game and you know I gotta win it, been ballin, nigga, give me a minute
You wanna sign lines and you look like you losin, you talkin all that shit nigga why you accusin?
You actin like a bitch, stop doin that hoe shit, Instagram, postin pictures of your toe shit
What the fuck, niggas on some hoe shit, I mean it like, niggas on some hoe shit
Me and Stan we gon kick the door shit, back to back, kick up in ya flow shit
I run up in ya house, and I hit the motion, I ain't with the back and forth and all the commotion
I was really down bad and now I'm floatin, track to track, back to back, I go in
Lap to lap, around the world, they know it's fast as fuck like a locomotive
I walk in the trap, like "hey", look at that bitch like you ain't my bae
You ain't payin my room, my shit ain't paid, this bitch wanna fuck and just get laid
Nigga like me, I'm steady gettin paid, huh, workin that bitch like a maid, huh
Workin that bitch like a slave, huh, workin time in my fuckin grave, huh
Another verse, I could do it for fun, lyrical like a nigga, big pun
Lyrical Lemonade, runtz, Lyrical Lemonade, I'm stuntin
Niggas hate, I feel like I'm Cole Bennett, hop out the Tesla with a midget
Came up in this bitch with a smidget, nigga talkin, Imma make him cricket
I can't stand up for no minimum wage, nigga like me, countin the blues
Nigga like me, stay with the crew, nigga like me, jump out the stu
Young nigga, I was countin the dollars, young nigga, make yo big mama holler
Young nigga, I was countin with partners, young nigga, Imma 
Young nigga, I stay with all the troops, young nigga, they gon hop out and shoot
Dark tints, they gon slide thru the roof, dark tints they gon shoot who to do
If you talk to cops, nigga you're lame, nigga think he flexin with that lil chain
Nigga think he up like he the thing, this nigga thinkin till we take off his brain
Go to the bank, pull out a fifty, bad bitch, send me pics of her titties
I'm a clean nigga, don't give me hickeys, kick her out, after she suck my dicky
Where your bag at? bitch I got , sippin lean, it go straight to my kidneys
Big gun, we gon shoot him with semis, smokin runtz, this shitLadies, stop actin' like you tryin' to understand our situation, just do your little babysittin' up there
That's all you think this is?
It ain't nothin' else, when I look out in the world, I don't see nobody that looks like me with they pockets full unless they rappin' a lyric or dribblin' a ball, so what else you got in here for?
Now, what if you can't rap a lyric or dribble a ball?
It ain't this, I know that much
And you all think you're gonna make it to graduation like this?
I made it to high school, ain't nobody stop me
Lady, I'm lucky if I make it to eighteen, we in the world, we graduatin' every day we live, 'cause we ain't afraid to die protecting our own, at least when you die for your own, you die for respect, you die worthy
So when you're dead, you'll get respect? Is that what you think?
Oh, yeah
You know what's gonna happen when you die? You're gonna rot in the ground, and people are gonna go on living, they're gonna forget all about you. And when you rot, you think it's gonna matter whether you were an original gangster? You're dead. And nobody, nobody is gonna want to remember you, because all you left behind in this world is THISUh

Trust and believe that you see it, your boys done beat the odds 
Man, that's how we living, making good decisions
So the devil doesn't get us, so we working hard to get it
In this game for forever
Nah, to me it's nothing but a scrimmage
Magnify my life
Now I'm blowed up in the image 
Old head, on code red, they all dead
Son these little guys like Joe Jack to the Jack 5
All eyes on me, myself and I
What better combination
Like Mayweather in his prime 
And that's just how we feel, to keep it real
Redefine print before we sign a major deal
It takes skills, so we work hard, and never chill
My flow real, like Stacil throw me on a Foreman grill, ew 
We earn quick, y'all learn slow, like Tyson hits
So my in bison, electrifying, we writing this
We're invading the A-list on your guest list
We top notch of the top like seal team 6

Father-son talkLyrics From Snippet
Flooded my wrist with ice
I got the first round like Mike
They leech and just suck me dry
Just like a parasite
I'm at the mountain view
They try to reach my height
My trap phone jumpin'
I don't need no satellite
We let the spot stake in
We had the club jump in-
We ahead in the race, I do the dash
Know these haters tryna take my place, but they in last
Lil shorty think I'm up in the ways, I'm on her ass
Never settle down for second place, I'd rather pass
Suicide moshpit, I'm in the crowd with the fence
If my brother down bad, you know, I'm covering him in bands

Girl your love had been the best from the start, baby give me your loveLyrics from Snippet
Yeah 
Ayy, ayy
Tell the freak hoes don't excite me
Money up, she hold a nigga down, she ain'tLyrics on another pageLyrics from Snippet
Yeah, cause you hide behind those lies
You say that I changed, but I'm being Faithful
Girl why you actin ungrateful?
We're starving now you got a plate full
I'm in the dungeon with angels
Say you hate me, girl, I couldn't blame you
These are the things that I came to
You can even think ?
Look at my vision, it's clear
Fighting wars with the man in the mirror
Hide her pain behind all the mascara
When we fuck, she hit notes like Shakira
Get a bag, and my bitch she ain't changed
Through my struggles, she stuck through my pain
She ain't trippin, she stayed in her lane
Held my hand when I was in the rain
You get mad cause I'm gone on the road
Doin shows, I ain't worried about hoes
They gon come and just fuck up my goals
I can't slide cause they want me to fold
We be fighting, this shit getting old
I don't care what you heard or was told
Shawtey I kept it real from the goLyrics from Snippet
Yeah, gotta bag
Hah, ok
Walk in that bitch, pop a tag
Bag, yeah
With a check, nigga I don't lack
No weed, ok
Yeah, ayy
Walk in the trap with a big bag, hol up, this shit look like Fritos
I'm a young nigga, got my cake up, hol up, I don't know bout you, hoe
He gon hate on the whole gang, hol up, we gon shoot him like a free throw
Bro gon pass the ball, gimme the assist, Imma make it through the peephole
I done came up from sunlight, one sip, I can show you how to stunt
Really came from the bottom, I done put my gang in the front, now I do what I want
Roll a whole ounce up, we be smokin on the Fronto, it's a opp in the blunt
Did the dash in the whip when we swervin thru the potholes, gotta watch from the front
Nigga think that he gon play me, hol up, nigga out his mind
Nigga tried to try my gang, we gon blow him up in a mine
Shorty wanna fuck on the team, we put that dick in her spine
I don't really wanna talk to you, that's why I just took my time, yeah
I be really with the family, I don't got time for fake love
Shorty she don't understand me, cause I'm way above they bums
Momma told me get that Grammy, and fuck all those that judge
Give a big bag to my family, go shop and get what you want
I don't got time for nonsense, it don't make sense, so don't bring it up
Niggas livin in a past tense, that's why they racks ain't addin up
I be swervin with a bad bitch, she ain't average, why you mad as fuck?
Stanley Steamer he a savage, you get mad bitch, he gon whack you up
Smokin real Runtz out the p, I give a fuck bout what you think
Man these niggas wanna be like me, when I stunt in my white tee 
I flex on a bitch I don't care, can't give you my heart, that's rare
He ain't like me, can't compare, don't look at me, nigga don't stare
I'm sorry I'm too icey, I know most niggas don't like me
Why you lookin at me like you wanna fight me
Nigga, I don't know you I'm not with the hype, bitch!
Tell a nigga pipe down, cause we're not with the clown shitNowadays I do the most
Pull up in a Jag, wanna pull up in a Ghost
It's a celebration, I might have to make a toast
I just spent some money on a thousand dollar coat
Grantin' all my wishes, I remember I was broke
It's alright, I like to fade away
Shine like a sunny sky, but on a cloudy day
It's all but hold it down
If I don't come around
And I will ride for you
I like the way that sounds
Nowadays I do the most
Pull up in a Jag, wanna pull up in a Ghost
It's a celebration, I might have to make a toast
I just spent some money on a thousand dollar coat
Grantin' all my wishes, I remember I was broke
It's alright, I like to fade away
Shine like a sunny sky, but on a cloudy day
It's all but hold it down
If I don't come around
And I will ride for you
I like the way that soundsI promise that I love you my nigga
Never put no one above you nigga
That's my word

It's a celebration
Uh-huh, Filthy Dirrty Entertainment
S.K.G, D2RR, ayy
And I know what I know
Yeah, let's go, let's go
Yeah!
Uh, and I'm finally makin' changes
Headin' to the top, homie, it's a celebration
All these women love us while their dudes over there hatin'
I tell them "do their own thing" and stop hesitatin'
And I know, and I know, everybody tryna make it
Money changin' people every time that ya'll get famous
But every time we make money, though, it's a celebration
So big, we so for tell em' "you'll forget me in a second"
Uh, dawg, I'm workin' hard all day
Bein' myself 'cause I feel better in every way
I was taught the be myself, no matter what they say
I know to keep it real when the situation's crazy
And fake people don't phase me
A lot of people try to copy, but can't pace me
I'm only 13 and feel like I am in a footstep to becoming one of the greatest like I'm Jay-Z
Dang, I'm goin' hard, makin' a change
While you were sittin' back, watchin' me doin' my thing
All these rappers care about is the drugs and the chains
Instead of bein' dumb, homie, I'm usin' my brain
I started from nothin' and turned it all into a thing
Now I'm makin' money and it feels great to make it rain
Uh, but shorty, go hard and stop me
'Cause every time we make money you know we celebratin'
Uh, and I'm finally makin' changes
Headin' to the top, homie, it's a celebration
All these women love us while their dudes over there hatin'
I tell them "do their own thing" and stop hesitatin'
And I know, and I know, everybody tryna make it
Money changin' people every time that ya'll get famous
But every time we make money, though, it's a celebration
So big, we so for tell em' "you'll forget me in a second"
Uh, uh, I'm comin' back with another verse
I work all night and get no sleep, but it never hurts
I treat myself like a king 'cause I know what I'm worth
I stand my ground until my feet get dug down in the dirt
Uh, and yes, I'm that dude, to go nuts in the studio, but no cashews
A lot of people hate up on me, but, no, that's cool
'Cause why should I worry about someone who is so rude?
I try to tell these people that one day I make a hit
That everyone loves, that everyone thinks is so sick
And now I'm making music that all of my fans love, this music is my addiction, something just like a drug
I keep it one hunnid, but I know I ain't no thug
Teamwork, hard homie, that's how he really does
Uh, and there's no time for any patience, so throw your hands up, if you know you're celebratin'
Uh, and I'm finally makin' changes
Headin' to the top, homie, it's a celebration
All these women love us while their dudes over there hatin'
I tell them "do their own thing" and stop hesitatin'
And I know, and I know, everybody tryna make it
Money changin' people every time that ya'll get famous
But every time we make money, though, it's a celebration
So big, we so for tell em' "you'll forget me in a second"
Yeah, it's a celebration
Uh-huh
It's 2012
And we're makin' hits, and we're makin' hits
Just be yourself, you don't gotta be like the guy next to you
Do your own thing
Have your own swag, uh-huh
That's how we do it
Be yourself, and you'll get far
Just celebrate, ayy, 'cause God made you for a reason
Uh-huh
Let's keep it real, and be yourself
You know what? Just tell em' haters, tell em' tell em'
Uh, and I'm finally makin' changes
Headin' to the top, homie, it's a celebration
All these women love us while their dudes over there hatin'
I tell them "do their own thing" and stop hesitatin'
And I know, and I know, everybody tryna make it
Money changin' people every time that ya'll get famous
But every time we make money, though, it's a celebration
So big, we so for tell em' "you'll forget me in a second"? cash 
I got demons on my shoulder, I got angels on my sleeve
I brought my bro a wraith, put him scorin' in the lead
These thots in my brain make it hard for me to sleep
The money held the pain when they lie and they cheat
Hold up, but what's the purpose?
Say they runnin' with you, but whole time they lurkin'
I pull up in the wraith, I'm closin' all the curtains
We steady on the chase, we layin' low, and swervin'Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Out on my balcony, yeah, ayy
Yeah, ayy, ayy, ayy
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony
You had a sign bitch
I had to buy it
I know a lame nigga when I one
And your pockets are on my list
I'm on my balcony, you ain't invited
I am the captain now, you just a pirate
I had to lay low
Stack up my pesos
I gotta watch out
They in the raincoats
They want a casualty
This ain't the end of me
I got the remedy
Cook like a recipie
Walk on a tightrope
Sip lean and die slow
My pockets line dough
My wine like Michael
Lay low and sip my tea
She wanna fuck on me
I let her suck my D
She gon' remember me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know
I know, and I know why
I'm on my balcony
Jump off a balcony
Get on a balcony
Jump off the balcony
I put my coupe in neutral when I drop top
She won't leave me lone, I still like to bump up
I cut that bitch off, I'm just like a crop top
I shut the lanes out whenever I hotbox
Don't be afraid of heights
Are you the savage type
Don't ever tell me lies
Just let me catch a vibe
Don't know what's wrong with me
Something got into me
They say I'm hard to read
Friends turn to enemies
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
Out on my balcony
Why are you doubting me
They all surrounding me
They talking down on me
I know, and I know

I knowI been up, I been down, trying to reach out for the crown 
No matter what will happen now
Yeah, if you're going to stop me, hold me down
'Cause I'ma be last up-up-up in here
No matter what it takes, I'm gon' get there
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Uh, been rappin' since I was four, and I ain't stoppin' now
I'm finally doin' great things and making my mom proud 
So I don't plan to stop, I'ma be here for a while
While you were sittin' back talking and tryna prevail
But it's okay, though, I'ma always stand my ground
And bring me crew with me, and I'll also roll my town
I been through a lot of the ups and the downs
So when I say I'm a king, homie, I'ma find my crown 
See, every day, it's like we face a new problem
But then I found out the strategy and then I go solve it 
A lot of rappers talk about their money and their chains
And people only do that just because they got the fame
See, I could never do that just because I'm not the same
I'm definitely grindin' and I'm just tryna make a change
People look down at me like I'm some type of lame
But then they get mad when I change the rap game
I been up, I been down, trying to reach out for the crown 
No matter what will happen now
If you're going to stop me, hold me down
'Cause I'ma be last up-up-up in here
No matter what it takes, I'm gon' get there
Ah, ah, ah, ah 
Nobody's perfect, ayy, nobody's perfect 
I been workin' my whole life, so I really know I earned it 
I started making this project, now people love it
They wanna see me get out and perform these songs in public 
And now I'm doin' great and I got the crowd jumpin'
Man, it feels great to know I'm finally doin' somethin' 
Now I'm a boss and I feel like a king
'Cause I know I finally turned my dream into a thing 
What? That's great, but I'm not gonna stop 
I'ma keep on going even when I reach the top 
Because, I know, homie, I'ma always set goals 
And when I achieve, they hate, and that's how it goes 
Oh well, I'ma keep on doin' this
And I don't care what they say, dawg, I'm doin' it
These haters tryna pull me down and tryna ruin it
But I ain't gonna stop, my career is too legit
I been up, I been down, trying to reach out for the crown
No matter what will happen now
If you're going to stop me, hold me down
'Cause I'ma be last up-up-up in here
No matter what it takes, I'm gon' get there
Ah, ah, ah, ah
Yeah, FDE, D2-double-R, SKG
Uh huh, no, no matter-no matter-no matter what
They say we gon' make it, and we gon' make it
Uh huh, let's go!
I been up, I been down, trying to reach out for the crown
No matter what will happen now
If you're going to stop me, hold me down
'Cause I'ma be last up-up-up in here
No matter what it takes, I'm gon' get there

Like fuck opinions, hit the wood, I don't believe in splif 
Remember when I used to dream about this life I live? 
Now I’m the man they showin' hands, I got no fucks to give
Trapped inside my mind and went through something I'll never speak

Even when I drove the Benz, I knew I was the MVP 
Now these niggas love to envy me
She told me she DTF and we didn’t even meet
She followed on my IG, going off with what she sees
Girl I'm on some other shit

I like her attitude, now she like, "Ooh, ooh"
I pull her in that mood, I gotta stick the mood
And yeah, that's the crew, that's what the bullets do

Demonios en mis ojos, los he visto escondiéndose disfrazados 
Yeah, paranoia para mi vida, yeah, yeah
Camino afuera
Acabo de agarrar la onda, he visto atención en sus ojos
Volando como un búho, me mantengo confiado y sabio
Fumando todo el tiempo solo para esconder mi lado malo
Mamá dijo que ella va a-va a orar por mí, pero sé cómo eso funciona
Gasté mucho tiempo alrededor de niggas falsos y perras falsas
Siento que el tiempo vuela cuando tu vida está en una cuerda floja
Veo mis problemas y pienso que tengo el antídoto
Y sí sigo drogado
Deseo que pudiera lograrlo, pero arruiné mis relaciones
La gente cree que estoy jugando cuando les digo que soy el más grandioso
Demasiado en mi mente, es difícil para mí incluso decirlo
Porque yo, visto mi corazón en mi manga
Cuatro gramos en mi hoja, bendecido como si estornudara
Ellos no saben lo que sé y sé que creo
Así que voy a recibir, todo lo que necesito, pero mi

Deja a mi corazón contar todo, sé que puedes escuchar mis lloros 
Demonios en mis ojos, los he visto escondiéndose disfrazados 
Yeah, paranoia para mi vida, yeah, yeah
Estoy contando todas mis bendiciones
Orando cada segundo mientras caigo en profunda depresión
Y últimamente he estado ido, sintiendo como si estuviera criticando o corrigiendo mi realidad
Todo por lo que trabajé, está incluso en la pregunta
Y sé que ellos actúan como si les importara, pero todos ellos muestran amor falso
Necesito elevarme así que apúntame hacía la conecta
Necesito un zumbido fuerte así que dame la droga correcta
Me siento como nadie y que no soy suficientemente bueno, Suspiro
Tuve que hacer algunos cambios
Me despierto cada mañana enojado porque no lo he logrado
Veo a mi familia batallar, Estoy trabajando duramente para cambiarlo
Ve y consigue el inoxidable, tomo un sorbo hasta que estoy indoloro
Porque yo, visto mi corazón en mi manga
Cuatro gramos en mi hoja, bendecido como si estornudara
Ellos no saben lo que sé y sé que creo

Ayy, I gotta play it safe, never run away, from all these rainy days
She a bad bitch, I don't know what to say
I call her Mary Kay, love her like Mary J
I grab a double cup, I might just die today
And I will never change 'cause they don't feel my pain
Her lipstick on my chains, she rocking diamond rings
I like the way she taste, she's so full of faith
We some rockstars, so we don't follow rules
I know you like the juice, but do you have a clue?
They hate to see me win, so I don't like to lose
I gotta stick the move, 'cause I can't be a fool
You say you love me, but never trust me
You wanna fuck me, but how could you judge me?
I live a dark life, a shadow in the light
I'll come in through the night, if you give me advice
I lay you on the bed and give you all of me
Not just a part of me, girl, take it all from me
And people talkin' down, it never bothers me
Cause I'm a prodigy, I know I got the keys
Ayy, I gotta play it safe, never run away from all these rainy days

Niggas claimin' that they gang, they a bunch of wannabes
I put ice all on my shit I guess that's why my neck gon' freeze
Fuck that bitch 'cause I don't need her, shawtey knew I was a cheater
Need a bitch that's a believer, I ain't talkin' Justin Bieber
That's why all these hoes basic, I ain't tryna save a thot
I need diamonds on my wrist and forty bitches on my yacht
Neighborhood playboy imma glow up and just flex
Teachers told me go to college but I'd rather count these checks
Always practice safe sex, in the game I'm just a vet
I don't care about respect that's why these niggas so upset
Aye, thrasher on my shirt, dirty vans on my feet
Trap boomin' in the street, runnin' laps where my cleats
Niggas know how I'm rockin', I ain't gotta say it twice
I be posted livin' life, drop a four up in my sprite, just to get me through the night 
Aye, she call me the plug, smoke my drugs, get a lot of love, fuck me in the club
Throwin' ones, we don't fuck with dubs, niggas know what's up
We messed up, shooters in the cut, they gon' wet you up

Tryna find a purpose, can you tell me what's the meaning?
Let them talk about me, swear these people so deceiving
I can never understand it, livin' like a rockstar
I'm not from this planet, got a lot of battles, I don't need a bandit
She say he won't  with us pull up 
Yeah, shoutout the ones who really hold me down
These circus rappers actin' like some clowns
I put in work cause I can't joke around 
The whole team meetin' even when I'm not in town
You gotta understand, as a man, I had this plan my whole life
I used to, sit on my porch with a pen and just write
I used to, stay up late and study music all night
And for my dream, I'm all in, I never think twice 
I ball so much, I make that shit look easy
You talk down on me like you ain't believe me
I know there's times when I thought you were greedy
Now it's my time, you gon' lie like you need me

My mind trippin, I be gone I think I need some space
I'm always stressed out and I know you see it in my face
I'm hardly sleeping, I been up, I'm constantly awake
I try not to think too much but the pain won't go away
And lately I've been-Yet to be TranscribedAnd I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that Super Soaker, well girl just let me see
I ain't worried 'bout shit, these niggas ain't scaring me
I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul
I roll up the Mary Jane, no they can't feel my pain
I'm still trapping everyday, I think I'm stuck in my ways
If you looking for a handout get the fuck out my face
I don't care about no friends because they all were just fake
In my inbox like I owe you, I got this by myself
I was broken down bad when you said you would help
Now I'm up, they love to hate me, that's just bad for your health
And she say she a college girl but left her books on the shelf
She gon' fuck me like a porn star, a rock star
Trying to skrt off in that fast car, like NASCAR
Girl you know I got a cold heart
If I would give it to you, would you tear that shit apart
Red roses on my grave, bury me with art
And with some Backwoods and a lighter just so I could spark
Midnight rider, never put the car in park
I'm shining bright just like a light 'cause I came from the dark
I ain't never had nobody, put that on my mommy
I might have to catch a body if you try to stop me
She ride like a Kawasaki and she like it sloppy
Oh you got a hotty body, come ride on my Johnny
I'm go show you the wave, just give me some space
Why you all up in my face like you need a taste
Good designer on my waist, shooters keep the K
I tell them boys to play it safe, don't lay in your grave
I ain't never taking time off, I'm steady grinding
I'm never lying, was never crying
Take flights I'm flying, no you can't see me
Say you need me but you deceive me
And I got all the drugs in the world that you need
We get high to pass time but bitch I ain't no fiend
I got money on my mind, I be stacking my green
Shawty said she like my style, I be dripping with ease
Please don't send me naked pictures, I don't like to be teased
Say she got that Super Soaker, well girl just let me see

I was destined for this life, this is my destiny
Friends wanna be friends when you doing the most
How you tell me you my bro then you went out and told
Niggas say they down to ride but be folding like clothes
Purple hearts all on my garment, I ain't trusting a soul
Said I ain’t never forgotten, not a soul worth remembering
'Cause all these motherfuckers turn to foe when they envy
So I don't talk, I work hard
'Cause you could be someone today and just be nobody tomorrow
She said I'll never be shit but a goddamn rock star
That blunt ash on the floor

Okay gang in this bitch they will get involved

You know I gotta keep it real and let the fake dissolve
And I ain't worried 'bout these hoes you can have 'em all
Okay I had to get my bands up, her hands up, shawty go on and pull your pants up, and stand up
I can give it to you late night, late night
Swim all in you like a great white she tastes right
Oh my god shawty a nudist that booty stupid
Broke her heart like I'm cupid, I've been a nuisance
I'm like Freddy with the Krueger, shine like a jeweler

They like how you so persistent? I'm born to get it
I'm like Jordy on my Pippins please don't forget it
All these niggas be my children I feel like Nikki
She get high off the sticky white bitch named Vicky
I see how I came up, yuh, they didn't think I was for real
I'm just tryna stack a mill I need a house up on the hills
Oh my god, long days, people said I wouldn't make it
Now I'm smokin' on Jamaican, eyes low like I am asian
Oh yeah, they don't understand I had to paint the vision
Momma told me I was trippin', now she see I wasn't kiddin'
I got people sayin' sorry honestly I'm not forgiving
Honestly I've been a great repeat that shit in every sentence
I got bitches down to fuck me yeah they ready to go
I got people on my dick because I'm destined to blow
Can't forget when I was down that's why I sip purple rain
Niggas say I switched up, I think I needed a change
And I'm coming for revenge like I'm OVO
Coast to coast smokin' dope with exotic hoes
And I'm only 17 but I'm still the man
Don't fear man, get your bans, you don't need a friend
And yeah I'm tryna go to Texas just to vibe off the energy
Built a lotta enemies I guess it wasn't meant to be
Back on my grimy shit, she just want a wedding ring
I'm the type to lay low then pop out make the fucking scene, nigga
