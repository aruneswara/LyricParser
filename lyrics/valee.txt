ChaseTheMoney, ChaseTheMoneyЯ заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу, заберу, заберу...
Это же все, что мы не хотели
Но, все эти чувства, мы словно летели, но
Глазки опущены временными метелями
В этом тумане висели неделями
Ты же не узнаешь меня, я не простой
Все же доверяешь мне, сегодня я твой
Я не открываюсь до конца тебе в ночь
Но ты уже знаешь, больше нечем помочь
Все что я хотел это любить и мечтать
Каждый день летать и каждый день отмечать
А порою модно заставить страдать
Все может дать, но рукою забрать
Мне бы назад, но там нету пути
Долго летим, но пора бы сойти
Я ведь с тобой набирал высоту
Кто мне сказал, что я выбрал не ту?
Я заберу тебя с собой... Я заберу тебя с собой...
Заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу, заберу, заберу...
Я заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу, заберу, заберу...
Пусть мысли не дают покоя мне
Пусть я упал и я сейчас на дне
Я знаю точно, я с тобой смогу
И мне плевать я тебя сберегу
Пусть самый сильный ветер бьет мне в грудь
Если ты любишь, то со мною будь
Я заберу тебя с собой в туман
Завтра начну с нуля, а сегодня...
Я заберу тебя с собой... Я заберу тебя с собой...
Заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу, заберу, заберу...
Я заберу тебя с собой, этот город не родной
Убежим, куда наши глаза глядят, я живой
Заберу тебя с собой, мы сливаемся с толпой
Заберу, заберу, заберу...I get my work from the Narco

Одна, пусть даже для всех плохая
Одна, со мною не проста

Но она одна, со мной непростая
Одна, пусть даже для всех плохая
Одна, со мною не проста
Со мною не проста, со мною непростая
Среди людей, тебя искал всегда
Пусть для тебя, мои слова вода
Я буду долго, долго забывать
Как ты смотрела, тогда на меня
Я среди народа тот, о ком не забудут
Ты играешь со мной, так что невпроворот
Ты словно запретный плот,ты самый запретный плот
Я все свои мысли в этот блокнот
Но она одна, со мной непростая
Одна, пусть даже для всех плохая
Одна, со мною не проста

На гипнозах днями занозными жили прогнозами
Не любили актуального все что
По стареньким правилам делал неправильно
Мне за двадцать буквально
Я порой бываю за районами спальными
До тебя пытаюсь донести самое нужное все что нам нужно
И эта боль закрутила пацана так легко словно ветер
Гуляет по крышам мы это слышим сука и мы этим дышим
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — пой от души пока ты молодой бой
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — стой эта боль закрутила с головой
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — пой от души пока ты молодой бой
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — стой эта боль закрутила с головой
Я не верю в эти странные сказки
Я не верю в ваши белые маски
Мы достанем свое из под пыли
Как бы нам бездну усердно не рыли
Жили любили как дети любили
Где нас любимое время носило
Щас на холодных и тонких подстилах
Время животного дикого мира
Знай, время теплая вода
Молодая кровь бежит по нашим проводам
Самое прекрасное, самое печальное время для нас
Время за нас
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — пой от души пока ты молодой бой
Не кричи за жизнь пока ты молодой
Пацан молодой — стой эта боль закрутила с головой

Руки на стол, это просто фастфуд
Жизнь не , похуй на этот костюм
Учёба парит паренька, учёба губит паренька
Родители тебя осудят
И даже если в кармане нули
И даже если душат этажи
Забей на все советы как те жить
Ведь жизнь всего одна

        Твои синие глаза накрывают нас волной
Я тонул в тебе вчера, ты тянула за собой
В небе розовый закат заменила темнота
Чтоб остаться до утра, мне пришлось тебя спасать
Ты девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет
Моя девочка с картинки - заплаканны глаза
Я листаю по привычке, так и не успев сказать:
Ты девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет
Моя девочка с картинки - заплаканны глаза
Я листаю по привычке, так и не успев сказать:
Ты стала дальше звёзд и ближе, чем дыхание
Ты не в моей системе, но в моём подсознании
Ты алгоритм души, ты хуже всех бездушных
Ты лучшая из лучших, но каждый раз всё рушишь
Моя-моя проблема, мой странный парадокс
С тобой мне охуенно, с тобой время - песок
Дарила мне надежду, но забрала с собой
Ты лучшая во Вселенной, но я не пойду с тобой
Ведь, ты девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет
Девочка с картинки - заплаканны глаза
Листаю по привычке, не успев сказать
Я девочка с картинки
Ты девочка с картинки, из пепла твой портрет
Мои мысли - невидимки из дыма сигарет

        Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Люди травятся, люди так меняются
Но люди влюбляются, теряются, словно, в кино
Все были лучшими, казались все простыми
Печально, но порой от нас уходят молодыми
Мы так временно, но зато уверенно
Верим в себя и мы идем вперед намеренно
Бывает так, бросает вниз обратно эта жизнь
Мы пролетаем со слезами эти этажи
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодая ночь, молодые мы, молодые наши мысли
Мы летим туда, где горят огни, прожигая свои жизни
Забери меня, забери всех нас туда, где вечность
Молодость, ты моя бесконечность
Мы так временно, но зато уверенно
Верим в себя и мы идем вперед намеренно
Бывает так, бросает вниз обратно эта жизнь
Мы пролетаем со слезами эти этажи
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом
Молодость, ты делаешь нам больно
Чем же ты бываешь недовольна?
Мне тебя порой так не хватало
В холода укроешь одеялом

        И снова седая ночь
И только ей доверяю я
Знаешь седая ночь
Ты все мои тайны
Но даже и ты помочь
Не можешь, и темнота твоя
Мне одному совсем
Совсем ни к чему, ни к чему
Это бездна, читай меня по губам
Честно, этой ночью я буду в хлам
Каждый день я делю по-полам
По району и темным дворам
Эта музыка в темной ночи
Заставляет меня улыбаться
Но только не Вам
К черту все принципы, 
Я готов уступить, не примите за слабость
Вольная птица, я взлетаю наверх
Но не вижу там радость
Белая Луна меня манила в ночь опять
Но я не знал, но я не знал...
И снова седая ночь
И только ей доверяю я
Знаешь седая ночь
Ты все мои тайны
Но даже и ты помочь
Не можешь, и темнота твоя
Мне одному совсем
Совсем ни к чему, ни к чему
Ночь рисует эскизы, собираю все мои мысли
Я так сильно верил, что оступился
Но снова контрольный выстрел
Не взрывать на перемены, вечные измены
Молодая кровь, она бежит по моим венам
Я искал и находил, влюблял в себя и любил
Боялся, что я остыл, поднялся, но не забыл
Я бегу по этим лужам, никому не нужный
Я не болен, но сегодня этим миром я простужен
И снова седая ночь
И только ей доверяю я
Знаешь седая ночь
Ты все мои тайны
Но даже и ты помочь
Не можешь, и темнота твоя
Мне одному совсем
Совсем ни к чему, ни к чемуI’m rollin’ up that extendo, I’m extra

Switchin’ lanes too fast, I need an extra signal, pouring’ extra mud, my cup stay extra filthy
Flipped to buy a extra building, my bitch in her extra feelings
Conversation with a millionaire, I just brainstorm on how the fuck to get one
Walked in Diesel for some underwear, be payin’ extra, you know I can’t pick one

Killin’ shit, I’m extra guilty, extra mud got me feelin’ extra tilted

А что, если с другой летал?
А что, если я самый отвратный

Разговаривают о запрете
Мы давно с тобой уже не дети
Мы давно с тобой уже не дети
Я не стану тебе самым-самым
Ни Ромео, ни герой романа
Я такой же, как и ты, упрямый
Но тебя сегодня так же мало
Стану другим, если ты со мной
Все кричат — парень будь собой
Подливаешь яд, и сердца горят
Эпизод любви до конца отснят
Это самое страшное дело
Полюбить то, что давно сгорело
Полюбить холодное тело
11 ровно минут, аллё!
Нас с тобой здесь не найдут, аллё!
Пусть все кричат, а мы здесь, и-е
Прячемся среди камней вдвоем
Я раздеваю тебя, аллё!
Нет, ты смотри мне в глаза, аллё!
Перед тобой я из кожи вон
Я открываю глаза, это сон
Художник и бедная леди, разговаривают о запрете
Разлетаются во всех масс-медиа
О любви, в которой нет трагедий
Ты уйдешь сегодня без ответа
Буду ждать тебя, но нет привета
Я сегодня, как всегда один
В своей темноте из CD картин
Каждый день я тебя ищу
Каждый день я тебе пишу
Рифмами, красками
Минуты ведь были прекрасными
Это самое страшное дело
Полюбить то, что давно сгорело
Полюбить холодное тело
11 ровно минут, аллё!
Нас с тобой здесь не найдут, аллё!
Пусть все кричат, а мы здесь, и-е
Прячемся среди камней вдвоем
Я раздеваю тебя, аллё!
Нет, ты смотри мне в глаза, аллё!
Перед тобой я из кожи вон
Я открываю глаза, это сон
11 ровно минут, аллё!
Нас с тобой здесь не найдут, аллё!
Пусть все кричат, а мы здесь, и-е
Прячемся среди камней вдвоем
Я раздеваю тебя, аллё!
Нет, ты смотри мне в глаза, аллё!
Перед тобой я из кожи вон
Я открываю глаза, это сон

        I’ma go get what I want
I’ma go
I wake up, get what I want, I had to get what I could
My lil ho suck me too good, my coupe the color that raw
OG gas come straight from Cali, I spend that check like I ball
I walk right into the store, pick out whatever I want
I want my engine in back, I’m out here chasin’ a sack
And then I’m gettin’ my way, I’m out here smokin’ that pack
I’m not here chasin’ these skeezers, they bite off the hand that’ll feed ‘em
You out here finessin’ your plug, fuck ‘round, you know you gon’ need him
I wake up, get what I want, I spent six thousand in Will
I could’ve bought me a bike, you know my bitches like hoes
They only fuck with them dykes, my partner play with that raw
No Pyrex pot, it ain’t right, I want white diamonds, VVSs
Them bitches light up the night, feelin’ like I’m Michael Knight
I just looked left, seen the police, so you know I made a right
Drop the coupe off, spray it white, my lil bitch only want pipe
Ay, I walk ‘round with the nina loaded, runnin’ up on me ain’t wise
Speed the coupe like it’s hot-wired, feed the fam all on my mind
Molly and lean mixed with Percocet and Xans, but I’m not tired
I stay ten toes on the ground, I put a peephole on my nine
Pussy nigga tried to bust through my front door, I put you on the ground
I wake up, get what I want, I had to get what I could
My lil ho suck me too good, my coupe the color that raw
OG gas come straight from Cali, I spend that check like I ball
I walk right into the store, pick out whatever I want
I want my engine in back, I’m out here chasin’ a sack
And then I’m gettin’ my way, I’m out here smokin’ that pack
I’m not here chasin’ these skeezers, they bite off the hand that’ll feed ‘em
You out here finessin’ your plug, fuck ‘round, you know you gon’ need him
I wake up, get what I want, my cellphone was boomin’ like Hell
I had to get me two phones, my lil bitch wanted some friends
I had to get her two more, all I do chase dividends
I fuck her money, make more, yeah, I got that pocket rocket, ay
I take it with me on the go, can’t chase that dough if you slow
I stay afloat like a boat, if you a drug dealer, put your wrist in the pot
When it come out, it glow, I do it twice, pour a four
I fucked her twice on the floor, when I pulled up in the coupe with no ceiling, I know she got horny
I wake up, get what I want, I had to get what I could
My lil ho suck me too good, my coupe the color that raw
OG gas come straight from Cali, I spend that check like I ball
I walk right into the store, pick out whatever I want
I want my engine in back, I’m out here chasin’ a sack
And then I’m gettin’ my way, I’m out here smokin’ that pack
I’m not here chasin’ these skeezers, they bite off the hand that’ll feed ‘em
You out here finessin’ your plug, fuck ‘round, you know you gon’ need him
I wake up, get what I want, I had to get what I could

I spend that check like I ball
I walk right into the store, pick out whatever I want
I wake up, get what I wantТы ту самую... Ты та самая...
Ты ту самую... Ты та самая...

Я снова в самолетах пропадаю до утра
Или еле засыпаю, здесь то холод, то жара
В смысле, в моей лучшей жизни, да в свои двадцать один
Моя жизнь, как карусель, моя жизнь, как серпантин
Разошлись дороги с лучшими людьми этой планеты
Нету света в этом мире, вранье все, в этих газетах
Я с самого начала, где внутри кричало
Что б мы со своей командой качали пустые залы
Ты тот самый... Ты тот самый...
Возьми всю свою волю в кулак и найди самую
Самую родную дорогу за небесами
Всегда только вперед за неземными чудесами, друг
Ты тот самый... Ты тот самый...
Возьми всю свою волю в кулак и найди самую
Самую родную дорогу за небесами
Всегда только вперед за неземными чудесами, друг
Ты ту самую... Ты та самая...
Ты ту самую... Ты та самая...
Ты ту самую...
Завтра будет лучше, чем сегодня и вчера
Завтра новая весна, завтра лучшие года
Мы поймем это потом, когда будет все не по чем
Когда больно, а вы вдвоем
Когда весело - вы вдвоем
Где все те, кто называл тебя важным в своей истории
Прячется в квадратах огражденной территории
Хватит с меня слов, хватит с меня мысли
Я уже заблудился во всех этих ваших числах
Ты тот самый... Ты тот самый...
Возьми всю свою волю в кулак и найди самую
Самую родную дорогу за небесами
Всегда только вперед за неземными чудесами, друг
Ты тот самый... Ты тот самый...
Возьми всю свою волю в кулак и найди самую
Самую родную дорогу за небесами
Всегда только вперед за неземными чудесами, друг
Ты ту самую... Ты та самая...
Ты ту самую... Ты та самая...
Ты ту самую...Bouncin’ with six sluts at the Four Seasons
