Attention Deficit Hyperactivity Disorder, or better known as ADHD, is a mental disorder that affects an individual's ability to focus
Causing them to move around more frequently
They may also have trouble controlling their impulsive behaviors
One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for the homies in the chow hall 
Three times for them hoes on the internet
Shittin' on niggas when they really should get out more
Four times for the days that were all bad 
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back 
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 
Kidnap a nigga like ISIS 
Turn a whole world to a crisis 
Walk around the city with a ice pick
I been paranoid, usually, I ain't like this 
Ain't no tellin' how crazy I might get, uh 
Beat the police with a nightstick 
In my whole life, I been lifeless
Now I'm so fly, I'm a muhfuckin' flight risk 
Fuck a couple hoes 'til I pass out 
Niggas throwin' stones at my glass house 
I remember sleepin' on my dad's couch 
Now I got the Bentley, and it's blacked out 
Family lookin' at me like a cash cow 
Errybody dissin' just to have clout 
Thought you had a chance, now you assed out
Nigga, I'm the muhfuckin' man, where you at now? 
Fuck it, I'ma hit 'em 'til they jumpin'
I ain't trippin', this is nothin' 
I been livin' in the dungeon
I done held a couple grudges
Went to hell and got abducted
Meet the devil, I'm his cousin
I ain't settlin' for nothin' 
Got a metal in the truck, I keep a semi when I'm bussin'
Niggas duckin' 
Even Stevie Wonder could've see it comin' 
I ain't judgin', I just want the money, I don't need a budget
I been hungry, I ain't got no oven 
But I got the munchies, nigga
How you gon' move on the front line? 
If I don't fuck with you, I just cut ties 
My high school teacher said I'd never be shit
Tell that bitch that I turned out just fine 
And no, I don't know you for the twelfth time 
We do not share the same bloodline 
You love to run your mouth like a tough guy
Hope you keep the same energy when it's crunch time 
According to the American Psychiatric Association
It affects roughly eight percent of children
And two percent of adults
Commonly believed to only affect boys
Because they are perceived as rowdy and rambunctious
One time for them prayin' on my downfall 
Two times for them bitches in the South Shore 
Three times for them days on the block
Gettin' chased by the cops like a motherfuckin' outlaw
Four times for them days that were all bad 
Five times for the bitches who ain't called back 
Six times for the kids like me who got ADHD just to— 
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses 
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
What's beef?
Beef is when you murder motherfuckers on a beat
Kill 'em all, kill 'em all
Nah, nah, what's beef?
Beef is brothers dyin' over shit
That never mattered in the first place, lyin' in the street
What's peace?
Peace is when you leave it in the past, let it heal like a cast
When enough time pass, then you blast
Kinda like John Wick, bars like a convict
Fuck around and you don't wanna start shit, woo!
Comin' with the hot shit, all they do is talk shit
You could never top it, boy, just stop, stop it
High and drunk, call that HD vision
All these other motherfuckers full of indecision
And I murder with precision all over your television
I'm numero uno, number one and you is just a subdivision
Never listen, we gon' leave them missin'
That's the mission like ISIS 
Ain't no time to bicker over who the nicest
It's Logic, it's obvious, just ask the audience
I've come to body this shit 
Yes, it's egregious, I'm Regis
You Kelly, you pussy, you pussy
Don't push me, I'm Louis Vuitton
You at Target with your mom
On the internet still hatin' on my last post 
I just sent a steak back at Mastro's, my god
Me and Joyner need a couple hearses 
Double homicide, kill the beat and the verses
Everybody livin' on the surface
But we came from the underground, yeah, we deserve it
Yeah, uh, far from the minimum, killin' 'em with no Ritalin
And 5'9" was the middleman to get 'em in the same room
Now we on the same tune, and we sealed the game's doom
The illest of lyricists on the same shit
RattPack, clap back on the gang shit
Do it for the love of rap, not for the fame shit, woo!
One time for the Grammy that I never got
Two times for the Garden that I sold out
Three times for the street crimes that I committed
Yeah, I did it, but thank God that I made it out
Four times 'cause I'm a fuckin' bastard
Five times Platinum with my last shit
Six times for the beats and the rhymes
Fuck the heat and the crime
Keep the peace like a waistline, woo!
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS, ISIS
ISIS, ISIS, ISISGo ahead and call me a coward
Say that I'm not strong because I'm not like you
Go ahead and call me crazy
'Cause I live in a maze, tell me how about you?
I think I live in my head
Sometimes I think that I'm dead, I hide behind my youth
Know I been losing my mind
And I'm a little behind, step inside my shoes
'Cause I've never been happy with myself
And I don't need no one feeling bad for me
Tryna to offer me pity and throw jabs at me
Wanna give me advice and then laugh at me
Behind closed doors, just close the door
Let me be by myself—just me and myself
I'm tired of living, I cry
I hear it's easy to die, I wanna see for myself
And I know that sounds crazy to everyone else
But I'm depressed as fuck, stressed as fuck
Ain't no medicine that could cure what's the test as drugs
I mean, I need extra love
And that ain't even enough, said that ain't even enough
And where the fuck is God? 
Damn, maybe I ain't believing enough
But today we gonna see if he's real
And if He is, then I guess I'm prolly going to hell
Look, I ain't wanna die like this
I ain't picture my life like this
They don't know what it's like like this
Pretending I'm happy so I can smile like this, and laugh like you
Sometimes I wonder if I ever act like you
Could I finally fit in and maybe relax like, "Woo!"
Or would you feel lost without me?
'Cause honestly, I think the world is better off without me
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is I don't care how they feel about my feelings
I made up my mind, I'm going out like Robin Williams
I guess I'm not the Ordinary People of John Legend
And I've been suicidal since the day I was nine, shit
Okay, the day I was nine
I've been tired of being bullied, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told me I should take it one day at a time
And dammit, look at me now, fuck
Fuck, pen runnin' out, shit, fu—, ugh
Look, just know it's a new day
But if you reading this, then it's prolly too late, blaow!
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I hope you got what you wanted
I hope you finally happy, it's too late for you
Been going out of my mind
You don't know how many times that I done prayed for you
I hope you hear me, goddammit
'Cause I got so much shit that I wanna say to you
I used to shine, now I'm all in the dark
I remember I used to tell you to follow your heart
But goddammit, look at you now, it's all of your fault
How could you? Maybe it's my fault
I shoulda paid more attention to what you been doin'
Maybe I should have been more of an influence
I can't believe that you're dead, I fu–
I read your letter and all I could do is have mixed feelings about it
But I'll forever be attached to you 
Part of me feels bad for you
A part of me feels like you weak and I'm mad at you
And I don't mean to be insensitive
But I don't understand how we couldn't prevent this shit
You took the easy way out, goddammit, you did
I mean, look what you did, I'm so fucking upset
How could you be so selfish?
Nigga, how could you be so selfish?
Now you're gone, you done left me so helpless
I wonder what God thinks, I hope you in God's place behaving yourself
Yo, what the fuck you gotta say for yourself? 
Look, I really feel lost without you
I hate the fact you think the world is better off without you
And my mind's spinning, this is the line finish
Truth is: I don't care how you feel about my feelings
And I'd be lying to you if I told you I'm fine, listen
I know that you can hear me, all I need is like five minutes
I just wanna reach inside the casket and pull you out
I'm sorry this is something that we both couldn't figure out
I wish I could hear you now, is your soul missing?
I wonder if you could do it again, would you do it different?
Tell me what death is like
Was it meant for you, brodie? Did the heaven support it?
Are you fucking happy now? Did you get what you wanted?
Isn't this what you wanted? I feel the temperature falling
And you've been suicidal back then you were nine?
Yeah, even back then, you was nine
We was living on the edge, couldn't stay out the fire
Grandma told us we should take it one day at a time
And damn it, look at you now, shit
But it's a new day
And if you can't hear me, it's probably too late, fuck!
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
Just make sure you tell my family it's okay, I'm sorry
But it's too late, I'm sorry, so much weighing on me
I don't wanna live to see another day, I'm sorry
But I can't stay, I'm sorry, so much weighing on meWith all due respect
I don't have pity for you black niggas, that's the way I feel
Screamin', "Black Lives Matter"
All the black guys'd rather be deadbeats than pay your bills
Yellin', "Nigga," this, and, "Nigga," that
Call everybody, "Nigga," and get a nigga mad
As soon as I say, "Nigga," then everyone react
And wanna swing at me and call me racist 'cause I ain't black
Well pound that, then
Talkin' 'bout slavery like you was around back then
Like you was pickin' cotton off the fuckin' ground back then
Like you was on the plantation gettin' down back then
Aight, look
I see a black man aimin' his gun
But I'd rather see a black man claimin' his son
And I don't mean just for one day and you done, I mean
You still trapped in a rut
And I work my ass off and pay my taxes for what?
So you can keep livin' on free government assistance?
Food stamps for your children, but you still tryna sell 'em
For some weed and some liquor or a fuckin' babysitter?
While you party on the road 'cause you ain't got no fuckin' goals?
You already late
You motherfuckers need to get your damn priorities straight, wait
It's like you're proud to be fake
But you lazy as fuck
And you'd rather sell drugs than get a job and be straight
And then you turn around and complain about the poverty rate? Fuck outta my face
You can't escape problems
You can pray for some change, but can't break a dollar
Got nobody else to blame, so you blame Donald
"They fuck the world with a Make America Great condom"
My voice been back
I'm not racist, my sister's boyfriend's black
I'm not racist, my sister-in-law's baby cousin Tracy got a brother and his girlfriend's black
My head's in the cloud
Heard there's not enough jobs for all the men in your house
Maybe we should build a wall to keep the Mexicans out
Or maybe we should send 'em all to the ghetto for now
I'm not racist, and I never lie
But I think there's a disconnect between your culture and mine
I worship the Einsteins, study the Steve Jobs
But you ride 2Pac's dick like he was a fuckin' god, oh my God
And all you care about is rappin' and stuntin' and bein ratchet, and that's the nigga within you
Music rottin' your brain and slowly start to convince you
Then you let your kids listen and then the cycle continues
Blame it all on the menu, blame it on those drinks
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on white privileges, blame it on white kids
And just blame it on white citizens, aim at the vice president
Bunch of class clowns
Niggas kneelin' on the field, that's a flag down
How dare you try to make demands for this money?
You gon' show us some respect, you gon' stand for this country, nigger
I'm not racist, I'm just prepared for this type of war
I heard Eminem's rap at the awards, who's he fightin' for?
Y'all can take that motherfucker too, he ain't white no more
It's like you wanna be so famous
You'll do anything for attention and a little payment
I can't take you nowhere without people pointin' fingers
Pants hangin' off your ass, you ain't got no home trainin'?
Pull your fuckin' pants up, nigga
Put that suit back on, take that durag off
Take that gold out your mouth, quit the pitiful stuff
And then maybe police'd stop killin' you fucks, yo, what the fuck?
I'm not racist
It's like we're livin' in the same building, but split into two floors
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story, I wish that I knew yours
I wish that I knew yours
I'm not racist, I swear
With all disrespect
I don't really like you white motherfuckers, that's just where I'm at
Screaming, "All Lives Matter," is a protest to my protest, what kind of shit is that?
And that's one war you'll never win
The power in the word, "Nigga," is a different sin
We shouldn't say it, but we do, and that's just what it is
But that don't mean that you can say it just 'cause you got nigga friends
Nigga
That word was originated for you to keep us under
And when we use it, we know that's just how we greet each other
And when you use it, we know there's a double meaning under
And even if I wasn't picking cotton physically
That don't mean I'm not affected by the history
My grandmama was a slave, that shit gets to me
And you ain't got no motherfuckin' sympathy, you pussy nigga
I'm sorry, you can never feel my life
Tryna have faith, but I never felt alright
It's hard to elevate when this country's ran by whites
Judging me by my skin color and my blackness
Tryna find a job but ain't nobody call me back yet
Now I gotta sell drugs to put food in my cabinet
You crackers ain't slick, this is all a part of your tactics
Don't talk about no motherfuckin' taxes
When I ain't making no dough
You think you know everything, but you don't
You wanna copy our slang and everything that we know
Try to steal black culture and then make it your own, woah
Fuck, I'm exhausted
I can't even drive without the cops tryna start shit
I'm tired of the systematic racism bullshit
All you do is false shit, this the shit that I'm forced with
And you don't know shit about my people, that's what bothers you
You don't know about no fried chicken or no barbecue
You don't know about the two-step or no loose change
You don't know about no 2 Chainz or no Kool-Aid, you don't know
And even though Barack was half as black
You hated President Obama, I know that's a fact
You couldn't wait to get him out and put a cracker back
And then you gave us Donald Trump and now it's payback for that
I'm not racist, I never lied
But I know there's a disconnect between your culture and mines
Yeah, I praise 2Pac like he was a fuckin' god
He was fighting for his life way before he fuckin' died, nigga, die, nigga
And all you care about is money and power and being ugly and that's the cracker within you
Hatred all in your brain, it slowly start to convince you
And then you teach it to your children until the cycle continue
Blame it on Puerto Rico, blame it on OJ
Blame it on everybody except for your own race
Blame it on black niggas and blame it on black citizens
Aim at the black businesses, I ain't saying I'm innocent, but
I might be any day now
Treatin' everybody how you want and any way how
I swear North Korea 'bout to bomb us any day now
And now I'm duckin' every time I hear a fuckin' plane now, shit
You know I make a lot of sense, but you just can't admit it
When Eminem went against Trump, that was the illest
'Cause even though he's white, he let us know he standin' with us
I'm not racist, but I cry a lot
You don't know what it's like to be in a frying pot
You don't know what it's like to mind your business
And get stopped by the cops and not know if you 'bout to die or not
You worry 'bout your life, so you take mine
I love you, but I fuckin' hate you at the same time
I wish we could trade shoes or we could change lives
So we could understand each other more, but that'd take time
I'm not racist
It's like we livin' in the same building, but split into both sides
I'm not racist
But there's two sides to every story and now you know mine
Can't erase the scars with a bandage
I'm hopin' maybe we can come to an understandin'
Agree to disagree, we could have an understandin'
I'm not racistYuh, yuh, uh
Woo, , yuh, yuh, yuh, yup
Pandora, Pandora, Pandora
I don't really fuck with no... 
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang, Dolce gang
'Sace gang, Prada gang, lot of gangs 
I don't really fuck with no brand names 
Joyner 'bout to go on a rampage 
They don't wanna see me let the chopper bang, yeah
Get this bitch jumping like Shabba Ranks, ooh
What's a Lil Pump to a rocket flame, yeah
Turn your pink dreads into pocket chains 
All you new rappers don't be talkin' 'bout shit except doin' drugs
Wonder how you got a name 
Sippin' lean, takin' E, Percocets, Purple drank, Xanax, everything sound the same, fuck
Bunch of drug addicts in the house of pain 
Hope you niggas suffer til you pop a vein, yeah
This shit made your mother wanna ovulate, yeah
This shit make conductors wanna stop a train
Gucci, Fendi, Louis, Prada, Dolce 
Back when I was broke and no one know me 
I couldn't afford it and now that I got the money
I don't even want this shit 'cause it ain't for me 
I always been myself, you don't know me 
Yeah I was so depressed, I was lonely
The man on the horse, all I had was Ralph Lauren
Then I went and signed a deal and bought a pony 
Yeah I'm taking it back and then I'm smacking you bitches and laughing
And I'm killing them, hacking them, and sending your body right back to them
You wonder what's happening
I'm flipping new syllables, acronyms
I guess I'ma practice it
You fuckers are fucking embarrassing 
You ain't gonna be happy when I'm on top and I'm gonna be popping
All of you gonna be dropping like birds dropping all on your conscious
All you niggas are watchin I'm spittin', slap all on your coffin, R.I.P
You lost and you fuckas sleepin' you're pillow talkin' 
And you dream all day, that's per year 
All you ho niggas leave your purse here 
I am your favorite rapper's worst fear 
Raised in the mud crying, dirt tears 
Just a bunch of kids in the high chair
Couldn't get a buzz even if you had lightyear
Wouldn't get no love even if your heart's right here
Niggas got guns so nobody want to fight fair, no
Hit 'em with the Ric Flair and the suplex
I ain't never been scared, bitch, I'm ruthless 
Raised by the ghetto
Know some gangs that'll get 'em
Split 'em right down the middle like a fuckin' duplex
Break a nigga toes, make 'em do the two-step
Crib full of hoes, now I feel like Hugh Hef
Got a bad stripper bitch, all we do is have sex
And she love suckin' dick so I call her loose neck 
Makin' a panic with my shit and I'm flippin' up banisters
I'm ready to handle and dismantle and crush and vanish
I hit 'em and send 'em into walls, then I got' em enchanted
Then my fuckin hands that holdin the hammer bangin' and slammin'
Killin' 'em in the ambulance, they dyin', they bleedin', they tremblin'
I'm really sick and I got a stiff as a fuckin' mannequin
I paint a picture a Picasso vision, all on my cellophane
I got 'em swingin' they on my dick and grabbin my pants again
Now, uno, dos, tres, cuatro, cinco 
I ain't Spanish but I know the lingo 
Atlantic told me that my flow a hundred
But my album ain't come unless I got a fuckin' single
Well I don't give a fuck about no hit record
I'ma just remix y'all shit and get big off it
I'ma just murder every mother fucking beat while I'm dreaming of gettin' paid in my mother fuckin' sleep, goddamn
Gucci gang, Louis gang, Fendi gang, Dolce gang
'Sace gang, Prada gang, lot of gangs 
I don't really fuck with no brand names
Joyner 'bout to go on a rampage, ooh
They don't wanna see me let the chopper bang 
Get this bitch jumping like Shabba Ranks, yeah
What's a Lil Pump to a rocket flame, woo
Gucci gang, Fendi gang, Prada gang 
All you new rappers don't be talkin' 'bout shit except doin' drugs
Wonder how you got a name, uh
Sippin' lean, takin' E, Percocets, Purple drank, Xanax, everything sound the same, fuck
Bunch of drug addicts in the house of pain 
And all you niggas suffer til you pop a vein, uh
Gucci gang, Fendi gang, Prada gang 
I don't really fuck with no brand names, yeahBottles in a bucket full of ice 
Better make room, vroom, hear the Lambo 
Bitch, better believe that I'ma sniper 
You know I'm 'bout to take you from your man though 
Pop up with the chopper at artificial niggas actin' like bitches
And it started up a epidemic
It don't make a difference, nigga, we winnin', I'm plenty grinnin'
Hunnid million platinum, fuck it, you ain't gotta listen 
You better step down to me
Feel the dick, bitch, open up your mouth to me
Now choke, talk to the dick, honestly
I'm dope, bitch, comin' like Eenie Meenie Miney Mo 
I don't like when I lose 
If I don't buy her them shoes, I don't like those 
Do anything that I want to
Think I'm gon' dance on the moon like Michael 
While I'm drivin', I'm moonwalkin' in the sky with some shooters
We jump inside of the Buick, you duck and hide from the Rugers 
A couple choppers, acoustic in the guitar with no music
Guess I'm alive and I use it, get stuck inside of the cubics 
I never lie, but the truth is I'm fuckin' tired of these losers
And all my life want the food when it's supper time and the juice 
But I'd rather die than to lose, it's a matter of time 'fore I lose it
And strategize with the movement-t-t-t-t-t 
Walk in the trap like a boss, ooh
Ho, you know I'm drippin' with the sauce, ooh
Pretty, with a face full of scars
All they did was build me up, tried to take me apart 
They ain't ever wanna celebrate like you have a label
Call the doctor, heard the chopper make 'em do the Macarena 
All you niggas sweet as candy, chocolate chip and Now and Later
Jolly Rancher, stick of bubblegum, it's watermelon flavored 
Get the paper, I'ma  on the corner
Heard you niggas got the juice, but I got Corona
Got a little Spanish bitch, I call her maricona
Joyner Lucas, bitch, I'm hotter than a fuckin' sauna 
Yeah, I make you niggas 
All you new niggas don't do it for me, look 
Bitch I'm the professor, you a student to me, woah
Designer shades on, like you cooler than me, wait 
All we do is win, you a loser to me
Rappers wanna talk about battle me 
You can't give me neck with a mouth full of cavities
Bunch of lil' niggas tried grabbin' me 
Five foot five, boy, you niggas like half of me
You don't wanna see the other side of me 
Hard to make 'em happy, all these bitches stay mad at me
I just might take her out to Applebee's 
Give her long dick and a strawberry daiquiri
Order Cheesecake Factory, bubblin', why you mumblin'?
What you utter? Stop stutterin', what you spend? Let me double it
Lime green 'Rari, two twins, call 'em double mints
If all you pussy niggas my kids, I'm in trouble then
Shut up 'fore I spank you for actin' up
Now I'm wakin' up in cabanas 'cause she bad as fuck
And all gorillas don't want bananas 'less your chain is tucked
You wiggity-wack with the strap, you cross Chris, make you jump
I criss-cross with the pump, ain't no bricks in the trunk
Leave that shit for the chumps, I still get what I want
Don't wanna believe in my mind, but you believe in my dump
I'm takin' a knee for my side, could give a fuck 'bout the owners
Nigga look at my eyes, you 'bout to give me my bonus
And every motherfuckin' record, that's a hit, I record it 
And e'ry motherfuckin' snitch up in this bitch, they report it 
You paid your way for this fade and can't even afford it
75 mil', look at me now 
And all these bad bitches can't keep their feet down 
You don't really wanna see Brown
Need to stop all that shit talkin', put the seat down
Joyner, I don't really feel these niggas
Hol' up, I ain't gotta pay to kill these niggas
Time is money, need to fuck around and bill these niggas
Vet, so I'm finna good will these niggas  
I'ma kill these niggas, I should grill these niggas
Take flex, Fresh Prince, Uncle Phil these niggas 
Oh shit, I'm the shit, you could smell me, nigga
Break ribs, yeah, you don't want no real beef, nigga
I say As-salāmu ʿalaykum when I tear apart some bacon
Hoe, you actin' like a pig, you fuckin' filthy, nigga 
Now the police tryna lock me in the prison, said, "I'm guilty"
I said, "Da da da da da, come and kill me, nigga" 
They must have forgot that I'm psycho 
Oh, you want war? Say no more
Turn your fuckin' block into a light show 
You better be sure, better be sure
I'm the realest nigga that I know 
And I'm so bored, I might switch cars
I saved a lotta money on Geico 
The neighbors knockin' on my door, what the fuck you want?
Bitch, I'm alright 
Listen, nigga, mind your business, I'm so sick of niggas
Tellin' me how I been livin' my life 
Sick of bumpin' shoulders, now I'm runnin' over
Every motherfucker who ain't wanna get in my ride 
I was watchin', you was shoppin'
Ain't never had the shit in my size 
Now I'm poppin', I'm poppin'
And your bitch keep hittin' my line
It's complicated, fuckin' up with my main bitch
Givin' it to the side bitch at the same damn time
Puttin' my face in it, never wastin' it
I'ma lay in it, hit it, hit it one more time
And I'ma proceed and play with the pussy
You know I don't keep my cape on a hoodie
But I keep a Uzi, it's a doozie, make a movie if you're actin' stupid
So I'm willing to die for this shit
I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
So my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
And if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'd probably be robbing and shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to ride for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit
Bitch, I'm a savage I spit at you bastards, I wonder what you gonna do to me, ho
I need to hear some more rapping
I'm just not impressed by your cash or your jewelry, ho
All you my soldiers and I'm a lieutenant
Goddammit, you should be saluting me, ho
I hope you know I ain't going nowhere
All you rappers just better get used to me, ho
Nigga, I'm Mr. Blue with my jeans, bought me a Jeep, 'cause I wasn't riding as much
My bank account looking weak, don't look at me, I ain't got time for no fun
Starting to feel like Tyrese, I'm 'bout to trip, and maybe start crying or som'
I might just hit up the Smith's, throw me a fit and wait for my wire to come
Ain't nobody give or show me love when I was coming up, I had to double up and tell these niggas buckle up before they ride
And they don't really wanna knuckle up, I hit 'em with the uppercut, I had these motherfuckers running for they life
Unidentified craft when I'm flying past, I'm an alien sailin' and if you look up in the sky
Blow your mind back, put your eyes back to your iPad, I'm an Iraqi in suicide
When the bombs are loaded and your mind explode in the wind
And you gon' sit down, repent
I was raised in the sewer; me and the 𝘐𝘵 clown are friends
Red balloons for your kids, sink my tooth in ya bitch
I lost too many friends, I don't do good with kids
What you know about riding dirty in the evening?
What you know about Ramen Noodles, and a pack of sazon seasoning
What you know about leaving the oven door open when there's no heat again
And the rent is due and your landlord try and throw you out on the streets again
Nigga, I was always dreaming of a Bentley and a fucking Lamborghini when I win 'em, I'ma finally get a break
If I didn't get it way before, I guarantee that if I talk to God, then I can say I got it when I prayed
She don't really want me to get petty, turn her dime into a penny, but she know I got a lot of shit to say
I can turn some water into henny, drink it up and let the semi shoot, I'll pop you niggas all up in the face
Blood all up in the lake, I
Wanna see your wake die
They don't wanna wave bye
Creep when I came by, teeth like a canine
Bleed through your Levi, we from the East Side
Eat when the beat's hot, tea from the teapot
Aim for the tree top, beg till your knees pop
Skrrt in a Nissan, swerve into three cars
You just a bird in a beehive, you just a cold in a room full of germs
Nigga, I said all of my idols and favorite rappers ain't been rhyming a lot
What the fuck happened to Jay Electronica? I wonder if he still got it or not
Whatever happened to Elzhi?
Whatever happened to Meth? What happened to Beans? Whatever happened to Lauryn?
What happened to Banks? Tell me what happened to Bleek?
What the fuck happened to Mos? What happened to Missy?
Nigga, what happened to Ghost?
Whatever happened to Cube?
What up with Common? What the fuck, where did they go?
Tell me what happened to Budden's, what about Luda?
I hope they ain't losing it now
Hope they get back to the music 'cause I need some new shit
I'm sick of these new niggas out, I'm that new nigga now
I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine niggas wanna war, 10 niggas on the floor, 11 niggas on the porch
12 killers wanna war, 13 carnivores, 14 Labradors, 15 dinosaurs, 16 Avatars
17 bombs or grenades at your rental car, 18 ways you can die when you have it all
I got I got one, two, three, four, five, six, seven, eight
Nine bitches wanna fuck, 10 niggas wanna rush, 11 hitters on a bus
12 think they one of us, 13 other guns, 14 runners-up, 15 rubber gloves, 16 double pumps
17 shots in your face till you cuddle up, 18 ways you can die tryna fuck with us
I'm willing to die for this shit
Said I'm ready to flip it and end up in prison the rest of my life for this shit
And my momma ain't want me, she got an abortion
I end up surviving this shit
Shit if I wanted somethin', I ain't got the money
I'll probably be robbing this shit
Don't know how much I cry for this shit
Said I am willing to die for this shit
You know murder's my hobby, inside of my closet's a bunch of dead bodies and shit
Niggas say that I'm cursed 'cause I go to church and stare at the Bible and shit
Shawty say I'm the worst cause I do my dirt, and I don't be hiding this shit
Joyner, wooh!Father, forgive me
I'm staring at this Bible as I keep glancing
Dear Lord, I got questions and I need answers
Tryna understand your vision, all I see is damage
Just a bunch of dead bodies in the street camping
A bunch of lost souls on their feet standing
We supposed to be your children, I thought we family
You're supposed to be my Father, bruh, I need answers
We don't need to die young, we just need chances
Tired of living on the edge so we keep scrambling
Tryna talk to these strippers but they keep dancing
We just wanna be number one like Steve Francis
Bow our heads, say a prayer, now the seed's planted
Everywhere I turn, I'm seeing MC's vanish
Lot of good niggas gone, I don't understand it
Lot of families lost and they sea stranded
I ain't tryna disrespect you, I just need answers
I know you're watching us from heaven thinking, "Who to save?"
Cherry pickin' who should go next and who should stay
I'd be on my way to heaven if I knew the way
And bring back every good nigga you choose to take
They say you never wrong, but you done made a few mistakes
'Cause you taking the wrong niggas, maybe you should trade
Trade us back all the real ones, remove the fakes
I think you should trade
Give us 2Pac back, and take that nigga Suge 
Let the legend resurrect and he gon' live for good 
I been screaming "Thug life" in every different hood 
If only you could bring him back, Lord, I wish you would
Give us Biggie, give us Pun, give us Triple X
Take that nigga Trump with you, that's a bigger threat
There's too much power for a coward with no intellect
That's a bigot with a collar, there's a disconnect
Niggas dying, Mama crying, Grandma need a tissue
Niggas shootin' up a church, now I need a pistol
All them niggas still livin', you don't see the issue
But how you take Selena and then you take Aaliyah with you?
I ain't tryna disrespect, just need to meet up with you 
I ain't tryna overstep, just want to reason with you 
Give us back our loved ones and take the evil with you 
Send them suckers straight to hell, they don't need a vigil 
I need you to give us back Martin Luther, take Martin Shkreli 
Give us back Malcolm, take R. Kelly
R.I.P. Lil Snupe, give that boy his life back
Take Eric Holder, give us Eric Wright back
I'm sending you this message, Lord, I hope you hit me right back
They say I'm on the wrong train, I know I'm on the right track 
'Cause Trayvon gone, and all he did was try to fight back
Zimmerman walk around free, we don't like that 
Why you take our mothers from us?
Our fathers and our sisters and our cousins from us?
Got these children getting murdered while they double dutchin'
Wonder why the fuck you take Nipsey Hussle from us?
Damn, you took a true king, a true brother from us
This a fuckin' marathon, but they runnin' from us
Now everybody got guns, niggas up to something
And every gangsta wanna prove that they tough or something
You know it's not fair, tell the truth, I've been in my feelings too
But if you took Emmett Till, at least take Dylann Roof
At least take James Holmes, I ain't even mad at that
Just bring back Whitney, and give us Michael Jackson back
Feds want me in the slammer, damn
Ain't no justice for Sandra Bland, we up like the ceiling fan
Lord, if you listenin', I'm just lookin' for a hand to hand
Take out the fuck niggas and give us back our fam again
Drownin' in my tears, tryna pray for something 
Wonder why you give us life for you to take it from us 
Wonder why you give us family then erase them from us 
Maybe hopefully you can have a conversation with us 
Maybe I'm just probably tripping 'cause I need a hug 
The hood can't find jobs, now we need a plug 
Everybody and their mama tryna be a thug
I don't go to church 'cause I'm afraid of being judged
I've been starin' at the ceiling as I lie in bed
Watchin' niggas follow trends like Simon Says 
I pray you give us back the real ones and try again
Or maybe take them niggas that deserve to die instead
Tomi Lahren run her mouth and then she get defensive
Laura Ingraham laughin' at death and disrespectin'
I really feel like you should teach them stupid hoes a lesson
Either that or give us back somebody who deserve the blessings
I left out a bunch of names that I forgot to mention
Cost too much to pay attention, then it got expensive
Father forgive me, for I know not what I do
And now I'm reachin' out to you, hopin' you hear me and return the message 
I know that you got our back and that you're not against us
Or maybe you just love us so you doin' shit to test us
I just kinda thought that you would do more to protect us
They say that the good die young and I ain't on the guest list
I've been drinkin', Lord forgive me, it's my blood racin'
I don't know what I'm thinking, I'm just frustrated
I don't mean to question you, I'm just confused
I don't know what else to do, I've been patient and it sucks waiting
Took my mans from me, that forever hurts
But puttin' the blame on you, that'd never work
I know this ain't your fault, it's the devil's work
Devil's workThe more that I want, the more that I grind
The more that I shine, the more that I stride
The more that I stunt, the more that I cheat
The more that she leaves, the more that she cry
The harder to trust, the more that I lie
The more that she die, the more I realize
The more that I, the more that I 
The more that I try, the more that I want
More that I grind, the more that I shine
The more that I stride, the more that I stunt
The more that I cheat, the more that she leave
The more that she cry, the harder to trust
The more that I lie, the more that she dies
The more I realize I'm harder to love
I’m harder to, I'm harder to teach
My heart is a beat and I am the drum
I'm harder to keep, but harder to sleep
I’m scared of the dark, I'm not gonna run
I'm harder to break, but harder to make
You get in my way, I'm drawing my gun
I'm not gonna play, I'm not for the games
I'm not gonna change, put that on my son
Put that on my mom, put that on my sis
Put that on my bitch and all of my hoes
Put that on my team, put that on my G's
I say what I mean, you already know
Put that on my city, put that on my Bentley
I got me a Bimmer, I wanted a Rolls
Sip on some Henny and ride with the semi
All my niggas with me, I’m calling a toast 
Callin’ the plug, you callin' the cops
I call you a snitch, you holdin’ a grudge
You callin' the judge, you say you a thug
I call you a bitch, I call you a ho
Don't call me your bro, don't call me no more, I call you a trick
I’m tired of the hate, I'm tired of the snakes
I'm tired of your face, you all on my dick
I wanted the fame, I wanted the name
I wanted a break, I wanted the love
I wanted the cake, I wanna be great
I wanted to change and all the above
You want me to fall, you want me to crawl
You want me to stall, they want me on drugs
You want me to fail, they want me in jail
They wantin' my soul, they wantin' my blood
I'm out for revenge, I'm out for the ends
I'm out for respect, I'm out for the crown
I'm out for the reign, they startin' to aim
I hopped in a plane, I'm not going down
I'm dodging the flames, they callin' my name
I wanna be saved but I don't know how
I thought it was safe, but I got a plan
Let's load up the chopper and ride it around, woo
I roll up on 'em while he sleep , you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree , you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep , you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me , you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep , catch a nigga slippin'

'Cause revenge feels sweet , you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep , you gon' see
Give me a pen
I don't even drink, but fuck it, I need some Henny and gin
Plenty of sins
I broke my bitch's heart, she'll never forgive me again
Where have you been?
I had to go find myself, I killed and buried my friends
I never could swim
I used to push some weight with niggas who been in the gym
Come step in my Timbs
You could not walk my path
I never caught my cabs, I had to walk
Niggas was lost and sad, I never would call my dad
Fuck that nigga
I was depressed as fuck, mentally torn in half
Feelin' stuck
When it was hard to laugh, the music was all I had
Wish I could be out
I never got any clout, what's all the plottin' about?
They drownin' me out
Everyone countin' me out, nobody try to reach out
You proud of me now?
Niggas'll flip the script, I cannot live to quit
I don't wanna chill, I don't wanna get no flicks
Don't wanna rekindle shit
It's N-O-T, don't you flex on me
I do not get no sleep
I'm barely up, hope you ante up
Word to M.O.P., you don't know me
I need my revenge, it ain't no more peace
I'm rollin' deep and I'm finna turn your block up into World War III, woah
I roll up on 'em while he sleep , you gon' see
It's a fuckin' murder spree , you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep , you gon' see
Don't you turn your back on me , you gon' see
Roll up on 'em while he sleep , catch a nigga slippin'
I might hit him with the , they gon' miss him
'Cause revenge feels sweet , you gon' see
Won't nobody say a peep , you gon' see
The older the berry, the sweeter the juice
Knew I could do it, I needed the proof
In order to lose, I needed to win
In order to win, I needed to choose
I needed to fall, I needed to move
I couldn't be safe, I couldn't be you
I'm coming for everything they said I couldn't
Including your plate and all of your food
I don't wanna do no E
Don't wanna drink, I don't wanna do no lean
I don't wanna move no keys
How you like me now? I'm too OG
I feel like Kool Moe Dee
Ain't gon' be no slatt, my whole team'll crack
I seen 'em flat, never seen no snacks, they left me the scraps
I Deebo'd that
Think I'm cursed again, went to church to sin
I did a lot
Mama quit her job, she won't work again
I been on top
Got a mental block and it hurts, but then I bid and shop
And my bitch is fly, she a perfect ten
That's M-O-B, don't you flex on me, I do not get no sleep
I'm problematic and I gotta have it, word to Ed OG
You don't know me, I need my revenge, no more peace
I'm rollin' deep and I'm finna turn your block up into World War III
I roll up on 'em while he sleep , you gon' see

Won't nobody say a peep , you gon' seeYeah, yeah, yeah
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...
Look, I love it when they count me out, I'm a soldier 
Love when they think I ain't cool 'cause I'm sober 
You used to love when we was down, we was closer 
But I stopped lovin' ever since I got fucked over
Ho, don't call me, I don't know ya
You gotta keep that same energy 
I'm not no regular entity 
I'm not your friend, I'm your enemy 
I don't know what's gotten into me
Lately, I'm just feelin' finicky
Lately, I just want the cake and the greatest amenities
Lately, I ain't got no sympathy, aim at the industry
This ain't the way that they pictured me, what's your identity?
I guess I'm linin' 'em up
I keep my nine in the trunk 
All of y'all niggas gon' bleed 
Guess it's that time of the month
I done came up from the mud
They said I'd never be nothin', they said I'd never be rich
They said I'd never be anything, I told 'em, "Get off my dick"
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love...
Yo, I love days they say I couldn't eat when I fell 
On the streets with no help 
Money ain't everything 
Nigga, speak for yourself 
Pawn shops every week 
Scrapin' change, pay the bills 
Rainy days, couldn't sleep 
Now I sleep with my grills 
I wanted to be like Hov 
I'm livin' la vida loc' 
They jus' wanna ride my wave 
You ain't never seen my boat 
Hit 'em with the Eastside smoke
I'ma kill everyone, I'm a G.I. Joe
Hidin' my weapons all in my Levi's coat
If a nigga was pimpin', you'd prolly be my ho 
I need some different opponents 
I think I live in the moment 
I fuck my bitch in the mornin' 
I take that shit when I want it 
All you new niggas be frontin'
You just be lyin', I keep it 300
Came up from nothin', I say what I want
And no, ain't no discussion, I aim and I bust
Get away from me, if I was you, I'd watch what you say to me
Snakes all in my bed, wanna lay with me?
This ain't no motherfuckin' game, why you play with me?
Don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, don't play with me, this the only thing
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love, I love, love, love, love
I love Uh
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Sober minds
Dead silence
Yuh, listen, look
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit, it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm 'bout to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long
I know you wasn't expecting this shit but you asked for it
I'm about to grab niggas by the throat
I'm about to crash Lil Yachty boat
I'm about to drag niggas by the coat
Take out your trash, sit it by the door
Shit, I got the mask on me, I'm 'bout to go
I hate when niggas act funny when I'm alone
And try to give daps to me and tip their hats to me
And they act gully when they at home
Yeah, I don't do Xannies or Mollys
Don't come near me with problems
And don't you compare me to Logic 
Go listen to Sriracha
Yeah, that's Amanda to Ronda
And that's a Benz to a Honda
Yeah, that's a dance with the devil
And I ain't dancing behind ya
My nigga, I'm a muthafucking entity
You don't get it, even landlords gotta pay rent to me
Gingerbread man fuckers ain't catchin' me
Sick and tired of niggas sickening, depressing me
Go to church, I testify
Pray to God I bless the beat
Kanye said "Touch the Sky"
Future might come for me
But I'm a fucking beast and if I die, that sucks for me
But where the crown I'ma kill the king
I bet a lot of haters won't feel the same
I dug the ground, I built the ring
I cut the cow I milked the game, nigga
I should cut a hole in the sky
Make you feel the rain, nigga feel the pain, nigga
A lot of rap niggas get nervous when they hear my name, nigga
I'm insane, nigga
Back when you was watching Leave It To Beaver
I was crushing on Tila Tequila
I was swagging in Adidas and Filas
Fuckin' divas call 'em Venus, Serena
Signed my deal and told em Cesar's a beater
Hope you didn't think I needed you neither
Take it back and told 'em I didn't mean it
'Cause my uncle said it's cheaper to keep it
Mask off, run in the back door
Blast y'all hats off
Fuck is you mad for?
I catch y'all, smash y'all
Don't mean to laugh hard
But all you funny to me
None of you niggas half hard
You think you comin' for me but you never could last long
You don't mean nothin' to me
And I come with some shit that'll make you niggas {Imitates mumble rap flow}
Like that mumble rap shit 
Whoo, whoo!

And I come with some shit
That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas that never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing
I mean I'm very disgustin'
I mean I'm ready to bust and
Put an end to you fucker, now what's what?
How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
Huh?
Look, all you a lie
I don't cuff no hoes, you can have my bitch
I don't even mind
It seems like all these hoes wanna do is switch up
They rather be a guy
If she could suck my dick everyday for a living
Then that'd be her job, yuh
I said candy paint in yo fuckin' rims
.38 in yo fuckin' Benz
I was broke as fuck had a couple friends
A refrigerator and a cup of gin
Let's drink it up, me and you
'Cause these niggas fake, and I see it too
And they try to get me to pop Percocets and Molly
And I said
I don't take no fucking percocets
Molly, Percocets
No ecstasy, promethazine
No lean, no purple mess
No dirty Sprite but bitch, I got that Kyrie Irving step
If you don't think that I'm the shit it's just cause you ain't heard me yet
I'm about to put my mask on, my mask on
Stick all these industry niggas up until they cash gone
I know you high for the moment but that shit don't last long

That'll make you niggas bump into me with a couple of weapons
And be afraid to get it poppin', now they duckin' and dippin', I mean
What's up with you mumble niggas who never say nothin'?
I'm about to make all of you fuckers go to bed in the oven
I go to sleep with the devil and wake up next to your mother
And you ain't telling me nothing

How many CDs could a woodchuck chuck
If he chucked it at every single nigga that sucked?
What the fuck? Fuck!Joyner, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Woo, woo, woo, woo, woooo!
Mind your motherfuckin' bid'ness, ain't nothin' you gotta see 
How you all up in my shit when you got more problems than me?
Yeah, I'm cool but you don't wanna see that other side of me 
And my niggas mobbin' deep, hoe, I'm a fuckin' prodigy 
I know, I know that you been envy, bitch, it ain't that hard to see
Don't you dare go fix your mouth to tell me that you proud of me
Ain't no choice to me but loyalty still means a lot to me
Some niggas'll gon' chop my arm right off and still reach out to me
I know you probably want that
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
They don't revive a nigga then bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right  I don't die
B-b-bad to the bone
Everybody wanna be so motherfuckin' bad 'til they ass be alone
Now you back in the cold
And I'm laughin' at every single fag who didn't want me on half of they songs
It was that from the go
Just a bunch of little spoiled fuckin' bastards, every single one would laugh at my joke
Nigga, pass the Patrón
I think I'ma go and drink until I pass out and then fall in the back of the Rov' 
A Ménage on my mind , I've been on my grind 
Been through so much, sometimes think that God ain't on my side 
I cut all my friends off then say, "Y'all ain't on my vibe"
And it's so much more to life than drinkin', party all the time, whoa 
This gon' last a lifetime 
No more Mister Nice Guy 
I text Jaden Smith and told that nigga he a icon 
Don't get shit fucked up just 'cause I ain't got no ice on
Don't mean I am not Sub-Zero, I should freeze you hoes at night time
I'm like, where the hell you been at?
I've been doin' this since I was a kid and my grandma used to ask me where my head at 
Always in trouble, 'cause I was never learnin' nothin'
Except how to muscle my way into the game with no setbacks 
And all that been sleepin' on me, fuck it, where the bed at?
'Cause I've been strugglin', tryna be on top but them other niggas
Blind for me, but fuck it, it really doesn't mean nothin'
If their music ain't really cuttin' it they get hit with the galick gun 
One day y'all gon see me , I make shy look freaky 
I make dry look greasy , I make hard look easy 
I remember way back when my momma took my TV, hoe
Now I'm all on TV, hoe 
Mind yo motherfuckin' bid'ness, ain't nothin' you gotta see 
How you all up in my shit when you got more problems than me? 
Yeah, I'm cool but you don't wanna see that other side of me 
I don't want to hear no sorry's, bitch, fuck your apology
I know, I know that you been envy, damn, it ain't that hard to see
I don't wanna get to know you, no please, don't say hi to me

Some niggas'll gon' chop my arm right off and still reach out to me

You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
They don't revive a nigga then bring me back to life
And you shot me down, shot me down, shot me down, shot me down
Shot me down, that's all right  I don't die
That's why a nigga ride with a weapon
Better that than me lyin' on a stretcher
Gunshot 
Applyin' all the pressure
Potato on the chopper
Shootin' through the pillow, blood on the feathers 
Rollin' dice with ya life, all I do is roll 7s 
Eagle on my lap when I walk with the devil
Hit a bitch from the back like I don't know better
Man, I swear to God you better talk to the reverend 
Yeah, I'm on a weed high, dehydrated
Her booty fuckin' skin-tight, Levi made it 
Yee-haw, yee-haw, put her in a stable
Keep my cards in my pocket, never put 'em on the table 
Leave her bra on the floor, put my dick up on her navel
Do what I say, don't give me no ultimatum
Ride around or die, get your life taken
Shit, already went half on a baby 
All these broke bitch ass niggas
Tryna tell a real nigga how to really fuckin' get a bag 
How you fuckin' 25 with your first car?
I got 10, that's why them niggas mad 
Why you wanna hate on progress? 
Why you wanna keep me in the projects? 
Nigga, why you wanna eat off my check? 
That's some weird ass shit, you suspect 
That's a weird ass bitch, don't trust that 
Shut the hell up, a nigga ain't done yet 
All these shots, are you niggas havin' fun yet? 
I'ma do it by the book so run that 
Take ya bitch, then I ride in the sunset 
Layin' on the Westside, hit Sunset 
Backwoods, you can find me where the skunk at 
Bullet with ya name on it, if you want that 
You want that ambulance to pick me up and take me on that ride, yeah
They don't revive a nigga then bring me back to life

You can't blame me 
It's my ADHD, yeah

Don't cut me off like I don’t have a voice
I think I was born different, I ain't really have a choice, yeah 
Class in session, you a hour late 
Don't play with me, today is not the day 
Pay attention, I am not deranged
I could tell you what I'm thinkin’, I just don't know how to say it
Maybe I get on your nerves, I mean what I say 
I been a man of my words, eon wide awake 
Maybe a lil' disturbed, but that's just me
You don't bleed the blood I bleed
I wear my heart on my sleeve, nigga
And I been this way since day one 
I don't need no medication 
No, I don't need no drugs

'Cause they want me gone 
This that shit I be on 
Ain't no one to lean on 
And you know I been this way since day one 
I don't need no medication 
Or maybe I'm on one

Someone save me

Nigga, I ain't ever been a yes-man
All you gonna die, you can get murdered on webcam
I don't get tired; sweat through a headband
You might look alive, that's 'cause you don't really know you a dead man
This is God's plan, someone stop me
I've been sent here from Illuminati
Evil scriptures written on my body
Me and Satan pull up in a red Ferrari
Don't be tryin' to put your fuckin' arm around me
44 shots traumatizin' from the .45, hit 44 more

But it's competition, I'm a savage winnin'
You can have the digits, I'm a mathematician

My name JoynerHey
Will
Yeah
I'm feelin' like Will , I think I'm a prince, I'm feelin' myself 
I'm loaded with bills 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil 
Don't know how it feels, I wanted to flex, they told me to chill 
I'm makin' a flip , my life is a flick, come load up the film 
I got me some paper, hired a butler and got me a waiter 
I wanna get married, but none of my shorties remind me of Jada
Or maybe I'm just too afraid to settle, I wish I was plannin' it different
I think It's a phase, I'm very conditioned
I'm stuck in my ways and scared of commitment, I'm very conflicted 
I got the drip and I'm saucy, ooh 
ADHD, I'm a bad boy
I think I might just pull up in the 'Rari, ooh
I might just skrrt up the Philly
They call me Big Willie, I think I'm Mike Lowrey, ooh
Ain't nothin' much you can tell me, I blew through a milli and threw me a party, ooh 
I know I'm the one
Dammit, I made it, I look at my son
I feel like I'm dreamin', he truly a blessin'
I'm really elated, I pray that he grow up like Willow or Jaden
I know that he will
I hope he look up to me like we used to look up to Phil
I know that's it's real
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build
I learn it from Will
I know ain't nothin' gon' set us back 
You take it from me, I get it back 
Me and my homies forever strapped 
We roll up on 'em like Men in Black 
I blow your chest through your head and back 
I think I done made a mess 
I'm in Cali with a vest 
That's the wild wild West 
I told my homies I'm good with the labels
I don't need to sign the dots 
They must not know me
They cannot control me 'cause I ain't no I, Robot 
Yeah, I grew up on a legend and I gotta show it
I learned a lot from him and I owe it
Homie's my idol and don't even know it, ooh
I'm feelin' like Will , I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself 
I'm loaded with bills  'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil 
Don't know how it feels , I wanted to flex, they told me to chill 
I'm makin' a flip , my life is a flick, now load up the film
I'm goin' back to Miami to meet with the cartel 
All of you rappers be runnin' 'round tellin' shark tales 
I was tryna make a flip when y'all was doin' cartwheels
The Pursuit of Happyness
I was rock bottom now I'm out spendin' large bills 
And I got a shorty who stuck in a bubble
But I'm still in love with her hustle 
Her body bangin' but she don't stop talkin'
I wish that she come with a muzzle 
I don't know if I'm in love with the pieces
Or I'm just in love with the puzzle 
But I had to leave her 'cause I know
These girls these days ain't nothin' but trouble 
I know I'm the one
Damn it, I made it, now look what I’ve done 
I feel like I’m dreamin', I count all my blessings
I’m really elated, I know I Am Legend or one in the makin'
I know that it’s real
I hope they look up to me like we used to look up to Phil 
I know that you will
I lay a brick at a time for somethin' I know I can build 
That's how we leave an impression 
Yes, I believe in expression 
I got some secrets and weapons 
That might just leave a concussion 
Give me three wishes, I think I'm Aladdin
But there ain't no genie to bless us 
I ain't had nothin' just me and heater at night
He be sleep on the dresser 
I cannot fold, I hit all my goals, I did it with pride 
Ain't nothin' worst than losin' your hero and couldn't say bye 
And we never know just when it's our time
The legends are gone and we don't know why
So before they go, look here go a toast
So give 'em a rose while they still alive 
I'm feelin' like Will , I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself 
I'm loaded with bills  'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil 
Don't know how it feels , I wanted to flex, they told me to chill 
I'm makin' a flip , my life is a flick, mmYeah, ain't no one colder than me 
I'm straight from the mud, I got me a plug
And now I be rollin' with Meech 
You think you the shit? I think you a bitch
Now go 'head and call the police 
These niggas a trip, your homie's a snitch
He'll probably be home in a week 
I hit up Tory and told him, "I know you don't like me but fuck it I'm over the beef" 
Told 'em we could be friends, invited him over and gave him some soda and bleach 
They said, "Joyner you lost it"
I told them they soft
Now go take a stroll on the beach 
Nigga, I get the sauce, bitch, I'm a dog
Just don't get a hold of my leash 
Y'all niggas back to the bluffin' 
Joyner get back to the bustin' 
If I do not make a few million this year then I might just go back to the hustlin'
I got me some product and I ain't gon' hide it
I might just start trappin' in public
I might go to prison and free all my niggas
That's word to Harriet Tubman
Tired of you askin' me questions, I'm sick of it 
"Why you keep shuttin' shit down on the internet? 
Why do you have so much talent and benefits?
Why you keep droppin' your album in increments?"
A.D.H.D. is a social experiment
Who pay attention the most when they hearin' it?
You cannot stop it, there's no interferin' it
This is my moment and no one is sharin' it
Nigga, I'm just gettin' started, I hit all my targets
I promise I'm very defiant 
If I do not win the Grammy this year then I'll blow that bitch up and then everyone dyin' 
I think all my shit is hot, if everyone think that it's not then everyone lyin'
I hope my shit doesn't flop, 'cause I'll put a gun to your head and make everyone buy it
I'm diggin' the hole you get buried inside , or you get buried in silence
The day that I die I get buried in diamonds
I'm killin' you niggas, you barely survivin' 
I think I'm so high, I could marry a pilot
I'm Area 51 alien, I let my UFO fly in, it's scary and violent
I shut down the planet, you hearin' the sirens 
I'm very excited and you shouldn't bother 
Joyner got too many problems 
I told that little bitch that I'm down with a threesome as long as it's you and your mama 
I ain't got no patience, I love to get dirty
But fuck it I'm cool with the drama 
When niggas be hatin', I tell them, "No worries my nigga, Hakuna Matata"
I don't wear Prada, just bring me a white tee 
I bust some Margiela's, I still wear the Nikes 
I roll with some hitters, I know you don't like me
I shit on you niggas, now bring me some wipeys 
You think I'm a killer? Well maybe I might be
I ain't got no feelings I dare you to fight me 
I'll swing with a left but I'm really a righty
Get pussy and money, it barely excites me
I'm ready, don't try me, so bow
Fuck all you pricks
You cannot harm me, I think you a bitch
You think I'm corny? I think I'm the shit
When she get horny, she tickle my dick
When I was broke, I would think like I'm rich
'Til I fucked up my credit and hit me a lick 
Then I got me some money to get me a crib
And then blew it on bitches from Plenty of Fish 
I'm goin' back to the streets 
If Freddy and Jason had babies, my nigga I promise then that would be me 
Niggas all in my honey and actin' all funny, I think I'm attracted to bees
They told me that I changed, I looked in the mirror like what the fuck happened to me?
Ever since I done came up, these niggas been so in their feelings
They countin' my pockets I know that it's killin' 'em
Don't tell me you proud when you know that you jealous
The money keep pilin' I know that you smell it
You think you entitled? Well suck on a dick and I hope that you swallow
And that's how I'm feelin', put that on the Bible
Don't call me your family, you know you're my rival I do what I gotta
Now turn the fuckin' TV up, I'm in the media
And ain't nobody wanna see me up, a nigga heating up
I'm like a sickle cell anemia, I really mean it
But I'm 'bout to slow a nigga breathin' up, I think he's seen enough 
I go to hell, I fuck a demon up, I think I'm mean enough
To beat a nigga with Adidas 'til I fuck the sneakers up 
I'll sucker-punch you when I'm sneakin' up
You couldn't see me but I had to hit 'em like a meteor 
And make 'em giddy up, to get the trunk
And I went from nothing to somethin'
I fell in love with the guns and I got a hundred and one 
And like every day that I'm bustin' I'm putting one in your stomach
I got 'em jumping and running, you better cover and duck 
And I'm not the one to be fucked with
I'm not the one that you think you could do whatever you want to 
There's gonna be repercussions
The enemies know what's up and I'm up at three in the mornin'
When you be sleepin' and yawnin', you know the evil be callin' 
Somebody better call the ambulance or the E-M-T 
Nigga, I'm the bomb like T-N-T
Bet I roll up on a nigga with a G-M-C 
Get to clappin' on 'em, end of it, the E-N-D
Call the plug, tell him that I want at least ten keys
Now I'm back in business, E-P-M-D 
Couldn't walk in my shoes with a street stampede
Can't walk this way, I Run D-M-C 
Pack in the mail, I sit it down and it's crackin' the scale
Had to switch position from the kitchen, nigga, I was flippin' like a spatula there
Pretty Ricky with them bitches, when I'm hittin' long as a dread on spectacular hair
Here shit, light shit, white whip, open up it look like a packet of mayo
I'm back in Rodeo, fuckin' up the check and chuckin' up the set
And I'm back off the layover, pay-over way over niggas
No slumber but a nigga stay over, nigga
Your bitch is with me 'til the day-day, AK loaded up the same way
Chain swang, white person screamin' out, "Gang gang!"
Slide or kick, Jet Li or Liu K-K-Kang 
I got a Little B, he call me based God like brring, ding, ding
Got a main dame, Audemar, and that's my main thang
Got a Rollie watch, her name Jane but she plain plain, so we call her plain Jane
Over her, I let it bang-bang like the fingers twistin' on a gang member sittin' in the chain gang
Nigga, please, I got old nigga cheese, y'all got hoe nigga knees
Can't let a faux nigga roll up, put a hole in your shit then let the ho nigga leave, man
Y'all niggas know a nigga T-O-R-Y, all my niggas got paws and they're always for the free
"O" for the fee, if a nigga throw a couple Gs, get a little nigga smoked for the free, man
1-5-0, first show, nigga, that's how I go, I was chosen with those melodies
Niggas hatin', I've been goin' up with those enemies
And the snakes keep blowin' it with those in the breeze
I'm up to no good, my boy's in the hood
With no young Jeezy, and no Jody Breezy, could blow 40 Gs
Still come back, who the fuck lookin' like the Ol' Dirty B from the Wu-Tang, nigga?
I could say nothin' on a motherfuckin' track, still go back plat' like Pootie Tang, nigga
Do your thing, nigga, hoppin' in the Mulsanne
Hotter than a blue flame lit up in the full tank, nigga
Man niggas better hide, niggas what, niggas what?
Nigga, niggas at the bottom of the food chain, nigga
Nigga so lame, can't crew hang, nigga, can't crew bang with ya, can't move a thang with ya'
See a little bad bitch walkin' down the block, but she lookin' at me 'cause your crew can't get her
I'm a dominator, moderator
Pass your chick like hot potato
Police non-cooperator
I won't tolerate a bitch that's talkin' crazy, not me, lil' nigga
I be on the beach with the sea, lil' nigga
I been triplin' up the doubles and threes, lil' nigga
Livin' it up with the women up in Vis, lil' nigga
Give it up all my niggas is tuckin', I hope a nigga's duckin'
I been drippin' and drippin' like a nigga's tippin' the bucket
I been whippin' these bitches and stickin' out my dick in public
They be lickin' a nigga to get to familiar fuckin'
I be fuckin' these women in ten-percent'd tinted windows
And I'm yellin' and tellin' I gotta get it, get to steppin'
I'm reppin' Umbrella forever, my niggas in abundance
I'm fly as propellers, you jealous
And if a nigga comin', I'm eatin' these niggas like ketchup and relish on a bun
I got the money to fund the wonders of what I wanted
And when I want it, I wanna feel like you can't front on it
I got your ex-chick and your next chick on a pole in my livin' room floor tryin' to dance all on it
As long as I can put my hands all on her, she said: "Handstand, a handstand'' and landed on it
I said damn, had to put it in her head, I ain't droppin' no bread
This is not that Gretel and the Hansel story
Got a Coupe full of hoes and the hose in the Coupe
To the Lamborghini doors to the floors and the roof
When I'm goin' in the booth, I'm exposin' the globe to the truth
They be knowin', I be showin' up with proof
Any faux nigga, any ho nigga, any low Joe Schmoe nigga better know
When I unload Get Low, Get Low, Get Low like Lil' Jon and the Eastside Boyz, nigga
And my lil' bitch type thick, uh
Neck is freezy as a ice-pick, uh
Out of sect just like a high kick, uh
Niggas gonna copy my style like a right click
All of my dogs'll kill you like Mike Vick
Light that pistol, put that boy in a Heimlich
I was handin' them Ls to Joyner and Don for comin' out actin' too lightskin
Nigga, I'm back in the Bentley, applyin' the pressure
Spittin' bunch of flyin' and firin' embers
So fuckin' hot, you'd think I died in the desert
Came back to fuck up your entire endeavor
You tryin' me? Never; your squad will get shot if ya try and be clever
My diamonds forever, designin' and linin' a bed up
Then give 'em a choice: which one you want die with, the .9 or Beretta?
I'm sorry for being intolerant, I got this violent temper
I like when I'm cold, I shoot a nigga, make him die in December
You been a bitch, as long as I can remember
You sayin' that you're gang, them niggas keep talkin'
I promise I'll silence your members then quiet your temple
While firing bullets that fly at your mental and pry at your denim
I'll hire somebody to fire the jet up then get up and send a shooter that'll fly if you rattle
I promise I'm high on momentum
Might think it's a setup, but find me a nigga
Might line that nigga for the paper
Let the hitter get to foldin', origami the nigga
The Louie luggage bustin' down on ya nigga
But true we thuggin', no insomnia, nigga
I'm really a top 3...
Man, hold on, I'm just rappin' too much, man, fuck this shitWoke up at 7, my day seemed more than I prayed for
Got dressed up to head out and ride to school on my skateboard
New kid in class I sat alone takin' notes while the hoodlums were makin' jokes at the clothes that my momma paid for
Seemed like everyone was a part of some gang invasion
Tattoos, the initiation, parolers I’m on probation
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information
'Cause lately I been deprived of a normal day
But today, on my way to eat lunch, some kid approached me
He told me “we should be cool” if only he got to know me
'Cause on this side of town I would need some protection
It’s crazy, reckless and dangerous
Unless I’m some sort of gangster, I’m only safe with the police
He said his name was 
I dapped him up at the busses
I was kinda skept' about him at first cause I didn’t trust him
The more I got to know him, I couldn’t tell what his motives were
Hopin' that he was sincere, somethin' told me “let go”
But the only thing on my mind was patience
Searchin' twice for a different life, I was tired of waitin'
'Cause me and  had similar views and conversations infused with knowledge
Mainly 'bout school and college, that was my truth, but regardless
He was type cool when I was wit' him
Introduce him to my family, they were rockin' wit' him
My momma told him, “Make sure you look out for my son”
And before she could finish her sentence, he quickly just interjected and said, “Don’t you even stress it, I got it under control.”
It’s been two months since we met, it seemed like we’d gotten close
Some cat approached me and tried to beef wit' me, I just froze
Then I see  pounded and stompin' homie right out his clothes
Called me his brother and told me he got me to the fullest
Even if that mean bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas ‘till they kill us
That’s the realest shit I ever witnessed
A few weeks later, my uncle sold me a Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin' about every place that I’ma go when I finally get it
And then he asked me for a ride around the block some distance from where I was parkin
And instantly I knew the spot was sketchy, my momma would kill me
My intuition told me not to, I knew it was wild
And plus I knew I had no business or place on that side of town
And I read about some chick that went lurkin' without a sound and got murked
Her body found in that dirt, with a thousand rounds
It was worse than abandoned buildins of bandits, villians, and scammers
Killers provokin' gangsters, but maybe I’m overthinkin'
Maybe I might be straight just as long as I pump the brakes
And try not to think about it just trust I’ll be fuckin' safe
And then I told him, “Let’s go, hop in.”
He dapped me up, he started tellin' jokes the whole ride there
Had me crackin' up
As we were gettin closer, I felt funny, my stomach turned
Then he told me, “Go left, make another turn, go right, and drive slow”
As I look, it was all abandoned and quiet, not a single person in sight, nobody standin
And right when I pulled the car to the side
He said, “Right here, sit still. Turn the car off and chill.”
That’s when I start to panic he told me, “Relax.”
Then he pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out and laughed
Then my life flashed in an instant
He inched to my driver door then I tried to lock it, I couldn’t
Ripped me right outta my seat and then grabbed the side of his jeans and then
Pulled out the shotty and all I heard was a screech and he shot my arm into pieces
I’m thinkin' I must be dreamin’, another shot to my chest
And my stomach’s squeezin', my breath or my lungs collapsin
I’m down on my fuckin knees askin' him, “Why?”
He looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes
And he smashed my face with the barrel
And I throw my teeth to the sky and then uh
I heard a  sound of the shotty cock back
He pressed it hard against my head and blew my fuckin top back
I’m still conscious, I’m breathin'
I’m still movin', no clue as to why I’m not dead
All this blood that I’m losin' and I heard my car drive off
And I looked up and saw the sun and that was all that I saw
Then I heard my conscience tell me, “Get up nigga get up! You’re losin' blood, oh my! Don’t fall asleep or you’ll die! Stay awake and move as much as possible, there’s no time! Find some help or try to yell, you ain’t too well, oh God! Wake up, nigga! Wake up! Wake up, nigga! Wake up…”
Woke up at 7, my day was worse than I prayed for
Got dressed, then head out, down the stairs from the eighth floor
New kid in class, he sat alone, takin' notes while my niggas were makin' jokes
At the clothes that his mama paid for
Had no family, but was cool with the local gangstas
Tattoos, and now I’m on parole and probation for breakin' rules
That life was all I knew, all I wanted was to do was cruise
Smoke weed and say, “Fuck school”
Wanted guidance cause all my role models I would look up to
Was indicted a young dude with no logic
I went to church 'till the pastor said, “Fuck you.”
Now I’m violent and this gang that always looked out for me
Vouched for me and adopted me said they wanted to rock wit me
And I wanted to get down, guess there was somethin' missin'
Everything comes with a price, “There’s only one condition:
All you gotta do for initiation is kill an innocent victim and leave em there with no witnesses or no snitches
If you do that, you’d be down with the clique and that’s for life so don’t you ever think you getting outta this shit"
I thought about it
Soakin' up the vibe as I study for information, tryna choose my victim, plottin' the weakest prey
But today on my way to eat lunch, I approached him
And told him we should be cool, if only I got to know him
Cause on this side of town, he would need some protection
It’s crazy reckless or If only, unless he some sort of gangster and he only safe with the police
He said his name was  and I dapped him up at the busses
Was kind of skeptic about me at first cause he didn’t trust me
Then the more he got to know me, he couldn’t tell what my motives were
Hopin’ that I was sincere, but little did he know I was tryna snake him and pop a brick
Just need the perfect opportunity, I’m tired of waitin’
A murder runnin’ through my head, I knew that death was comin’
He introduced me to his family, I was jealous of him
His momma told me “Make sure you look out for my son-“
And before she could finish her sentence I quickly just interjected and said
“Don’t you even stress it. I got him to the fullest, even if that means bullets, bullies, gangs, AKs and choppas till they kill us.”
I was lyin to the fuckin’ limits
Took advantage when he said he had that Honda Civic
A ’93 with no license plates and no registration
Just thinkin’ about every place I’ma go when I finally kill him
And then I asked him for a ride around the block, some distance from where he was parked
And instantly I knew my chance was comin’, I’m ready to drill him
Then he told me, “Let’s go, hop in.”
I dapped him up and started tellin jokes the whole ride there
Had him crackin up
As we were gettin’ closer, he felt funny
I think he knew somethin’ was comin’, that look he had was enough to tell me
But fuck it, go right and drive slow
As he looked, it was all abandoned and quiet
Not a single person in sight and nobody standin
And right when he pulled the car to the side
I said, “Right here, sit still. Turn the car off and chill.”
Then he start to panic, I told him, “Relax.”
Then I pulled the keys out the ignition and hopped out, laughed
His life flash in an instant
I inched to his driver door then he tried to lock it, he couldn’t
And I ripped him right out his seat then I grabbed the side of my jeans and then
I pull out the shotty, I cocked it twice ‘till he screamed
And I shot his arm into pieces, I’m watchin’ his blood leakin’
And another shot to his chest, seen his stomach squeezing
His breath and his lungs collapse and he down to his fuckin’ knees
Askin’ me, “Why?”
He looked at me, I looked him dead in the eyes
Then I smashed his face with the barrel, and I throw his teeth to the sky
And then  sound of the shotty cock back
I pressed it hard against his head and blew his fuckin’ top backYeah, Joyner
Woo
Ayo I'm tired of this fucking beat
Ayo, how many of y'all niggas
How many of y'all niggas gotta do this beat?
I'm gonna kill this fucking panda, man
I'm done
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I don't stand alone
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em
Kick him, punch him, throw him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make him a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too
I'll make him black and blue, fuck the black and white
I don't fuck with niggas like a pack of dykes
Eat the panda bitch, I got an appetite
I'm out this world, I swear that I'm a satellite
How many rappers gotta try to pay me?
Tired of hearing niggas on the same beat
Time to kill the panda in my old pajamas, flying to Atlanta in the same week
What's a panda to a fucking polar bear?
A gorilla to a monkey, tiger to a puppy, lion to a kitten, wolf to a pigeon, shark to a fish and snake to an infant
Alligator in the water wet
Joyner Lucas to a dinosaur and pet
They ain't know that I'm Tyrannosaurus Rex
Cut the panda up and rip apart his neck
I ain't doing interviews and autographs
I don't like the way you talking all of that
I should fuck your bitch and never call her back
I'd go down in history as an artifact
But...
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em
Kick him, hit him, make him slam the wall
Tie him to a cannon, make a cannon ball
Into the ocean, make him suffer too
Nigga this is fucking animal abuse
Animal cruelty on the fucking news
I'mma kill the panda till he bloody too
That's a bloody mess, that's a bloody death
Tell them niggas hating on me, "suck a dick"
I ain't satisfied until I get to smash J-Lo and give her ass a couple kids
I’ve been on Animal Planet, I got my hands on the phantom
I kill it again, and nobody gotta hand me a Grammy
God damnit I barely don’t even want to hear what they planning
I sit in a Pana' again and then I blam with the hammer
The man with a plan, you looking at the man in the mirror
The man with a killer that drill a nigga straight in the building
I hang with realest, I really wanna handle my business
I get it, I get it. I gotta get it. Damn it, I did it
I’m out of this commodity
‘Bout'a be outta there, hotter than riding inside of a driver seat at Leh and Ladakh
How did we get out of them out of a prodigy, nigga
All I ever wanted was to hit the lottery, nigga
All eyes on me and they gotta be, nigga
Swear to God, 2Pac could be proud of me nigga
All I know is the fire burning inside of me, nigga
All I ever could be is real as I gotta be, nigga
But why you all wanna act hard?
Where I'm from we get it popping in the backyard
Now everybody wanna run up on the back door
Half pussy half bitch, you a cat-dog
Let me see you do the cat daddy on a black Caddy
Shorty got a fat fattie and flat belly
All she do is lap giving if she act petty
I'll kill a panda, throw that nigga off a balcony for running his mouth to me
And y'all done got me mad
I'mma put the panda in a body bag
What you doing 'round here? Why you standing 'round?
Why you niggas tryna lollygag?
You ain't got a life and you proud of that?
All you wanna know is where the molly at
All you hoes think about is Prada bags
I done killed the panda, where Desiigner at? 
But this is not a diss, don't call it that
I'm just giving all you pandas hepatitis, cancer, HIV and a heart attack
All you broke bitches need to call a cab
Cause I ain't 
Yo, stop rapping over this Goddamn beat cause I ain't too fond of that
Look
I'm tired of this fucking panda song
I don't stand alone
I just wanna wrap my fucking hands across
Stab the head, and break the fucking panda's jaw
Burn em up and turn the fucking candles on
Choke em, beat em, put a couple hammers on em
Dab on a nigga while I'm standing on em like
Like, like this Hey
Will
Yeah
I'm feelin’ like Will , I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself
I’m loaded with bills 'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil 
Don't know how it feels, I wanted to flex, they told me to chill 
I'm makin' a flip , my life is a flick, now load up the film 
Yeah
You feelin' like me? 
I feel like a prince that turned to a king 
Found me a queen, started a family and got me a team
On top of my dreams, Joyner, I know you inspired by me
Like I was inspired by Nelson Mandela, I give him a rose for every endeavor
And shoutout to Julius Erving, one of the legends I worship 
Muhammad Ali put the work in, he was the champ, the greatest, he earned it
I love that you think that I'm perfect but I had plenty mistakes and burdens
My grandmama thought I was worth it
She always guided me when I was searchin’ 
I wouldn't be me if it wasn’t for her 
I wouldn't be Willie, I couldn't be me if there wasn’t no Eddie
I wouldn't be Will if I wasn't from Philly
Ain't nothin' much that you really can tell me
Willie been cold since Benny and Jerry
Must've forgot that I really get busy
They done forgot who invented "Get Jiggy," ayy 
Back before there was streaming sales
Way before all the iTunes and the fans had to get CDs still 
Sixty million records sold, I was on fire, I ain't even need a grill
Did it all with no cuss words, I ain't have to curse just to keep it real 
Me and Jazz in the late eighties, writin' rhymes, makin' tapes daily
Fresh Prince make the babes crazy, rest in peace to James Avery
Even when the streets call me corny I still ain't never let the hate break me
I just wanted the respect first, I still ain't never lettin' fame change me 
New me, but I'm old school 
Big Willie on the Pro Tools 
Still fresh and I'm so smooth 
I still got on my old shoes
I give Jada one thousand kisses, ain't nothin' change since '02 
Martin Lawrence get a rose too
He a legend and a G.O.A.T.  too 
Man, I love how you break the rules
Pushin' limits and you make it cool
Joyner Lucas wasn't made to lose
You a legend in the makin' too
What a beauty, my life's a movie
I swear I'm only on take two
All my kids turned out great and I know your son gon' be great too 
Brick by brick, buildin' a wall that no one could break
Flip by flip, glad I could help so you could be straight
And life's a trip, but who could relate?
The legends are gone but it ain't too late
To give 'em a rose and carry the grace
'Cause not every hero is wearin' a cape 
I'm feelin' like Will , I feel like a prince, I'm feelin' myself
I'm loaded with bills  'cause I wasn't blessed with no Uncle Phil 
Don't know how it feels , I wanted to flex, they told me to chill 
I'm makin' a flip , my life is a flick, mmYo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
You know, you really piss me off sometimes
I spent all night waiting for you to come home
And I've woken up without you
I don't know where you are or why you're not answering your phone
But I'm starting to get worried
I really hope you're not pissing away the last of our money
At the stupid casino again
Because you know my next check won't be here 'til the third
And we literally have nothing right now
If you did go to the casino and you have more money, then I guess
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, ho, fuck you mean? 
I don't think you notice what you done to me 
Yeah I think you should know that you are under me
If anybody got a problem, tell 'em they can come to me
What the fuck you mean? This is not allowed 
Better calm it down 
Cause all you new niggas just watered down
I can see through you like a muh'fuckin' ultrasound, woo!
Okay, be ready to hold up then, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor spin
I'll blow the boat up then be gone and wonderin' what you noticin'
A couple of hoes that I've been boning since a nigga was only ten
I'm tryna to get all up in that pussy harder than my youngin' 
You fallin' and you love it 
Can't stand the heat but you all up in the oven 
I remember when I used to ball on a budget
 Now wait a minute 
You finally got some paper, couldn't wait to get it 
And it don't really matter 'cause you're still lame
No matter how much cake you got, it wouldn't make a difference 
I'm tired of all you rappers wantin' free verses
The fuck up outta here, this how I make a livin' 
I dive up in that pussy like Jamaican niggas 
I spend all of my dollars on some Laker tickets 
I think if I die young, they gon' miss me too
I think I'ma buy guns, maybe empty two 
I think I'ma sell drugs to the kids at school
I think I'ma get buzzed if it gets me through
I think I'ma need to hide if they know where I live 
I think I'ma drink and drive til' I total the whip 
I think I'ma get high, give her all of the dick
Even if she ain't mine so she knows what it is, wait 
 Hold up though, I'm ready to roll up on them
I'm ready to mow them, make your motor boat
I blow the boat up then be gone, I'm wonderin' what you notice though
A couple of hoes that I've been bonin' since a nigga was on it though
My nigga, what's your worst fear? I been running from the start
Scared to be a man, tryna hustle in the dark
Running down the stairs, gotta hustle every March
Eating supper, getting filled, watching "Rumble in the Bronx"
I slip inside into the puddle of your heart
Nigga I don't trust you plus you never play the part
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, nigga
 I said
I been living in the ghetto where the devils pray to God, hold up
 Mm
I been living in the 
Yeah, look
Get the, fuck, off, of my, dick, bi-, wait a minute 
I'ma fuck your bitch to let my neighbor hit it 
She told me, "Maybe we could go on a date"
I told her, "No way, but we could say we did it"
Heh, I'm such a lost soul
Even my mom knows, that's why she hate a nigga 
Yeah, I'm such an asshole
Even Superman couldn't save a nigga 
Get the, fuck, off—of my cock
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peaceDamn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but it
Oh no no no no no no 
Oh no no no no no no 
Oh no no no no no no 
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no
I remember everything was different
When I tried to get a job and make some money, I was livin' on the street
I walked a lot of miles and nobody wasn't hiring
And I had to stand in line if I was to get something to eat
'Cause I ain't had no homies and my girl depended on me
Every night that we were lonely and I couldn't get no sleep
'Cause I was plotting on anybody I seen that was getting money
You got it? I need it sorry, you don't need it more than me
And bitch, I'm tired of this struggle, ducking and dodging them puddles
Wondering if God ever hear the prayers I said
'Cause every time I got a new hustle, that shit done got me in trouble
You don't know how many fucking tears I've shed
But fuck it, I'm letting loose, and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you know what I'm finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafucking thing that I pick and choose
And I'm done with all the begging, I'm past that, all I did was get laughed at
You can go back track but you'll never get cash back
And they told me I'm half black, but I'm white as a lab rat
With a mic and a gas mask, I'm a light for your trash ass
And I might get the last laugh, better fight if you back stab
With a knife in your backpack, all my life I've been jabbed at
But I fight like I'm Mad Max with a knife with the yeah, yeah
You know, you know what the fuck I'm talking about
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what I had to do to get what I want
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count it on my fingers how much shit that I lost
Woo, nigga, this is my job
Yeah, these are my thoughts
Woo, I ain't never had shit
But for now you better give me what's yours
Damn I feel so loose, I'm about to pop shit
What's a man to do when he's out of options
I ain't wanna do it but this
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no
No no no no no no
I said gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, gimme that, you heard what I said
Nigga run that, run that, run that, run that, you heard what I said
I said yeah, oh no no no no no no
Oh no no no no no no no
You really got some nerve talkin' bout me like you're better
Cause you got your shit together and I'm really goin' through it
I don't think you have a clue what it feels like
Doin' dirt knowin' in your heart you ain't wanna do it
I don't got one G bone in my body
I ain't never gang banged, I don't know nothing about it
I don't claim to be a thug nigga or Illuminati
But there really ain't no tellin' what I do when I get rowdy
And I'm starvin' and my back against the wall and you ballin'
Everytime I see you, all you do is flash hundreds
Everything on fleek, I ain't never had nothin'
I just wanna be you, wanna feel like stuntin'
And lettin' loose and they told me don't bend the rules
This is my winter blues, you don't know what I finna do
Anything necessary to make it up in the news
And I'm taking every mothafuckin' thing that I pick and choose
I'm done with that hating shit, the fuck do you think this is?
Damn it, you made me sick, ain't no time for no babysit
This is the way we live and yes I'm okay with this
You think you all that and a bag of potato chips?
Could jump off a crazy bridge, and enough of you idiot kids
Go suckin' a lady dick, I would never just make amends
With none of you shakin' hands in public like yeah yeah
Like get the fuck out of my face, dude
Listen, I don't give a fuck about your feelings
You don't have any idea just what a nigga had to do to get loose
All I wanted was to make a decent living
I can't even count on all my fingers how much shit I went through
Woo, what I went through
Yeah, what I went through
Uh, and when shit get real
Ain't really nothing that you can do, woo
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you
Peace
Yo, who the fuck do you think you are
Tryna give advice to a child? My child
Nigga, you the biggest piece of shit I've ever met in my life, my nigga
You the last person that should be trying to give advice
To anybody about anything, let alone my fucking kid
Acting like some fucking role model or some shit
Nigga, no nobody wanna be like you, stop itUh
What if I told you that I was different?
What if I told you that something's missin'?
And what if I told you we're not alike
And the way that I feel inside is different than what you picture
What if I told you I feel divided?
Keep to myself and I'm awfully quiet
And what if I told you I been conflicted by my own thoughts
Trapped in the dark, and I tried to hide it
No, I'm not a slave to no fuckin' fairy tale
I bet you think that you know me very well
Make no mistake, this is not a cry for help
'Cause I don't owe no one no explanation on how I feel
But on the real, what if I told you that I was brave?
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Yeah
What if I told you I'm not alright?
I mean, I don't feel dead, but I'm not alive
And what if I told you, "I'm not like you"
And the shit I've been goin' through, it'll prolly make you cry
And what if I told you, "I'm not this"
And the person you think you know don't exist
Look, I'm not who you know, I'm not who you wish
I'm not who you want me to be, what you want from me isn't this
I grew up in church where I couldn't be myself
I felt like a prisoner, couldn't leave my cell
They told me, "God don't like ugly," and this an ugly world
And if I ever seen things different, then I would burn in hell
And on the real, this is not new, this is not a phase
I grew up different than I was raised
But still, what if I told you I'm out of place? Wait
What if I told you that I was gay?
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
What if I told you I'm homophobic?
And you have zero control over your impulses
And the genetic flaw in your chromosomes is the culprit
It's something I can't sugarcoat, it's repulsive
We were homies, since children, I thought it
But thought I was buggin', though
'Cause we'd sit, chill and just talk chicks
Now how can we be friends still after all this
Unless, I can convince you to repent
Ask God to forgive you for your sins
And begin healin' your conscience
And rid you of this sick illness that causes it
Part of me wishes you'd kept this shit, still in the closet
I'm white but I'm gettin' mixed feelings like Logic
Yeah, I'm pissed off a little, this is a choice
We were supposed to be boys
You're actin' like this ain't optional
What if I said you was weak?
'Cause you don't got the strength to conquer some biological monster that's part of you
That's responsible for them homosexual thoughts
If you don't want a lecture, part
Like a sofa section or long as you
Make your decision and stand by it, but I can't be beside it
'Cause for me, that'd be next to impossible
Or you learn to control your urges
You say, "It's like pullin' teeth and morals are oral surgeons"
But how would you even know anyways if you're a virgin
Why can't you be a normal person?
What if I tried steerin' you towards a girlfriend?
Wouldn't work, would it? You seem pretty surefooted
I'm sure good at judgin', but I have no right
I know goodbye seems cold, right?
Not even a flicker of hope like a strobe light
As I leave and I swear I stayed up that whole night
And no, I didn't know you would go right home and go take your own life
I ain't mean for that shit to happen, I said I won't cry
I let the best friend that I've ever known die
Alone, was gonna tell you the next day
I'm so sorry, I'm fightin' my own demons, I won't lie
They won't leave me alone, eating at my soul, this whole time
I've been tortured, imprisoned in my own mind
A born again Christian but Lord if you're listenin'
We might be headed for a collision
'Cause when I told my boy I couldn't support his decision
I was tryna make it seem like a choice, when it isn't
Can't be cured with a prayer to Saint Jude
What If I told you my wish never came true?
What if I'm a hypocrite who's afraid to just face truth? Wait
What if I told you I'm gay too?
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuh, duh nuh nuh duh
Duh nuhMally Mall
It's my birthday, I'm 'bout to get lit-lit 
Might blow a bag on the drip-drip 
Make it all back on a quick flip, ayy 
I just need cake and a thick bitch, ayy 
I ain't have much, just a wishlist 
Now the broke nigga doin' big shit 
I got the gun lock, loaded, I'm ignant
So keep one eye open like Slick Rick 
I got the drip game, nigga, I'm the big mane 
Switch lanes on 'em, hit the mid range 
Keep the big strap on me like a hitman 
It go "click-clack, willow-wallow, bing bang" 
I ain't never been shit, ain't shit changed 
But niggas get lame when you get fame 
Can't sleep at night 'til I get brains
Got a mean ass pipe and a dick game
I got a bitch on my sofa 
I got a chip on my shoulder 
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to 
I got hitters all over , told 'em this is all over 
I take the kids on drugs and line 'em all up and get 'em all sober 
I got a little check that I cashed out, ayy 
Credit card maxed out, ayy 
I get lit then I act out, ayy 
I ain't wanna do it but I blacked out, ayy 
They say I need to be safe 
I think I need to be straight
Fix your vibes, you need to be laced
You just need God or you need to meet Mase
I left my bitch, maybe we just need space 
I got gunners like Chris, like Niecey 
I got brothers like Tip, like Breezy 
I got stunners like Wayne, like BG 
I got a hood bitch all about the bread
And she only give me head 'cause the bed too squeaky 
I'm too smart for a ho tryna G me
A bitch be dumb if she ever try to leave me, word
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow
I'm the realest nigga, I know 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto, oh 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto 
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow 
I'm the realest nigga, I know 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto, oh 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto
Why do I feel like Manson? 
Smoke y'all niggas, I feel like I just got cancer, ayy 
Murderin' streets, my anthem
All of y'all clowns is banter, ooh 
Still can't pull your pants up
Kidnap kids like Amber 
Hold a lil' nigga for a ransom 
I moved from the trap to the mansion 
Went from the Uber to a Phantom 
You niggas gassed up, don't amp 'em
I've never been pretty, but my mom think I'm handsome 
I hate niggas that flex on camera 
Lil' kids always tryna throw tantrums 
All you motherfuckas dry like dandruff
You can get washed and I'll throw you in a hamper
I got a bitch on my sofa 
I got a chip on my shoulder 
You gotta live with your karma
And if you get hurt then you got what you supposed to 
I got hitters all over , told 'em this is all over 
I take the kids on lean and get 'em all clean and give 'em all soda 
Watch how I do it, I demonstrate, ooh 
I ain't gotta move, I renovate
I don't really pray, I meditate, yeah 
I ain't gotta jump, I levitate
Always on time, I'm never late 
I was outside like every day
Tryna turn water into lemonade
Now I'm boo'd up like Ella Mai, I just wanna get away, woah 
You don't want war with a rich nigga 
You should hit the gym, get a bit bigger 
I ain't got patience for bitch niggas 
Wrap you in the basement with Big Tigger 
Your bitch is a thot, you had kids with her 
Your watch little lit, but my wrist litter 
He thought he had a plan 'til the fist hit him 
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow
I'm the realest nigga, I know 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto, oh 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto 
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow 
I'm the realest nigga, I know 
I just hit the fuckin' lotto, oh 
I just hit the fuckin' lottoWhat's up with you R&B niggas tryna turn rappers and trappers 
You should just stay in your lane, bro, you sound like PaRappa the Rapper 
I'm looking down on you when you talk to me, you should grab you a ladder
You swung at me, only jabbed at my bladder
Watch you disappear like you abracadabra 
Now grab me a dagger
You got some hits but you lacking a swagger 
I'm still the shit, bitch, so that doesn't matter
Don't call me a kid, I'm your papi and dada 
You get splattered and flattened
You an' Trippie better have you some backup 
Ren and Stimpy looking agi' and staggered
And when I kill 'em, they get madder and madder
Time to get litty, bitch, fuck all that singin' 
You challenge me, what the fuck is you thinking? 
Way too much weed, what the fuck is you drinkin'?
I brought the tsunami, you fuckers are sinkin' 
I'm glad that you came
Leave all that lyrical shit up to me, I'm a savage that bang
Bring all your Prada suits back to Lee Chang 
Take all that autotune back to T-Pain
I swear you R&B rappers is strange
You okay but you ain't nobody favorite 
You a'ight but you ain't nobody major
5'3", you ain't nobody dangerous 
Maybe that weed you were smoking, had you feeling confident
Let's have a real conversation 
Maybe that doctor put something inside of your head
When you got your new hairline replacement 
Why you bring my name up in the first place, Tory? 
You ain't fucking with me on my worst day, Tory
Wasn't better than me when I was in first grade, Tory
We can do this every year or on your birthday, Tory 
Every summer, every winter, every Earth day, Tory 
Every Tuesday, every Thursday, Tory
It's gon' be a motherfuckin' anniversary, Tory
You done fucked up, now you need first aid, Tory 
I'm the leader of the new school with a screw loose 
All you niggas Blues Clues with a fruit juice 
Turn your Jimmy Choo shoes into FUBU
Nigga, you do what you can, I do what I choose to
I get litty in this bitch for my city 
Only few real niggas left, they ain't many 
They compare me to Em, they compare you to Iggy 
They compare me to Meth, they compare you to Glizzy 
I'm Leonardo Da Vinci, I paint a picture with color
I already got cake and I don't need a butler 
We already got Drake and we don't need another
I don't really got space but I'ma eat your supper 
You know Joyner got a hotter flow
I'ma do what Travis should've did a while ago 
I'ma do what Drake should've did a while ago
Throw your ass off a cliff, make you say, "Geronimo"
Then you had one chance, now you slumped on 
Go back in the booth, make another love song 
What you gon' do when the fucking blunt's gone?
'Cause I wanted all the smoke, I ain't even puff long 
Nigga, I been packing a black MAC with it wrapped in a backpack
With a stack and I'm Mad Max in the back of the black cab
With a gat and a snapback, put a cap in yo' back fat
Murder you and your wack little Cat in the Hat raps
Finna stab if you jab back, and I clap at you mad fast
When you sing, you ain't half bad, but you rapping like Ras Kass
And I bet that you mad sad 'cause you 'bout to get laughed at
And buried in trash bags and left in a hatchback, my nigga
Jamming in front of the corner store, whoa
Mobbin' a lot in the corridor, whoa
Breakin' some shit you don't want no more
Fightin' when nobody want a war
Rob at the haters, gon' sing like the Commodores
I got some shit you ain't saw before
Swallow the key and I lock the door
Tory, you ain't gotta hide no more
Come out and play, you my prey, you the GOAT? I'm a dinosaur
Oh, you wan' hate, that's normal
You just gonna do what you supposed to 
I remember when them hoes called me old news
Now when they cheat, I'm the go-to 
Word on the street's I ain't one to get close to
I was hopeless, now I'm hopeful 
I done made my own way like I'm supposed to
All you niggas did what you was told to 
Tory, why all your songs always sound like a rerun, nigga? 
I just want my motherfucking refund, nigga 
Funny looking ass, go and eat some', nigga
I ain't never had to get my fucking teeth done, nigga 
When I kill you, I ain't running to you, bleed some, nigga 
Oh, you wan' be some nigga? 
Me and 6ix9ine had Trippie Redd bitch on the couch
She was giving us a threesome, nigga
Why you bring my name up in the first place, Tory? 
You ain't fucking with me on my worst day, Tory 
Wasn't better than me when I was in first grade, Tory
We can do this every year on your birthday, Tory 
Every summer, every winter, every Earth day, Tory
Every Tuesday, every Thursday, Tory
It's gon' be a motherfucking anniversary, Tory
You done fucked up, now you need first aid, Tory
Shit
Damn
So now that we got that out the way, hmph
Let's make a record, nigga
Hahahahaha
JoynerDon't you stare me down, you know I'm rude
Why the fuck you looking at me like you so confused?
You really make me sick my nigga if you only knew
I swear to God I wish you wasn't born and there was no excuse
Cause I don't want to raise you
I really fucking hate you
I wish I ain't have to take you, I ain't trying to educate you
Yo, this really fucking sucks, and your mothers fucking nuts
I had my whole life figured out, leave it to you to fuck it up
Man shut the fuck up! What you crying for?
Looking at me like you love me
What you lying for?
Why you want to try me for?
Blow your fucking candles out
Enjoy that cake I got you, for your stupid little birthday that everyone's so excited for
Except me
Shit I dare you to disrespect me when you grow up
That's gonna be the last time you ever swell up
Fuck you thought
Everything was perfect, now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga
Sometimes I wanna kill myself so I don't have to deal wit' you
I know it sounds harsh but I'm just being real wit' you
And I ain't looking forward to none of that father shit
I ain't got time for that type of shit
And your mom ain't gonna like this
But we ain't
Shooting no hoops
Flying kites
We ain't riding bikes
I hope you get your ass beat
I ain't teaching you how to fight
I ain't here to kiss you goodnight
I don't care to give you advice about girls
I hope you get your heart broken for dear life
I fucking hate you!...
And I know that its wrong
Sometimes I wanna explain but I don't know where to start
Cause you won't understand even if I told you my thoughts
Cause even when its light
I feel like i'm alone and its dark
My mind keeps racing fast
I can't bear with this pain I have
I can't stand you
And I hate the fact that you just a mistake
And that's just what the fuck you was
Everything was perfect
Now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday Nigga
Shit I wanted to be a father so bad, I would give it all
Just to have my baby sit in my arms while I'm holding on
And to feel that beautiful feeling of love for my first born
Even play you the first song, that you hear when you first come
I loved your fucking mother so much I would give my heart
To be down to death do us part
Till I drown in a fucking pond, till I burn in a blazing building
Apartment fire with bombs
Till I crash a Mercedes car, by a drunk drive on broad
With seven heaters on me
And then she fucking cheated on me
Drinking with her friends and they didn't wanna leave the party
Got drunk and had sex, I ain't even see it coming
And then we find out she was pregnant, and she keeping secrets from me
This don't make sense and I felt my fucking heart cave in
The baby not mine, the paternity test came in
And the love is gone
Everything was perfect, now its fucking lost
And its all your fault
Happy Birthday MotherfuckerStompin all up in the rain
Hop up all up in the way
Elephants a couple lions and a zebra
Put the heater’s in your face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, it’s funny
Watch em pull apart your little face
And I've been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Tell em what i slay
Beast in a cage
Nigga this is what you call Jumanji
Ain't no new Bugatti's
Just a deuce deuce shotty
Big enough to make Bruce Bruce potty
Turnin' Bruce Jenner to a new hobby
I ain't cool with nobody
I don't trust a motherfucking soul nigga
Even let the grim reaper know nigga
Put it on my tombstone when I die here
Take a step inside of my world
27 years still ain't comfortable enough to call a bitch my girl
You are now looking at a monster
85 teeth, 39 deep, 26 piece
Run and light a fucking military with a M-16
Influenced by George Bush
Burn your whole city with a blowtorch
Then I ride out in a tour bus
And I hop out in a Porsche truck
Like blah
Black tie swagger
Black pride nigga
Black lives matter
Black eye shadow
Black nine barrel
Bang bang move back my nigga
Why lie?
Every night I pray to my god
I don't gotta wait to blah blah
And I never gave 2 caca's
I'm a heavyweight new prime time
In an MMA fight
With a Kimbo Slice for your neck
Then I put my fucking life in the script
It's a movie put my life in the shit
Pack a mag and we could get it crackalackin
Back when I was tryna make it happen-happen
Nothin' happened, nothin' ever shot at rapping
And if that doesn't happen I'ma stack it
Till I turn a pack into another pack
‘Til I sack it up to cap a captain
Big enough to put a fucking bomb inside it
And blow flames on a fire
Be the dragon
Bin Laden ain't got shit on me
I don't think you understand
You are really looking at the devil, nigga
I don't think you wanna dance
Meet me in the clouds and the smoke nigga
I hope nigga you ain't never stood a chance
You ain't never, you ain't never
Could've been should've been would've been
Look at him Joyner Lucas
Stompin' all up in your face
Poppin all up in the bass
Elephants, a couples lions, and a cheetah
But the heaters in ya face
And leave you with the monkeys
A banana clip, its funny
Watch 'em pull apart your little face
And I been in the jungle with the fucking apes
Hunters wanna slay beasts in a cave
Nigga, this is what you call Jumanji
Jumanji
Me and my bitch against y'all
So fuck you and your in-laws
Never grew up on Crenshaw
But I grew up on menthols
And I smoke till my fucking lungs squeeze
And I choke till my fucking tongue bleed
In the carpet of yo mom's crib
Till your tubs leaks on them love seats
And this must be what it feels like
When you full force and I'm dead right
And you dead wrong and I'm here like
With my hands wrapped around his like
Goddamn
Black tie swagger
Black pride nigga
Black lives matter
Black eye shadow
Black nine barrel
Bang bang move back my nigga
This is more than a board game
What's Jumanji with a little morphane
The gorillas talking like a torpedo finna knock up on your fucking door frame
Not a problem you was just a floor stain
At the bottom of the ground i'm walking on
I betcha momma teach you not to talk a lot
I betcha ya dog'll teach you not to bark a lot
A lot niggas gotta get it
I've been tryna get it
I'ma tell you bout it, if you gotta minute
Got a minute?
Ayo you gotta minute my nigga?...
...Yo...
Ayo you got a minute?...
Aight...
Back when Iverson was in his prime
I was writing
I ain't wanna get a job
I was dream chasing
I was gettin mine
You was sleeping
I was tryna get a line
Nigga woo
Ayo Joyner...
Let me show you how to keep the dice rolling when you rolling that dice on that Jumanji game, my nigga
Get em!

And put a dick inside of your esophagus
And poppin shit

Cock another glocka
Blocka blocka

Traded my hoopty for a Honda 
Traded my Honda for a Panther 
I just got a crib in Wakanda 
I never been into the drama 
Never been a fan of designer 
All I really got is one wish 
A one night stand with Madonna 
Think I gotta hit 'em with the head bust 
This is for them days when they made me ride the motherfuckin' sped bus 
And this is for them days when my teachers told me I should go and sell drugs
Niggas went to jail, ain’t nobody put the bail up

I just got a million out the bank 
Spoil my son, do what I please
Fuck what any nigga gotta say 
Lay in the sun, kick up my feet
I just might pull up in the mink 
Take my enemies out to drink 
Toss my weapons in the lake
Count up my blessings and I'm straight 
I think I might go on a date 
Count all my dough in the safe
Roll with the wave, look at my soul in the face
They don't even know what to say
I just want 
Ten bands, twenty bands

Never had no money, but she love to dance

Look at my feelings, I'm civilized, yeah
Analyzed, and I might spend a night with a dyke
Get her right, bitch, if I hit it right, huh
I remember scraping up the quarters 
Drinkin' from the sink to get some water 
Tryna pay the rent, I couldn't afford it 
Stressin' made a nigga bipolar 
Washing machine out of order 
Nigga had to hustle on the corner 
Now I'm back and forth from the border
Savin' up hoes like a hoarder 
Ten bands , twenty bands 
She'll do anything for a couple grand 
Never had no money, but she love to dance 
I gave all my money back to Uncle Sam

Frikki-frikki-frikki, uhAhh, shit
Joyner!
Yo, nigga's saying, "What a great battle"
But you about to see a fucking snake rattle
Boy, you just a pony with a pink saddle
I'm truly sorry that you stuck inside of Drake's shadow
When are you gon' overcome? 
When are you gon' level up?
When are you gon' grow another foot? 
When are you gon' show us that you number one? 
And everything that you accomplished in some years about to take me just a couple months
Don't you think I'm bluffing neither
I thought you were tougher, eager 
How you almost signed to Justin Bieber?
You look like a fuckin' beaver 
Ten years in the game but yo' ass still sittin' on the fucking bleachers
Boy, you just another diva 
Heard yo' grandmama kicked you out the house screaming
"Tory, we don't fucking need you"
Why yo' daddy up and leave you? 
I guess this is how they fucking treat you
And you my puppet, you my Cousin Skeeter
This ain't what you wanted, they been waiting for it
I'm Joyner Lucas, what the fuck you niggas take me for
I pull up in a Demon but I kill Satan for it
If you want attention Tory you gon' have to pay me for it
All these hoes love me but you sucker niggas hate me for it
You roll up on me, catch a shot at ya Mercedes door
The bullets fly, you recline like a La-Z-Boy
All you do is cry, you a child, you my baby boy
You call yourself Tory after The Notorious Big 
Biggie turning in his grave when he hear yo' shit
Don't ever think that you could ever come compare yo' shit
Little girls and kids only ones who feel yo' shit
I skipped the plaques on my way to a Grammy
All your records soft and sweet, niggas think that you candy
Your niggas really convinced you that you think you can scare me
And you got identity issues, niggas think you a tranny, really? 
Tory tell us why you always gotta lie in your rhymes 
I know keeping up with lies can get tiring sometimes
You not a G and deep down you wanna hide sometimes
Staring at the sunshine and start crying sometimes
Your real name is Daystar, you been dying to shine
And when you sing you kinda sound like you dying sometimes
You make the type of tracks that had me feelin' silent inside
Nobody take you serious, put all the violence aside
Okay, let's talk about your plagiarism that you hate to mention 
Or talk about the hate you giving to the greats you dissing
And that writer who wrote yo' shit still ain't get paid on that "Don't Die" record
You should probably go pay the nigga 
And how the fuck you talk about Kendrick when he a legend 
Then go bite the nigga style on your record right at the ending
On "4AM Flex" 2 minutes and 50 seconds
Sound exactly like "The Art of Peer Pressure", go take a listen
You inspired by the niggas you name dropped
Catch fire in the rain, no umbrella to shelter you and no rain drops
When I seen you on Flex, I gave props
But then we found out you stole Don Q shit from the train stop
You thought you were fly 'til the plane drop
Ugly motherfucker tryna stunt in a tank top
It's no wonder why they used to feed yo' ass with a slingshot
You my son, this the last time I'll give you a Ring Pop
Sit down, you on punishment
And don't get up until you see me
And don't even think about touching that TV
No more video games, no more phone, no more 3D
No more radio or boombox for your weak ass CD
Matter of fact, give me your chains back and everything I bought you
You a disgrace to this family and everything I taught you
I hate to say it son but you make me sick
I should'a knew you weren't shit when you came out with a baby dick
It's no wonder why you pay for pussy
Tory you think you slick
All you do is lounge around the house all day like a lazy prick
Shit, highly disappointed in you son, I need some answers
How come you couldn't follow in my steps and be a dancer?
Or maybe write a book like me or be somebody's grandpa
Instead you wanna be a fucking rapper with some hair plugs
No more rapping, give me your pen and paper
No more lying to the people on how you the biggest gangster
Now hurry up and get your juicy out the refrigerator
You going to bed at eight o'clock and not a minute later
No, I don't wanna hear it
No, let this be a lesson
Close your mouth and go into your room like I suggested
I'm a get real Joe Jackson in a second
Matter of fact, give me your toys, I'm adding that to the collection
I just did a show and got it lit ya little nigga
And my freestyles killing your originals nigga
Couldn't name a bitch I couldn't get ya little nigga
You a rebound, even Scottie Pippen know nigga
You ain't from Toronto, put that on the Bible
I put six hollows in your Ferragamo
Nigga, you from Brampton, go spin the bottle
Bitch I'm from New England, me and Brady in the El Dorado
Now come get on my level, I'm hard as metal
I bomb the ghetto, I brought the shovel
I bury all of you little ninja turtles
You Donatello, you soft as jello
You must be gone off that Amaretto
It's hard to tell 'cause you soft as pillows
You fucking midget, I call you Willow
I throw you out a fucking car window
I step all over your Margielas, you caught feelings
Yo' heart spinning, my bars illing
I'm Bob Dylan, I'm John Lennon, I'm authentic
Your bars running no off limits
Don't talk business, don't talk, listen
I'm off this so you fuck this you fuck! Nigga
What, nigga
Fuck out my face nigga
Ayy nigga look
We gonna get one in, pause
Let's not, let's not do this back and forth shit no more
I, I think we know what's up, you know
Ha ha ha, JoynerI don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
Look, I don't wanna be no fuck nigga
I don't wanna sell drugs, nigga
I don't ever wanna fuck mad hoes
And then claim I can't find love with 'em
I don't wanna be no super thug
I don't ever wanna get tripped up
I don't wanna get drunk and high
And spend all my time in the strip club
Look, I don't wanna ever go to jail and shit
Serve time and get bail and shit
Be a bum and start stealing shit
Fuck around and die and go to hell and shit
Yo, I don't wanna be jobless
And I don't wanna be heartless
Run around, tryna start shit
Pickin' fights, thinkin' I'm hot shit
Yeah, I don't wanna become vengeful
And I ain't into what you're into
Pray to God I don't run into
Someone just like you, my one issue
Hope one day, that shit does hit you
'Cause you so goddamn judgemental
And I don't wanna... look...
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
Uh, I don't wanna be hopeless
A pretty girl with no focus
A single mom with like four kids
Never had much, never owned shit
And no school and no diplomas
Dropped out and don't know shit
Steady sticking my nose in on your business
Spreading rumors, uh
I don't wanna be chasing guys
Half ratchet, half sanctified
Giving all your friends lame advice
Always going out, can't stay inside, yeah
I don't wanna become trite
Content with my fucked up life
Little attitude, actin' uptight
Never had a clue, but I love fights
No, I don't wanna smoke cancer sticks
Going out every chance I get
I love the truth but can't handle it
Tryna cover bruises with bandages
But I hope one day, that shit does hit you
Cause you so damn judgemental
And I don't want...
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be anything like you
I don't wanna be caught just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be just like you
I don't wanna be nothin' like you
I need someone to look up to
A role model I can run to
When I feel lost and I'm confused
And I'm out of touch with my young roots
I need confidence so that I can get
And I love you and your common sense
'Cause lately, I've been tryna live this thug life
And I'm not convinced
Look, I love how you handle your own
Glad you are the king to your own castle
You handle life when it's thrown at you
Never curl up, never faux fragile
I need you to be here, regardless
Teach me how to be there for my kids
Show me how to be fearless often
I need real guidance, I ain't scared of options
Because of you, I've got a clearer conscience
Because of you, I'm not scared of monsters
Because of you, I'm not afraid of failure
When life was blurry, you made it clearer
And God forbid, if you died now
I know that I'd be well taken care of
I know you'll be there waiting for me
I just wanna be just like you
I wanna be anything like you
I wanna be just like you
Yo, what's up, this is Joyner, I'm unable to take your call right now, leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
It's really Valentine's Day and I'm sitting here thinking I'm about to get a gift from this man but this man can't even buy me a good dress because it's fucking Tuesday. So why should I expect a gift on Valentine's Day? And I'm here    chewing on some fucking bubblegum waiting on some hard dick that's probably in the next bitch right now. So you know what? I'ma go find me my own chocolateYeah, yeah

I love your piece of mind 
I love your conscious, ain't no options
My apple meets the eyes 
Ain't no stoppin', damn my heart's been back and forth
Trapped and bored, it's on a magic floor, behind a padded door 
All my emotions in the attic stored, inside the bag of orbs, in the cabin drawer
And you wonder why a nigga playing hard to get 
That shit's hard to fix
I just want peace and some common sense
And I ain't really into the arguing
So I hope you not upset 
I know you not done yet 
And I know you like drunk sex 
I hope you ain't cum yet 
You wanna hop up on me like dubstep
Then pop up on me like drug tests
But I'm livin' and I learn how to love less
Wanna hit me where it hurts like a cup check
Oh, damn that's painful 
That's okay then 
You're my future , That's So Raven
That's amazing, we divine
Lemme free your soul, lemme ease your mind
Baby, hit me up and call me any time
Don't be restless, let your problems be my problems
I don't mind it

I was tryna love you better
Girl, I know you've been hurt before
You been treated bad, you been taken advantage of
I know, I know I drive you crazy, babe
I curse you out, I don't mean what I say
And I can't get how you keep kickin' me out
You just need me now
You worried 'bout sex, I be weedin' 'em out
Make 'em fear me now
And I make a change, I pull up in that Wraith
All this ice on the beach, I just put on them skates
Titanic, that diamond, I put in the safe
Hit an iceberg and climate's be in the heat
And damn, my love's enormous, leave when I'm performin'
Not scared of heights, I'm soarin'
And you know now I'm woke, bitch
Baby, hit me up and call me any time
Don't be restless, let your problems be my problems
I don't mind it
Put your panties and your pride to the side

Now can you hear me?
'Cause you ain't listeningGo
Buck, buck, buck
I think I was born inside a cabana
With diamonds and gold on top of the Phantom
Jesus told Mary, "Go get me a hammer
I'll kill any nigga that try to get near him"
All of the angels were drinkin' tequila
And Michael was sleepin' with Dirty Diana
And now I can't look at the man in the mirror
My life is a movie and here is the trailer
I ain't no killer, but don't try to play me
I'm out of my pills and now I'm just crazy
I jumped out of Heaven 'cause Lucifer paid me
I needed the money to buy a Mercedes
I fucked a few bitches, I had me a baby
I hope that my son don't grow up to hate me
I'm out of my mind and no one can save me
I wish I—
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself 
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry
Think I was losin' myself 
I prayed to God, and promised if he made me rich
Then I'ma stay true to myself 
But fuck it, I lied, and now I just stare in the mirror
Like what did I do to myself? 
I think the old me died
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I told my girl I'll give her the world
Whatever she want, consider it done
Soon as I'm rich, I'll buy you a crib
And get you a whip, whatever you want
Promise my niggas, "I'll give you a million
A couple of cars just so you can stunt"
Then I got famous, blew up my head
And fuck what I said, my nigga, I'm gone
Hop out the foreign and jump in the stretch
Life is a bitch, I fucked her to death
And how do I feel? I'm somewhat depressed
I'll probably get killed, but fuck it, I'm blessed
Nigga, I'm rich, I'm done with the stress
Now I got drip, and blood niggas sweat
They love when I trip, they want me in debt
Go choke on a dick and cut me a check
All of these meds done got me a fever
I wanted a chain but got me a Visa
I came in the game, just proppin' my feet up
You niggas is strange, you follow the leader
And me and my pistol like Martin and Gina
We plot on you niggas, I'm probably a schemer
I'm easy to hate, I'm harder to love
You say you don't trust me, I wouldn't either, woah
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated 
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons 
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"
But  I didn't mean it
Back when a nigga was jobless, tryna get by
Plottin' on shootin' myself 
I was just tryna survive, the money went dry

All the damn promises, I forgot
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied
I let the money change me, I lied 
I just put some gold Dayton's on my fuckin' Benzo
Hit the switches, told your bitch, "Come fuck me 'cause I said so"
They say, "Joyner, you done changed, you done lost your mental
You blew up and all that humble shit went out the window"
I ain't the same, I used to be different
They say that I changed, well, maybe you right
Maybe them pills the doctor prescribed me
Got me wantin' to kill, and maybe I might
Maybe my family upset 'cause I made it
'Cause no one expected that I would be famous
And just 'cause we blood don't mean we're related
I'm threatin' the plug, I'm not with the fake shit, I'm not with the— 
Grandma told me, "Tone it down," I said, "Bitch, I'm older now"
I ate at my auntie house, she think that I owe her now
Cashed my check, got paid again, make you's think I'm Oprah now
Took my girl to H&M, she told me, "It's over now" 
I had to move back at home, my mama was heated 
I locked myself in the room to hide all my demons 
I told my uncle to give me a loan 'cause I really needed it
"Soon as I'm on, I promise I'll pay you in full"

UrghYo, I know you don't understand my words
But you will eventually
You will eventually, some day
One day
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I hope you understand I love you more than life itself
And this is nothin' but your daddy's thoughts when he was feelin' empty
And everything ain't always what it seems like on the outside
I fought so many tears so that you would never see the outcry
I never wanted kids until I lived and went through hard times
And became a man that fell in love with someone that my heart finds
But you know how that shit go, young and reckless, different women part time
And I wasn't ready for that life yet, I was in my dark prime
Me and your moms ain't get along and she gave me a hard time
I really think that we just crossed paths at the wrong time
I wasn't happy when she said she was pregnant
Probably the worst news of my life, that shit was so depressing
I told her she should get an abortion and I really meant it
I'm sorry that I said that shit, yo I was trippin'
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I'm sorry, yo
And I never wanted a broken home to raise you from a distance
Yeah I'll admit it, I was scared of that type of commitment
Even hopes of a miscarriage, anything bad that could happen
That'd get me out of that situation, I was livid
I felt like shit about my thoughts, that wasn't me, I'm different
Plus I was dealing with some demons that I couldn't live with
I told her she should get an abortion and I really meant it, damn
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older I hope you don't hold this shit against me
Hope you don't hate me, I was selfish, I hope you forgive me
I hope you forgive me 
And I still remember your baby shower like, it was yesterday
And to your mom it was special, me, just another day
I wish that you could see the pictures, all the fake phony smilin'
Had to pretend that I was happy, deep down I was cryin'
Ma asked if I was okay, I turned around and looked away
I was dryin' all my tears, look back to say "Yeah"
I was lyin', goddamn, how the hell I get here?
This is it, this supposed to be my life, this ain't how I pictured it
I never felt so damn alone, but it was more than often
One of the worst days of my life, and I ain't even lyin'
We argued when we came home, I blame myself for all this
I think that I was holding a grudge cause she ain't get an abortion
I'm sorry  damn
And I know you can't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I can't believe I tried to hurt you, I hope you forgive me
Please, please
And everything ain't always what it seems like on the outside
I fight so many tears so that you would never see the outcry
I sacrificed my life so you could live it, peace
Want to give you things my father couldn't give to, me
I think I was raised wrong and that's just what it is to me
And if you ask him then his ass gon' probably disagree
But whatever, whatever...
And nothing's ever made me cry as much as you, I swear
Your smile gives me motivation and some new ideas
My worst fear is always you not knowing who I am
Cause I been on the road dreamchasing for you out here
I was the first thing that you opened your eyes to
And the last one that you said goodnight to
I went home and cried to
And I bawled my eyes out and then watched you
Glad I got you, that's a blatant fact
And every negative thing I said I swear I take it back
I know you don't understand my words but you will eventually
And when you get older, I hope you don't hold this shit against me
I hope you understand I love you more than I love myself
And this is nothin' but your daddy's thoughts when he was feelin' empty
I was feelin' empty, I been feelin' empty
I put my emotions in this music when I'm feelin' empty
I hope you forgive me
Please, please

Talking about making money and I'm spending your money
But spending hella money is the only way you're going now
Yo these private conversations got me thinking out loud
Used to queue up out front, I come through the back now
Dear mama, all I wanted was to make you proud

Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
Hello... hello?  JoynerFirst, we're affected by what we know
When I talk to the kids in high school classes, college classes, that's the first thing I tell 'em
Get the information while you're here
Like nothing worse than being stupid when you get out of school
So get the information, being broke is bad
But being stupid is what's really bad
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid
Uh, this the shit I dreamed about when I was only four
Sugar, water, mac and cheese, we were broke and poor 
Court evictions, landlords never showed remorse
Now I'm in the building, when they greet me, they gon' hold the door 
I never needed your acceptance, this is my destin'
I made devil's work and turned it into God's blessings
Can't knock me off the block, this is not Tetris
Life lessons, I learned tables turn, that's my assessment
They told me to be patient, but I need to flex 
I'm so famous, I can finally hit JAY-Z direct 
I might hit up Drake and tell him to send me the jet 
I might drink Cîroc with Puff if he send me a check 
Lot of squares in my family, I could see the stress
Bunch of crabs in the bucket tryna eat my flesh
I ain't nothing like you niggas, I don't even rest
I don't sleep until I see success, I wish you the best 
I ain't on no hating shit, I just wanna get rich 
I don't do relationships, I don't wanna commit
Lot of bitches did me dirty, ain't talk to me since
And now I'm insecure, closed off, but that's hard to admit 
I'm just thinking 'bout the days that were making me jealous
Can't rain on my parade when I'm made of umbrellas 
Fuck it, it don't faze me, I don't stay in my feelings
Thought money would change me, but it changed all my niggas 
I just bought a Lamborghini and painted the ceiling
I ain't bragging, I'm just happy I made me a million
ADHD, I was slow, now they label me brilliant
I'm proud of niggas like Hov, he made him a billion 
I hope I never go broke tryna break through the ceilings
Fifty thousand on the low, I might make an appearance 
This that shit that made them kids run away from they parents
Nigga, I'm breaking your spirit 
I told myself if I go out, then I'ma light my wrist 
If I die today, I'm happy for the life I live 
And my son is only three, he be like, "Mama rich"
Told him go outside and play, just be inside by six 
I done made my niggas proud, you ain't gotta love me
Give a fuck about your opinion, only God could judge me
I don't even write on paper, I just write on Tully 
I might hire an assistant, make her write it for me 
This is me against the world, that's the mood I'm in 
Hop up out the fucking pussy like I'm new again 
I remember they was calling me a hooligan
In special education, I just might go back to school again, woah
Only hit it once, then I make her leave 
We ain't cuddlin', I need some space to breathe 
If she fuck me good, I let her stay 'til three 
No, I'm not your man, but we can make believe
Okay, you got an ass, that don't mean a thing to me
Stop acting like a brat, bitch, I ain't Jermaine Dupri 
These pussy niggas talkin' 'bout what they gon' say to me
And they gon' beat me up, I told 'em that's some shit I'd pay to see
Stupid
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupid
Nothing much worse than that unless you're sick
Like sick, broke, and stupid, that's
About as far as you can fall unless you're ugly, right?
But surely that would be the ultimate, right?
The ultimate negative life, ugly, sick, broke, and stupid
I turned my life into a movie, bitch, I think I'm Rocky
I can't even wear my jewelry now, they think I'm cocky 
I know that I got myself if I ain't got nobody
Just bought a pistol, I just hope that it ain't got no bodies
You gon' have to pay the price if you get wishy-washy 
This a Talladega Night, I think I'm Ricky Bobby
My advice, quit the music, get a different hobby
All you lil' niggas sound the same, just a different copy, woah
And I bow my head and pray for this 
Yeah, I spilled my guts and made a mess 
Shit, I ran on Mars and made a wish
Yeah, I stand on cars like Jaden Smith 
And I ball so hard, I sprained my wrist
If I shoot it, then I ain't gon' miss
Loyal nigga, so I ain't gon' switch 
Blew my money at the strippy, it don't make no sense
Broke and stupid, shit'll never be the same again
And what's really, really bad is being broke and stupidFall slowly
Fall slowly
I love you more than I love myself
If I weren't with you, I can't picture me with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed
You know the vibes we on be like some movie shit 
And we don't always get along, but when we do, we lit 
I never understood love or what it truly is until I met you
Now we just inseparable until we trip 
And every time you try to leave, I'm chasin' after you 
And every time I go, I keep on comin' back to you 
'Cause you belong to me, and I'm the other half of you
And as much as I need you, deep down I know I'm bad for you
You know I'm bad for you 
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
You're not perfect, but you make life worth it
Maybe that's why we stick together like cursive 
Hella toxic, but I know that I'm determined
If we can make it through the fire, we can breathe inside a furnace 
Your family never liked me, they all think that I'm a burden
They know when we're together you're a different type of person 
Whenever things get bad, it never seems like it's worth it
It's like we're drownin' really fast until we get back to the surface
And we never learnin' self-love 
So we been there for each other when no one else was 
And all the times I was broke and you kept me held up
And got me back focused or held me down when I felt stuck 
And every time I try to leave, you're chasin' after me 
And every time you leave, you keep on comin' back to me 
'Cause I belong to you, and you're the other half of me
And as much as you need me, deep down you know you're bad for me
You know you're bad for me
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
Fallin' slowly, fallin' slowly
I love you more than I love myself
If you weren't with me, I can't picture you with someone else
And every time we separate it's like we under spells
'Cause when we hurt each other we come back to help each other heal
You say I'm crazy, but at least you know my love is real
But shit, you crazy too, and that's why they say love is hell
And it's forever, so I hope you never up and bail
And if you ever left me for someone, you gon' get someone killed 
The swing that takes me now
Of crawlin' down me skin
Hold me by your name
Hold me 'til the endKeep it a 100
Uhh, yo
Somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
I slaved away for ten hours a day at work and just finally got my check
But the ATM isn't working, shit
Oh, there it go  damn, it's hot as hell
Punched in a pin code and grabbed a hundred dollar bill
I snatched it up and went back to my wheels
Hit up the plug and said "I know you got some bud, I need that with some pills"
Meet me outside the gas station on Park Ave, I'll be waiting
Then put the cash in the glove compartment as I sat waiting
Damn, yo where's this nigga at?
Bout to light a cigarette while I-, oh, there he go
Opened up the glove compartment, told em to light this
Come around and drive inside and act normal like we ain't making a transaction
Take that  I dapped him up and got to sliding
He crinkled it up, walked off then put it in his pocket
Off to the strip club with some drinks and some orders
He pull that hundred out his pocket, uncrinkled the corners
Stageside, watching this one bitch shaking and twirling
Busted it open all exotic and maybe she's foreign
She making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She sees that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking "I want that", he takes a sip from his glass
She bend over, he slaps her ass and puts some ones in her crack
He whispered in her ear "How long are you here? Tell me you single
Oh, you got a man? Fuck, I don't care, tell him I'm queer
Save my name as Susan in your contacts, hm
And fuck your relationship, I ain't worried about that, heheh
Can I use that red marker, sir?
Let me write my number on this hundred for you
Make sure you hit me up when your boyfriend can't do nothing for you
-507-2209"
She got home and opened her purse as soon as she gets to the door
Counting them dollars, smoking tree while she sit on the floor
I don't think she like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna get high now, uhh
Grab the Benjamin off the floor, she feeling alive now, uhh
Few grams of coke on the table, that's the right now, uhh
She rolled a hundred up and stuck it up her nose like
That's what she call Heaven's door
That's what she call Snow White, the white without seven dwarfs
She throw a hundred back at her purse and headed down to the store
She needed blunts for the gas, she needed gas for the Ford
She needed eggs and some dill, she needed cheese and some milk
She needed change
"What what number is that?
I said what number is that on the bill, what is that?
Yes, in red, it's like a phone number
What is this? Never mind"
"Aye aye, don't you make one mothafucking move
Empty that register, I know you don't need my help
Hurry the fuck up, look, don't make me repeat myself
Gimme the cash, follow instructions, don't be fucking moving
Cause I'd hate to kill you over something stupid
Now hand me the bread and place your hands on top of your head
Take my tough advice
Turn around and count to a hundred if you love your life"
Now keep it a 100
Uhh, keep it a 100
Yeah, keep it a 100
One hundred
Keep it a 100
Yo, somebody told me money rules the world, I know you heard that shit
Money's the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
He put that hundred inside of collection plate on Sunday too
Hope that it'll take away your sins, maybe someday soon
But anyway, they covered the plate and just continued praying
After church, the pastor opened it up and started saying
"Lord forgive me but I need this, I've been really static"
And he grabbed the hundred off the top and started staring at it
Held it up to see if it's real or fake
Then looked around to make sure nobody was looking, and then he took it, damn
Off to the streets with the Lord, off to go find him a whore
A hundred bucks in the dash and now he riding the course
He see some bitch on the corner, he told her hop in the car
And then she opened the door
"Come on bitch, yo hurry the fuck up, I ain't tryna get caught up"
Then continued driving and stuff, looking for a spot in the cut
"How much for head?"
"Now how much for sex?"
"Damn, a 100?"
"Fuck"
"Nah, I'm just saying, that's a lot bitch, like gotta calm down, damn"
Now she making eye contact, she got on eye contacts
She see that Benjamin Frank, she keep her eyes on that
She's thinking "I want that", he pulls his dick out his pants
"Ooh God is good"
Transaction complete, and she went back to the streets
Back to the cash at the leash, she back to get back on her knees
And she don't like how this shit make her feel
But you gotta do what you gotta do when it's time for paying bills
For real, she wanna retire soon, she swear to God 
She looked up and seen the hand of God, oh my God...
Forgot she had a pimp
That nigga been looking for her ass for days
Took every single dollar and left her eye black and gray
He be on the corner jamming, getting drunk that-a-way
7-Eleven gambling, throwing all his cash away, yup
Some say that money rule the world, I know you heard that shit
Money the root to all evil, blessings and murder shit
Yeah, that pimp just lost that hundred dollars in that dice game
He said "I should've just bet that shit on tonight's game, whatever nigga, nice game"
The homie who won it walked off with the hundred
Then opened up his wallet, stuck it inside and then put it in his pocket
Started stomping and running
Feeling so good, started hopping and jumping, money flopping and rumbling
His eyes is as big as his smile, no stopping him from the prow
He's jogging, skipping around, 'til his wallet fell on the ground
A hundred sticking halfway out, in the back of a halfway house
For like three weeks so don't even ask me how, check it
A homeless man walks by, sees a wallet, opens his eyes
And then grabs it, opens to check what's inside and to his surprise
It's money, a couple dollars, a hundred bill with some writing
A number written in red, if he had a phone he would call
But he doesn't, so he says "Fuck it, it's mine
And I'm really hungry and thirsty, I want some beer, a beef jerky
Maybe some ten percent juice, hm
And if the store's open, I need some cigarettes too", true
He walked into the same store on the block
Just so happen to be the same exact store that got robbed
What a coincidence, that shit is just as weird as I thought
The clerk rang him out and said, "That'll be 18.25"
And then he held that hundred out with the red number written on top
Then everything stopped
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
Mr. Lucas, Officer Michael Bradley with the police department
Trying to get a hold of you now, this is the third time calling
I need to speak to you with regards to some serious charges
You need to get back to me as soon as possible
Or we'll be showing up at your door
With about 10 officers and some handcuffs
Choice is yoursI been snatchin' purses while I'm rapping in the back of churches
I'm a backwards person, I ain't laughin' don't you act absurd
And I've been havin' urges, ain't no passion
Don't you bastards think you bad at cursin'
I've been bad since birth, been slapping nurses asses
Takin' percs and I've been urgin' to get served in action
Got a nervous itchin' in a serpents kitchen drinking Captain's
While I'm servin' children, different words that's spillin' out the cabinets
In a hurt position this absurd addiction got me laughin'
Spit faster, runnin' with impact 'til your wrists cramp
And break your kit-kat while you play with your kids back
I'm Chris Hansen
Laughin' at addiction,, absurd, in this position
Hurt inside a cabinet, spillin' out words that's fairly different
Servin' children while the captain's drinking in a serpent's kitchen Itchin' from a nerve in action, got served while takin' percs
Ass nurses slappin' since birth, and I've been cursin' bad you
Think you bastards think you got passion, but ain't no urge you havin'
Been absurd action, don't be laughin', ain't no person backwards
I'm at churches in the back rappin' while I'm purses snatchin, nigga
I been chasin' rappers down with pencils, paper books, and stencils
Writin' verses while I pack the pistols in the back of rentals
I wrote my dad's initials, then laughed and then passed it in to, I been half demented breaking shit down to half a sentence
I been half demented, breaking shit down to half a sentence
Fuck the rap Olympics, I murdered the past contenders
I cooked their ass and grill 'em, now you can eat that for dinner
And I used to laugh at niggas for actin' like fags with feelings
Till' I packed a gentlemen's packages filled with acid venom
I bought a toy gun with some bullets wit' plastic in them
Explosives with matches lit em' and left a few fragments in them
I never packed a mac in the back of a Ac or Sentra or
Lexus with gas unless it’s a Benz with a stack of Benjamins
Benjamins and stacks of Benz's and gas for the Lexus or the Sentra, act in the back of the mac when I packed it in it
The fragments lit matches explosives and plastic bullets from a gun toy I just bought for you niggas as y'all been reckless
Venom acid filled with them packages and I'm packagin' them
Faggots in they feelings just actin while niggas laughin'
Eatin dinner seized in the grill and cooked they asses, while contenders pass ‘em, murder Olympics, and rap past them
Sentence down, breaking dimensions in half essentials
I passed and laughed with the pencils I wrote in Dads initials
In the back of rentals I'm pistol packing a stack of stencils in the book, papers and pencils I'm rapper chasin' and-
- hold up
I'm the same nigga that fizzled pop and got ratchet on them
Yeah that same nigga that took a piss in your Arizona
And that same nigga that put acetone in a bag a soap
And then sold it for $40 some pussy and half a soda
And I never paid attention to rappers who actin' bogus
Who lie and say they rich in their songs when their ass is homeless
Then tryna throw dirt on my name just to pass the quota
Till I grab it throw em', bash 'em and laugh when they ass is over
Fuck 'em hard go hustle hard with the hustlers
Cut they jugular so you choke on your tongue and jaw
And I never been a gangster or wanted no trouble, nah
But I'm good with my knuckles punch through a brick and leave dust and all
All and dust, leave a brick punched with my knuckles, nah
But i'm nah, no trouble wanted, a gangster I never could
Your jaw and tongue choke on your jugular
Cuttin' hustlers with the hustler hustle hard
Fuck 'em hard over ass laughin', I'm bashin' my back, fold 'em
Crack 'em till the quota, pass 'em and trash 'em, and laugh over 'em
Homeless ass when they songs trash, and crack closer
Bogus actors who rappin' over the track, hold 'em
Sold a half a pussy, a dollar forty, I sold it for some soap and acetone, and a bath and then blast Both 'em
Arizona piss that I took in a glass of cola
And got ratchet on em, popped em and fizzled, I'm back to sodaPicture me putting my city all over the map
They wasn't believers, I had to get even at math
Be coming, I'm pulling and jumping all over your grass
So tell all my bitches I got a new girl
Tell the police that I'm robbing the bank and I want all of my 50's in cash
Bitch, I'm tired of living, check to check
I need twenty models and some extra sex
Smiling in my grave, bitch I'm fresh to death
I've been drinking Wu-Tang with Inspectah Deck getting drunk 
Yeah, I got some shit that I gotta just get off my chest
I can admit I got lots on my list and you next 
Take it how you want it, I ain't famous like I want it
But I think I might just skrrt off, blow the speakers and turn up
Pop a bottle of Smirnoff, go to church with my shirt off
Tell the Lord that I'm here now, I've been waiting for so long
I've been patient for so long, breaking rules like there's no laws
And I did it for a long time
If you don't like me, take a ticket, there's a long line
Nice to meet me, hoe, I think the pleasure's all mine
Shit, they've been clocking me so long, I think they lost time
Ooh you lost your mind, nigga
Fuck you mean? Whoo! Hol' on
Goddamn it, nigga
Fuck you mean? Whoo!
And I don't trust a mothafucking soul
What the fuck you mean? Whoo!
Hol' up, whoa whoa whoa whoa
What the fuck you mean? Whoo! 
Look
Don't know what you thinkin', compare me to niggas is nothing
Adrenaline pumping and blood'll be leaking and running
Shit, I do what I do, I don't care if you like it or love it
Tell all of my bitches I got a new girl, wait
And tell the police that I'm robbing the bank and I want all my money in 100s
Bitch, I'm tired of living on the edge
I wanna sell drugs but they gon' call the feds
I just bought a brick and that shit cost an arm and leg
My momma told me, "Take it back and get a job instead"
Me and the devil got too much in common, I swear
Born in the ghetto, I never had nothing to fear 
Take it how you want it, I ain't famous like I want it
So, I might just throw a hissy fit
Call up Cassie, ask her if she broke up with Diddy yet
I said shawty, if she's talking I ain't hitting it
Cause she gon' call her friends up and brag about the shit we did
Whoa, I ain't into pillow talking, go chop off your lips
If I ain't in your top ten, go dive off a bridge
My block boys got Glock fours that'll knock off your lid
I doubt you gon' pop off, so hop off my dick
Whoo!
Nigga, fuck you mean? Whoo!
Goddamn it, I said fuck you mean?!
Listen, I don't trust a muthafucking soul
Nigga, no, nigga, fuck you mean?!
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa
What the fuck you mean?!
You thought I was finished, you thought it was over?
You thought I retired, you thought I went fishing with Kobe?
Nigga, I'm still as the illest, considered as one of the coldest
Still-a pull apart in a rapper head like Moses, mm-hm
I'm throwback like I'm Motorola
But hoe, I'm cooler than a cup of yogurt
Black flag, Crip boy, truck soldier
I'm cool with drug lords and Ayatollah's
Rap god, cyclops and ogre
Bitch I'm King Kong, ain't nobody told ya?
Fuck you think bro still smoking?
Aww fuck it, I'm Bobby Brown, 'bout to go get loaded
Retarded Paul McCartney, bitch I'm rich

Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
Yo, this is the third time this week
That you failed to pick up your son, and I'm just so confused
Like I find it funny that you stay in the studio laying something down
Slanging mixtapes but you have yet to bring home diapers
And lay your kid down and go to sleep
On Snapchat talking 'bout, "Where's the plug?"
Like I’m sure he’s at National Grid tryna cut my lights back on
Like "a dollar and a dream" ass career
And you can't even come home and give us a dollar for some fucking milk
I'm not doing this with you, keep it 100, my niggaI spent a check on a whip, on a bitch, on a grip, on a flip
Lost it all and got it right back, yeah
I fell in love with a chick that I thought was my bitch
'Til I found out it wasn't really like that, yeah

I can hear the sounds of the war 
And this ain't goin' down like before 
I can hear the sounds of the war 
I used to make love to a down-ass trick, you could bend her backwards 
I don't need much but a badass bitch and a Netflix password 
I know that I'm comin' home late, but fuck it, what we gon' do after?
I'm tryna get head today, go to work like you got rent to pay

Hit 'em with the hand, the Deebo
All of you birds is Dan DeVito

Stroll through life like I ain't got rules
You think I ain't shit if I ain't got you
But how you gon' walk if you ain't got shoes? Ayy
Shawty shootin' bullets from the Pontiac 
She a ventilatin' hypochondriac 
She just wanna know where the Molly at 
I just wanna know where the party at 
I'ma leave your ass where I got you at 
Damn, you done let the dog off the leash
Can't talk to me, now I'm harder to reach
You don't belong to me, you belong to the streets 
I spent a check on a whip, on a bitch, on a grip, on a flip
Lost it all and got it right back, yeah
I fell in love with a chick that I thought was my bitch
'Til I found out it wasn't really like that, yeah
So I won't be around anymore

I'm in New York with five hundred sticks and we sell 'em two thousand apiece 
A hundo for privates, yeah, land in Hawaii, my bitches in Honolulu 
I hopped off a jet and I land in Dubai
Look like she got red contact in her eyes 
I'm 'bout to ride, you know you can slide
I'm 'bout to ride, but I don't do lie
Want your body like Nicki Minaj 
Hypnotize your jeweler with these diamonds 
Takin' mine, yeah, that's an honor 
I fuck with you, but this one done, yeah
And all my life, I just wanted to be me, babe 
And all my life I just wanted to be free 
Said all them nights spent together, we would stay up 'til forever
You act like you don't remember, but I do 
And that's alright 'cause I know what it's gon' be, babe 
Said, "That's alright, I found someone else for me" 
So when you see us out together, please act like I never met you 
I just thought that I should let you know that
I won't be around anymore 
I can hear the sounds of the war 
And this ain't goin' down like before 
I can hear the sounds of the war 
So I won't be around anymore 
I can hear the sounds of the war 
And this ain't goin' down like before

How the fuck I end up on the other side of life?
No more hangin' with my friends, no more ridin' bikes
No more brushin' barbies hair, no more flyin' kites
No more school, no more learnin' for me
No more youth, no more juice
No more hula hoops or Suzy Q's
Wish I could kiss my momma bye 
And if she ever see me like this, she'll be traumatized
No this is not alright, but nothing is 
I barely got to live, I'm just a kid
Look at me, look what you fuckin' did
I'm fuckin' dead 
No this wasn't even my fault, now I'm speaking with the lights off
I don't think they hear me
It ain't no more TV, no more dancin'
No more sleepovers or no candy, no more campin'
No more kisses from my daddy 'cause I left and died
All because this stupid bitch wanted to text and drive
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
We're frozen in this moment
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
Auto pieces, oil leakin', drippin' gasoline
Door is open, windows broken, glass shattered dreams
Holy bibles, open beer bottles at the scene
Now look at us
No more comin' home from work and cookin' dinner for my man
No more prayin' for my sins, no more stuntin' on the 'Gram
No more Thanksgiving holidays or pictures with the fam
No more vacation plans to everywhere I've never been
It's all gone now
Look what you did 
Damn
I should have never got inside your car
I should have stayed at home or just went shoppin' at a different store
I should have waited or just called an Uber, but I live too far
No more tantrums and ain't no more questions, no more answers
No more homework with my daughter, no more second chances
No more baby in my belly, sad to say we died
All because you choose to drink and drive
Why?
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
Frozen in this moment
Ain't no way ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
I've always been a one for challenges and different thrills
Open alleys while I'm speedin', that shit gives me chills
Hittin' corners, ridin' fast and that shit's really real
My momma always said if I don't chill that shit gon' get me killed
It's too late 
I say goodbye
No more drivin' reckless thinkin' I won't pay the price
No more taking life for granted I just wasted mines
Oh my god, I just died tryna race and drive
Smash time, watch the glass fly
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeah
We're frozen in this moment
Ain't no way, ain't no way you can go back
Float away, float away, float away-ay-yeahWe gon' be alright

So if I take advantage of you, you won't be so nice
You told me "Next time there won't be no next time", looked me in the eye
And I gave you a chance even though you not my type
She told me "I ain't gonna let you hit unless you spend the night"
Then treated me like them other hoes that you might fuck sometimes

Ever since I got laid off, you don't treat me like you used to, no
 But now my backs to the wall
Kinda hard to believe when you make it seem like you not havin' a ball
You make it harder for me when you wanna leave but I miss havin' your all
You ain't talkin' to me and it's been a week and I ain't happy at all
Listen, it's been way too long and you been actin' funny
You say shit, like you'd bend over backwards for me
Shit we've been back and forth since last December
We break up, but it don't matter cause we get right back together

Whoa, and my homie said he heard you complain about me
And I've been stressin', hopin' that you feel the same about me
Cause lately conversations with you kinda crucial
Ever since I got laid off, you don't fuck me like you used to, no
 Okay, back to the basics
I love when you tell me you trust me and don't want to go back to the fake shit
You fuss and I get all my stuff and I move back down to the basement
And plus I don't wanna be the one to be givin' up right now when I'm anxious
I've been thinkin', I've been down since days you ain't had no money
You say shit like you'd bend over backwards for me
Shit we've been back and forth since last December

I don't know why you keep doing this to me
We gon', we gon', we gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type, uh
How many times do I have to keep saying the same thing over and over again?
We gon', we gon' be alright
I gave you a chance even though you not my type
You're literally doing nothing for us
I did some things I ain't proud of but I'd never leave your side
You're just being selfish
We gon', we gon', we gon' be alright, done
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peaceI got, I got, I got, I got anger, hate and jealousy inside my DNA
I got envy and bad energy inside my DNA
I got snakes and satan entities inside my DNA
I got demons, pain and enemies inside my DNA
I got passion, guts and action tucked inside my DNA
I got pints of Michael Jackson's blood inside my DNA
I got Captain Crunch and Magic Dust inside my DNA
I don't do massive drugs, don't gas me up
Look, I got, I got, I got, I got
Murder all on my conscience
I might take me a hostage
I fell asleep in Worcester, I just woke up in Compton
Shout out to LA, where your songs play niggas gon' put on my shit
Half of you niggas fake, heart full of clay
What's your last name? Thompson?
Even if you join a gang, that don't really change up the fact you the softest
Don't let the colors get to your head
Who the fuck you think you are, Rodman?
Who the fuck you think you are, Ron O'Neal?
I'mma murder everything, I don't chill
If you lucky, then I might let you eat the scraps off whatever's left I'll kill
Nigga, pull it and *bap bap*
Blow your brains all on your crop top
Sick of niggas thinking they hot shots
Full of jokes, niggas get knock knocked
This is the chop shop
I know where they cooking the Crock-Pot
Semi-auto making them Hopscotch
All my life I've been cock blocked
I'm tired of being stuck in a blood clot
Talking that blah blah
I'm runnin', jumpin', duckin' them cops
Hop in the puddle while you jumping on FOX trucks
You can run all you want, we just gon' see how far you can get
If fans want me do features with their favorite rappers that'd be the best
Look, all them niggas know exactly who I am, but they don't give me no respect
'Cause the problem is they don't fuck with me, everybody see me as a threat
Yeah yeah, I know this sounds like some fresh air
If you don't hear me right use your left ear
I want to say that I'm the next up
I want it last year, they said next year
I want it this year, they say not yet
But I'ma take it from whoever got next
Twin deuce-deuces, I'm Clyde Drexler
What is competition, who gon' die next?
Get dissected in the lab with pliers, pencils, and a razor with my initials
Get stabbed by the guy who sent you
I'ma sign, send you the pollution, environmental
I'm a giant pistol, you're a kung fu guy
It's simple, you gon' lead by my example
I'm a flying missile that connected and fried your mental
DNA on the side your temple, nigga
*Cough, cough, cough*
Oh, shit
Someone call 911, niggas gon' die when I'm finished
I'll probably get locked up for life, what the fuck you thinkin'?
My whole life I been too fuckin' patient
Give me respect before I fuckin' take it
I know you see me don't duck your faces
You see me mentioned on publications
Then you get sour and suck your face in
Pay for my dick since you love to taste it
Better swallow the shit, don't you fuckin' waste it
I'ma flood the nation, this is suffocation, this is deprivation
This is Satan's kitchen, that's your destination
I got heaven waitin' angels flyin', prayin'
Jesus entertainin', Marvin Gaye singin'
Martin Luther dreamin', Pac and Biggie schemin'
Bob Marley smokin', Paul McCartney floatin'
Prodigy  mobbin', Pun say I’m joking
JFK riddin' 'round locked and loaded nigga
Shout out to Joe Budden
These niggas really don't know nothin'
I swear they gang full of ho muffins
I should just roll up and  *gunshot*
No one seen, nobody know nothin'
This shit is so touchin'
Shout out to Kevin Durant
This that underdog court that they throw us in
I blow your shoulders in
This that crack, this that shit that them hoes got they nose up in
Cinematic, movie shit I usually watch a little static
I crack you till you're leaking and begin to panic
A DNA ya bleeding and get liver damaged and get jimmy jammers
And I never had too many manners
And you know my momma always told me I was heavy handed
Fuck it though 'cause I was fully loaded
Now the semi jammin', I'm already blammin'
Got the hammer and the minivan
And I'm a busy man but I got liquor
And she bad and boujee
All of ya'll snitches is Ratatouille
Can't beat me up so they gotta shoot me
They don't like me now they gotta sue me
Killin' y'all softly, I got the Fuji
Don't touch me, all of y'all got the cooties
That's your bitch who sent me all the nudies
Get my dick sucked playin' Call of Duty
Nigga fuckin' shoot me
Nigga damn it they ought to know
Em shoulda' signed me a while ago
Cole shoulda' signed me a while ago
Dre shoulda' gave me a beat or two
Diddy shoulda' had me writin' for him in the crib for a week or two
I don't smoke weed but I needed to
This is a meter room
You gon' need a bag and a feeding tube
I'm mad and I mean it too
It won't be the last I'll see you soon
Kiss my ass and I mean it too
A lotta drama
Bitch I'm Freddy Krueger mixed with Jeffrey Dahmer
I know you're probably mad 'cause you look very sour
I'd probably be in hell if I was any hotter
I'd probably be Usher if I ain't wear a condom
I've never been a fan of Gucci, Fendi, Prada
But my auntie got it and she never leave the crib without it
Some people say I'm crazy, that's the the thing about it
Whatchu think about it? Think about it, niggaZim Zimma 
Who got the keys to my motherfuckin' Bimmer?
Bitch, I ain't no 
Yeah
I want a 'Rari, I'm feelin' godly 
Wonder how much that gon' cost me, they feelin' saucy 
Niggas know that I'm a problem, they'll never solve me 
If you came to start some drama, then bring a army
I've been goin' fuckin' fast and it got me swervin'
I know that I'm a child of God, but they want me cursed in
I've been trappin' out the Ozark, I'm Marty Byrdin' 
And I've been hard at work, yeah, ho, you just hardly workin'
If it wasn't for this rap shit, I'd be movin' kilos
Front the pack from my connect then cop a few casinos
Used to fake it 'til I made it just to boost my ego
Stashin' money in my shirt, they thought I grew some chichos, oh no
I got some new wheels, uh-uh
Tirеd of kids, they think that we in school still, ah-ah
Play me, you gon' find out how thе tool feel, ah-ah
Fuck around and you gon' find out who's real, ah-ah
Who, yeah, ah-ah
Zim Zimma 
Who got the keys to my motherfuckin' Bimmer?
Bitch, I used to dream of this
I ain't that nigga you could
Play with, nigga, that's dangerous 
Told 'em I was raised in the basement
Twin AKs in the playpen
Take your face, rearrange it
I can turn eggs into bacon 
I can serve base with a apron
Niggas been waitin' to hate it 
I got a Beamer and I'm anxious to race it
Vroom right past you 
Cops keep followin' a nigga, that's bad news
I don't like hassles 
Suck it down Remy and I'm feelin' like Papoose
Hope I don't crash you 
Lil' bird bitch with me and I call a ho Zazu
Mind your bidness 
Fuck your opinion, nobody asked you, woah
Look , this that WAP-WAP shit 
Shit'll make a nigga wanna stop, drop, shit 
Roll when you hit 'em with the Glock-Glock, bitch 
Semi-automatic if a nigga really think he want static
Now a nigga doin' pop-pop, bitch
Oh, you thought you was a hotshot, bitch? 
Now you want a crown with a hotshot, bitch 
Nigga, I was raised on the block-block, bitch
This is my time, no stopwatch, bitch
All of my whips is top-notch, bitch
How to get a plug at the chop shop, bitch
Even my son got pop rocks, bitch
Fuckin' your bitch, don't cock block, bitch
I get your bitch, at my casa, bitch
She gon' ride my drop top, bitch
Zim Zimma 
Who got the keys to my motherfuckin' Bimmer?
Bitch, I used to dream of this
I ain't that nigga you could
I got some bands, now they got they hands out 
All them hoes that have a man now, they pull my pants down
They know they don't got no chance now, bitch, I'm the man now 
Used to be my only fan, she got OnlyFans now
Yeah, I'm swervin', I got road rage, I feel like OJ
I don't wear no fuckin' Dolce, I smell like olé 
I might go back to my old ways, she want her soul saved
I done traded in my soulmate and got a gold chain
Okay
I came up with the privilege of poverty livin' and I ain't had nonthin' but scraps 
I had to watch niggas winnin' and drivin' in foreigns and I was just stuck in the back 
I had to learn me the bidness so once I applied it, I made me a couple of racks 
I had ménages with Nicki and Cardi and Megan and then I woke up from a nap
Ooh 
I had a Bugatti and then I woke up in the trap 
I had a couple of friends I left in the past 'cause they don't do nothin' but cap 
I know a couple of niggas that don't know the bidness and they do nothin' but rap 
Fuck it I guess I'll just shut up and drive, I got me a Beamer, I'm runnin' the lap
Zim Zimma 
Who got the keys to my motherfuckin' Bimmer?
Bitch, I used to dream of this
I ain't that nigga you could
Yeah, put me inside of a room with niggas you think that are better than me
I crush them inevitably, and leave them as dead as can be
That go to any nigga who's steppin' to me, they all come second to me
My words are weapons to me- I burn it, second degree
And get it, and I'm sick of any nigga that's sick, and I got it sick and shiverin'
Even Ritalin couldn't get rid of the kid
You gotta be kiddin', I'm trippin', I kinda feel like a kid again 
And, yeah, I got somethin' to say
I ain't with the games, I ain't come to play
Nigga, you confused, you a broad, go tuck your leg
You trapped in the wrong body like Young M.A 
I need my money like andale
Got a one-inch blade, get cut if you run that fade
I ain't really with the dumb ass shade
I come back brave, get cut when I run back sayin'
Zim Zimma 
Yeah, ayy
All the girls, dem sugar
I'm a trill ass nigga, I'm a Mike Jack thriller
I'm a VJ killer, I'ma get 'em long-range, Reggie Miller
Watch me swerve on a nigga
Zim Zimma 
Yeah, yeah
All the girls, dem sugar
I'm a trill ass nigga , I'm a Mike Jack thriller 
I'm a VJ killer, I'ma get 'em long-range, Reggie Miller
Watch me swerve on a nigga
Zim Zimma She got a nice face, she got a nice body 
I still can't love her, still can't trust her, baby, I'm sorry 
I'll hold her down, if you don't got me, then I got me 
It's over now, so please don't call me, please don't find me 
Yeah, yeah, when I move on, you wanna stop me 
On everything, girl, I'm a king, I think I'm Rodney 
Ain't no fake love, only got real niggas around me 
And all you care about is drinkin', gettin' sloppy, you don't give a fuck about me
She got a nice face, she got a nice body 
I still can't love her, I still can't trust her, baby, I'm sorry 
When I'm off that Henny, I see double, feel like a zombie 
But we still don't ever slip, no movin' sloppy 
She wanna study all the tats all on my body 
Somebody told her that my middle name Muhammad 
She thinkin' I'ma fake a love, say I ain't 'bout it 
I told her, "Baby, watch your mouth, you better stop it" 
All my life been sucker-free 
That's absurd
None of these hoes are cuffin' me 
That's my word
And I heard money don't come from trees 
But you can't hustle me
Yeah, your ass look good in them jeans
That don't mean too much to me 
I need a lil' somethin' with a vibe 
Lil' somethin' with drive
I know you wan' fuck all day
Might try and make love to your mind
I been tryin' get my mind right, ooh
These hoes ain't my type, ooh
She want that limelight, ooh
She'll do anything for a Klondike, ooh 
What you gon' do for the pension? 
Way too tempted
Tryin' get rich, get mentioned
She'll do anything for attention
She'll do anything for her interest
How did you get so senseless?
How did you get so foolish?
How did you get so clueless?
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm whippin' it, car from the plug and it came with a brick in it 
She ain't had to tell me that she wanna fuck, I could see in her eyes she was diggin' it 
She said she could try, but it ain't gon' work 'cause this just the life that was livin' in 
She tell me she don't give a fuck 'bout my past, I told her, "Baby, mind your business"
She got a nice face, she got a nice body 
I still can't love her, I still can't trust her, baby, I'm sorry 
When I'm off that Henny, I see double, feel like a zombie 
But we still don't ever slip, no movin' sloppy 
She wanna study all the tats all on my body 
Somebody told her that my middle name Muhammad 
She thinkin' I'ma fake a love, say I ain't 'bout it 
I told her, "Baby, watch your mouth, you better stop it" 
It's like, it's like I still can't love
See, that's what real pain does
Oh yeah, I'm feelin' you, baby
But what I feel ain't love 
Yeah, I might tell you it's yours
But nah, I still ain't hers
And she just callin' you "daddy"
Ain't know what your real name was 
Friends I feel changed up
And shit I still think of
Love got me mentally scarred
Still tryna heal things up 
We all started from the bottom, tryna build things up
But it's some dudes who love to hate and that's some real strange love
I know some real gangstas 
Niggas who still slang drugs 
They got pills, can't bluff 
But they ain't got no love 
And they ain't got no trust
'Cause those'll be your downfall 
Bro says, "Shawty bad, why you ain't keep her 'round, dawg?" 
Shawty say she bad, bad, she a bad bitch 
She don't know the half, half, I'm a savage 
I just put the cash bag on a mattress 
I don't need it that bad, you can't have it 
Tens, twenties, fifties, hunnids, run it, oh God
Shawties did me dirty, now I got a cold heart 
Booty on point, kinda hard to say no
But what you gon' bring to the fuckin' table?
She got a nice face, she got a nice body 
I still can't love her, I still can't trust her, baby, I'm sorry 
When I'm off that Henny, I see double, feel like a zombie 
But we still don't ever slip, no movin' sloppy 
She wanna study all the tats all on my body 
Somebody told her that my middle name Muhammad 
She thinkin' I'ma fake a love, say I ain't 'bout it 
I told her, "Baby, watch your mouth, you better stop it" Hey, let me clarify something for you
You're looking at a lot of fucking time
So this is completely up to you
We can do this the easy way 
Or we can do it the hard way 
I need some fuckin' information 
And I need it right now 
This your motherfuckin' conscience, nigga, don't even do it
Don't start actin' like a bitch 'cause you forgot where you goin'
You made choices that done put you here, and now you just ruined
And I don't care about why you did it or who got you influenced
Nah, don't listen to that nigga, that ain't good advice
If you cooperate, then it's your chance to save your life
Just tell 'em what thеy wanna know and you won't pay the price
Some would call it snitchin', but for mе, I call it make it right
Man, fuck that "make it right" shit, you gotta sit through your bid
You should've thought about this shit before you did what you did
Give a fuck about your family or your bitch or your kids
You either gon' respect the code or your gon' get what you give
Who gives a fuck about the codes? No one follow codes
We both know that jail ain't the place you wanna go
Somebody fuckin' on your bitch, you tryna call her phone
If I was you, I'd tell them boys everythin' they wanna know
Pssh, okay, let's think about this, let's embrace it
Let's make an illustration
Let's say you switch up with it and bitch up and then make a statement
Now niggas in jail, that nigga ain't tellin', had no snitch temptations
Now you might be free, but you might get killed for givin' up information
And if you don't get killed, then that's a wrap, everybody gon' know you as a rat
Won't get no respect for the rest of your life, nobody wanna know you after that
You might just run, but you never could hide, how long you hopin' that'll last
'Fore they catch you slippin' and give you somethin' that you know you had to have?
Fuck that, let's say you keep your mouth shut and take the blame for it
Now you need money on your books, ain't no one payin' for it
No visitations or no letters you've been waitin' for
That pussy you've been cravin' for, you may not get laid no more
And all them niggas that you call your brothers'll be ghost
The only one who got you is your mother if you close
A bunch of niggas screamin' "free you" and makin' posts
No one show up to your trial, niggas pray that you get smoked
Man, please tell me you ain't 'bout to take this sucka's advice
Your kids'll grow up knowin' that you just a sucka for life
Lackin' morals and integrity, it come with a price
And if you fold, then you should know that we ain't nothin' alike
And if you leavin' here tonight, you better cop a burner
Don't fuck around and be somebody ain't nobody heard of
Now here's your choice, be a man or be somebody murdered
It's either you can take the stand or you'll be Bobby Shmurda
Free Bobby Shmurda 
Alright
So it was me, C-Dot, Killa, Rico and Vic
Cut the shit
Who is Rico? Who is Vic? 
I want their real names 
Killa's name is Jonathan Taylor 
And Rico's Michael McCormick
And Vic , he was the person, pretty much
He was like the head of the operation
Snitch 
Snitch 
Snitch 
Snitch

I don't trust niggas, I ride by myself, all I need is my strap and my armor 
All I can see is these fuck niggas, it must be somethin' they put in the water 
I quit my job at McDonald's and built an empire and now I'm a gold mine 
Nothing was handed, I dreamed it, I did it, been wantin' this shit for my whole life 
Move, move, move, get out the way, nigga bossed up 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I just got laid, I'm gettin' sauced up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far 
You know you too lit when you stretchin' these bands
You know you on top when your enemies fans 
You know you too blessed when they think you a threat
Try and aim for your neck, but I never be scared
Niggas on drugs, I was packin' all the work
Couldn't find a spot, we was trappin' out the church
Boost mobile phones had me waitin' for the chirp
Fresh to death, I was waitin' for the hearse
Casket fresh, had the weight goin' crazy 
Show up to your door like the Avon lady
I could be the GOAT but the hate won't save me
If niggas hate me, then they hate Tom Brady
Go against the grain then you gotta be brave
She don't like me then she gotta be gay
To take me down then you gotta be paid
There ain't enough money I gotta be paid 
I don't trust niggas, I ride by myself, all I need is my strap and my armor 
All I can see is these fuck niggas, it must be somethin' they put in the water 
I quit my job at McDonald's and built an empire and now I'm a gold mine 
Nothing was handed, I dreamed it, I did it, been wantin' this shit for my whole life 
Move, move, move, get out the way, nigga bossed up 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I just got laid, I'm gettin' sauced up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far 
Can't touch me when I'm in my zone
Came too far to sell my soul
When you gon' give me the respect I'm owed?
When you gon' watch my dreams unfold?
When I'm on tour, I just wanna be home
When I'm at home, I just wanna be alone
Me and my niggas still share the same clothes
When you got brothers, man, anything goes
Pull a bitch here like clickbait, ayy 
ADHD, can't see straight, ayy 
Work a lil' job, I was still outside like, "Please will you listen to my mixtape, huh?"
Please will you listen to my mixtape, ayy?
Still can't listen what a bitch say, ayy
Niggas switched up, that's a mistake, ayy
Never thought I'd see this day, ayy 
I don't trust niggas, I ride by myself, all I need is my strap and my armor 
All I can see is these fuck niggas, it must be somethin' they put in the water 
I quit my job at McDonald's and built an empire and now I'm a gold mine 
Nothing was handed, I dreamed it, I did it, been wantin' this shit for my whole life 
Move, move, move, get out the way, nigga bossed up 
Ooh, ooh, ooh, I just got laid, I'm gettin' sauced up
Ayy, ayy, ayy, gotta go up 'til I motherfuckin' lift-off
Wasn't supposed to make it past twenty-one, nigga, I can't believe I done made it this far Fuck you doing in this motherfucker, huh?
Who sent you here?
Why you keep fronting like your friends are here?
Acting like you ‘bout to be next this year
I mean the food gone, ain't nothing left to share
We done ate that shit
Funny how they told me to stack this year
Now a nigga get colder than central air
And your momma shoulda aborted you and left you there
Damn, I need a massage
Where the gay bitches when I need a ménage?
She said she got a porn tape that I needed to watch
And I remember days where I couldn’t even get by
Uh, I couldn’t even get mine
Couldn’t pull a fine chick to save my life
And ain’t nobody want to go with me to the prom
And now I got so many hoes I can’t even decide
Real shit, believe it or not
The light skins love me like I’m Chico DeBarge
And I ain’t give a fuck if you’re sleeping or not
Time to wake niggas up, whoo!
Fuck you talking ‘bout?
I be fronting to these hoes like I’m rich
And they don’t know I got a room at my momma’s house
You know it's always something 'bout the impressive ones
Working all week for my check to come
And I ain’t make shit after taxes though
But it feel good not to stress so much
Know it’s something coming in for now
And I can get my son a Nintendo now
Couple shirts and a damn Netflix account
That’s it?  yep, but that’s okay
I know that I’mma be alright, I ain’t rich for now
But I got dreams I could live for now
And there’s a whole lot of niggas doing worse than me
And that’s as good as it’s gonna get for now, cause
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be 
I got work
I could split heads in a drive-by first
Blow your damn brains in your tie-dye shirt
And I ain’t been the same since I got cursed
I gave my CD to Bad Boy and I got curbed 
So when you see Diddy, tell him I got words
My shrink keep telling me to calm my nerves
But it’s been a long time since I got heard
And don’t nobody give a fuck when you starving though
They don’t answer me when I’m hollering though
Try to cancel me like "The Cosby Show"
Until I put them hands on them like Rousey though
I got a hundred fans waiting in the lobby line
Taking shots like it’s party time
Hands up, ain’t nobody got to die
I just got four rings like the Audi sign
I just bought cocaine for a nigga to flip
Real shit, the bigger the brick
Now these hoes looking at the flick of the wrist
And I can take your girl out to chicken and shrimp
She said my head so big I could live in a blimp
Word? Heh, well listen to this
I remember watching "MTV Cribs"
Thinking how the fuck all these wack niggas get rich
While I’m eating TV dinners
You know, the ones with the meat in them?
Pause, I kinda wonder what they see in them
Got laid off from a job, it was seasonal, geez
I think I’ma need a hit for now
We all got dreams we could live for now
But there’s a whole lot of niggas doing worse than us
And that’s as good as it’s gonna get for now, cause
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be 
And I’m feeling way, way up
And I’m looking way, way up
And my bitches way, way up
They miss that yeah, yeah, yeah
And she want that yeah, yeah, yeah
And I got that yeah, yeah, yeah
And we on that yeah, yeah, yeah
Said I’m feeling way, way up
Hold up, pause
We was trying to eat till they told us "Nah"
I wonder how much a pair of Pradas cost
With the ice cream, bottles and the Häagen-Dazs
Somebody getting robbed while this song is on
We just want cheese and the parmesan
I got a bitch at Mickey-D’s, she be working at night
And she gon’ let me hit it with pajamas on
Yo why these niggas think I’m playing with them? Let the paper hit them
You be copying, that's plagiarism
I be laying, sitting, standing on a fucking hater, kick him in the face
Them niggas got me twisted, I ain’t saving bitches, I got Sega Genesis
And I can play and finish if you want to pay attention
I’m hoping you wait a second, I’m broke and I pay the rent
I don’t know how I freakin' do it, I guess I don’t really believe in losin'
I’ve been a winner since I was a little nigga, nigga!
Hold up, stop
We was trying to win 'til they told us "Stop"
The cops ran in trying to hold up spots
‘Cause we were moving more O’s than a donut shop, whoo!
I’m pissed for now
I thought I had dreams I could live for now
They told me there was niggas doing worse than me
Motherfucker this as good as it’s gonna get for now, ‘cause
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be
I ain’t got much but I feel loved
Just be real love, just be real love, just be

I'ma be alright, ay-ya-ya-ya
Gold teeth and some Benzes, twenty-twos and some bitches
Strip clubs every night, that's the life that I'm livin'

I'ma be just fine, ay-ya-ya-ya
What a lonely night
One lonely night
Oh shit, oh shit, here we go again
Make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
And you gon' take this dick while I press record
And tonight you my slave, don't you ever tell me no again
So don't you ever tell me no again
Bitch I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Oh who hittin' you phone at two in the morning?
And I had to tell that nigga, "Don't you ever text my hoe again"
Said don't you ever text my hoe again
Look nigga, I don't care how long you been friends
I don't care if you knew each other since you was kids
Bitch, I don't care if your little brother is cool with his
I'm the shit, oh shit, where the noise at?
Everybody got a squad, can't avoid that
Niggas screaming "Gang gang gang," oh yeah
But when the shit hit the fan, where your boys at?
Oh shit, oh shit, I don't have a Visa
I think I'ma fall in love with a ballerina
Just let me hit it and I ain't waitin' for marriage neither
Cause she gon' fall and I'ma ball like alopecia
Hah, I said I go bald like alopecia
I turned to God then read the Bible and grabbed the heater
I want a mansion in Hollywood and Pasadena
But I still ain't got shit and I ain't too happy neither
And everything was all good just a week ago
I heard some shit about you, I ain't believe it though
Cause I don't listen to the gossip or tea and go
And treat your differently cause niggas wanted me to know
Yeah that's for you to guess and me to know
And shorty said I'm cold hearted, my shit 3 below
Yeah I just ran into the bank, give me all the bread
I ain't really want to do it but I need the dough
Oh shit, here we go again
Make sure you take them clothes off, bitch I'm going in
But you gon' take this dick while I press record
And tonight you my slave don't you ever tell me no again
 Shut the fuck up, hoe
Look, don't you ever tell me no again
Bitch I'm possessive and I never let you go again
But who hittin' you phone at two in the morning?
And I had to tell that nigga, "Don't you ever text my hoe again"
Woo! Yeah don't you ever text my hoe again
Cause I'm possessive and I never let you go again
Hah... don't you ever call my phone again
Yo, yo, hello, you
The fuck?
WhooooooaI wonder if you often think about what you became
Or do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I watch you raised me as a baby so over protective
Smiling at me, blowing kisses while you hold me restless
When you told me that you loved me I can tell you meant it
And it never took for you to try to ever show your efforts
But we was connected through the heavens though, I felt your soul
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
I bumped my head and you consoled me as you held me close
And I wonder where went wrong but I guess I'll never know
Cause ever since I grown I felt like you been kind of giving up
And it seems like everything I do is just not good enough
Shit, we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall the day that I was born
When you used to sing to me like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
I wonder if you often think about what you became
And do you ever wonder if you ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
Nigga I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
My father died when I was five and I ain't cry at all
I never knew him he just disappeared and I'm not sure if he knew I would grow up to be ruthless, I don't hide my flaws
A young woman with a body and a mind like yours cause we a lot alike
I mean that's prolly' why I felt connected
And when we met I was so innocent but slowly tempted
When you told me that you loved me boy I know you meant it
You sucked the soul out of my body with your own intentions
Now I'm stuck inside a life of prostitution, no discretion
And all you do is beat my ass and leave me slowly breathless
But we don't have the type of bond we used to have before
And I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall when I laid in your arms
And you used to sing to me like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
I wonder if you often think about what I became
And do you ever wonder if I ever truly changed?
Cause honestly I'm lost and I don't know who to blame
Listen, I need some help cause I don't know what else to soothe the pain
I used to watch movies about you a whole lot before
I read about you back in school when I was kind of bored
Now I'm ashamed and embarrassed I truly got involved
Cause you gave me a feeling some shit that I never felt before
And I ain't trying to make excuses but inside I'm torn
And you was there for me at times I couldn't find the Lord
And all I had to do was inject you and lock the doors
So I can feel some type of peace while I dream and go watch the stars
And that alone is just a feeling some will never know
But now I'm rotten, it's not the same as I felt before
We don't have the type of bond we used to have before
But I ain't mad at all, I just wonder if you recall sticking you in my arms
When you used to sing to me like
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la
La la la la la la la la la la la la la la la

Boston bitch, she bougie 
Yeah, you goofy
Told niggas, "You don't like me? Shoot me"
And if you don't wanna fight me, sue me
Guaranteed niggas won't like the new me
This feel like a Spike Lee movie
Room full of hoes and I might get choosy
Please excuse me
All of my moves are carefully planned
Don't play with me, I'm a family man
I put your bitch on my family plan
My mansion lookin' like Fantasy Land
I bought a beach with some Canada sand
All of my moves are carefully planned
I'm two steps ahead like Nigerian scams 
Now hand mе the Benz
You in the crib and I'm hеre with the fans
My bitch got titties like Pamela And'
And she wanna fuck in a janitor's van
I'm 'bout to turn to a psycho
You 'bout to see my true colors like Michael
I'm 'bout to pick niggas up with a rifle
I never lit niggas up but I might though
I'm a cool nigga but I can get spiteful
I'm 'bouta fuck this shit up like a typo
You do not know me, no, we ain't related
And we ain't got mutual friends that I might know
I don't wanna be acquainted regardless
Every bitch I ever been with told me I'm heartless
I don’t trust a single motherfucker, I'm cautious
I can never win, they want me up in a coffin
Way before I started winnin', had a couple of losses
Had to make a livin' out my mother's apartment
Wasn't too much opportunity to come up in Boston
I was fucking exhausted, I was done with the talkin'
I was workin' odd jobs, had me stuck in the office
On God, I was outside runnin' and walkin' nonstop
On a dark block, duckin' and dodgin' all cops
'Til they all stop, buckin' and sparkin' all Glocks
'Til my heart stops workin' at ten breaths
I benchpress any fuck nigga relentless
I been dead, I ain't put you niggas to bed yet
The bed wet, this a wet dream of wet sex wit' rednecks
Why am I not allowed to feel, to feel free?
I learned from God, whatever will, just will be
I bet you prolly wanna kill, to kill me
The cops who killed Breonna Taylor still free
And George Floyd'd prolly kill to still breathe
How many black lives did they kill to kill me?
I protest but we still feel no real peace
I hear no relief, I still don't feel free
And man I hate fucked up rules
Got a fucked up head with some fucked up screws
Bitch, please don't put me in a fucked up mood
Got twin nines, and we play duck, duck, goose
Better jump up, move 'fore I bum-rush
Niggas get lumped up too, I'm in a fucked up mood
I don't even trust me, why the fuck trust you?
Three deep in your crib like a drug bust, one plus two, nigga
I'm with the fam
Bitch, you a pig, I don't fuck with no ham
All y'all been sleepin', I'm tuckin' you in
I built a label then upped the advance
Please don't compare me to none of these scrams
I'm buildin' my brand, you stuck in the ground
I took advantage and stuck to the plan 
Fuck is you sayin'?
What's Gucci? 
Boston bitch, she bougie 
Look, you goofy
Told niggas, "You don't like me? Shoot me"
And if you don't wanna fight me, sue me
Guaranteed niggas won't like the new me 
This feel like a Spike Lee movie
What's Gucci?On our knees, we pray as we waste away
And we dig our grave, dead on arrival
I close my eyes and contemplate on why I chose to be great
I find myself tryna escape from where I'm supposed to be safe
Or maybe I should pray like I'm supposed to be saved
Sometimes I feel like getting even, but I chose to behave
I'm mentally locked in a prison, and I need bail
But the internet will kill me quicker than the streets will
And if that shit doesn't kill me, then the police will
Or maybe all the refills, or the E pills, or the lean will
I wish I was more flourished, I wish I had more courage
I feel like there's more purpose, and maybe it's all worth it
I wanna keep on learning, but I couldn't be more nervous when I keep looking for answers
And I gotta keep on searching, the tables keep on turning
Tryna call up to Jesus, but the phone keep on ringing
I think I need more service, the calls seem more urgent
And all I see is more murders, the soldiers keep on serving
I wonder if it's all worth it, I wonder
On our knees, we pray as we waste away
And we dig our grave, dead on arrival
In this mess we made, fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain, dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
I can't breathe
Got my head on the guillotine
Slipknot around my neck, come and take a seat
Watch 'em bury me down till I'm six feet deep in the underground
Dead is the land of the free
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take though it's killing me
Don't give, just take every time you need
Don't give, just take
On our knees, we pray as we waste away
And we dig our grave, dead on arrival
In this mess we made, fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain, dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
I can't breathe
Am I not worth saving?
Am I not worth saving?
On our knees, we pray as we waste away
And we dig our grave, dead on arrival
In this mess we made, fill our lungs with hate
Just to numb the pain, dead on arrival
Yeah
Dead on arrival
Dead on arrival
Dead, dead, dead, dead
Dead, dead, dead, deadAnd I think I've encountered my hardest days
Lord, won't you save me? Oh
You know what I've been prayin' for
And I never thought I'd see this day, yeah
I gotta make it change
And I think I've encountered my hardest days
Uh, writin' plans to make a new report 
Grind hard and turn my basement to a jewelry store
If you don't do it for your kids, then who you do it for?
I'm tryna read and learn some shit I never knew before
Focused on investments  build me up some nеw resorts
We can manifest it  you'd rathеr hit the Louis store
Wastin' all your blessings, care about the ones who doubt you
Just to impress some hoes who never gave a fuck about you
Just what I discovered
Never believed in family, that word is really a cover
Just a title that have the advantage to keep you under 
I got niggas I consider brothers more than my brothers
So watch it, you show your colors
We livin' in a world where prison walls is depravation 
Livin' in a world where snitchin' calls for celebration 
Livin' in a world where niggas crawl and segregation
Rainy nights and desperation, pray we fight the legislation
Protest until we flatline, paralyzed 
They throwin' stones at my Black Lives Matter signs 
Made a change but we still not satisfied
I can't smile half the time I'm still 
I'm still waitin', sittin' plottin' on the couch 
‘Cause I know that I ain't safe when all these cops is on the prowl 
Tryna think of other ways, but we ain't got no other route
I'm startin' to understand that shit that Pac was talkin' ‘bout 
And I think I've encountered my hardest days
Lord, won't you save me? Oh
You know what I've been prayin' for 
And I never thought I'd see this day   yeah
I gotta make it change
And I think I've encountered my hardest days
Lord, won't you save me? Oh
You know what I've been prayin' for
And I never thought I'd see this day, yeah
I gotta make it change
And I think I've encountered my—
Look, time is money and the clock tickin'
I teach my son love and respect, that's a God given 
My sperm donor never been shit, just a flop
Listen, if it wasn't for my step-pops, I'd prolly turn out different 
Probably be in a cell doin' a life sentence 
Probably have twenty baby mamas and nine bitches 
Probably grow up misguided, twisted inside the system
Dropped out and failed ‘cause nobody listen to my admission 
Sick of gettin' in fights with niggas less educated
Sick of gettin' advice from niggas who never made it 
Sick of bein' polite to people with lesser patience
Oftentimes, I wonder where I would be if I never made it
The hatin' always comes from niggas
That wish they had all your blessings or the clout 
And bad vibes forever, but I'm destined on this route 
I'm startin' to understand that shit that X was talkin' ‘bout 
And I think I've encountered my hardest days
Lord, won't you save me? Oh
You know what I've been prayin' for
And I never thought I'd see this day, yeah
I gotta make it change
Worst thing comes to worst
I fuckin' die a tragic death or some shit
And I'm not able to see out my dreams
I at least wanna know that the kids perceive my message
And were able to make something of themselves
And able to take my message
And use it and turn it into somethin' positive
And to, to at least have a good life
If it ain't black owned, I'm prolly gon' use it to chop crack on
Hard white for all them hard nights I had my back on
Roach-infested carpet, tip-toe in my mother's room
See a dresser and felt no pressure when takin' a twenty off it
Compton like a closed coffin, we walkin' to school coughin'
Often high off the gun smoke, Boston had at the front door
Cookin' class, I'm JAY, Hov', rock it up on they stove
Me and my teacher goin' back and forth like Noname and J. Cole
You said I would never be what? I wouldn't amount to what?
Now you in this Trader Joe's, same lines, sayin', “Wassup?” 
Talkin' ‘bout like how you like my songs, not knowin' it was me
Security had me in a headlock and I told you I couldn't breathe
Now it's Black Lives Matter and white letters on your shirt
Now how many black lives did you help, or did you hurt?
Did you handicap, block, push to excel or did you hinder?
Since hindsight's 20/20, I guess you don't remember
Now you with your mixed child, havin' all these mixed feelings
But do your black husband know you tried to burn down our village?
But never mind, from the line, that's for y'all to figure out
Just know that boy who wasn't shit bailed all his niggas out
And it's my black queen, I kiss her on her black lips
And she rock Off-White ‘cause she support black shit
And I'm blacker than a Steeler helmet or a Spike Lee flick
Black like the pick stuck in the afro of KaepernickI need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha, whoo, whoo

I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
You got some scary intentions
Your brain is clouded with too many possessions
You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
And all you do is flash your money and fortune
You ride around in that Ferrari and Porsches
And all you talk about is Bugatti and foreigns
You walk around like you somebody important
You surrounded by leaches and beggars
And none of them niggas wanna see you do better
I bet they plotting, wanna see what you got
Cause you brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous
So what the fuck you even see in the mirror?
Your future couldn't really be any clearer
And when it rains, you gon' need an umbrella
But you don't listen, you don't see it or hear it
And all you ever say is...
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha, whoo, whoo
I need more hoes, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more clothes, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
I think you really aggressive
Your brain is clouded with too many possessions
You think you rich but you depressing yourself
It's just so pathetic and materialistic
I really think that all them drugs got you tripping
Your brain is ruined and your logic is different
I know that syrup got your body in shivers
If I was you, I'd get that out of my system
And I think that you bugging and stuff
You just shit on everyone who's stuck in a rut
Always flash your money out in public and stunt
And we all just look at you in fucking disgust
Maybe you're just insecure with no luck
And deep down you're a dub without nothing to love
And I wonder if you'll ever realize what's up
And be humble and just say enough is enough
But for now you just wanna say
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha, whoo, whoo

I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
I need more hoes, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more clothes, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more dough, wha, wha, wha, wha, yeah
I need more blow, uh, uh, uh, uh, yeah
Yeah, I must be really possessive
My brain is clouded with too many possessions
I think I'm rich but I'm depressed and I'm selfish
I'm so pathetic and materialistic
Like how the fuck I let the money do this
Man I swear to God that I would never be tripping
I promised that I would have respect and be different
But now I make it rain on plenty of strippers
I'm surrounded by leeches and beggars
And none them niggas wanna see me do better
I bet they plottin', want to take what I got
Cause I brag a lot and make it seem like they jealous
And I never had nothing
I just wanna live like them rappers on TV forever
But what have I become? Maybe I'm one of them
Maybe I just don't know any better
And now what I'm sayin' is
I need more hoes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more clothes, more, more, more, more, yeah
I need more dough, yup, yup, yup, yup, yeah
I need more blow, wha, wha, wha

And what the fuck do I gotta do go to and buy me a mansion? 
Fuck is this? 
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long damnit 
And my manager told me, "Nigga, you gon' be rich" 
That was last year
Now I'm living in the ghetto with the crackheads
Working at McDonald's as a goddamn cashier
Ain't this a bitch? 
Liquor got me lightheaded 
Sippin' to the light red and
I ain't go to college, I ain't good at nothing else
So if this don't work out then I wonder where my life headed
I ain't got shit
Tired of being stranded
Gotta go and get it
Living in hell, that's a heaven full of bitches
And I'm scared to fall in love but I never will admit it
Shit, I never could'a did it 
Point me to the door, I gotta leave
Real cocky to them hoes that say hi to me
Like I'm the best thing you heard
Bitch don't lie to me, don't you lie to me
I tried to play the lottery
Maybe I can hit the Powerball
Cop 50 fly cars, and then drive them all
Just so I can feel like a rich nigga got it all 
Bitch you ain't shit, and these broads ain't loyal
Hoes won't relate but these songs ain't for you
And the game ain't the same, so along came Joyner
Standing around like you don't get the fuckin' picture
Let me paint it for you, I ain't playin' witchu
Waiting for the Illuminati just so I can get a check
Here's my soul let me trade it to you
'Cause what the fuck do I gotta do to go and buy me a mansion? 
Fuck is this? 
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long, goddamnit 
What a bitch 
I said my manager told me, "Nigga, you gon' be rich" 
Yeah right, I need a mansion on the water
And a yacht for my momma
Throwing party while we're bumping Barry White
Nigga, I just want a mansion 
I just want a mansion 
Yo, what the fuck do I gotta do to go and buy me a mansion? 
Fuck is this? 
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long, goddamnit 
What a bitch 
And my manager told me, "Joyner, you gon' be rich" 
A year later, now I'm living in the ghetto with the haters
Working at Denny's as a motherfucking waiter, nigga
Ain't this a bitch? 
Liquor got me lightheaded
Sippin' to the light red and
I ain't really got no damn back up plan
So if this don't work out, then I wonder where my life headed
I ain't got shit 
Tired of being broke, gotta get it all, plus a nigga need drawers
Gotta hit the mall
Ain't no cameras in the stores so I bend the law 
Point me to the door 
I'm winning now
Yeah, I'm tryna get some head
Bitch, it's been a while
And don't be acting brand new cause your friends around 
I'm tryna hit the lotto, thirty million and deposit all
Cop a mansion with a safe and I hide it all
Just so I can feel like a rich nigga got it all
This nigga got it all, it's all paranoia, I got a call from my lawyer
I should've went to prison but the bars ain't for ya
And the game ain't the same, so along came Joyner
Standing around like you don't get the fucking picture
Let me paint it for you, I ain't playing with you
Awaiting for Illuminati just so I can get a break
Here's my soul, let me trade it to you
'Cause what the fuck do I gotta do to go and buy me a mansion? 
Fuck is this? 
I wasn't supposed to be broke for this long, goddamnit 
What a bitch 
I said my manager told me, "Nigga, you gon' be rich" 
Yeah right, I need a mansion on the water
And a yacht for my momma
Throwing party while we're bumping Barry White
Nigga, I just want a mansion 
I just want a mansion She say I think with my dick and she probably right
And it's Friday night
And he gon' do whatever when he feeling good
But girl I promise you that me and him are not alike
I swear he 'bout to be the death of me, I can't fight it
And he gon' do whatever when he feel like it
I tried to teach him 'bout relationships and he don't like it
And he gon' go inside whoever when he feel invited
I had a conversation with him from the get go
He said "Nigga calm down let me finish, yo
Don't understand why you acting like a bitch, though
Ain't nothing wrong with a little bit of sex, hoe
You ain't gotta stress yo", my nigga, listen, you a part of me
You get me in trouble then you fall asleep
And all it takes is some liquor and some R&B
But you gon' fuck around and turn me into Charlie Sheen
Look nigga, I've been getting teased while the guys get played
Sweating in your jeans all goddamn day
Tryna feel a little breeze you can get a little wet
Go swimming 'til she screams, make her feel it in her chest
Love a bitch that'll suck me and swallow your kids up
Kiss me on my eyes while she tyin' her hair up
Then give a massage as I lay it down
Shit I could do this all night, I don't play around
My nigga, you don't ever take your time so it never lasts
You sabotage every chick I ever had
When you see another chick you say goddamn
The blood rushin' to your head and then you dive in
And you willin' to say whatever just to get some
You better hope that I don't ever fuckin' catch none
Cause you a dirty motherfucker you should listen to me
Or I'ma have to cut you off, literally
I've been thinkin' with my dick, baby I ain't got control
I try to fight it but he got a mind of his own
I've been thinkin with my dick but I'm tired of these hoes
And this is my confession, I can't lie anymore
I've been thinkin' with my dick, baby I ain't got control
I try to fight it but he got a mind of his own
I've been thinkin' with my dick but I'm tired of these hoes
And this is my confession, I can't lie anymore
She say I think with my dick and she probably right
Yeah it's Friday night
And he gon' do whatever when he feeling good
But girl I promise you that me and him are not alike
He sayin' "Hi, hello" and got a thing for Adele
He got a mind of his own, he really think for himself
It's hard to keep him happy, he a heavy hitter
When bitches call him daddy then his head get bigger
I had a conversation with him, had to set him straight
He said "Nigga calm down, homie listen, J
Ain't nothin' wrong with some pussy and a little brains
Besides I don't really know if this is just a phase
And I don't mean to be rude or to hate though
But I get bored when I'm in and out the same hoe
The same pussy every night I'mma lay low
And I could care less if she keep her fuckin legs closed
I love a bitch that'll suck me and swallow your kids up
Kiss me on my eyes while she tyin' her hair up
Then give a massage as I lay it down
And as soon as I'm done with her, I'ma make my rounds
And you don't ever take your time so it never lasts
Plus you sabotaged every bitch I ever had
And you ain’t even being safe, you fuck it you lazy
And as soon as you fuck up, then I'm stuck with a baby
And I hope that you know you givin' me a bad reputation
All because you don't know how to relax and be patient
Now these bitches trippin' they gettin' mad at me blatant
They call me a bunch of names, that's some bad defamation
And today I'm gettin' checked at the fuckin' clinic
And if I got somethin' then I know who fuckin' did it
Cause ever since the other day, I kinda feel a little burn when I'm pissin'
And if I got somethin' I hope my girl don't get it, hold up
Uh, yeah
This message is for Mr. Lucas, Dr. Kipling's office calling

"You have reached the National Suicide Prevention Hotline
Also serving the Veterans' Crisis Line
If you are in emotional distress or suicidal crisis
Or are concerned about someone who might be, we're here to help
Please hold on while we route your call
To the nearest crisis center in our network"So listen, buddy, I'm gonna give you a little test, okay?
Okay
Is that okay, buddy?
This test is call a Rorschach test
And it's a test that we give to smart kids like you
So we can see how smart you really are
And Joyner, you're only eight years old, correct?
Yes
Wow, you're such a big boy
Okay, so I'm going to hold up some pictures
And you're gonna tell me what you see in these pictures, okay?
Okay
Okay, let's start with this one
What do you see in this picture, buddy?
A butterfly
Yes, that is absolutely correct
What a smart boy you are, that is a butterfly
Wow, okay, how about this picture?
That's a television
And that's another correct answer
Good job, buddy, you might be a genius
How about this one?
That's a basketball
Joyner, you are so amazing
Another great answer, that is a basketball
I don't even know if I could've got that one right
Such a smart, smart boy
Okay, how about this one?
That's a condom
We're gonna try this again
You better not fuck up this time
That's a, that's a condom
Joyner, I just called you a smart boy
Please don't make me regret that statement
You know what? Let's just try another picture
Look closely and tell me what you see in this picture
Uh, that looks like a loaded gun?
We're gonna try this again
And you better not fuck up this time
I said it's a loaded gun
What are you, a fucking retard?
Are you stupid?
Mentally challenged?
What the fuck is the matter with you?
I'm sorry
I'm trying to help you
Look at the fucking picture
I am, I'm trying, I'm looking
Look at the fucking picture!In sweet dreams, I kid myself
Have your love for good
I really had hoped you'd stay
But like the river, you just come and go
And these things, they comfort me
When my mind's on you
And I feel you comfort me
But like the river, it just comes and goes
I used to think that you was Superman when I was younger 
Findin' comfort in your voice when I was down and under
Put you on a pedestal and now I kinda wonder if that made sense
‘Cause I'm convinced you showed a lot of colors 
All them nights I was alone, I hid inside thе covers
Used to argue with my moms whеnever I was stubborn 
I never warmed up to the idea of a step-dad because he wasn't you
And you and him ain't even like each other 
Used to bring me ‘round your girlfriends as I recall
I thought one or two was cool, but I ain't like ‘em all
‘Cause all you ever did was argue ‘bout who's right or wrong
And you ain't have no job, so you would sit at home and light a bong 
Used to crave for your attention, but I never got it
And everything you said we'd do is just another promise
You had dreams of bein' famous and I never doubted
But I started rhymin' to impress you, if we bein' honest 
But we can have some bondin' time and maybe pow-wow
A father/son relationship that we can smile ‘bout
At time's you got abusive and I had to bow down
Or keep on makin' music to try and compete with Bow Wow
Your father died when you was young, I think that made a scar
I started thinkin' maybe that's why you the way you are 
End of the day, no excuse for how you played your part
Told myself when I became a father, I'ma raise the bar 
We had a lot of fallin' outs and didn't talk for years
And all them birthdays and holidays got awfully weird
You threw me in a foster home and I was brought to tears
Livin' with some strangers, feelin' anxious, I was lost and scared 
And now I'm starin' at the river tryna get across
And all I see is apparitions of what never was
And everything I used to wish for is dead and lost
And if I never see your ass again, I'll be better off
I'll be better off 
You are so negative 
And you say you know
But you know a goddamn thing
Like the river, you just run and go
You say you could do good
And better you know
But you tried no goddamn thing
Like the river, I'ma run from you
I told myself I wouldn't write a song, but fuck it, I did
Oftentimes, I sit and wonder if it's somethin' I did
Or maybe I was immature, but is it somethin' I said?
I can't help but feel the feelin' that there's somethin' I missed
I told you somethin' happened to me and you ain't protect me 
You tried to say you ain't believe me as you disrespect me 
And plus, you never had my back, in fact, you may resent me in a way
‘Cause everythin' I say, you try to use against me 
And I never knew your other kids, but I knew of ‘em 
I'm not really sure if I like ‘em, but I do love ‘em 
Shit, I don't even think you knew but just a few of ‘em
‘Cause all your baby mothers stayed away to keep you from ‘em 
You probably out fillin' they heads with shit that's not the truth
You probably told ‘em that I switched up when I got some loot 
You probably told ‘em that I'm greedy and I'm not so cool
That I worship the devil and I sold my soul to cop a pool 
I worked my ass off to get rich, let's not confuse
I sacrificed my whole twenties just so I can move 
While everybody else was chillin', hangin' out with crews
I was writin' a plan to finally win while tryin' not to lose 
I still remember signin' my deal and you got hella funny
And at that time, you probably figured I had hella money 
But I only got a small advance, so I ain't even get a chance to hold you down
‘Cause then you started gettin' jealous of me
But I'm worth a couple million now, I turned out fine 
I copped my moms a big crib and went and got mine
An indoor pool with a house made and I'm not lyin' 
A happy son who loves his dad, it's about time 
But I'm still starin' at the river tryna get across
And all I see is apparitions of what never was
And everything I used to wish for is dead and lost
And if I never see your ass again, then I'll be better off
Nigga I'll be better off
Karma comes back and it's co-co-comin' 
Treatin' me bad and I'm ru-ru-runnin' 
Karma comes back and it's co-co-comin' 
Treatin' me bad, I'm ru-ru-runnin' 
And congratulations, nigga, you won
And all the love you never gave me, I can give to my son
Eternal love to my child, we'll forever be one
Thanks to you, I know the man that I would never become
Never becomeJoyner, Joyner, Joyner

Mass in the building 
Mally Mall
Let's go!
El banco siempre virao' , abran la caleta
Medio melón que vale mi muñeca
Hay muchos que lo han tratao', no tienen la receta
No le temo a los nombre', la calle me respeta
Un par de Mercedes y yo ni los guio 
Tenemos de to', estamos bendecio's 
Si no es en la calle, es en el estudio metio'
Y en el cuello hielo, siempre, siempre estamo' frío'
Frío', frío', frío', los diamante' de mis prenda'
Millo, millo, millo, pero el palo siempre anda cerca
Soy leyenda como Tito, soy boricua y no me quito
La baby me ve en la Lambo y yo sin tocarla me dice "Qué rico"
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro
Moreno, gringo, hembra, vato
Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow
I'm the realest nigga, I know

Gangsters, hustlers, killers follow
I just hit the fuckin'—
I'm still waitin' on Drake to hit me up and say "What's good, J?" 
"I need a feature on my album if you could, J" 
I slide on a ho if she look great 
And my whip matte black but it look gray 
It took a while just to get me in a good place 
Too depressed, never thought I'd see a good day 
They tried to put me in a box with some duct tape
Nigga, you ought to open up the motherfuckin' floodgates 
Nigga look, me and Yandel hit the jackpot 
Tired of being broke, just a havenot
And back then I was sellin' crack rock
Tryna make the check, sick of livin' at the trap spot
I need an old school Chevy with a ragtop 
Hit the switches on a ho, make her ass drop 
Say Joyner got the streets on a padlock
Know I gotta do it for my city, I'm the mascot
This is for them niggas on a six yard 
For them hoes who ain't think I'd make it this far 
Remember you was on top, you was in charge 
Now you livin' on my shadow like Spliff Star
Always knew one day I'd be this large 
Born and raised out of Mass but I live far
Got a strong right jab and I hit hard
Fuck around and leave a nigga leaking like discharge
Salimos a la calle, siempre estamos en play
Entramos a la disco como dieciséi'
Me vieron en baja, se comen el fake
Y si fantasmea, no le vo'a dar break
La movie en P.R. como en USA
Ustedes no pasan ni del TSA
Yo siempre en la mía, viajando en privado
Y ustede' to'itos esperando en el gate 
Con to' los diamante' cómo Thanos 
Ya la baby tiene todo pago 
Ustede' roncando que son malo' 
Y yo haciendo millone' con to' lo que grabo 
En la calle estamo' claro 
Todo Gucci, todo caro
A lo' haters que me sigan dando follow
Mientras contando dinero, estoy ocupado

Hay muchos que lo han tratao', no tienen la receta 
No le temo a los nombre', la calle me respeta 
It's my birthday I'm 'bout to get high, high 
I tell a broke bitch "Bye, bye" 
Spaceship whip look sci-fi
Mally think I'm a alien but I'm the guy, guy 
Came home, my bitch suck me dry, dry
But it's COVID-19, no high five 
I'm the best who ever did it and he got away with it
I win like it ain't no tie, tie, ooh
Why do I feel like Marshall? 
Coldest white rapper in the game
Let me dig in my bag, my arsenal
Your bitch tip-toe on my marble
I ain't never been shit, ain't shit change
I came up with this when your bitch came
I always show up for the big game
400K on four wheels when I switch lanes
Got brothers like Mally, like Joyner 
I got rich on my lawyer 
Got two hoes kissin', got two in the tub gettin' naked, I think I might join her 
Was an angel until I destroyed her 
Goyard bag, I spoiled her 
Then it went to her head so I had to kick her out
See her around, nowadays I avoid her
I say, uno, dos, tres, cuatro

I just hit the fuckin' lottoNow I be lying if I, I be
Now I be lying if I told you I ain't trying to get rich
I need mines, I need grind, ain't no time for no bitch
I'm surprised I'm alive, oh my god, take him up
Make him fly, break him even
They been sleeping, wake them up
They got molly, they got bands, I got fans, I got ooh
I got dro, I got grams, I got damn, I got blow, hoe
I got what you need, homie don't raise your voice at me my G
All these eyes on me, I see, that's word to Pac and B.I.G. I be, I be
On stages, and ain't there nowhere I got to go
I ain't got no fucking patience that's one thing you got to know
All these rappers in my way, they think they famous, I don't know
When I watch them hit the pavement I'ma feel like Holly Holms
I swear it don't get no better than this
I told my bitch we better get rich
Then flip these chips and get a new whip
And twist my wrist in front of ya, none of ya
Want to get pimped you son of a prick, let's flip this win and then uh
Jump in the air
I just want to dig a hole in a cell
I just want to say Hello to Adele
Yeah yeah whooh whooh
I just want to let you know that I'm here
I just want to sing a song and a prayer
I just want to make a toast to El Chapo
My idol, I might dig a hole in a cell
I should probably change my hoe to affair
I could probably make your hoe disappear
Different emotions you don't know what to feel
Always feel like my jeans burning
No bail and I'm seen murdering
New gold grills and your teeth hurt
I'm still walking and my feet hurt
Where's Uber when you need one?
Just tell me where you see one
I'm driving bars on the wall
Okay, where's Luda when you need her?
Listen, I'm my back to the wall
Then I'm back to the zone, I'm in a Twilight
If you ever get a minute tell them other little niggas I've been winning I've been doing it from hindsight
Don't you ever get a pen in on my level never said I'm not a rebel don't you ever get on my mic
And you ever been a kid and been a winner by the niggas and the pen I'ma end 'em in the limelight rhyme-light
I'm like, I'm like
Swish swish whooh
I'm like eh ya hoe, there I go
I'ma kill the game this year
Say I won't, may I? Woo
I don't give a fuck about no haters or what I never did
I got angels here and that's evident
I got halos all in my head I swear
Y'all done lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Y'all done lost... Lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Ya... Y'all done lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Y'all done lost... Lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done, lost your motherfucking mind
Got what you need, this that 24-hour spot
This that Massachusetts, Kawasaki, and the Yamaha
My Mama, Auntie, told me if I ever started drama
I can go to jail
But fuck the cops
And tell the judge to suck my cock and go to hell
No filter, but I got real love
Niggas ain't real son, tryna get meals but
Everyone's still friends, she don't got heels on
But her ass still fat, bet if I hit that she gonna tear up
Where are my real thugs, when they gonna hear us, when they gonna feel us?
Everyone act cray
Don't know what make they way
I tell your bitch: ay baby
Poppa can't crip stand
They ball so hard since wristbands
So my broads ain't got no implants, these bras ain't got no kickstands, and I know it though
Hold up
Fuck what you feel
I just want to sell salt to a snail
I just want to sell a hoe to a queer
I just want to go to Oprah and Phil
Give them both a little coke and some pills
I remember when I had to scrape a little change just to go to the store for some milk
I remember when my ex bitch didn't come home, she was stroking the field
I don't think you really know how I feel
I don't think you niggas know how to chill, whooh
So, the fuck is you thinking you older than me?
You got some type of control over me?
Just cause you got some shit you can hold over me, like you running this shit?
Act like I won't put my tongue in your bitch
Bring her closer to me
And then go to the beach, sit in the water
Don't act like you not an emotional creep
I pull over the jeep 
I just want to let you know that I'm here
I just want to sing a song and a prayer
I just want to make a toast to El Chapo
My idol, I might dig a hole in a cell
I just want to say Hello to Adele
I could probably make your hoe disappear
I don't think you niggas know how it feels
Y'all done lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Y'all done lost... Lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Ya... Y'all done lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done... Y'all done lost... Lost your motherfucking mind, ooh
Y'all done, lost your motherfucking mindAyy man, what up, man?
Joyner man, what's happenin', man?
Look man, let me just let you know, man, you takin' too goddamn long with this album, man
And I don't wanna hear about that ADD/ADHD shit
My mama got ADHD too, my nigga
And she ain't ever use that as no damn excuse to be lazy
My great-great-grandmama had ADHD and so did my grandaddy
You need to do, all you need to do, man, is smoke a little weed, man
Get your mind right
Got all these goddamn people waitin' on you
Man, I thought, I thought you was supposed to drop that damn album two years ago, man
I done shot ten goddamn movies and your shit still ain't dropped yet, man
You been, you been milkin' the fuck out that album cover, man, way too long
So I hope this music's good, because if it's not, I'ma be highly upset, nigga
Every time I go on YouTube, you got a new video of you throwin' a pity party because you got ADHD
Fuck your pity party, man
Boo-fuckin'-hoo, man, stop cryin'
Smoke some weed and drop this damn album already
Goddamn, we waitin'
ByeI wanna expand my brain, but I'm trapped in prison
Got me shackled up in chains for the maximum sentence
I'm tryna get out my ways to bring me back to census
And maybe teach myself some game and turn my rags to riches, mmm
Ain't no excuses we all start at the bottom
Gotta learn to speak yo' truth and that's just part of the process
Shit, if I ain't the solution, guess I'm part of the problem
You pullin' flowers out the roots when I just wanted to blossom
And I'm exhausted, but I tried my best
We needed change 'cause we tired of stress, tryna flex
Bought you a chain, but couldn't buy respect, I'm not impressed
We can't evolve unless we follow steps, it's not a test
I'm tired of frontin' like we not oppressed
And I thought if I was rich, then all my problems'd be through
'Til I made a few million and now I got more problems than you
I know it feels good to win, but it hurts a lot when you lose
Don't ever say what you gon' do unless you followin' through
I'm talking execution , uh
And I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm learnin' as I'm growin'
That's the evolution 
Hope I don't finish last, I'm still healin' from my past
I need some retribution 
Did a lot of gettin' even, but I'm sick and tired of beefin'
What's the resolution? 
I'm talkin' evolution 
I gotta be honest, I never thought that I would pop this quickly
Feels good to look at my phone and see Rihanna hit me
Nah, it ain't on no shit like that, shorty a goddess to me
Just one of my friends that I can vent to when my conscious get me
Look, I ain't into what niggas is doin', I'm on some other shit
I never been the type to turn up and be on that clubbin' shit
I'm lookin' at niggas like, "Bruh, you grown, how you still love this shit?"
I'd rather be home and watch some movies with my son and shit
'Cause I ain't tryna impress nobody, that shit get old quick
Like starin' at an old flick
Trynna travel back in '06
Maybe hope for what I won't get
All that temporary happiness only last until you grow sick
And them lights start to go dim
And the walls start to close in
And the times starts to pass you by
Don't act surprised
Better be careful what you ask from God
I had some jobs, shit, I quit and took control, my nigga
Got tired of buildin' companies up that I ain't own, my nigga
It's time to grow my nigga
Evolution 
I don't know where I'm goin', but I'm learnin' as I'm growin'
That's the evolution 
Hope I don't finish last, I'm still healin' from my past
I need some retribution 
Did a lot of gettin' even, but I'm sick and tired of beefin'
What's the resolution? 
I'm talkin' evolution 
Na-na-na-na, na-na-na
Da-da-da-da, ohYeah 
Middle fingers to my foes, straight like that 
This the truest story ever told, straight like that 
On my phone, we speakin' codes, straight like that

A couple dollars in the prayers, straight like that 
Ain't a single nigga that I fear, straight like that 
Yeah, I done shed a couple tears, straight like that 
Pourin' liquor for those who ain't here, straight like that 
Since you gon' make me disappear, straight like that 
Then you gon' have to prove it, that's a dare, straight like—
You weren't afraid of them runnin' it 
Give it the way that you wanted it 
I never knew what the money would do
If I knew, then I wouldn't want none of it 
Niggas I thought I was cool with is schemin'
But they wanna dap me in public
I'm startin' to think that I'm numb to it
I wear my heart on my sleeve, but decided to cover it 
Wonder how crazy my son'd get 
I wrote a book, and then buried and covered it
Hope that he'd never discover it
Wonder if he only knew all the shit that he up against
I gotta put me in front of it 
I want it all and they only want some of it
I think I need me a ton of it
They wanted drama until I decided to come with it
Straight like that, straight like that, straight like that, straight
Straight like that, straight like that, straight like that, straight
Yeah , look
Sober minds is my regime, straight like that 
I don't do no drugs or sip no lean, straight like that, yeah

New bitch in my crib, I might just dick her, straight like that

I ain't fallin' for no stripper, straight like that 
I said fuck the labels and got richer, straight like that
Used to struggle, now we icey, straight like that 
Hope my daughter don't meet no one like me, straight like that 
If she do, he gotta fight me, straight like that 
Someone gotta pay as shit get pricey straight like that
Hop in the foreign, I'm swervin' it 
They want a dish and I'm servin' it 
Word to the niggas who thought I was leavin'
I told 'em I'm stayin', it's permanent 
Typical nigga been hurtin' these women
They feelings, they wasn't deservin' it
I broke their heart and I'm sure of it
I did some damage, I hope that one day I can learn from it 
That probably won't be the first of it 
I'm on a journey, I feel like a journalist
Never had many alternatives
Only way out is to murder it, I gotta murder it 
I bet that you be observin' it
I'm all the way up and I'm feelin' the turbulence
I need my peace, you disturbin' it
You put some drop up inside my pocket and it's startin' to-
Straight like that, straight like that, straight like that, straight
Straight like that, straight like that, straight like that, straightListen, Joyner what's up? It's Kev
Heard the song "Lotto" you just dropped, and I'ma tell you right now man, I'm not too impressed
I'll tell you why I'm not impressed, tell you why
'Cause you still owe me money from a year ago, when your bitch ass cryin' about your Lamborghini gettin' repossessed
Until I came to the rescue, had to be Captain Save a Ho
So you could maintain your lil' bitch-ass, fake-ass lifestyle
Now it's a year later, I still don't have my money and you're rappin' about hittin' the lottery
Tell me, where the fuck do they do that shit at?
I just— I d— I don't know
You think 'cause I'm five foot two I can't box?
I'm 5'4", I'll whoop your ass, swear to God
Get your ass whipped by a munchkin
Tell you something, Joyner, I don't care how short I am
Or whether I can get on the roller coasters at Disney World
If I was you, I'd get back to me immediately
'Cause if you don't, I'm gonna beat your ass with a Lil Uzi Vert album, I swear to God
Ha, I swear to God
What are you, white?
What the fuck is this, slavery? Reparations?
Still chase you down
Gimme my shit!I've got this darkness in my soul
Don't see no light when I'm wide awake
I'm sick of workin' for no ends
You see the greed made me feel hate
And there's no turnin' back, no
Keep runnin' from my past
Well, the fear, it always lasts
I don't think you know me, know me, no
You don't know my life, my heart, my soul, no
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen, see things I've seen
Black women hurt, black women curse
Black brothers doin' black women dirt
Black women cryin', black women murk
We can never put a black woman first
Black lives matter, black lives scatter
Black eyes under black eye shadow
Black blood made a black life splatter
Black sister had a black life shadow
Black single mother, black favorite color
Black brother made a black woman suffer
Black women down, black women under
We contribute to the black women struggle
Black women brave, black women save
Black women lost, black women fade
Black man with a black woman
Made black paint, made a black woman change
Black women cryin', black women tired
Tears runnin' down a black woman's eye
Black women run, black women hide
Black violence made a black woman die
Black woman passed, black mama sad
Black pride on a black woman had
Black rage for the black women, mad
Black man callin' black women trash
Black women hurt, let you back in
Black women keep protectin' black men
Black men don't protect the black queen
Black women always get the back seat
Black women preach, black women teach
Black soil for the black women seeds
Black pain's all a black woman sees
Black love's all a black woman needs
Woah-oh, you don't know the tears I've cried
If you've seen the things I've seen 
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen
Black resurrected, black manifested
Black women vision, black innovation
Black women faith, black women blessings
Black man keep the black queen protected
Black women safe, black women save
Black business is a black women paid
Black don't crack, black don't age
Black women proud, black women praised
Black women smilin', black women shinin'
Black women got it, black women write it
Black wealth, no more back to the bottom
Black kings get a black woman diamonds
Black women body, black women climbin'
Black women body, black women poppin'
Black men keep the black woman honored
Black roses painted back and they got 'em
Black loyalty, black royalty
Black novelty, black odyssey
Black women in a black colony
Black women feelin' black harmony
Black for the people, black women peaceful
Black man treatin' black women equal
Backbone what a black women teach you
Black strength when a black woman feed you
Black pride, that's what's happenin' now
Black men holdin' black women down
Black women gettin' cash and I'm proud
Black angels and they trapped in the clouds
Black women preach, black women teach
Black soil for the black women seeds
Black pain's all a black woman sees
Black love's all a black woman needs
Woah-oh, you don't know the tears I've cried
If you've seen the things I've seen 
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen 
My God, I lost a lot of love
Can see the pain in my momma's face
A daughter hangin' from this earth
She got them scars she don't deserve
And there's no turnin' back
Keep runnin' from my past
Well, the fear, it always lasts, mmm
Seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen 
If you've seen the things I've seen
Woah-oh, I'm standin' 'til the end, woah
If you've seen the things I've seen
If you've seen the things I've seen
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh, woah
Ooh-ooh Lyrics from snippet:
It's okay 
They see me in the street, they say, "Oh damn"
It's a bloodclaat
I'm a vampireHey buddy, come in and have a seat
Your mom told me you didn't want to come in and see me today because of our last conversation
And I apologize, buddy, I really do
I shouldn't have lashed out like that
I was out of character
I mean, you're only eight years old
And I had no business talking to you that way
So I wanted to extend a very sincere apology to you
You think we can be friends and get over this?
I guess so
That-a-boy
And I promise, from this day forward
That if you don't act like a little fucking retard and piss me off again
I won't lash out like that
There's consequences for everything, Joyner
You act like a little prick, you get the mean doctor you don't wanna see
It's that simple
Now, mom tells me you don't really like the prescription I gave you
Not really
Well, what if I told you that I have a prescription that you can't get at the pharmacy?
Like what?
You ever used cocaine, Joyner?
What's that?
How about lean?
I never heard of it
Give me your backpack
Why?
I'm going to put a few things in there for you
And I guarantee this will take all your ADHD away for good
How's that sound?
Um
It'll be our little secret
I'm not sure about this
Don't tell mom
If you do, no more treatment for youI got pain in my soul 
And I ain't prayed in so long 
Jesus can't save me no more 
Just remember the road
You feel like the world is against you
You feel like you had a bad case of the "can't help it"
You feel like sometimes all hope is gone
And every time you wanted to do good
Evil was always prevalent on you, you hear me?
He came to kill, steal and destroy your soul
And now you look at yourself
And you say, "I just got pain in my soul"
Uhh, I ain't felt this way since Wednesday
I brought a switchblade to 6th grade
Way before Myspace and Sam-space
I had a crush on Beyoncé and Kim K
I went to work late and missed out
My Grandma told me, "In ten days you're kicked out"
Never went to Sunday School, I skipped out
And then went to the mall and got draped up and dripped out
I used to listen to Bon Jovi
And hang with my Aunt Rosie, then she called the cops on me
Crack in my socks runnin', my neighbor up top sold me
Nowhere to run now, thanks a lot homie
Misunderstood, trust me I know what you took from me
She said, "I know you're in a relationship and you couldn't love me
And you know we got something and you know it's time so what you waitin' for?
Goddamn you let me down again, way to go"
I got pain in my soul 
And I ain't prayed in so long 
Jesus can't save me no more 
Just remember the road
I came to tell you tonight that there's good news
That Jesus came to save you from all of your sins
And he came to wash it away with his blood
The enemy came to steal, kill and destroy your soul
And now all you can do is that in your soul
Is that there is nothing but pain
Uhh, niggas just throw fits, I'm so sick
I'm tired of my broke friends who smoke cigs
I just wanna gold Benz with with smoke tens
And take all of my hoes on a road trip, just no kids
I guess it's cool to dream when you ain't used to havin' much
I know this breakup hurtin' you and you sad and such
I know you not happy, stop actin' like you havin' fun
I know you snoopin' through my Instagram gettin' mad as fuck
I tried to run away from home before the ass-beatin's
All I wanted was some clothes but it's tax season
I love it when they Black but they act 'Rican
My pastor think that I'm half Black and half demon
What the fuck is you tryin' for? What's mine is yours
What's yours is mine and I'm down for, we ridin' for it
We wanted this a long time ago, what you waitin' for?
Goddamn, you let me down again 
I got pain in my soul, way to go
And I ain't prayed in so long, way to go
This sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go
This the end of the road
I got pain in my soul, way to go
And I ain't prayed in so long, way to go
This sinnin' can't save me no more, way to go
This the end of the road
I got pain in my soul, way to go
Ta-ta ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, oh why-y-y-y
I ain't prayed in so long, way to go
Sinnin' can't save me no more, no more
Yo wassup, this is Joyner
I'm unable to take your call right now
Leave me a brief message and I'll get back to you, peace
Man, think about a little baby girl and a baby boy
Man makes them happy, to carry, to carry heavy load

Man I never had shit
I never had cake
Used to sell drugs but I never had weight
Livin' life fast like I never had breaks
Speakers on blast like I never had base
I never had friends, keep my enemies close
Roll the windows up if whenever we smoke
My niggas stay high they can never be low
And I lie to my bitch like I never had hoes
Never wish jail or death on a nigga
I never had tears or respect for a teller
I never did a beer till the cops come and get 'em
Even 27 years couldn't stop Mandela
But I never cooked crack
Never took slack
Run away from home and I never looked back
Broke ass nigga livin' life on the bottom
I was tryna touch a mil and put my mama in a condo
Up in Beverly Hills, maybe down south
Never been a funny nigga why start now
Dreams of a Bentley with a top drop down
Tryna take my shit, then it's po-po-pow
Never been a thug but I'm real acquainted
And you will never feel how real my pain is
And all your new shit sound real outdated
This is real rock bottom for the tears I tasted
Cause I never had shit nigga

Nah, I ain't never been a rat 
Nah, I ain't never have no money put the pennies in the bag
Cause I never had a stack 
Nah, I never been a bitch nigga, never had a pad
You ain't never have a bag 
You ain't never rode a bus, prolly never took a cab, gettin' ride from your dad
But your momma at work takin' money out her purse tryna pay for some work
Cause you never wasn't nothin' but a spoiled motherfucker
Tryna follow where your friends and magnolia motherfuckers
But you never give respect of a loyal motherfucker
You just want to be down, wanna live fast
Run away from home and don't ever look back
Dreams of a beast livin' life in a city
I'm just tryna touch a mil and put my momma in a mansion
All the way in Miami, maybe in the hill
Never had a job but the nigga got bills
And niggas run they mouth 'till the shit get real
And the thugs come out with the p-p-pill
Never been a thug but I'm real acquainted
You will never feel how real my pain is
And all your new shit sound real outdated
This is real rock bottom for the tears I tasted
Cause I never had shit

Aye, what you know about stunting?
What you know about lame ass niggas always talking bout money?
What you know about stray bullets hitting when you never seen it coming?
What you know about Joyner Lucas all up in the streets to the flooding?
To the bass, ba-ba-ba-ba bass till you running down a motherfucking tunnel?
What you know about the cops on the corner tryna knock a nigga hustle?
What you know about Illuminati, everybody working for the devil?
Feeling dead but I'm working for the living
I be in a spaceship getting-getting-getting litted
I be Trinidad James, nigga-nigga-nigga, listen
What you know about riding?
What you know about a check even though a nigga really don't got it?
What you know about the boys at your door while you hiding in the closet?
Pray to God they don't ever catch you slipping or falling
Balling on a budget with my windows tinted
And you ain't seen nothing, nigga, you ain't seen nothing
What you know about money from the chop?
Hustling on the grind nonstop
In the street, but the heat make it hot
Looking out for the cops on the block
You know nothing bout slanging them rocks
Taking hits from nothing to the top
Lock it down and setting up shop
Getting all that paper and stock
Don't you know that I be riding solo?
Making money, staying high with pure dro
What you know about the dough that we blow?
Don't play no games, I tell these niggas lay low
Yeah, what you know about rhythm?
What you know bout an east coast nigga with a sound so trilla?
Don't you know I'm Mike Jack, call you looking at the man in the mirror
What you know about a party? Everybody throw your hands to the ceiling
To the bass, ba-ba-ba-ba bass and you feel it in your motherfucking fingers
What you know about Picasso? I think another picture being painted
And what you know about drinking to the pain? All you do is get faded
What you know about rapping all day and you dedicate your life to a dream that ain't paying and knowing there's a big chance you could never ever make it?
That's fucked up, ain't it?
And what you know about waiting even if a nigga really impatient?
I got love for the hood even though I wish I was really in Vegas
With bad bitches in the water, I be deep sea swimming
To wake up in the car with my windows tinted
And you ain't seen nothing, nigga, you ain't seen nothing
What you know about money from the chop?
Hustling on the grind nonstop
In the street, but the heat make it hot
Looking out for the cops on the block
You know nothing bout slanging them rocks
Taking hits from nothing to the top
Lock it down and setting up shop
Getting all that paper and stock
Don't you know that I be riding solo?
Making money, staying high pure dro
What you know about the dough that we blow?
Don't play no games, I tell these niggas lay low
What you know about pain?
What you know about living on the edge, ain't nothing gon' change?
What you know about standing on the corner, tryna hustle all day?
What you know about scraping up change so your supper get paid?
At your door, knock knock knock-knock-knock and your landlord banging for the rent
What you know about waiting for a prayer that ain't never get sent?
What you know about trusting nobody? We ain't never been friends
You ain't never shook hands with the fans
I be in the bad bitches put they ass on my hands
I be on that low soul, d-d-d-d-d-d-damn
What you know about Joyner? 
Nah, what they know about Busy? 
Dead Silence! Joyner!
You ain't know about it
What you know about money from the chop?
Hustling on the grind nonstop
In the street, but the heat make it hot
Looking out for the cops on the block
You know nothing bout slanging them rocks
Taking hits from nothing to the top
Lock it down and setting up shop
Getting all that paper and stock
Don't you know that I be riding solo?
Making money, staying high with pure dro
What you know about the dough that we blow?
Don't play no games, I tell these niggas lay lowOkay guys, time to go
Remember to bring your homework in tomorrow
And please, don't run, walk, please
Thank you
Joyner, stay behind one second, I wanna talk to you
Alright
What’s going on with you? You've been kinda off lately, everything okay at home?
Yeah, everything's fine at home, I guess
How come you didn’t participate in class today?
When the other kids were telling me what they wanted to be when they grow up?
I don't know, they all just sounded stupid
Well, beforе you leave, I want you to tell mе
What do you want to be when you grow up?
I want to be an entrepreneur, I want to change the world!
I don't want to be like these other kids
I want to be my own boss, I don't want to work for nobody
But what do I look like taking orders from people?
I wanna do things that were never done before
I want my legacy to live forever!
I wanna make sure my kids are straight, and my kids' kids' kids are straight
You feel me?:
Champagne for my real friends
Real pain for my sham friends
 Nah
Champagne for everybody 
Uh
:
Champagne dreams for them days I was unemployed 
Selling drugs, trying to live, I was stuck in void 
Wasn't like I wanted to
But what the fuck I'm 'posed to do
When the government ain't giving me no fucking choice?
They ain't want to show us love like them other boys
I was trying to make a change 'til they cut my voice
I was trying to buy a Range 'til they upped the price on me
Try to cut the lights on me like they clubbing boy 
I can tell ya things, that some people never seen in life
Living lavish, thinks that happiness the key to life
I had a couple bad bitches, I ain't treat 'em right
I had a couple fat bitches I ain't even like
But their conversations was enough to make me sleep at night
Never fucked 'em, but I made sure they were eating right
Only loved 'em 'cause they taught me how to love myself
Gave me something to believe when there was nothing else
Tell me something else
All I know is hell, point me to the riches
It's funny how niggas screaming, money over bitches
But, when them niggas going broke, then it's bitches over money now, oh
Whoa, that's some fake shit, but that's the world that I know
She just want attention, that's the girl that I know 
I just want a pension, that's a check that I deserve
Share it with my niggas, I ain't stressin' 'bout a bird
All you ever wanted in life was to be a legend
All I ever wanted in life was to be accepted 
All I ever wanted at night was a Lamborghini
'Til I woke from my dreams, and they told me to keep dreamin'
My radio demons
Too much new shit with out a reason 
Too much music without a meaning 
But how the hell do I keep believing without achieving
And how the hell do I pledge allegiance without allegiance?
Me and John Lennon by the fire, singing songs
"Kumbaya," wishing that my Lord sing along
Reminiscing 'bout every nigga that did me wrong
Pray to God I don't catch 'em slipping, but this is wrong
This is wrong
We ain't supposed to hold grudges
Forgiven all my enemies for they don't know nothing
This is Sunday school church, this is soul touching
This that old Keisha Cole back in '07
This that Bob Marley dreadlock shit
This that grandma in the kitchen cooking ham hog shit, whoa!
I warned niggas years ago before they cared about me
Like "If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me."
But I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching
And I still got champagne for everybody
Pour it
Champagne for everybody 
:
She said
She said "I thought that you were different"
"I thought that you'd be different" 
'I thought that you would be submissive' 
Told you all my secrets while you just pretend to listen
Just so you can have a feast while you fuck me in the kitchen
Man, you cold blooded and maybe other hoes love it
But I ain't other hoes my nigga I'm so subborn
Them fucking with my heart is like touching a cold oven
That shit barely work, you 'bout to get your feelings hurt
Hold up
Close my eyes and I never get lost again
Some niggas cross the line and I never get crossed again
Pigs pulling triggers, these kids won't walk again
And that's the day I promised God that I'd never eat pork again, wait
No money, no commas, always had them problems 
More money, more problems, wish I had them problems 
I know that finance you stressing had you at the bottom but at least if you was making dollars, you can have some progress
They told me only time could tell, but I had no options
Eviction notice, I ain't had no options
Young Jeezy bumping, I was on my Tamadotchi
'Til I almost seen the ghost, I was Action Bronson
I just wanted champagne while I crack a lobster
I just wanna see your fucking hands at the concerts
I just wanna see Meghan Good without the nose job
I just wanna see Eva Mendes without the clothes on
And so long to my old kins, and my old friends
And so long to my old bitch and her hoe friends
Shout out to all them hypocritical Christians
Who act like just because I use the words 'niggas' and 'bitches' I can't deliver my message
Come deliver my blessings
Upon evil hide your sins , up in witness protection and
I warned niggas years ago before they cared about me
Like 'If you don't hear me now, then you going to hear about me.'
But I forgive 'em, I can see them over there watching
And I still got champagne for everybody
Pour it
Chapagne for everybody
There you go
:
Can I have everybody's attention, please?
I need to make a toast
A toast to every motherfucker that ever did me wrong
A toast to the basic hoes that played me
And the fuck niggas that slayed me
A toast to the non-believers and the money-hungry creatures who was sitting down eating steaks and lobsters, crabs and didn't even offer me a fucking biscuit with the butter that they give you at the restaurant when you sit at the table
I've been hungry since the days I was able to use music as an escape when my aunt was on Section 8 and got her first apartment
I wanna make a toast to my unborn child, I can't wait to see you smile when you come out
A toast to all my old friends who backstabbed me and spread dirt on my name
Well, I got plenty champagne for y'all
Heh, I got plenty champagne for everybody
I got champagne for everybody!
:
Champagne, champagne 'fore we all go
Champagne, champagne 'fore we all go
Champagne, champagne 'fore we all go
Champagne, champagneDear America
By the system I was raised
Same system that enslaved us and took us all away
Same same system I was trained to put my hands across my heart and pledge allegiance to the grave
The same system that made me sing the national anthem
While the fucking flag hanged
The same system that'll claim innocent lives
Barack ain't made shit change
Nigga fuck this shit, I won't budge!
Shit, I won't budge
They say Rosa Parks was sitting on the wrong bus
And now that Malcolm X is gone, I guess it's on us
Fuck a cop, they gon' kill us then they charge us
They gon' charge us
Pull that fucking badge out and say it's all love
But I got six warning shots to my heart, lungs, face, neck, cough blood
Now they say we all thugs
I guess we all thugs
Ever since the Watts Riots, motherfuckers wanna try us
Everything was all quiet til they crossed us
Al Sharpton keep on talking, nigga do something!
Nigga prove something
So much drama, I just got the fucking goosebumps
Word down to Ferguson, they murderin' the youth young
What the fuck is new, son
This shit gon' make me lose some'n
This a war we won't back down
Fuck this country, we ain't treated fair
I should burn the fucking flag down
Yeah, I should burn the fucking flag down
But your victims lash out, they have no clue
But if I protest, a nigga'll put me in a stretcher
Gun me down with my hands up screamin' "DON'T SHOOT!"
Motherfucker, don't shoot!
By the system I was raised
Same system that just killed Mike Brown the other day
Same system that just slayed Sean Bell, Trayvon, Eric Garner, what a shame!
The same system that gon' lie just to cover up the crime, quick to send us to the grave
The same system that'll claim innocent lives
Barack ain't made shit change
Nigga, fuck this shit, I won't budge!
Shit, I won't budge
They say Emmitt Till whistled at the wrong slut
And now that Martin Luther gone, I guess it's on us
Fuck the cops, they gon' kill us then they charge us
They gon' charge us
Pull that fucking badge out, leave a nigga passed out
CLAP PLOW twenty shots to my heart, lungs, face, neck, cough blood
All they do is cross us
Living in the projects, and we all thugs
Now they searchin' through my pockets
Wanna treat me like a hostage
Tryna get inside my conscious like a broad does
If they catch me lookin' wrong, I'm a rebel though
If I got my hoodie on, I'm a criminal
If I got my hands up, that means I probably got a weapon
If they kill me, then I guess that means that it was an exception
This a war we won't back down
And tell the government to kiss my ass
I should burn the fucking flag down
Yeah, I should burn the fucking flag down
We were forced to surrender, they have no clue
But if I protest, a nigga'll put me in a stretcher
Gun me down with my hands up screamin' "DON'T SHOOT!"
Motherfucker, don't shoot!K-K-Kato on the track bitch
I got a girl, she dope as hell 
She wear that Gucci, That Louis, Chanel
Shorty so right can't even deny 
Booty so fat you can see from the side 
I'm just a guy, I'm just a man
Lotta things 'bout me she won't understand
I think I'm so used to being alone
Now I have urges to cheat on the low
No, It ain't cool
No, It ain't life
No, I ain't saying that shit is alright
But it was only supposed to be once
Now I got more than one chick on the side
Feel like a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me
Knowing they fearing, I know that It's wrong
Ain't no excuse and I feel like a dog
Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me on some code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knows
I'm para-I'm para-I'm paranoid
I must admit
Real mixed emotions that I gotta fix
When she at work I be losing my mind
Feeling like she know the truth and I'm blind
Taking my time, I got a plan 
Plus I'm afraid that she won't understand
If she found out then I'd be on my own
Fighting these urges to cheat on the low
No, it ain't real 
No, it ain't cool
No, I ain't saying that this is the move 
But it was only supposed to be once 
But that one night just turned into a few
I'm such a dick
Feel like a cheat
Wonder how'd I feel like if that was me 
Knowing they fearing, I know that it's wrong
Ain't no excuse though I feel like a dog
Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me on some code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knows
Then my phone rang, my phone rang
Got me on some code names, I'm so ashamed
Now my girl lookin' at me so strange, say I won't change
Oh na na
Now I'm layin' there with my lover and she starin' and me oh
I've been so selfish, I've been so blind
I feel so stupid, I don't know why
I got a good girl at home
And I know she love me so much
And she know I'm up to no good, no good
And I think she knows
Yeah I think she knows
And I think she knows
I think that she know whats up
I think that she know enough
Yeah I think she knowsShit, I close my eyes sometimes and I just think, like...
Like, did you really do this shit, my nigga? Like...
Is this shit even real, cuz?
Ha, this shit crazy 
I go to sleep and I try to wake up with a clear conscience and shit, you feel me? Like...
I done been through the mud, nigga
Sacrificed a lot to get to the endzone, my nigga
Just tryna give our kids a better life than we had, my nigga 
I always wanted to change the cycle and
Create a new generation and pass down everything I worked for, my nigga
I'm just, I'm just thinkin' out loud
Look 
I wonder where lifе would probably take me, yeah
Won't break me, yeah
I show some love to niggas who hate me, yeah 
That's crazy, yeah
I kept my cool without no AC, yeah 
Got somethin' to prove, I jumped in the pool and now I'm wavy, yeah 
And lately, I've been tryna hold my blessings
You talk to God, but you don't know the message
Those are lessons 
Walkin' in circles without no direction
No exceptions 
Don't give advice if you don't know the pressure
Close your lips 'cause half of you more full of shit than colon cleansers 
I was born in inside a manger 
And no one ever did me favors, now I'm highly favored 
I finally made it out the hood, now I ain't got no neighbors 
So before you talk to me, you gotta sign a waiver 
Post-traumatic stress disorder keep my conscience racin'
Deep inside my thoughts
Wonder how much I can grow if I just even out my flaws 
How I teach myself I'm still a winner even when I lost?
And if I lose, I know I'll still be on even when I'm off
I took my chances and I'm eatin' now
I'm finally learnin' all the shit I used to read about
Now I could live all of the shit I used to dream about
'Cause niggas tried to leave me out
But I learned to get revenge through my success and so we even now 
I stare at my reflection 'cause I like what I see 
All them years at CVS workin' them nights on my feet 
Ain't a nigga where I'm from'll reach the heights that I'll reach 
I'll risk it all to give this life to my seed 
And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
M-M-M-M-Maybach Music
I done seen a couple niggas lose they life over a dollar 
And they hit the hardest when it's not an outsider
Better keep your money close 'cause that's the only thing that's honest
Everybody thuggin' 'til they gotta face your honor
'64 Impala, hoppin', scrapin', bumpin' chronic
Ridin' solo 'cause these pussy-niggas out here countin' pockets 
Stackin' all my money, at the same time, lackin' knowledge
Homegrown in the south, it's in my blood and body-body 
You say you own your masters, can you tell me what they worth?
I still be havin' flashes 'cause it came from doin' dirt
Fifty restaurants all poppin' and I still be poppin' Percs 
Get you to support, but then they rob you for your merch 
Shot her in the foot, what pussy-boy, you rockin' skirts 
PJ to Miami where you know who got to work
Got the condo on the beaches, let the bitches come and twerk 
Woke up out a coma, fuck around and fuck a nurse
And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh 
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
And if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
They gon' play this when I'm gone and I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Said if I die today, I'm goin' out a fuckin' legend
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
I was lookin' to the Dope Boys in the FUBU 
And if they play this when I'm gone, then I'll be resurrected
Oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh
Now they lookin' up to us, you heard me? Excuse me, Ms. Nelson? Joyner said something mean to Cory
He did? Well, that wasn't very nice of him, was it?
Joyner
Yes, Ms. Nelson!
Can you come here, please?
Coming!
So I was just informed that you said something mean to Cory
That's not true, she's lying!
Joyner...
Yeah, he did! He told me I was–
Now, before we figure out anything, I just wanna point out that what Christine came up and told me wasn't her business, was it?
No
And what Christine actually did was what?
Tattle taled
That's right! She tattle talеd. And we don't like tattle talеs very much, do we?
No
Cory, what's another name for tattle tale?
Snitch!
That's right! Snitch. And what Christine just did was snitch on Joyner
Aha!
And like the saying goes, "Snitches get" what?
"Stitches!"
Say it again! "Snitches get" what?
"Stitches!"
One more time! "Snitches get" what?
"Stitches!"Look, pour me a drink
I don't do liquor, I know what you think
This is a vibe
This that shit that make niggas get fly and go on a date
Fly to Dubai, order a steak
I got a shawty, she told me she loved me
I know that she mean it, don't know what to say
She want a nigga to go all the way
She want a—
She want that feelin' that she on a mission to find what she missin'
She need the commitment but don't wanna wait
I need a break, I need 
She need a hubby
I wish I could love like I did in my twenties
I wish I was me back when I had no money
I wish I could give her all that she want from me
And I know it hurts 
I got a diamond, don't know what it's worth
Don't know what is worse
Sleepin' alone or sleepin' with someone you know you gon' hurt
Layin' with somеone you know that you killin'
And deep down inside, you know that she willin' to stay and just ridе
Just hopin' that one day this shit'll be fine
But what if it isn't? Or what if I'm wrong?
What am I missin'? Where do I belong?
She got a vision and I never listen
I think I been lookin' for somethin' that never existed
I'm dealin' with scars that never be fixin'
I know that I'm guilty of every conviction 
Now how can I look in the mirror and talk to myself
When I know I ain't ready to listen or ready to fix it? 
I just packed the ride 
That's a vibe
I ain't perfect, but I try
She said, “That's a lie
You know you just sabotage” 
Girl, you cold
You know I'm in love with you but I ain't done bein' a ho
I got a shawty beside of me 
She ain't got shit that she proud of me 
She never trip up or lie to me
She never bicker or brother me 
I got a bitch with a Rolls-Royce
She wanna pull up beside of me 
She never get in my way
And don't ever complain about spendin' no time with me
I got a, I got a shawty that give me up 
I don't need no one to trip me up 
Too many hoes wanna keep me down
I got a bitch that'll pick me up
She wanna suck me and lick me up 
I got a ho that'll spoil me
Treat me like royalty
I gotta live it up 
None of these women can get enough
I got a, I got a shawty with hella ambition
Somebody who trust and believe in my vision
And keep to herself and don't be in my business
Won't talk to nobody, not even my niggas 
I swear that her booty's a heavy addiction
I just wanna hit it in every position
I'm very consistent
I don't wanna cuddle, she very submissive with every decision 
And shawty a boss
She got my, she got my back and she ‘bout it 
If I try to pay for the bill, she tell me, “Don't worry, my nigga, I got it” 
Baddest lil' bitch in the Hills, her body amazin', I'm talkin' exotic 
Shawty be cookin' me meals and fuckin' me crazy
I'm talkin' demonic, I'm talkin' neurotic
But I ain't in love with these bitches, I'm not gonna reach 
I hate that the woman I love has gotta compete 
But I'm tryna figure the reason I’m incomplete
Nobody perfect and not even me
I figured all of these hoes can solve the problem, well maybe the problem is me
Hey, babe 
I just found love and I never had a love like you

To the match and the Glock, now run fast

Been that nigga that knock him out
Stomp that nigga, i stomp him out
Walk that nigga, now walk him out
Flow like venom in the cold
I’m entering the zone where hoes ain’t friends
With the hoes, and a man get the most shit
From the police and they beat them cops
Pretending to hold that 5-0-8
Walk on water, and drive on lakes
Fly them clouds, i float on bliss, my home
I’m pulling it out you face

Self explanatory shit for warriors
Killed your car in the corner
The vicious slaughtered an officer
No applause, then applaud us to

I remember when I used to beg for change
I done came a long way from the block where these birds got their hands out
Remember lil me? Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now
She used to hang up on a nigga when I called, that was year 'round
Now the same bitch wanna give me good brains with her hair down
And that's funny, and my ex wanna call me, saying that she wanna have me
Talking 'bout "When we getting married?"
Bitch you need to find another pappy, and haters don't look too happy
Swear it's my fault, you done turned me to a monster
Fly ass truck, I'm a Tonka, and I ain't really into the drama
I'd rather get paid, period, no comma
Mind your damn business, homie what you saying?
I done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working
Fuck is you thinking? I got some hurt for the niggas
I got some pork for the bacon, if it ain't bones that I'm breaking
And I was born on probation, they pulled me over to take me
Inside the border, they drained me and cut me open and gave me
Some fuckin' potion I'm craving, dammit, look what you made me
I'm just going
Look what I became from where they found me
I think you should take a look around me
I hear people saying things about me
I think you should take a look around me 
I hear people saying things about me
But I think you should take a look around me
Man I wish these hoes could see me now, things changed
I remember when I used to beg for change, that was way back
Now I sit and wait while these niggas plotting payback
Success is on the way
Uhh, I done came a long way from the stoop where the fiends got their hands out
Remember lil old me? Guess what, motherfucker? I'm the man now
He used to run his mouth 'bout me all around the hood, it was man down
And now the same nigga want a fucking autograph, he a fan now
And that's funny, now my ex girl calling saying that she tryna see us
Talking 'bout "Where we gonna meet up?"
Bitch you need to find another re-up, and haters wanna see me get beat up
Yeah it's my fault, it done turned me to a psycho
Ass so fat she need lipo, and I ain't really into the titles
Rather get insurance on the pussy, no Geico
Mind your own business, homie what you saying?
I done came up, fuck is you talking 'bout? I'm just working
Fuck is you wishing, I got some dirt for the pigeons
I got some work for the business so write my words on the ceiling
I hope I'm hurting your feelings, they pulled me over, I went in
Inside the border to check in, they cut me open and gave me
Some fuckin' potion or medicine, dammit look what you made me
I'm just going
Look what I became from where they found me
I think you should take a look around me
I hear people saying things about me
I think you should take a look around me 
I hear people saying things about me
But I think you should take a look around me
I used to get mad when the hoes ain't flock
I used to get bullied by the whole damn block
Running from the boys, hope I don't get caught
Niggas had guns, hope I don't get shot
Lord, oh Lord can you answer my prayer?
Beautiful dreams and these weird nightmares
Standin in blood with a pair of Nike Airs
I'm just tryna get a buzz, I'm the real light year
Ho point me to the door, I'm catching my breath
Blood on my blood, and flesh on my flesh
My heart might stop but I'll stretch you out, yes
Machiavelli and Pac, resurrecting my death
And I'm back as a hologram, Jesus must be inside of him
What you riding in? Wanna talk about ice and Beamers?
Get your shit broke like Ike and Tina
I was born on the seventeenth day
Along came Joyner, in Heaven we pray
Born by the pussy I'll die by the pussy
That just means that I could never be gay
Take a look around me, me, you floss too much
And talk about how you just a boss too much
I swear I love winning cause I lost too much
I wanted Drake on the hook but he cost too much
Fuck I look like lying then? I'm a pyro's pirate
Set the hood on fire, hit the hydrants
Guess I'm just a product of my environment
And that's word, flashbacks to my teacher in class
Telling me she hope that I don't finish high school
All I know is I came a long way
And I'll be God damned if I ever stop soon
Look what I became from where they found me
I think you should take a look around me
I hear people saying things about me
I think you should take a look around me 
I hear people saying things about me
But I think you should take a look around meI wash my dick in a pool with some Dove soap
So tell them rappers who want to battle me fuck no 
I was born and raised in a pool of AIDS with a cutthroat
And now I'm bruised and pained and losing veins till my nuts blow
I'm not a fan of the blunt
I tried to smoke I was damaged for months 
Carry hammers like I'm starving bitch hand me your lunch 
Better answer me when I'm talking you hear me or what? 
Do you understand me or what? 
I wanna hire a hit man to kill rappers for fun
Half now to do the job and the other half with his gun 
At high school you was the man always yapping your gums
Now we look at you like 'damn fuck happened to son?' 
I'm bad for your son and your daughter's mama 
Before I die I need a hard recliner
Two lesbian dikes with soft vaginas and brains as smart as China
I'm kind of a misfit I don't hide all my business 
And I'm probably going to hell since i told God my religion
Is really no competition 
I deserve to best, only reason I'm not on top is cause they ain't heard of me yet 
I get it then go I'm putting you niggas in holes it's surgery rest
And get ready to blow I’m better the level the most I murder these steps
And emergency jets on my third light year
I'm not an angel it's the purge right here
I'm not a rapper I'm your worst nightmare
I'm not -So today is Father's Day
And I asked you guys to create a beautiful card for your fathers today
I'm sure your dad would love this!
I'm just going to quietly walk around the room, and look at the wonderful card you made
This is beautiful
This is nice
Thanks
Sandra, I love this one!
Is that a picture of you and your dad?
Yeah that's me and my dad
That's beautiful
Nice, nice!
Thank you!
Oh well, Joyner, what is this?
This part says "Happy Father's Day, stepdad"
Why don't you create one for your real dad?
I don't have a real dad
Oh, well isn't that unfortunate? That explains a lot
So, anyone with a real dad, take you cards and place them in your backpack
Joyner, I'm gonna hold on to yours, and maybe one day
You'll have a change of heart
Remember, you only get one dad
Keep that in mind
Yeah, yeah*Birds chirping*
I used to be all you loved
I used to be all you needed
And I used to be all you dreamed of 
And I don't know what to do
And baby I'm falling down
And maybe I'm overthinking
And maybe I'm drunker now
Bitch I ain't fucking with you
Don't tell me you love me 
Girl I don't believe you now
'Cause I don't understand the feeling
Don't tell me you love me 
Girl I don't believe you now
'Cause I don't understand the feeling
Don't tell me you love me
Give me a moment
And let me tell you how I feel on some grown shit
And I've been drinking Hennessy and seeing clear now
I'm finna tell you how a nigga fuckin' feel now
Bitch you brought me down when I was doing good
All you bring is drama you a drama queen
Don't tell me that you love me 'cause it sounds good
I don't need you're fucking money, wait

*Cries*
And I'm sorry I missed your phone call
And that I- I- I- I know you're done
So- so, when you get this, can you call me back?
*Cries*
I love you, and I miss you
*Cries*I've never been a gang banger with street killas
If I protect myself, I'll be favoring all these niggas and
I bought my first gun from my homie who tried to sell it
A 9 with a couple bullets, just eyes when I'm out here looking
Trying to find a job to survive so I stop tossing
Hop inside the whip and then drive cause I walk often
Stressing like a bitch, cause I'm tired of my Mom's apartment
I'm Satan in God's office that's.. 
Shovels to my gravestone, kicking dirt on my coffin
Broke bitches with their hand out, cause they heard I was balling
Fuck me so good, went to sleep, woke in the morning
Six niggas in my face, Guns drawn with no warning
Pistol whip, stomped me and left me like I was dead
I had murder on my conscience, I was plotting on revenge
Circling the block like I know what I need to do
Before I cock the fucking hammer I said what would Jesus do...
Because Christ is not only leader
He was teacher
But not just leader and teacher
He was Christ the redeemer
Christ the restorer
Christ the deliverer
Hate's the only motivation, that's how real we made it
Guilty by association, you affiliated
Smoking Newports while I'm riding the Willie Mays
Watch you niggas turn bitch, there's nothing more humiliating
I wonder what my life be like, if I ain't had no hobby
Probably dancing with the Devil, moving like a Jabbawockeez
I just want change, wonder how much that'll cost me
I don't think I have a heartbeat I'm just.. 
Tempest keep raging my mind, don't ever sleep
See my cousin in the cold, gave him a ride up the street
Blue flashing lights, pulled behind me it's the police
So my cousin reached in his jeans, threw the burner under my seat
They pulled us out the car, got charged with a loaded 9
Cause he told the boys it was mine, I was facing a 5-9
My Mama sold the car, bailed out in a week or two
Before I caught that nigga slipping, I said what would Jesus do...
Not that Jesus is God
Because Jesus never told you to worship Him
He told you to follow Him
And you see, Pastor, when we praise Jesus
He's worthy to be praised, we feel good don't we
But not enough, follow Him
Rappers on TV with jewels,  we idolize them
Picturing myself on the news and paparazzi
Bunch of grimy thoughts, niggas never had no conscience
I've been looking for a jux, being broke is not an option
I've never been violent, I'm shaking just being honest
Especially when my girl ain't working and we was starving
Argue every minute, fighting in a small apartment
She tripping just non-stop and I'm like.. 
Looking for some pussy to fuck just for one night
Get some anger out my chest and bust until I'm right
Met this shorty at the bar, she was working for some tips
Took me back to her crib and I was nervous as a bitch
Her husband came home and he was lurking in the crib
While I was jerking in his bitch, he grabbed the burner out the 6
Bursting in the room, cocked it back, from me to you wait
Before you pull that trigger think of what would Jesus...
You're going to feel, the presence, of GodI get love down in Cali' like the homie Dre 
But these hoes think I'm Snoop they won't go away 
They should play this down in Compton with a cherry drop top
Then everybody get to blasting till they blow the bass 
I ain't gotta say much bitches know the face 
Joyner Lucas see it tatted on the shoulder blade 
Try to Play me you just Skating on a frozen lake
I just wanna put it in her mouth and make her poker face 
Yeah, tell me is you taken for the night? 
I know what you thinking I'm your savior for the night 
I been paper chasing till my bank is looking right
I just need some motivation what you drinkin' for tonight? 
And don't be talking bout them other heads 
Ask about me I've been macking like I'm fucking crag 
Bitches love me in the country like I'm uncle Ted
I'm just what you made me don't mistake me for a fucking sac

Uh, Black shorts and a tank top 
Dead silence on the charm from the chain spot 
Couple dollas in my pocket they don't mean much 
I don't care for bragging you can have it I don't need much 
I remember I was just a nada
Shaggy with da holla

This that opposite attraction
I got opposite intentions
I got positive incentive
I should rob a nigga senseless
I hope them cops'll get defensive
There ain't no stopping this I've been it
Fuck yo' confidence I've been sick
Fuck yo' opposition, I'm kinda different, I hop inside a spaceship
I've been lots a different places
Bitch I'm locked into the matrix
Put my thoughts in different cages
Watch me turn portraits into paintings
Who told you right is wrong in your eyes?
Who said wrong is right with no lies?
They said I was wrong the whole time
Turn them lights off its show time
Who told you there wasn't no God?
Who told you that I don't know God?
Who told you that I don't go hard?
I'll give you something big to choke on
I never follow rules and no laws
Turn your fucking head to coleslaw
This that winter flow, that mistletoe, kiss you goodbye, so long
I'm that Martin Rocka 
I'm that Maserati two-tone
Ain't no cavities in this jaw bitch
Ain't no gravity in these songs
And I've been wanting it for so long
They've been talking shit for so long
This my ocean now, when them sharks lurking boats or coast guards
Bitch my coat rocking so raw
This what happens on a two way street when I'm opposite roads cross
All your common sense'll go lost
All your common sense'll go lost
All your common sense'll go lost
Tell me what happened to you?
What have you done? Where your mind at?
Hol' on
Tell your daughter put some clothes on
Tell your son put his coat on
Tell my father pull his skirt down
He ain't did shit for me in so long
Fuck your opinion nigga I'm grown
They don't like the shit that I'm on
Can't accept the fact that I'm grown
Just accept the fact that I'm on
Ain't no evil practice in here
I got Jesus all in my bones
I got angel wings on my back
I got 808's on my track
Shit I been wanting this for so long
They been talking shit for so long
This my ocean now, when them sharks lurking boats or coast guards

And I can't follow you into the grave
If you want to go that way
You can go alone
Oh, if you want to roll that way

And you don't understand
But it's because I'm different

Oh, if you want to go that way, you can go alone
Oh, if you want to roll that way
Just know that I won't come
Look, you got an attitude 
I hate when you get mad when I'm mad at you
I think you should relax with the latitude
And we done did a lot of things for the gratitude
Cheers to the days I was in a stressful place
Running up the bank, moving next to Chase 
And broke bitches always got expensive taste
She gon' suck me off and see how expensive taste
You'll be my bae and my confidant 
Struggle through the pain and the ramidon
I could be your slave and your Amistad
Love the way you move your waste when my song is on 
Uh-huh, you the baddest
And I'ma hype you up like some ad-libs 
And I can't get enough of your assets
I hope to God you ain't nothing like my last bitch
Can't gas me, I'm a Tesla 
She just wants rules and affection 
Then tell me what you do like Alexa 
But I ain't really cool with the extras
Blessed to be living and my mind is clear 
Tryna chase you but ain't no time to spare 
I don't know where I'm going but I'll find you there 
And we can make love every time you're here 
They think I need to slow down

Man, I wish I had a Maserati 
I'd be taking pictures for the paparazzi 
Feels so good, she wanna pop a molly 
R.I.P. to Whitney, I ain't knockin' Bobbi 
Go check my history, can't nobody stop me 
I should take a picture with Mahatma Gandhi 
Was creating the music when the cops behind me 
And now I'ma bring them strippers to the private party 
Black laces, I don't rock Versace 
I be speeding with the engines on the Kawasaki 
Couple shots to the kamikaze 
We can get to cookin' like some hot hibachi 
My Spanish bitch, she give me sloppy-toppy 
You should use your manners when you talkin' 'bout me 
I've been ridin' solo, I ain't got no posse 
I just saw the people that forgot about me
Don't you wish you were? 
Don't you, don't you wish you were?  
Don't you, don't you wish you were a little bit hard? 
Don't you wish you were a little bit hard? 
And don't you wish you were?  
Don't you, don't you wish you were?
Don't you, don't you wish you were a little bit strong? 
Don't you wish you were a little bit strong? 
Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Yeah, yeah
Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive 
Joyner's all in the focus
And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice 
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya 
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gonna kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana 
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real 
Fuck a talk 
Funny how a funny nigga come across 
Funny how the money make a sucker talk
When it feel good like a nigga took the rubber off 
I see both sides like tug-a-war 
Joyner's on fire, close the oven door 
Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist 
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me 
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary 
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble 
And I love it how they hate you 
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you 
Make a screwed face at you 
Middle finger saying "Fuck you, nigga"
That's just motivation 
I ain't hatin' like a sucker 
But I treat you like a slugger
Uppercut you 'til you crumble 
Have you singin' like Usher 
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches
On a murder mission
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction 
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction

Run and tell the competition
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Stay the fuck up out my jurisdiction
Jurisdiction
Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion
Or sacrifice
What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground
When you can, it's comparable
To mean something more than
JurisdictionVerse 1:
Fuck a swag or being wavy, my practice is being different
You lacking and need attention, I'm rapping in three dimensions
I killed the Seed of Chucky, he back just to seek a vengeance
I slash his Achilles tendons
Verse 2:
Mitsubishis, Hyundais and Kias
Range Rovers, Hyundais, a Lexus
Suzuki, Toyota Prius
Mercedes, Bugattis, Porsches
More shit I just can't afford, when I see you I'm taking yours
You don't open, I'm breaking doors and I broke 'em
Verse 3:
The streets is tattle-telling, cats revealing
Half 'em killing, half 'em dealing
Strapped and peeling
Blaaat, Kill 'em
They trap us
Send the coppers at them niggas trapped in prison
Cause these bastards tell'em, that's a bad decision
Verse 4:
They devious, beautiful, sexy
Intelligent, back-bone, sneaky
Deceitful, envy
Argumentative, territorial with lots of fetishes
Emotional creatures who like leathery baller benefits
Verse 5:
Fucking whack, the U.S. is under attack
The whole nation is under scrutiny, psychological foolery
TV is filled with coonery, guess it's cool to be that
It's a shame the reason we voted Obama is cause he's black
Verse 6:
Joyner Lucas, I'm spitting shit out the air
Kicking alphabetical schemes, and I smack the shit out of words
Slam you on the street, tell them you got hit by the curb
I can take the Hit out of ler, I can take your bitch out of her
Verse 7:
Fried chicken and roasted coyle, with fish smothered in oil

Joe Budden, J. Stylez, P, Nas
Plenty more, Lauryn Hill, Mos Def
Farrahman, Kweli, Kanye

Verse 9:
Innocent, rowdy plus curious
Rambunctious peer pressure
Funny ones, smart ones
Even some who lack guidance, act violent, troublesome
They need love, they need us, they need what, they need
Verse 10:
Ecstasy, coke, 2 acid tablets
Some reefer, that's THC for my speakers
I'm PCPing, some bleach and some DVDs
I buy shrooms and some oxycotins
Some crystal meth on this beat, got you smoking crack in your seat
Verse 11:
Wordplay, play with words
Even if the words play
Tetris like a puzzle, puzzle stretching like I'm exercising
Exercising when I'm taxi driving, driving texting while im whiling texting
Til they pull me over give me breathalyzers
Tempers rising, textin bitches
Letters like I'm emphasizing, emphasizing by the size of envy put them em inside
Step aside, keep it in this verse put your friend aside
That's what I learned, never mind if ever I should tell a lie
Then tell a lie, when you see him
I've been seeing devil's eyes, eyes devil red and God told me that the devil died
Lamborghini diablo, Devil dare me to devil die
Right off the cliff, satanic strip until the genocide
Of Free Masons and ask Mason if he choose the Devil side
Illuminate the Illuminati, not even rep a lie
My repertoire get the pot of gold, kill the Leprachaun
In Lebanon with my sweater rhymes for the second timeThis that shit that'll make me tap dance
All over your crib, then backhand
Both you and your bitch, then crash land
On my alien ship, then stack bands

At you and your clique, what happened
Nigga, look what you did, I'm asking
Bitch, I'm a half-black assassin
Better grab your gats and blast them

And I'm more like Captain Savage
With no black on black on madness
Bitch, y'all back on crack like crackheads
With no platinum plaques or passion
But, nigga, fuck all that, I'm a pilot
High up all over your conscience
And drive up all over your 'partments
And pile up all over your closet
I wind up all over your side bitch
Time's up, could've been in that clock
With my luck, I'll never be on that hot list
And I never had love for no dry snitch
Okay, I grew up in the projects
You come around and everyone in your pockets
You never gonna really know who they watching
Take everything and they gon' leave with your wallet
I bet you never gon' believe that we poppin'
Go take a nigga somethin' to eat and they starving
You never knew that I'd be in their Top 10
Like, God damn
Hol' up

All over your crib, then backhand
Both you and your bitch, then crash land
On my alien ship, then stack bands

"Cash rules everything amongst everything, but what's everything with no peace?"
Fuck the police, hands up in your face
I'm an ice cube with a N.W.A
I don't like you, and I will fuck up your day
And I heard shit gets real up in L.A
I just hope I make it home by five
Cross my heart, bitch, I hope y'all die
And y'all don't see shit through both my eyes
Oh, my God, this that shit that'll make me tap dance
All over your crib, then backhand
Both you and your bitch, then crash land
On my alien ship, then stack bands
I get it in quick, I'm laughing
At you..
And you..
And you..I like this feeling
Yo Q turn me up just a little bit
Yeah, just a little bit
Alright I'm ready let's go
I got 'em bitching, I'm focused
Back and forth from coast and I backstroke and I'm floating
All up in your bitch ocean, I don't think this should be insulting
Drink the juice from my glow stick, don't call me back i'm groaning
But thanks for buying my posters, I fucked around and get twisted
Strait Tequila gon' burn and I write 16's and murder that sick shit
Waiting for my turn, I'm doing this shit since I was an infant
Way before I had sperm, yeah that's the definition of an addiction
Fuck these niggas gonna learn
And I got this bad bitch she a brain buster, I don't care if Lil' Wayne fucked her, I beat her down and get brains from her then kick her out cos I can't trust her
Fuck the Benz mother fuck can't drive, and fuck the party I'm staying in, but when I get rich you'll see me whippin' it'll probably be something Bruce Wayne was in
It'll probably be something that Jay Z in
It'll probably be something Kanye be in
King size bed in the back seat, something that I can make a baby in
Wait hold up, hold up, hold up
Way too much kool aid in your heart valves
If I was you then I'd die now, jump out the window like Ron Brown
So
What you, what you, what you want?
What you niggas want?
Give you want you want
Man this that Chris Angel, that Houdini, that Bum Diggy
Now fuck with me, that black magic
That same shit that made your bitch fall in love with me
What you, what you, what you want?
What you niggas want?
Give you want you want
Oh yeah this that Copperfield, that David Blaine, that Bum Diggity
Now fuck with me, that black magic
That same shit that made your bitch fall in love with me
Now
I don't need no crew with me, I'm solo
Benz on no polo
No Gucci but I'm so fly
When I walk by it's in slow mo
Shorty want me we both know
She can swallow my mojo
Don't call me back, I'm gross though
But that's the 
I fuck around and get wasted
They don't like me then what a shame
Take a number then wait in line
There's a million niggas who feel the same
Disappear like black magic
Black coupe to get a black wagon
Black driver with a black mask
And a black pistol for your black ass
So fuck a blunt, I'm high off life
Piss me off, that's not alright
Yeah that's that shit I don't like
Bitch hurry up, we don't got all night
508 and that's where I'm from and my shows startin', they ready for me
Profound in my hometown, it's like Motown bitch I'm Berry Gordy
Broke nigga, no tour jet
Big dreams of a Corvette
J-Low on my doorstep with some booty shorts and a corset
So hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, way too much Kool-Aid in your heart valves
If I was you then I'd die now, jump out the window like Ron Browz
So
What you, what you, what you want?
What you niggas want?
Give you want you want
Man this that Chris Angel, that Houdini, that Bum Diggy

That's what it sounded like
Shut the fuck up, man
You good?
Yeah I'm good man, we just need to get the fuck off this planet man, I'm tired of this shit already
And go where?
I don't know
Something's just telling me to go man
I think you should come with me
Know what? That really doesn't sounds like a bad idea, now that I th-
Hold up, fuck that!
What man?
Nope!

Last time you had a bright idea, we went to the sun
Nigga that wa-
You almost got us killed, 'member that?
Yeah bu-
My skin ain't been the same since nigga, fuck you!
Nope, the answer is no
Ask me five minutes later from now, the answer is no!
Nigga, you always told me that you would never succeed unless you die, I'd never forget that shit
Dumbass! I-is unless you try, and I ain't tryin' to die tonight, so no
Cancel me out your plans for this one, I'm good
Stayin' my ass right the fuck here nigga, fuck you!
You know, sorry you feel that way my man
'Cause umm, I got this brochure right here and ahh…
What brochure?
I see Planet Earth got some of the baddest bitches we've ever seen in our life
Nig-, gimme that! Let me see that shit
But I guess you don't wanna go so don't worry bout it
What?!
Ahh, don't worry bout it
Nigga what you mean?
Ni- ayy, I'll go put fuel in this shit right, matter-
Get yo' ass up, let's go!
Shoulda said this shit from the first place nigga
Sh- I woulda been sayin' yes, let's go man!
Hehehe, ahh, I figured you'd say that
Well, pack yo' shit, let's take off! I pray for the day I get straight
No cash still niggas trynna eat off my plate
Lord, so sorry for the things that I say, didn't know things 'd turn out this way
All alone in this world so I made mistakes. Fuck, I messed up, I tried my best
I admire my best cause they say the best things come straight from the chest
Almost caught a bullet went straight through my chest
So thankful vest and thank to the chick who played me and made me realize I ain't shit
Just a nigga trynna make it and if I ain't got it, imma take it, if you got it imma chase it
Imma robber in the making, but my head keep ringin'. Heh
Somebody talkin' about me again probably just another nigga trynna out me again
Probably just a hater that just won't allow me to win
Got me sippin' on this bottle of gin, thinkin' bout my role model again
But what would my nana think if I was following him?
Staring at these twin hollows again damn
What a nigga gotta do to make life worth livin'?
Is worth life livin',  I ain't like most niggas Iont think that
Me and you cool, I mean we used to back when you was you and I'm still the same
A lot of people change, with a whole lot to lose and a whole lot to gain that's just game, that's just the game
We all gonna break, I stay rollin' up, I hate growin' up
But wait hold it up, damn look at yo smile, I love it when you smile
Yeah, I love it when you smile, it reminds me of a child
It remind me of a child, it remind of the belt and I probably like you cause you remind me of myself
I'm all grown up, you all grown up
Don't cry though we been through a lot, so what?
We can make it through whatever, that's what I used to tell you, whenever you was down
But now it's whatever and everytime I talk to you, shit, it's whatever, whatever
But I can't say I wish I never met you, but I wish I never wish I let you get the best of me ever
Whatever, might as well say goodbye to yourself cause in the end
All a nigga really got is himself, true, I used to be down with O.P.P
Until other people's personalities told me some otherwise but otherwise don't quote me
Show me, I never let a nigga control me, that's O.D. what
And Imma tell you like, Barack told me
Heh heh listen check, I gotta call em' like I see em
Lil cousins only two swearin' next time imma teach him
Kids only three cursin' that's what y'all teach em
Turn around and beat him kinda hard to believe it
Cut friends off cause Ion't really need em plus Iont really seem em
And iont wanna be em
I want a relationship, but I don't really need it now
Cause I got two reasons, Iont trust nobody and you ont trust me either and I don't blame you
Cause I don't trust me neither, anything you could do, I could do sweeter
And revenge is sweet, sweet like sugar, Ice tea can't 
I don't want to hear all of that shit, wordKnow what it's like to be half nigga
To be half nigga, to be half nigga
Yeah
Joyner
Joyner
Know what it's like to be half nigga, just a half nigga 
My white Mom fell in love with a black nigga 
Just a black nigga
A white lady with a colored kid
I don't even understand what my color is
What my color is 
Black, White, Brown, and some other shit
Homie say you ain't allowed with us
I don't even want you hanging out with us 
And quit trying to act like you proud of us
If we were slaves back then, you'd be a house nigga
A house nigga 
Wow nigga, know what I hate the most
A bunch of cartoons with some racist quotes
And subliminal messages and racist jokes
Kinda funny how the money not ours 
Yeah the money not ours
All the white motherfuckers got power 
While the black motherfuckers got talent
Trying to get respect that'll never be valid 
Never be valid
Even if you had level 3 clearance 
Even if you had Hillary's parents 
Even if you were a rap star 
Even if you had 10 cars and
Even if you had a Red Porsche and a 747 with 10 floors and the best whores
Even if you were a ball player, playing for the Clippers
Just imagine how you would feel if you were Doc Rivers
With a boss like the racist motherfucker Donald Sterling
I've been in and out of feelings, how sad is it 
Yeah how bad is it, when your boss got billions of cash and shit
And you stuck at the bottom you ain't half as rich
Fighting to be equal in the battle with
Another race in this land full of happiness
Another day trying to race to establish this
Another way, gotta wait for an activist to come say how we feel
Ain't that some shh..  ain't that some shit
But meanwhile I got morals to stand up for
Can't cause I got a daughter to man up for
Gotta bite my tongue 
While the life is young if you a black entertainer it'd be nice
To run this shit, but you not shit till the fight is done
And that's just with the icing on the cake
If we didn't break, we'd be twice as strong 
But now it's twice as hard
To be a half nigga living in this life of darkness
All the black kids looking at me like I'm awkward
Cause I'm too light to be on one side of the streets
Now I play both parts, like hide and go seek
Malcolm X gave hope of getting out of the streets
And Rosa Parks was never getting out of her seat
I guess we here for life 
And I heard Mr. Sterling got banned for life, from the NBA
And He can sell the team
If that don't take away the heat from his self esteem
We in a helpless scene and a helpless time
With no help, trying to help decide, if we in hell or a jail
Can't yell or cry, can't scream or tell
But they can tell us lies nigga
Know what it's like to be half nigga 
Just a half nigga
My white Mom fell in love with a black nigga
Just a black nigga
A white lady with a colored kid
I don't even understand what my color is
What my color is 
Black, White, Brown, and some other shit
It's kinda funny how the money not ours 
Yeah the money not ours
All the white motherfuckers got power 
While the black motherfuckers got talent 
Trying to get respect that'll never be valid 
Never be valid, just a half nigga
Just a half niggaVerse 1 :
Riding with the riders, with the mileage on the pilot
Couple bottles and some models and some condoms we be wildin'
Choppers in the closet, for the watchers who be plottin'
Watch me burn this shit down, like Sodom and Gomorrah
My mama and father had some problems but regardless
It was obvious, I would be a fucking monster and a goblin
Killers move in silence but gorillas move with violence
And my niggas move with choppers, and maracas, and Obama’s
And the time here, lamas and the tommy guns
Tomorrow never promised but I'm promising your time is up
Line em' up, Eeny, meeny, miny, grab a shawty, every body fuck
Heard your bitch a hottie but she prolly, well not prolly, fuck
Stopping out you soul until body jump, copy cut
Semi colon, space point, comma what? I'm a nut
Wave strong enough to fucking stop a truck
Smack you with a hockey puck, rip your fucking pockets off your Hollister
Chores :
Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on, suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Hook :
Yo, I try and, I try and tell these niggas man
They not, they not fucking with me man, I, you know what I mean?
I've been doing this shit since I was like 9, 10, you know what I mean?
I can do this in my sleep man
Verse 2 :
Son of an artist, I'm fucking bonkers, I roam with bosses
Fucking your daughters, your mothers, aunts, in your uncle’s office
Born in a carriage a couple horses while jumping off em'
The cops chasing, I fucking lost em' that's fucking awesome
Joyner the puppet master, I'm stabbing your lung and fracture your back
Till your nuts will crack in your sack to your fucking bladder
Funny how now suddenly everyone's a bunch of rappers
They just a bunch of band wagon hopping faggot maggots
Got magic racket, hacky sack it's in my khaki jackets
A cream colored hat to match it with it after taxes
These little hoes know my name they ain't have to ask it
The rap assassin, I'm action Jackson the cash attack a freakaziod
Frankenstein, eat the boy, follow me on Twitter catch me at the BET award
Looks can be deceiving I'm the daemon in your ouija board
Sneaking through your basement I be creeping and I never make a freaking noise
Chores :
Climbing through your windows with a hollow pipe, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ninja blades, twin razors and an army knife, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Ski mask rubber gloves, cutting all the lights, I can't wait for tomorrow night
Vest on suited up like an armored knight, I can't wait for tomorrow nightShit, damn

But being successful is harder than I knew
And I would just nod I said, "Well I'm gonna try"
She looked back at me and stared, "Do what you can"
I said, "Well what if I fail?" She said, "Just do it again"
Do what you fail, don't let the devil inside you

Pray everyday, but if you lose all of your faith
Then you must do what you got to
Then you must do what you got to

"Nigga you just like your father
I knew I shouldn't have kept you
Son told me not to have you, little bastard I regret you
You so disrespectful
Your daddy wore a condom and it broke
You shouldn't even be born, you wasn't meant to"
"Oh bitch I can't believe you
You never was my mom, bitch you always did me wrong
We could never get along
So many times I tried and plenty times I cried
You were never by my side, shit you never did me right"
"Motherfucker damn right
Your daddy never loved me
Used to beat me and he left me for some hefter in the country
And you a spitting image of that piece of shit faggot
If you think I treat you bad, muhfucka just imagine
I used to write poetry, he took away my passion
If you don't believe me ask him"
"But that was way back when"
"I don't give a fuck I can see his face all in your face
For what he did to me you gon' pay for his mistakes"
 {x2}
Nightmares and I can't sleep
Pray the Lord and I hope that He can hear me
Bad dreams and I wonder what it means
Lord have mercy on me
"Nigga shut the fuck up
You got it fucked up, I never should've trusted you
Or fucked with you, you fucked up
I knew I should've one'd you
I knew I shouldn't have fucked you
Son told me not to trust you I knew you was nothing special"
"Bitch be happy I ain't leave you
You lucky I ain't left you, hefter don't be forgetful
I did everything I can do
But you so ungrateful and I'm so faithful
I done took care of your kids like they mine it amaze you
A nigga could be so good, working two jobs and
Bitch you got some nerve coming at me sideways
No wonder when you get a man you can never keep one
It's just that you don't know a good nigga when you see one"
"Fuck you
You don't know what I've been through with my baby dad
He beat my ass, nigga left me, wouldn't take me back
Sometimes I see his face all in your face
For what he put me through you gon' pay for his mistakes"This is a WJZ13 Eye Witness News Special Report
Good afternoon everybody, I'm Mary Buballa, we will join Dr. Phil in just a moment but first, breaking news out of Silverspring, Maryland
A gunman has entered the Discovery Channel building on Georgia Avenue in Silverspring, and taken at least one hostage. We're gonna look at some video of the building
The man entered it around 1 this afternoon. It is not known if the man works there now or has worked there in the past
Police are not saying that anybody have been hurt at this point. Police are saying that the suspect does have concerns about the Discovery Channel-
He's making some demands I'm not getting into. We are-
The man needs to be listened to. Somebody needs to listen to this guy. I mean...
We just received word the suspect is 23 year old black male. We have a name. Future. Future Joyner. He's not backing down, he's determined-
He's apparently some sort of rapper
Somebody needs to listen to this kid
Somebody really needs to listen to this guy before he kills people-
Uh, you muhfuckas better listen to me
You got no muhfuckin' choice, so what's the
Chance of the world hearin' my muhfuckin' voice?
Embrace it , I kill a hostage
Spit the conscious of a prick that's violent 
I'm twisted minded, bitch I grew up in the Worcester projects 
You might as well try to kill me 'fore I blew up 
So fuck everybody when I grew up, henny when I threw up
Corona and Tequila in my cooler, black smoke seepin' from the Cuba
Attract mode, scratch from the cougar 
Plottin' on them diamonds from the jeweler 
Reach from the tool to fill the rugger
That the mouya from Bermuda, to Aruba, we maneuverin'
The movin' in the blue Corolla, Suburu, the new one 
I spend like a champ, tell me, who won? 
Fuck around, get your whole fuckin' crown blew up 
My nigga Aziz told me how to get this moola 
Nigga Trubs took me down to Ayab , where niggas get sprayed at 
And bitches get laid at , and niggas just hate that 
'Cause actual niggas ain't them niggas you could pay back 
You fuck what you heard, I be way back
'Cause I ain't goin' nowhere , so homie, don't go there

I know some bad hoes that suck the poo out a lake
And I don't do a lotta drinkin', I just cool out and wait
Funny thing is, they think they sicker than me
I shot these industry niggas up, now listen to meMan, what the fuck

"Who the hell is this kid?" and
"Why the hell is he here?" and
"Who told him we care?" like yo
I'm Joyner Lucas, by the way, hello
You don't remember my face
Or ya'll didn't get the memo?
At some point, I gave all you niggas my demo
You hopped inside your limos and threw it out the window
Man it's no wonder why nobody called and tried to find me
No wonder why nobody flew me out and tried to sign me
They said this game is full of hoes
And then I thought of Miley
They told me "get her while she young"
And then I thought of Tyga
Or Kylie, whatever
I gotta say a few things
And this wasn't supposed to happen
But I made it this way
And now I finally get the chance to hit the stage for the day
And address all the things that I swear I've been waiting to say
Okay let's get down to the itty gritty
You nitty bitty rappers softer than Pretty Ricky
And smaller than Iggy's titties, I shit in your kitty litty
And if I died and came back, I'm bringing Biggie with me
I ain't got no top five
I'm top five of your top five
But I'm not trying
I'm 6'3", you 5'5", but you not Plies
I'm pop-eye, I'm Fetty Wap
With a cocked-eye
You in for a rude awakening, I hope you awake
I went to Meek's crib and told him that I'm cool with Drake
Kendrick told me this is competition, who is safe
And shoutout to my exes, ya'll done made a huge mistake
When am I gonna win an award?
When are ya'll gonna realise that I'm kicking in doors?
When Dre gonna realise I ain't no shit to ignore?
When Diddy's butler gonna come and get my shit at the door?
Huh?
Now YouTube Joyner Lucas, follow me and stay
I hope that Charlamagne'll give me Donkey of the Day
I hope  never drop no bombs on me
They gonna need some military bazookas and nine armies
Never been running your mouth
Instead I'm putting my gun in they mouth
A thug and I'm coming around
And taking they sweater, they woman, and duck and I'm out
Thinning it out
Somebody calling you out, you ready to move?
Joyner get women, I'm setting the mood
And all of the niggas they get in the booth
I'm telling the truth
So what's an MVP when you strategising?
And what's an STD if you're Magic Johnson?
What's a BET Cypher without me involved?
This ain't even what we all thought it was
We was wrong
JoynerOpen your mind
Breathe
Now, I want you to close your eyes and imagine
You're entering a new dimension
A dimension of sound
A dimension of sight
A dimension of mind
You're moving into a land of  shadow 
Come with me
You lock this door with the feeling of imagination
Low-Frequency Oscillators
You motherfuckers
How the fuck they gon' talk about me?
Bitch, you talkin' 'bout more
You talkin' bout peace, should I talk about war?
You talkin' bout a nigga 'bout a body gotta ride or drive
Or when I catch you, beat you, I just hop up in your Maserati
Get pissed when I spit liquor
A fully grown pimp, bitch with a 
I'ma fully, I'ma automatic stick shift 
With a big dick and a mentioned killer
Certified nigga, I ain't talkin' bout bars
And def come in threes, I ain't talkin' 'bout four
The best come with me, they ain't resting in peace
I'm STD's on your MPC
They envy me, you're the big pet peeve
A lot of rap niggas don't interest me
 press press keys on a nigga had 'em be the itos on Belvita cheese, eggs on my rita
With a chicken noodle soup and a Solo on the side
Pull up on a ride, in the morning when I rhyme
With a mouth cat busy ever dreams of a Drizzy with Cassie and Nicki tryna go at a Minaj
Never scared of death, I don't know why I'm alive
Let her take risks I don't know when I'ma die
Tethered to the booth like I know went over top
And I never been a snitch, I don't know a lot of cops
Cop cars on the block for had the block all blocked off and I blocked more
Mama had a baby and the baby head popped off when the block niggas chopped off on the block, pause
Open up your eyeballs, get a good look
You looking at a nigga that was in a good book
In the rap game, everybody sound the same, with ya lame ass songs with a really good hook
I cook crack on the stove and sell it to a nigga that was jealous of the shit that I was yellin' on a beat that he's probably feelin' so he caught feelings had to drill him in the street
Kill him with the rhythm, put the pistol in his  hit him, get him, and then kill him in the middle of the east
Heavy metal beats, never settle, but I never been or ever willShit, fuck
I fuckin’ hate the rain nigga
Why you, why you hate the rain so much man?
Nigga you know why I hate the rain

Bitch took up all my motherfuckin’ time
Every halfour that bitch was calling’ her motherfuckin’ phone

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Joyner, Joyner, Joyner
Uh, put the cause on the totem, put the balls on the boat
And hit 'em all with the motive
Joyner's all in the focus
And the blogs want to post a niggas songs and you notice
I'm a star, undervoted
I'm a dog, I'm a Doberman pinscher, you a pony
You a unicorn, Louis Vuitton, sneakers on woadie
Trying to be up on me and my niggas like you know me
You don't me
You just know what the people wanna tell ya
Talkin' on the low, but the speakers gon' kill ya
Sleepin' on my back with the TV on the ceilin'
Got Jeezy on, chillin' with the kiwi hard sippin'
E'erybody wanna live like Tony Montana
Sniffin' out the coke with the homie, don-da-da
Drug dealin', bang bang, with the phony bandanna
'Til the homies run right up in your cozy mañana
That's real
Fuck a talk
Funny how a funny nigga come across
Funny how the money make a sucker talk
When it feel good like a nigga took the rubber off
I see both sides like tug-a-war
Joyner's on fire, close the oven door
Beat the pussy up like a drummer boy
Thought you ran the city, what the fuck you niggas runnin' for?
Fuck the law
Tell the politician I'm a terrorist
And tell the government that I'm a colored kid
Tryna make a penny off of half a G
And that'll be the day you catch me workin' at a god damn Applebee's
Nigga, don't be dappin' me
'Cause we ain't got shit to talk about unless you talkin' 'bout a salary
And rappers wanna talk about battle me
But they can suck my dick with a mouth full of cavities
Oh, you in trouble
And I love it how they hate you
But they actin' like they love you
Then they kiss you, then they hug you
Make a screwed face at you
Middle finger saying "Fuck you, nigga"
That's just motivation
I ain't hatin' like a sucker
But I treat you like a slugger
Uppercut you 'til you crumble
Have you singin' like Usher
You a dish to my supper
Motherfuck a nigga, uh
Never ever have I ever
Ever seen another motherfucker fuck her
Fuck her better, better than him
If I ever did
Then I was never ever on this planet
But I plan to dead him and forget him
If I ever seen another
'Nother different mother fucker
On a level of a level one
Level headed rapper
That be rappin' circles
'Round the circles that you rappers burnin'
Burnin' rappers like I'm burnin'
Burnin' bridges with the niggas
That be burnin' bitches

Regarded as mercilessly destructive and unstoppable
Something that demands blind devotion
Or sacrifice
What are you willing to sacrifice?
To censor the word is ground
When you can, it's comparable
To mean something more than

I see a bunch of sentimental niggas
In the ghetto while I’m sittin’
On a Level while I’m spittin’
Instrumental  went on trippin’
Independent Independent
On the feelin or the mission
I go heaven it hadn’t been an aberration
I ain’t selling crack I did it
But my other  was tripping
And my brother has some bitches
I be fucking I was different
And I know it
You was on my Jurisdicton
And I saw it
You ain’t know what I’d had been through

Funny how a funny nigga talk a lot
Funny how the money make a sucker pop
‘Cause it feel good like a nigga took a puff of rock
But I can give a damn if he tough or not

Beat the pussy up like a Juggernaut
Say you run the city what the fuck you niggas talking ‘bout

Lord Quest, what up?
Future Joyner out here
Uh 
Uh
Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of 
Not a Christian and my auntie say I cuss a lot, uh 
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her 
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her 
When I'm rich, they'll be jags that I'm drippin' outta 
So what the fuck I gotta do to make a couple dollars? 
Life's a bitch, you shouldn't press your luck around her 
Just throw a condom on, but fuck a  , )
Everybody call me Joyner but my Mom different 
She call me Gary, but the fiends call me Joseph Griffin 
Chef boy, cookin' up hits in my boy's kitchen 
Guaranteed that once they hit it, they'll be all trippin' 
Clap, clap, let the heater go 
Everything was good just a week ago 
Let the birds talk, chirpin' ain't a secret though 
But these bitches know that they won't ever look at me for dough 
Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of 
Not a Christian and my momma say I cuss a lot, uh 
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her 
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her 
What you know about me? I don't talk a lotta, 
She got a big mouth, so I don't really talk around her 
Steady searching for the love, but it's hard to find it 
She want my heart but only my goddaughter got it
Hoes with the modem, I don't  the car around it 
Swallow your pride, take a shot, and build a bar around it 
Dehydration in my flow, but the water rising 
Drink 'em up, shit 'em out in my port-a-potty 
When I'm rich, they'll be jags that I'm drippin' outta 
So what the fuck I gotta do to make a couple dollars? 
Life's a bitch, you shouldn't press your luck around her 
Just throw a condom on, but fuck a  , )
Snitches know the definition of a lawyer means
Do you know the definition of your loyal means
Now a nigga out of prison, payin' lawyer fees
One squeeze, last breath right before you leave
Clap, clap, let the heater go 
Everything was good just a week ago 
Let the birds talk, chirpin' ain't a secret though 
But these bitches know that they won't ever look at me for dough 
Couple things about me I don't puff a lot of 
Not a Christian and my momma say I cuss a lot, uh 
She a bad bitch but I done heard enough about her 
She mean a lot to you but I don't give a fuck about her 
Give a fuck about her
I don't give a fuck about her
Bitches come down in dozens, manLyrics from snippet:
Don't you make a move unless I say so 
I been down, my girlfriend look like J.Lo 
I thought I was stuntin’ 'til my chain broke
Time to hop out that bando, they see me inside in the fi-i-ire
Ain't runnin’ corporation liars
If the pill's gon' kill you, I'll buy it
You never smoke a herb while on trialLeave me alone
Y'all ever heard of that term
What's it called, uh
Fatal attraction
Well this story right here
It's like that
Thin line between love and hate times ten
You be the judge
She sent me one-hundred and fifty letters sayin' we should be together
And how we should meet each other, when are we gon' see each other
Blowin' up my phone, I ain't even give my number
Leavin' voicemails to my fuckin' brother and my mother
Photoshopping pictures with me and my sister on it
Cut my little sister's head off and stuck her picture on it
She tatted Future Joyner on her titties and her stomach
Tellin' me that if we fuck she  for my brothers
Middle of the night she was in my fuckin' dreams
With a knife tellin' me that "It ain't really what it seems
I'll slice your fuckin' throat nigga, don't you even scream
Future Joyner don't you love me baby, we can be a team
Stick together, you and me forever, Batman and Robin
Or I'll cut your fuckin' dick off like I'm Lorena Bobbitt"
I woke up, jumped in the whip and tried to leave
But she was in the backseat with my keys like "Uh-uh-uh
It's you and me"
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Bitch, leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
She snuck in my hotel room
Lookin' all seductive, almost fell for it
Put my phone in her panties, tied me to the headboard
Shoved a pill down my throat and then my body felt sore
I woke up in the prison right before they shut the cell door
"Officer what fuck?" he said "Nigga listen
Since you wanna rape women, you gon' be somebody's bitch" and
I was trippin' like "Nigga what? You got it fucked up"
He said "Keep your mouth shut, pussy, tell it to the judge"
I went to court the next day, she was in the stands
Slipped the cuffs of my hand, then I ran, goddamn
Took a right down the alley, gettin' chased by the feds
Made it to my nigga's house and she was layin' in the bed like
"You can't run from me Future, don't you understand
I'm your number one fan, what about our fuckin' plans?"
I said "Bitch, you a crazy schizophrenic heffer leave
Won't you let me fuckin' breathe?" She said "Uh-uh-uh
It's you and me" *gunshot*
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Bitch, leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me alone
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Uh Uh Uh Uh
Leave me aloneLet's go
Yeah
Let's get 'em, oh
My father showed me love but it wasn't enough
So I grew up a lit fuse or blow up on a bus
These fuckers treat me like a nigga ain't suffer enough
What? 
Now I raise hell like Satan is back
Abrasion, it hurting, aching and scratching, aim for you back
I'm the equivalent to Ronald Reagan raping the track
Nasty 
Bullemic what I'm eating, what's the meaning of life
I had a meet up with a demon and my dream with a knife 
I beat your cheek with an Adidas 'till you eating the stripes
Bitch 
I'm steaming while I'm freezing in a G2 Fury
Diving down into the ocean with my deep blue jury
I stab your face with a clab and make sea food chilly
Yeah 
I paint a perfect picture, need some abstract colors
Too half ass, so bad luck like two black ass niggas
Division, clap the one ho like two half-black brothas, oww
My mother showed me love but I needed some more
So I grew up an angry nigga just to even the score
Watch your wrist get shined, while we eat off the floor
Damn 
Drunk driving, diving off an air plane propeller
With a stolen umbrella 'cause my parachute have bullet holes
Police helicopters shooting so I could have pulled those
The final gravity falling rapidly with my fitted loaf
Cutting flow can rock shit, can hop big, can spinach blow
Heart's shaking, heart's break, thoughts racing, criminals
Every five seconds like getting more difficult
I don't think I fear the rest, punch you in your ear and neck 
Man in the mirror, Mike Jackson and I manifest
180-prayer connect, call me if you fear of death
Bloody paw prints when I smack the shit out of ghost
Pull the crust out the globe, had to cuss out the sober
Mixing up alcohol, I'm the drug Al Capone
You can call me Garry Lucas Jr
Mr. Super Duper shoot bazookas, packing two belugas
Smoking hookah, need to prove the movement
Losing, skip the grove, and here we use the rulers
You walking on a fine line
Call yourself a player but you sitting on a sideline 
Here's the grind time
They used to say I was stupid, now they call me EinsteinWhat?
It's over
Bitch it ain't over 'till I say so!
Bitch you got some fuckin' nerve
Oh, you really gon' kick me to the curb?
Hope you find the worst nigga you deserve
I hope he treats you like I did, even worse
Nah, I'm trippin, I'm just mad baby listen
I'm sorry I- I don't mean to come at you like this you know
I'm just
I'm still a little bit upset 'cause you know I thought we was gon' make it workUh uh uh whoo whoo uh yeah uh yeah whoo
Uh uh yeah uh yeah whoo whoo uh uh
Got some motherfuckin' Ciroc in the buildin'
And I got some motherfuckin' Henny in the buildin' too
And I got my nigga J Black in here too
And I got my nigga Ave in here too
And I got my nigga Azi in here too
My nigga Kev in here too
 
Say I'll do my thing just because I need to fuck what you hoe niggas thinking?
Tryna make it all stat with the cash in a wrap and I'm fuckin' your hoes on the weekend
Maybe pass in the back now I'm passing the black matter fact how you hoes wanna do this?
Super stupid, dark as chocolate, big pocket, Joyner Lucas
I'm a fool, let me get it all too
Fuck your girl in the pillow I'll drool
Fuck this world, when I fuck your girl, Imma flex so hard when I fuckin' curl
You feel it, haters stoppin', Trayvon Martin, but gun concealin'
I pop if you , man give you balls, you ain't feeling it, uh
Y'all niggas ain't cool, y'all niggas ain't hot, y'all niggas ain't nothing different
Y'all niggas ain't do the most , y'all niggas ain't even pimpin'
Probably got your bitches dry as fuck and I keep it drippin'
Ay ay, with your baby, you keep her sober, I keep her sippin'
Big difference, from bitchin' pitchin', switchin' words to a vision and flippin' birds in the kitchen, they slick, conversing with women the frickin' nerve of you niggas
Tryna tell us that we ain't the greatest
We love to love and give the same to haters
Can't fade away, let's just play to play this
I'm good, these niggas just mad 'coz me and my niggas got hoes on speed dial
So they hittin' they phone and they don't pick up and they hang once more with the redial
Leased out when I pee now
Probably fuck dirty bitches and you when I'm senile
Future's what I see now, take a puff of the blunt if you really wanna see how
Rappers, gangstas, killers, smokers, bunch of niggas with feelings
Models, hoes, and strippers, hookers, bunch of bitches with children
What you think is appealing me I be fighting the feeling
Just livin' life in the ceilin', ain't gotta like it but feel it
Get you, get you, ya ya
The killers on the corner
That hit you with the chopper
Then make you do the cha cha
Make you do the cha cha
Then make you do the cha cha
The killers on the corner
They make you do the cha cha
Get you, get you, ya ya
The killers on the corner
That hit you with the chopper

Then make you do the cha cha
Then hit you with the chopper
They make you do the cha cha
 
And I know these niggas just mad 'coz me and J Black got hoes on speed dial
Better ride on out, cut your eyeballs out until you look at me now
And I spit so hard you can dive inside my drool, go swimming and float
By the stop sign too with a woman and hoes on the outside too
I'm hot times 2 times 6 times 7, eight breaks inside my crib when I tie my shoe
Gotta hide my shit, when I ride by you, finna pop my shit, better stop that shit you know better
If I ain't got it I get it, go get it, you got it, I'm a goddamn go-getter
If you knew better you'd do better bet I'm better than you niggas don't know better
How the hell you feelin'? I'm feelin' all great, I'm feelin' like winnin', I'm feelin' on free like dinner in prison, she feelin' on me, I'm feelin' like sinnin' now
I ain't pop no molly, ain't pop no pills, ain't pop no guns, I'm coolin'
She ain't pop no booty, ain't pop no pussy, she swallowed my dick, she droolin'
Rappers, gangstas, killers, smokers, bunch of niggas with feelings
Models, hoes, and strippers, hookers, bunch of bitches with children
Can't pay my rent, never paid more sense, Imma rob motherfuckers
I catch you chillin' with the wrong motherfuckers
Explode your crib put a bomb in the oven
With a match in the wick in the back of the truck when you catch your shit, I be laughing or something
While I'm walking on trains in the back of the tunnel
On the ground, escape 
And grab me a gun just blast me a nun
Don't pass me the blunt, just pass me the lunch
I eat that plate and I need that cake
When I see that bank Imma need that safe
Imma need that cave, when I see that Jake, Imma squeeze that thing
When you see that flame, you gon' need that cane, Imma leave that pain
Imma eat that brain, I don't need champagne, I don't eat pancakes
Plus herbal herbs, y'all get on my nerves, don't shit on my words, don't spit on my verse
I spit in your face, I'll piss in your grave, y'all niggas is birds, my shit is absurd
Get you, get you, ya ya
The killers on the corner
That hit you with the chopper
Then make you do the cha cha
Make you do the cha cha
Then make you do the cha cha
The killers on the corner
They make you do the cha cha
Get you, get you, ya ya
The killers on the corner
That hit you with the chopper
Then make you do the cha cha
Make you do the cha cha
Then make you do the cha cha
Then hit you with the chopper
They make you do the cha chaLyrics from the snippet:

She want all my gush 
Taking pics on the cam 
Take the dick like the champ 
Make it flip like a gram 
Make it strip while you dance 
Twenty, thirty-five, forty 
Forty, forty-five, fifty 
Swallow meat but don't kiss me
Just don't leave me no hickies
Five A.M. and we been at it
Throw it back she the best at it
Head game call it head magic
Addiction she a head addict
Give it all like a care package
Beat it down on my air mattress
Zip it down got my pants saggin'
Shawty ride like a bandwagon
Imma ransack it ain't no mercy
Throw it back like a old jersey
Make her quit like cold turkey

Today's topic will be, "Why do I attract bitch ass niggas"
Ho ass niggas, yo, excuse my language
Um, I should  say men
My baby daddy, ooh, yeah, he had that cake, boy
Making 50k, you know what I'm saying?
Everything, had the car, had the clothes, had the shoes
I mean I ain't no gold digger, if that's what y'all tryna get at
"Oh, she like them type of dudes"
No, I like a man who is able to take care of meThis is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
You should get up out that bullshit
Just point me to the good shit
She just wants some good dick
I'll show you where to put it
So sick of all your fussin'
That shoulda/coulda/would shit
I been cursin' like I'm ign'ant
And my aunty told me different
"That's that ratched"
Bitch, I'm ghetto fab'lous
Broke as hell the whole year
Then boss so hard with taxes
I felt like a grown man
When I was just a bastard
Hidin' condoms in my mattress
Tryin' to figure how to catch a bitch attention
I been dreamin' like I'm Malcom
Schemin' like I'm browsin'
Grindin' times a thousand
I been flyin' like a falcon
Over water, under bridges
This beat is too ridic'lous
Fuck around and break a mirror
I ain't into superstition
I'm is what the game is missin'
This the main invention
This is fuckin' homework
I hope you paid attention
I been playin', you been benchin'
These fuckers need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, nigga
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Okay, you brag about the Benzs
Then hoppin' out the Nissan 
I thought we were best friends
A shoulder I could lean on
Bunch of niggas thirsty
Go drink some Aquafina
Bunch of men that act like females
Ho, go drink some lime-a-rita with yo bitch ass
White on white like riff raff
Shined so bright my whip dashed
And it killed my swag on impact
And I died, what the hell, got sent back
And they sent my ass to the med lab
And now I feel like Hulk with a pen pad
And two lightnin' bolts would've went passed me
Don't look at me
I'm hype with a game like this
His flow tight, but it ain't like this
It feel like that, then it ain't my shit
Better frame my pic in an eight by ten
And I made my bed, don't lie by me
She don't suck dick, that's fine by me
'Cause I got chicks that abide by me
Better honk your horn when you ride by me
Better high five me when the game's in session
'Cause this the main invention
And this is fuckin' homework
I hope you paid attention
I been playin', you been benchin'
These fuckers need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, wha'?!
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
All y'all niggas need intervention, I'm independent
Don't get defensive, I'm sorry 
Mind your business, I'm thinkin' big
And I think I'm pimpin', I'm Scottie 
Bitches think that I'm cocky 
Dead silent, my posse 
Better be stressed, no East–West
No Keith Sweat 
Probably ain't get that line, my nigga 
Probably throw a fit and cry, my nigga 
But it's okay, I ride, my nigga
Go drink some henny and drive, my nigga
Go slide by, this my time, my nigga
Don't mind my thoughts, I'm just 
Y'all just  snakes, I piss on venom
More reason y'all niggas need intervention
I'm just Lieutenant Sergeant Joyner
Lucas, nigga, what you doin'?
Spendin' all your fuckin' bread
Tryin' to stunt, what you provin'?
Ba-ba-ball so hard, motherfuckers want to find me
Or motherfuckers want to try me
Motherfuckers want to rob me
Shit, you better robbin' Williams' Jumanji
And that's what it is 
For the li'l kids, I'm what it is 
Break down doors at your mother's crib
Better open your door or I'm comin' in
Yeah, I'm runnin' in, better ace this lesson
You niggas need detention
Or suspension or some counselin'
Or some Joyner intervention, wha'?!
This is intervention for these weak niggas; run around
Jump around like their shit is sweet but they funny style
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in session
Settle down, motherfucker, class is in sessionGet away from me
If I were you, I'd watch
What you say to me
Snakes all in my bed
Wanna lay with me
This ain't no mother fuckin game
Why you play with me?
Don't play with me
This the only thing-
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
Don't play with me
This the only thing-
Fuck it, I get it, I did it, I dead it
Regret what I said-
On that track Percasthetic
This shit is eugenics
I'm all in the centre
Yo check my genetics
You'd know that I'm mental
But show me somebody who run it like that
Hit you with words from the front and the back
Fly like a bird, from above I attack
With the words so absurd that they say that I'm wack, like-
Hol' up, 
Just noticed the vocals ain't Joyner
But V ain't gon' slow up
He glow up and show up
So trust me you're good as a goner
Bitch I am lightning
I keep it on timing
If you had the brains
Then I would be frightening
Best stay away
Or pay up the price
You're a good time
But this is my life-
Get away from me
If I were you, I'd watch
What you say to me
Snakes all in my bed
Wanna lay with me
This ain't no mother fuckin game
Why you play with me?
Don't play with me
This the only thing-
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
Don't play with me
This the only thing-
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
I love, love, love, love
I love
Don't play with me
This the only thing-You may have trouble with a stalker
Hi, I'm Robert Todd and I’m here to answer the question
What do I do in dealing with a stalker?
Well, the first thing is, treat it like a very serious matter
This is an area where I would advise you to air on the side of caution
As opposed to waiting in a period of time before you report it to your local authorities
