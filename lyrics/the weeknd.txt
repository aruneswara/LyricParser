Hey!Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gon' let them hits fly, we gon' let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo

You know me, know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me

Said I'm just tryna swim in something wetter than the ocean
Faded off a double cup, I'm mixing up the potion
All I wanna do is make that money and make dope shit
It just seem like niggas tryna sound like all my old shit
Everybody knows it, all these niggas know me
Platinum off a mixtape, sipping on that codeine
Pour it in my trophies, roll until my nose bleed
I'ma keep on singing while I'm burning up that OG
All my niggas get it, they make money all alone
Rock a chain around they neck, making sure I'm getting home
When I travel 'round the globe, make a couple mil' a show
And I come back to my city, I fuck every girl I know
Used to walk around with a slouch, had a mattress on the floor
Now my shit straight
Eating all day, tryna lose weight
That good sex, we'll sweat it out
Hotel bed springs, we'll wear it out
I ain't gotta tell you 'cause—
You know me

Oh, baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I'd give it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
Never comin' down, uh
I was running away from facin' reality, uh
Wastin' all of my time out living my fantasies
Spendin' money to compensate, compensate
'Cause I want you, baby, uh

It was simply a blessing wakin' beside you
I'll never let you down again, again

This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, yeah

Made you put down your guard
I know I made you fall
Then said you were wrong for me
I lied to you, I lied to you, I lied to you 
Can't hide the truth, I'd stay with her in spite of you
You did some things that you regret, still ride for you
'Cause this house is not a home
Without my baby
Where are you now when I need you most?
I gave it all just to hold you close
Sorry that I broke your heart, your heart
And I said, baby
I'll treat you better than I did before
I'll hold you down and not let you go
This time, I won't break your heart, your heart, noWasted times I spent with someone else
She wasn't even half of you
Reminiscin' how you felt
Reminiscin' how you felt
And even though you put my life through hell
I can't seem to forget 'bout you, 'bout you
I want you to myself
And now I'm askin', who do you belong to now?
Who you give that love to now?
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now?
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway
I ain't got no business catchin' feelings
Catchin' feelings
These girls only want you when you're winnin' 
But you've been with me from the beginnin' 
And I know right now that we're not talkin' 
I hope you know this dick is still an option
'Cause I'll beat it up 
I took my time to learn the way your body functions
You were equestrian, so ride it like a champion 
This sex will get you high without no other substance
So who do you belong to now? 
Who you give that love to now? 
Who you pullin' up on?
Who you gettin' sprung for now? 
And what they got that I ain't got? 'Cause I got a lot 
Don't make me run up on 'em, got me blowin' up their spot 
'Cause I ain't got no business catchin' feelings anyway

If you ain't layin' next to me-e-e
On me, me, on me, oh, I
On me, on me, on meUh, uh, uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, like
I ran out of tears when I was 18
So nobody made me but the main streets
'Cause too many people think they made me
Well, if they really made me then replace me
Homeless to Forbes List, these niggas bring no stress
I feel like Moses, I feel like I'm chosen
And if you ain't my nigga then your girl single to me
I don't give a damn if a nigga said he knew me
Grew up with no father so nobody ever "son" me
My flow too sick, Kevin Costner couldn't touch me
I know you wish that nobody ever love me
I feel useless when I'm never making money
Well, this the life we always fantasized
Rich folk problem through a Queen Street nigga's eyes
Every time you see me pulling up in Aventadors
Just know we been grinding on them sidewalks
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me on
Say, say, say
I come from murder one, brung late night melee
Say, say, say
We hung all summer, sprung mattress with bae bae
Say, say, say
Trippin' off Dyke, and my name strike with pay day
Say, say, say
Flippin' blue lightning, tightening, strapped with AK
Say, say, say
OG one, told me one, show me one, eight ways
How to segue
Pussy, power, profit and headache
I reminisce my life innocence or life innocent
Or life intimate, with fame
Light limo tint with light women, dark women in it
Awe Kenny, good game
She wanna hang with a Starboy
The sun and the moon and star, boy
Astronomer, anonymous
I line 'em up, we grind 'em up, there's nine of us
And five of us have probably fucked
She mollied up, I tallied up all the parts, boy
Twenty legs, arms, head 
Head, head, and more head 
Oh God, bless the dead 
I'm livin' life, high off life
I wear my chokes off to bed
I'm the greatest nigga, why you scared to say it?
I wanna rock, I wanna rock
I wanna cop more land, I never stop
I wanna quick advance on a bill if it ain't one
Break everything, I'm a hustler, came from
Sidewalks saved my life
They don't ever lie
Sidewalks saved my life
They showed me all the signs
They don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they don't let me down
But they lead me on
And they lead me onWe are not the same, I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas, they been doin' too much flexin'
And they about to call the wrong attention
And I don't got no patience, no more testin'
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessin'
XO niggas ain't nothin' to mess with
Nobody stoppin' us, oh no, we destined
And everybody 'round you is so basic
I'm never rockin' white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chase in
That money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick, tell her friends about it
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
Last year I did all the politickin'
This year I'ma focus on the vision 
I think these hoes deserve another fixin' 
I'm talkin' 'bout the ones from the beginnin' 
Don't believe the rumors, bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rockin' camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killin'
I'ma spend it all on bitches 
And everybody fuckin', everybody fuckin'
Pussy on the house, everybody fuckin'
Man, I miss my city, man, it's been a minute 
MIA a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz 
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Drivin' by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib, I guess you call that shit a miracle
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
Roll some, think I’ll roll some
To know some, if we both honest
Who lasts? Yeah, you lie
Spent the whole summer
Tryna be at the wrong place at the right time
But I know what's mine when I see it
I know
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen Street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
And I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded when we want, girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I get it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trillI'ma care for you

You make it look like it's magic 
'Cause I see nobody, nobody but you, you, you
I'm never confused
Hey, hey

So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you
I'ma care for you, you, you, you, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect
You're always worth it
And you deserve it
The way you work it
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah
Girl, you earned it, yeah
You know our love would be tragic 
So you don't pay it, don't pay it no mind, mind, mind
We live with no lies
Hey, hey
You're my favorite kind of night
So I love when you call unexpected
'Cause I hate when the moment's expected
So I'ma care for you, you, you

'Cause girl, you're perfect 
You're always worth it 
And you deserve it 
The way you work it 
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah 
Girl, you earned it, yeah
On that lonely night 
We said it wouldn't be love
But we felt the rush 
It made us believe it was only us 
Convinced we were broken inside, yeah, inside, yeah
'Cause girl, you're perfect 
You're always worth it 
And you deserve it 
The way you work it 
'Cause girl, you earned it, yeah 
Girl, you earned it, yeah

I guess you had no idea that you could have persuaded me
Girl, you could have had me doing anything you pleased
Girl, you should have took your time and thought of what to say to me
'Cause I'm not as hard as I make it seem to be
And it could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
If we just went on 
Happiness exists when you don't know a thing
So I hope you don't think this song is about you
And only I can know how close you came
But baby I'm a pro at letting go
I love it when they come and go
It could have went so many ways
So many ways it can go
'Cause ain't nobody feels the way that I feel when I'm alone
So if I said that I won't call
The lying comes natural to me
You probably could have had it all
You could have been that lonely star
If we just went on 
If we just went on

"Listen, listen"
From the morning to the evening
Complaints from the tenants
Got the walls kicking like they six months pregnant
Drinking Alizé with our cereal for breakfast
Girls calling cabs at dawn quarter to seven
Sky's getting cold, we're flying from the north
Rockin' with our city like a sold out show
House full of pros that specialize in the ho'in'
Make that money rain as they taking off they clothes
Order plane tickets
Cali is the mission
Visit every month like I'm split life living
Let the world listen
If a hater's caught slipping
Then my niggas stay tight
Got my back like Pippen
Fast life gripping
Yeah, we still tippin'
Codeine cups paint a picture so vivid
Fakes try to mimic
Get girls timid
But behind closed doors they get poles so rigid
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
Push it to the limit
Push it through the pain
I push it for the pleasure like a virgin to the game
A virgin to that money
A virgin to the fame
So this my only chance
And when I'm over only pray
That I flow from the bottom
Closer to the top
The higher that I climb
The harder I'ma drop
These pussy ass niggas tryna hold on to their credit
So I tell them use a debit
Watch they image start to lessen
I warn them like discretion
Why these niggas testing?
Always fucking testing
Why these niggas testing?
Shit that I got them on straight bar hopping
To the music of the ambiance
Get shit popping
Zombies of the night 
Niggas ain't talking if they hyping to the crew
Get it in like pockets
Downtown loving
When the moon coming
Only place to find bassheads and hot women
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work
Better slow down
She'll feel it in the morning
Ain't the kind of girl you'll be seeing in the morning
Too damn raw, ain't no nigga with her rollin'
Ain't no nigga that she holding
Man, her love is too damn foreign
Look at all that money
The money is the motive 
All that money
The money she be folding 
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money is the motive
All that money, the money she be folding
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in work, girl, girl, put in work
Girl, put in workOoh ahh

I don't want to die tonight, baby
So lemme sip this slow
I'll give you what you called for
Just let me get in my zone
I'll be making love to her through you
So let me keep my eyes closed
And I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right
I won't see a damn thing
I can't feel a damn thing
But I'ma touch you right 
I'ma touch you right

Ohh ahh, ahh

But I'm in need tonight baby
I've been alone for too long
Ohh, oh yeah
So, I won't say a damn thing

But I'ma touch you right 
Oh, I can't see a damn thing

Ooh, I'ma touch you right

Ohh ahh, ahh
Ooh, yeah
Whoa, all these broken hearts on that pole
Man, if pole dancing's an art, you know how many fuckin' artists I know?
Got some new bills in the mail, got some big favors I owe
Got some good things ahead of me when these bad bitches let go
Well girl let's go, walk your broken heart through that door
Sit your sexy ass on that couch
Wipe that lipstick off of your mouth
I take it slow
She in love with my crew
She said make enough so I can try some
I thought taking drugs just ain't you, be you
Yeah girl, just be you
And I do this shit for my hometown, it been going down, it ain't new
That's that north north, that up top
That OVO and that XO
Your girlfriend at our next show
But it's all good, don't stress though
First night fuck, never really planned it
Take a deep breath, no one need to panic
Lips so French, ass so Spanish
She don't really like attention, I don't know if she gon' manage out here
But she got me all up in my zone
Said she like the view I got in this place, shit I did all of that on my own
Aw yeahI'm Addy'd up, add it up, I just ate a plate for breakfast
Put it in a cup, then I mix it up with Texas
Chest feeling heavy like a midget on my necklace
Bitches that we came with got all of your bitches jealous 
'Bout to leave the crib with a couple of my pirates
Driving by the streets we used to walk through like a triumph
Mix it in a potion like a science
That liquid G diet got a nigga so quiet
'Cause the shit so strong, got me feeling like I'm dyin'
Shit so raw, nothing else can get me higher
Only time you see me's when I'm balling with my niggas
'Cause my life too private, my ride too private 
My flight too private, my shows so riot
My jaw so tired, I go all night in my city 'til the fall
Then it's time for me to fly her
I got a girl at home even though she ain't mine yet
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like
Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
Don't be mad, let her get hers
Don't be mad, let her get hers
She made her own luck, she don't give a fuck
She's tryna have fun, take a break from the love
Man, your girl so bad, let me get her
Your girl so bad, let me get her
I make my own luck, I make that pussy talk
Call to the fall, you can like it or not, nigga, back the fuck up
If you ain’t with me, motherfucker, you against me
If you ain’t complimentin' nigga, you offendin'
I've been out here last year wasting hella time
XO is the only time invested
Them Fall shows every year like a birthday
And I'ma do it every year in my birthplace
And I ain’t been this gone since Thursday
I never said that I’d be sober in the first place
And she gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it
She gon' give it up 'cause she know I might like it

Baby, you know what I like, like, like, like, like
Baby girl, you know what I like
Baby, you know just what I like, mm
I just passed that liquor fell off stage
Just sold out the O2 at my own pace
I can say that I’m attached to nobody
I've been getting paper while these niggas tryna stop me
Shout my nigga Doc, that’s a mentor
Had some bad business, nothing personal
But now that word out that we back
On some young Quincy Jones, dark skin Michael Jackson
And these the motherfuckers that they packaged
Their new shit all be soundin' like my past shit
Bring your girl to my show, give her floor seats
Then she go downtown like she owe me
XO, XO, XO
Mix it up, pour it up, take it down slow
This my sound, nigga, fuck your sound
Did it from the ground, ask around, bitch
When I touch down, I'ma shake shit up
Fuck your new man, I'ma break it up
He can come back when I go on the road
But that pussy mine for the next three months
’Cause the kid back, kid back, kid back
Cop ten whips for my niggas when we land
Queen Street nigga making money overseas
Had a few more debts, I'ma pay it all in cash
Shout out XO, shout out to the boy
Broke bread on tour, man, it’s all love now
Shout my nigga Stix, doing good in these streets
Bet he popping more bottles than us right now
Reason why they stressing, city never sunny
When the kid come through with more niggas than Apollo
But ain’t shit funny, can’t nobody stop me
All my hoes are trained, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of them swallow, all of them swallow
All of them swallow, I make all of them swallow
All of, all of, all of them swallow

To say that we're in love is dangerous
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted, oh

I know I'd rather be complacent
But girl I'm so glad we're acquainted
We're acquainted

But really if I could

Momma called me cryin', cryin', cryin', cryin'

Put some more inside your cup
And drink till you numb the pain
I got you touchin' on your body
These girls keep touchin' on their body
They got accustomed to the life we live
These girls born in the '90s are dangerous
I got 'em thinkin' that they want me
Although they know they not the only
I got 'em wanting to embrace their sins
These girls born in the '90s are dangerousAll alone, she was livin'
In a world without an end or beginnin'
Baby girl was livin' life for the feelin'
But I don't mind, I don't mind, oh
And all the wrongs she committed
She was numb and she was so co-dependent
She was young and all she had was the city
But I don't mind, I don't mind
And I know 
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when 
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
In the night when she comes crawlin'
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understand
He sang a song when he did it
He was cold and he was so unforgiving
Now she dances to the song on the minute
Yeah, all the time , all the time , oh
It make her weak when she hear it
And it got her on her knees like religion
She was young and she was forced to be a woman
Yeah, all the time , all the time 
And I know 
That she's capable of anything, it's riveting
But when 
You wake up she's always gone, gone, gone, oh
In the night she hears him calling
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain
She'll never walk away

In the night she hears him calling 
In the night she's dancin' to relieve the pain 
She'll never walk away 
I don't think you understand 
In the night when she comes crawlin' 
Dollar bills and tears keep fallin' down her face 
She'll never walk away
I don't think you understandWhen I got on stage, she swore I was six feet tall
But when she put it in her mouth
She can't seem to reach my
Ballin' ain't an issue for me
I'll make a hundred stacks right back next week
Do it all again, I'm faded off the wrong thing, the wrong thing
And I'll admit, baby, I'm a little camera-shy
But exceptions can be made, baby, ‘cause you're too damn fly
For what it's worth, I hope you enjoy the show
'Cause if you're back here only takin' pictures
You gon' have to take your ass home
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back
You can meet me in the room where the kisses ain't free
You gotta pay with your body
Not really into kisses leading into nothing
I'm into shows every night, if you play your cards right
I might fuck around, bring your whole crew on tour
Fuck around, turn you to my West Coast girl
Until they book a show in NYC
Gotta fly back east where the city don't sleep
Woah, I'm tryna finish all this potion
Baby, take your time, tryna sip it 'til the mornin'
And if you're still up, I'm tryna fuck you in the mornin'
Said I'm two days strong
And never sleep until it's mornin', until the mornin'
'Cause the only thing you're takin' is your clothes off
Go 'head, girl, strip it down, close your mouth
I just wanna hear your body talk
Oh yeah, don’t hold back, let it out
Oh girl, don’t hold back, let it out
Don’t hold back, let it out
Oh yeah, don’t hold back
I got a brand new place, I think I've seen it twice all year
I can't remember how it looks inside
So you can picture how my life's been
I went from starin' at the same four walls for 21 years
To seein' the whole world in just 12 months
Been gone for so long I might have just found God
Well, probably not, if I keep my habits up
Probably not if I can't keep up with lovin'
And I can't stand talkin' to brand new girls
Only bitches down to fuck when you shower them with ones
Probably not if my niggas round them up
Probably not if we take 'em to my spot
Probably not if I tweak all day just to sleep at night
Goddamn, I'm high
My doctor told me to stop
And he gave me somethin' to pop
And I mix it up with some Adderall's
And I wait to get to the top
And I mix it up with some alcohol and I pour it up in a shot
I don't care about you, why you worried 'bout me?
All I want is that smoke, give me all of that smoke
Last week was my rough week
I'm still drippin' down from my nose
And I don't know how to drive, I make my driver get high
But If he goes under that 110, believe my driver get fired
And I don't got any friends, I got XO in my bloodwork
And I'm posted up down in Florida, 
Ft. Lauderdale to that MIA
Cold drinks with Grand Marnier
To the break of dawn, Kahlua milk
White Russian when the sun hits
White Russians with tongue tricks
I like the feeling of tongue rings
She like the way my whole tongue flip
She grind hard for tuition
She grind hard 'til her teeth chip
I make her hide it with gold grills
I make her suck it with gold grills
In the back room of the VIP, she don't ever sleep…

I fight pain and hurricanes, today I wept
I'm tryna fight back tears, flood on my doorsteps
Life a livin' hell, puddles of blood in the streets
Shooters on top of the building, government aid ain't relief
Earthquake, the body dropped, the ground breaks
The poor run with smoke lungs and Scarface
Who need a hero? 
You need a hero, look in the mirror, there go your hero
Who on the front lines at ground zero? 
My heart don't skip a beat, even when hard times bumps the needle
Mass destruction and mass corruption
The souls of sufferin' men
Clutchin' on deaf ears again, rapture is comin'
It's all prophecy and if I gotta be sacrificed for the greater good
Then that's what it gotta be
Who gon' pray for me?
Take my pain for me?
Save my soul for me?
'Cause I'm alone, you see
If I'm gon' die for you
If I'm gon' kill for you
Then I spilled this blood for you, hey

And when we act a fool, it's probably 'cause we mixed it

Big O know the deal, he the one who showed me
Watch me ride this fucking beat like he fuckin' told me

Not between your heart
Can't you see?

It was like he was never there
It was like he was gone in thin air, oh
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time, oh, baby
It won't matter 
It won't matter
When it's time, when it's time, when it's time

Ooh, now I know what love is
And I know it ain't you for sure
You'd rather something toxic
So, I poison myself again, again
'Til I feel nothing
In my soul 
I'm on the edge of something breaking
I feel my mind is slowly fadin'
If I keep going, I won't make it
If I keep going, I won't make it
And it's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
It's all because of you
Woah, woah
Don't you, baby, hey
It won't matter, baby
Don't you know?
Don't you know?
Ooh, noYou bring good to my lonely life, honestly 
It's hard for me to look into your eyes
When I say  that I would be nothing without your love 
I feel the rush and it's amazing
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place , yeah
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I think I've been in Hollywood for too long 
'Cause I can feel my soul burning, feel it burning slow
But I would be nothing without the touch 
I feel the rush and it's amazing, hmm
Maybe I've been always destined to end up in this place
I don't mean to come off selfish, but I want it all 
Love will always be a lesson, let's get out of its way 
'Cause I know , all I know , all I know 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo 
I'm a prisoner to my addiction
I'm addicted to a life that's so empty and so cold 
I'm a prisoner to my decisions
Woooo, woooo, woooo
I don't know
I get so wrapped up in a world where nothing's as it seems
And real life is stranger than my dreamsOh, oh-ooh
Oh , oh 
Oh, oh
They say my brain meltin'
And the only thing I'll tell 'em is
I'm livin' for the present and the future don't exist
So, baby, take your clothes off, a chance like this

We'll be going all night, 'til light

Don't mind, all my writings on the wall
I thought I passed my peak, and I'm experiencing fall
And all I wanna do is leave cause I've been zoning for a week
And I ain't left this little room, tryna concentrate to breathe
Cause this piff so potent, killing serotonin
In that two floor loft in the middle we be choking
On that all black voodoo, heavy gum chewing
Go on if you thirsty, baby, if you dancing
Grab a cup of that XO, baby, I been leaning

Blood on pillow and one bruised eye
Drunk too much, you know what I'm like
But you should'a seen the other guy
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
Well baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies could not make you believe
We're running in circles, that's why
In my dark times, I'll be going back to the street
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark time, baby, this is all I could be
And only my mother can love me for me
In my dark time
In my dark time
Light one up, let me bum a smoke
Still coming down, dripping throat
I got another man's blood on my clothes
But it ain't his fault, it's the life I chose
This ain't the right time for you to fall in love with me
My baby, I'm just being honest
And I know my lies can never make you believe
Running in circles, that's why
In my dark times, I'll be going back to these streets
Promising everything I do not mean
In my dark times, maybe this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark times
In my dark times I've still got some problems, I know
Driving too fast but just moving too slow
And I've got something I've been trying to let go of
Pulling me back every time
In my dark times taking it back to the street
Making those promises that I could not keep
In my dark times, baby this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark time taking it down to the street
Making those promises that I would never keep
In my dark time this is all I could be
Only my mother could love me for me
In my dark times
In my dark time
In my dark timesI've been mixin', I've been sippin'
Since I been 20, on that lean, baby girl
I've been poppin', and I've been rollin'
Since I was 17, I've been geekin' on that water
I want you, now now
I'm not tryna fuck tomorrow baby I want you, now now
Don't take my number, don't want your number

And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love

The last thing I remember is your beautiful body grindin' in the club
Drunk in love
We be all night, love, baby, love
We be all night, love, baby, love
Wanna fuck a skinny model right before her runway show
She the one in the back, nose running from the blow
And we did it on the floor, that's why she walkin' kind of funny
Should've never put us on, bitch I'm only 24
And everybody salty, niggas stop your bitchin'
Everybody makin' money, we don't need to kick it
I'm chillin' with my niggas, everybody got a crib
Did an album just to do it, droppin' albums like a pill
Percocets, Adderall, ecstasy, pussy, money, weed
Faded for a week, I don't sleep, fuck my enemies
Try to stay sane is like a full-time hobby
Everything I do, fake niggas always copy
All I want to do is go on tour and drop albums
And if I live forever, probably drop a hundred thousand
Dick made out of magic, my tongue got superpowers
I woke up in the mornin', models passed out in the shower
And I woke up in the kitchen saying
"How the hell did this shit happen?"
Oh baby, drunk in love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all night, love, oh yeah, love
We be all nightI used to pray when I was sixteen
If I didn't make it, then I'd probably make my wrist bleed
Not to mislead, turn my nightmares into big dreams
Whole squad mobbin' even though we only six deep
I was singing notes while my niggas played with six keys
Walking in the snow before I ever made my wrist freeze
I was blowing smoke, had me dizzy like Gillespie
Niggas had no homes, we were living in the dead streets
You couldn't find me like I'm Hoffa
Cover girls jumping out the page like they pop ups
Spending all my money on these niggas that I brought up
Taking care of families for my brothers when they locked up
And I had nothing to believe in
Double cup leanin'
Couldn't even breathe and
For that money I was fiending
Cali was the mission but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
She like my futuristic sounds in the new spaceship
Futuristic sex, give her Philip K dick
She never need a man, she what a man need
So I keep on falling for her daily
We was at Coachella going brazy
Stack a couple M's like I was Shady
Now I'm in Tribeca like I'm Jay-Z
Rockin' Sorayama like he pay me
I just signed a new deal with Mercedes
Got me movin' dirty like I'm Swayze
All my diamonds dancing like they Swayze
All my diamonds hitting like they Swae Lee
Jet so big got a business and a coach
Always livin' on the road, rockin' Louis à la mode, nigga
And for that money, I been fiending
Cali was the mission, but now a nigga leaving
Leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, oh
Twenty mill' mansion, never lived in it
Zero edge pool, never dipped in it
Superstar neighbor in my business
Paparazzi tryna catch me slippin' and
Going on tour is my vacation
Every month another accusation
Only thing I'm phobic of is failing
I was never blessed with any patience
So a nigga leaving, leaving, leaving into the night
Now a nigga leaving, leaving
Leaving into the night, ohBathroom stalls for the powder nose 
High heel shoes with the open toes 
She's got a good time wrapped in gold

So obsessed with the camera lights 
You love her, but you can't deny 
The truth, the truth

To go back to my old ways, don't you cry for me
Thought I'd be a better man, but I lied to me and to you
I take half a Xan' and I still stay awake
All my demons wanna pull me to my grave
I choose Vegas if they offer Heaven's gate
I tried to love, but you know I'd never stay
I'd never stay
But if I OD, I want you to OD right beside me
I want you to follow right behind me
I want you to hold me while I'm smiling
While I'm dying
And if you know me
When I go missing, you know where to find me
Driving down the boulevard is blinding
Always blinded by the desert lights and
I'm alive when
I feel everything
I feel everything from my body to my soul
No, no
Girl, I feel everything
When I'm coming down is the most I feel alone
No, no
I lost my faith
I'm losing my religion every day
Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love

Time hasn't been kind to me, I pray
When I look inside the mirror and see someone I love
Oh, someone I love
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again
I ended up in the back of a flashing car
With the city shining on my face
The lights are blinding me again

That real life, real life, real life, real life
Heaven only lets a few in
It's too late for me to choose it
Don't waste precious tears on me, I'm not worth the misery
I'm better off when I'm alone
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh
That real life, real life, real life, real life
That's real life, oh oh oh
Real life, ooh
Mama talking that real life, oh oh oh 
Yeah, yeah, real life, real life, real life, real lifeSaid you want a little company
And I love it, 'cause the thrill’s cheap
Said you left him for good this time
Still if he knew I was here, he’d wanna kill me
But it's time you met the real me, filthy
But wasn't always, will be
Your pill refill and I'll still be your addiction
You can touch a prescription, but don't fill me
I let you see my dark side, but like a mic check, you got one too
So when the sparks fly we hit the flight deck and got sprung
 Like an ejector seat, from an F-15
But tonight we don't need those pills
Just the effects of each other, but we gon' film
'Cause I will want your ex to see  that…
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
And every time he hurt you, I heard you
Your shoulder to cry on
And I’ll be damned if I weren't who you turned to
You said he drove you to my arms
But don’t you know, remember when I told you
I would never let down my guard?
And I hope you feel like dirt when I hoe'd you
'Cause is it really over?
But you just want a little company
And you just really wanna thrill-seek
Said you left him for good this time
Bullshit, what your friends do, spill beans?
Or you just wanna be guilt free, and still creep
But these hills see from their POV, we can touch
But the only way you’ll film me is with a camera, feel me?
You’re nothin' but a barfly
You got your sights set on the one who you run to
But I’m a far cry from what you might get, if we come true
So keep textin' me
But at night, if you seek those thrills, what I expect to be?
'Cause if you cheat on him, just means I will be the next to be
Your ex, so no complexities, just sex
And don’t lecture me, just accept that…
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe
Hills have eyes, the hills have eyes
Who are you to judge? Who are you to judge?
Hide your lies, girl, hide your lies
Only you to trust, only you
I only call you when it's half past five
The only time that I'll be by your side
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, yeah
I only fuck you when it's half past five
The only time I'd ever call you mine
I only love it when you touch me, not feel me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me
When I'm fucked up, that's the real me, babe

You're the only one I've got my sights on 
Type of sex you could never put a price on 
I'll take it off, you're the one I'll roll the dice on 
And I just want a baby with the right one
'Cause I could never be the one to hide one

I can't, can't believe you want me
After all the heartbreaks, after all I've done, oh-oh-oh 
No, I can't, can't believe you trust me 
After all the rough days, you still call me up 
'Cause I've been the hardest to love
You're tryna let me go,  yeah
And I can see it, I can see it 
I've been the hardest to love 
You're tryna let me go, yeah
And I can feel it, I can feel itWhen I saw the signs, I shoulda let you go 
But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close 
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else 
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left 
They just made you feel lonely 
I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
I said don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the startWhen the sun comes up, you're searching for a love
So your heart won't lead you to anyone
When the sun goes down, I know what you become
You become awake, unlike the rest of us
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbye
I lay my head on a thousand beds
It's been a test to see how far a man
Can go without himself
I think I lost the only piece that held it all in place
Now my madness is the only love I let myself embrace
I could've stayed
But I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
Adapted to these models
Who's adapted to the bottle
They take it down like water
Just to burn away their sorrows
I'll stay up till tomorrow
Just to tear down all their morals
And all is fair in Love and War
She's pure
So pure, like the love that's so uncut and raw
And clean, so clean, as opposed to what I offered
Because I chose the life
I chose the life
Then I realized
She might have been the one
I let it go
For a little fun
I made a trade
Gave away our days
For a little fame
Now I'll never see your face
But it's okay I adapted anyway
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
She might just be the one
The afternoon has gently passed me by
The evening spreads its sail against the sky
Waiting for tomorrow
Just another day
God bid yesterday goodbyeIt's ideal, oh
You need someone to tell you how to feel
And you think your happiness is real
There's so much more the world has to reveal
But you choose to be concealed
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
I don't think you even know it
So you're somebody now
But what's a somebody in a nobody town
You made enough to quit a couple years ago
But it consumes you
It's everywhere you go
And just the thought alone got you trippin'
Got you losing your mind
And I don't blame you
It's everything you know
But I own this time, this ain't new
Now I decide when we're through
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
What the fuck does it mean, oh
When your heart's already numb
You're professional
Won't treat it like it's personal
No, 'cause it's just love
It always makes its way back around
It's dispensable
To fall is unacceptable
'Cause everything you've been through made you stronger
And every day you learn about yourself
And nothing really played out how it's supposed to
Depending on somebody else's wealth
But now you know the value of a dollar
And girl I make enough of it to spend
I love the way you've put yourself together
I love the way you make that body bend
For me again, oh yeah
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
All of those nights you were up barely holding your own
Girl, you've got it made
Had you blaming yourself for when life did you wrong
Now, you've got it made
Getting rich to the drums of your favorite song
Girl, you've got it made
Because your freedom was here in this cage all along
Oooh, how did you drain all the soul from your eyes
How did you teach, teach yourself how to smile
In a world where your dreams can't be real, no
Every touch that you sell is a lie
I love, you love
This love
We're professional
I know, you know
We're sophisticated
At loving...
We're professional
We're professionalWhoa, with a nigga like me
Whoa, with a nigga like me
She said please, mercy me, mercy me
Let me fall outta love, before you fuck her, before you fuck her
She begged me, she gave me all her pills
Now my back hurts, she lost control
Now she pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Baby got her pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long before she falls out of love
]
Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
I tried to kiss you
But you never let me miss you
But you never let me miss you
I thought I told you
I'm not him, I'm not him
Look what you did, nobody forced your hand
And don't you fall for a nigga like me, I begged, I begged
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
Now you're pleading, she on the floor, she on the floor
She said it won't be long before she falls out of love
It won't be long, before she falls out of love

Sandpaper kisses, papercut bliss 
Don't know what this is, but it all leads to this
You're gonna leave her 
You have deceived her
You're just a bird
Just a bird
Just a bird
Just a bird
Just a bird
Just a bird
Just a birdThe wind in the sky
Please gather the clouds
And close the way of the wind
I need to make the beautiful dancer
Like a muse, so I can keep looking at her
Too bad if you forget about me
I have to live with it
We swear by God we will be together forever
Now I'm worried God will take your soul
Because you broke your promise
Like the fire which guards light up to search things
Burns up in the night
And fades into the daylight
Just as my love and thoughts of you
Burn in the night and fade into the sun
I know you want your money, girl
'Cause you do this every day, okay
The way you doubt your feelings
And look the other way
Well, it's something I relate to
Your gift of nonchalance
But nobody's ever made me fall in love
With this amount of touch, well
I'm not a fool
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool, I'm just lifeless too
But you taught me how to feel
When nobody ever would
And you taught me how to love
When nobody ever could
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
And I know that I'm saying too much
Even though I'd rather hold my tongue, yeah
And I'll pull you closer holding on to
Every moment 'til my time is done, yeah
And this ain't right, you've been the only one to make me smile
In so long, I've succumbed to what I've become, oh baby
I'm not a fool 
I just love that you're dead inside 
I'm not a fool,  I'm just lifeless too 
But you taught me how to feel 
When nobody ever would 
And you taught me how to love 
When nobody ever could 
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you 
And learn to mistreat you 
'Cause you belong to the world 
And ooh girl, I wanna embrace you 
Domesticate you 
But you belong to the world 
You belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the loneliness of filling every need
Oh no, you belong to the world, you belong to the world
You belong to the temporary moments of a dream
Ooh girl, I know I should leave you
And learn to mistreat you
'Cause you belong to the world, ooh yeah
And ooh girl, I want to embrace you
Domesticate you
But you belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world
You belong to the world(Woo, ooh-ooh, oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woo, ooh-ooh, woo, ooh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
The reasons I can't have you, are so easy to fix
I didn't really plan to, but I'ma do it for thi-i-is
The reasons I can't have you, isn't so complicated
Baby, if you let me, I won't hesita-a-ate
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
All I know, all I know, all I know, all I know is this
I know there's been stigma 'round me
I know you heard things about me
You sleep one eye closed, too scared to get heartbroke
Heard too many lies told, don't make this shit my fault
I could tell why you would doubt me
I hit one time, you can't live without me
Girl I'm just peakin', I'm just tryna be on top of you, on top of you, ooh

The cash in my pocket spill out in the floor
When the cash overflow, let the cash overflow

Shutthefuckup!
We trippy mane!Somebody told me it was pointless for me to come back
Into your arms
Said you fucked another man
Finally, I knew this day would come
Whoa oh oh
Cause I see fear in your eyes
You've been living out your life
As long as you know that when I land you're mine
It's been exactly 365 since I've seen your face
I've been living on the road
And you've been living all alone, at home
Girl I hope, he made you satisfied 
Well baby I won't cry
As long as you know that when I land you're mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
There are certain things that I've come to understand
Expectations can kill a simple man, simple woman
I try to master the art, of that far away love
But only so much can keep a woman warm
Now it's times like this that I say to myself
We've been living in a cold, cold world, cold world
But at least I have you to rely
Even if for a short time
As long as you know when I land you're mine
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And you will never feel so pretty
And you will never feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there
And he can't make you feel this pretty
No, he won't make you feel this beautiful
When I make it there
Oh when I make it there

Quand une putain de colombe blanche chante sa chanson
C'est tout ce qu'on entend
Les jours se défilent comme de la ficelle dans le vent
Embobiné dans ma toile, je les dévoile à nouveaux
10 ans mon ami, que rien d'autre ne compte
Elle n'était qu'une gamine à ce moment
Souffrant d'un cœur brisé, une douleur très profonde
C'est là où je l'ai aperçue, seule, prête à entamer ses 17 ansYes, all I could say is yes
Promise me you won't regret me like the tattoos on my skin
Like the wrong pill

Paid for the life that I chose
If I could, I'd trade it all
Trade it for a halo

Hurt in the end, but I feel nothin'

Then take my breath and never let it go
If you just let me invade your space
I’ll take the pleasure, take it with the pain
And if in the moment, I bite my lip
Baby, in that moment, you’ll know this is
Something bigger than us and beyond bliss
Give me a reason to believe it
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder 
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Love me, love me, love me
Ooh-ooh-ooh-ooh
Harder, harder, harder
I know your motives and you know mine
The ones that love me, I tend to leave behind
If you know about me and choose to stay
Then take this pleasure and take it with the pain
And if in the moment you bite your lip
When I get you moaning, you know it's real
Can you feel the pressure between your hips?
I’ll make it feel like the first time
'Cause if you want to keep me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder 
And if you really need me
You gotta, gotta, gotta, gotta
Got to love me harder

I never thought I'd be here without you
Don't let me drown inside your arms
Bad thoughts inside my mind
When the darkness comes, you're my light, baby
My light, baby, my light when it's dark, yeah
I'm too high, baby, too high, baby

As for me, I've been getting grown
As for me, I've been getting old
As for me, I’ve been flying around the world
I’ve been killing these shows
But I'm always getting high
Cause my confidence low
And I'm always in a rush
Ain't no time to fuck slow

Even though I probably don't deserve this girl
But you been dreaming for this moment so you have to
Baby, it's OK
I got show money, baby
I wanna show you how I blow money, baby
I wanna show you how I throw money, baby
I'm a kid, so it's hard for me to hold money, baby
Cause I'm a star, don't get it twisted
Got some trappers in my car
What kind of caps I got the brownest of them all
Somebody pop 'em before we pop 'em all, before we pop 'em all
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall

I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before
I've felt the ground before

Cuz I ain't scared of the fall
Mama, I understand why you're mad
And it hurts to accept what I am
And how I live
And what I do
But I've been good since Thursday
Yes I've been good since Thursday
So you can watch my love vanish
In a girl with no talent
But to make mula vanish
Call her friend for my friend
And friends name's Lexus
I let my niggas test it
Her morals worth a cent
And best believe I already spent it
My blunt full of B.C
My cup full of Texas
Flown on that OVO jet, yeah I said it
I was born to be reckless
Was forced to make records
So you ain't gotta ask "Who's next? Who's next?"
Saying this ain't nothing, but it's all I need
And the peak ain't reached but the peak is all I feel
And it feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
It feels so good
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I ain't scared of the fall
I've felt the ground before

The fall
And I ain't scared of the fall

XOI realized, I belong to you
I feel the darkness when away from you, eh
Don't stop your lovin', walk out on me
Don't stop for nothin', you're what I bleed
I learned to love you, the way you need
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Pick up your phone, I got a question, oh
If I die tonight, would you regret it, whoa?
Don't stop your lovin', it's all I have
'Cause I can't function, no I won't last
I swear I'll love you just like the past
'Cause I know what's pain, this is not the same
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you

I was too busy tryna find you with someone else
The one I couldn't stand to be with was myself
'Cause I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
When I feel the love, girl I hesitate
It's what I'm guilty of, oh yeah
I can't get enough, I'm insane
Without your touch
Touch, touch, touch
I'd be nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing, nothing, nothing without you
Without you, without you, without youYou'll never make me stay so take your weight off of me
I know your every move, so won't you please let me be
I've been here times before but I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man, this time you won't seduce me
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you please
I am the stuff that you want, I am the thing that you need
She looked me deep in the eyes, she's touchin' me so to start
She says there's no turnin' back, she trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...
She likes the boys in the band, she knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors for those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame, a life that's so carefree
She's saying that's ok, hey baby do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing, I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say, I want to go too far
I'll be your everything if you make me a star
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...
She said I have to go home cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone, why don't you come with me
I said my baby's at home, she's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone to say that I'm alright
Diana walked up to me, she said I'm all yours tonight
At that I ran to the phone sayin' baby I'm alright
I said but unlock the door because I forgot the key
She said he's not coming back because he's sleeping with me
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no, Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no... Oh no... Oh no...All alone
All alone
All alone
All alone
I got something to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I could only say one thing
Girl, I been bad again, girl, I been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems comes solutions
And I use 'em
When I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me
Pick up your phone
The party's finished and I want you to know
I'm all alone
I'm feelin' everything before I got up

I always want you when I'm coming down
I always want you when I'm coming down
Poppin' again, I tried to quit again

Supply what I take, I take what I spend, baby

A vision of my nails in the kitchen
Scratching counter tops, I was screaming
My back arched like a cat
My position couldn't stop, you were hitting it
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it , star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
And I shouldn't cry, but I love it, star boy
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girl
I just want to see you shine 'cause I know you are a star, girlWill I ever love the same way again? 
Will I ever love somebody like the way I did you?
Never thought you'd be so damn hard to replace
I swear it don't need to be this way
If I can't have you, is love completely off the table?
Do I sit this one out and wait for the next life? 
Am I too cold? Am I not nice?
Might not be quite yet healed already
Should I be goin' too steady? 
But I just wanna know is love completеly off the table?
Will you be thеre? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
I'll wait for you
Even though it always feels like I'll be number two
To someone you can't hold anymore
If you let me in, I'm ready to give you what I couldn't before
'Cause I got you, girl, let me help you through it
You're trying to fill the void with a couple boys
I can see right through it 
I can love you harder than I did before
Was in a dark place back then
I was toxic, then I was toxic to someone else
I was haunted by the hills 
I couldn't give you my all, but I will
If you let me in your arms 
If you let me in your heart
I don't think that love's completely off the table
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table?
So can you hold me?
If I let you, can you prove it to me? 
'Cause I need you to calm me down, babe
Gotta get out of my head 
Tryna be here from this bed 
Just wanna know, just wanna know, know, know, baby 
Can you touch it like you believe in it, baby? 
Let me think you never gonna leave on me, baby
'Cause I ain't her and you ain't him, thankfully 
But it's gon' be hard to let someone else in again 
Baby, baby 
Will you be there? 
Can I still love you? 
Not yet healed or ready 
Should I be goin' too steady? 
Just wanna know is love completely off the table, baby?
I swear, I swear
I will wait for you whenever you need
Ooh, oohThey all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain
So now that she's gone
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame
Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
When it's said and done
I already felt love
And I let it end up
End up dying by itself
And when it's said and done
You were better off
You deserve real love
And I deserve to be by myself
'Cause I've gone too far
And I started too young
To give up
And even if I changed
It would be too late
I exposed my ways
Now every girl I touch
They all feel the same
Adjust to the fame, ooh
'Cause no one will love you, like her
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone 
Embrace all that comes 
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become 
They all feel the same
I should've let you leave
But I let you watch me slip away
I could've set you free
But I'm selfish
I watched you stay, oh
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, away
They all feel the same 
Adjust to the fame 
'Cause no one will love you, like her 
It's pointless 
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone 
Embrace all that comes 
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become  
They all feel the same 
Adjust to the fame 
'Cause no one will love you, like her 
It's pointless
Like tears in the rain 
So now that she's gone  
Embrace all that comes
And die with a smile
Don't show the world how alone you've become 
She has no recollection
Of the life she had without me
She let it slip away, away, away
So sad it had to be this
She forgot the good things about me
She let it slip away, away, awayI tell myself that I'll take you for the last time
I'll be over you eventually
Time after time, you seem to brush me off
I understand what we have become
You wash your neck when you leave, now I know your routine
I was in love with your mystery
Now I'll just take what I can get from you
I'm not embarrassed to be what you want me to be
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
You know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You just wanna fill the void now
I can tell that you’ve been yelling at him all night long
And I can hear it in your voice now
He got you smoking extra packs a day
Don’t you worry 'bout me talking
I know why you’ve been coming
I’ll be quiet, this ain't nothing to me
Just wrap your legs around my waist
I won’t stop until you ask me
Don’t you worry about us messing up my sheets
Cause unlike you, I got nothing to hide
I don't pretend to have any shame
I got a box you can put all your lies in
Until the end of days
And know that I will be a call away
The call you'll make when you're all alone
And I know that I will always be the one
You repent when you are done
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
You’re gonna hate him
Then you’ll want me
Then you’ll miss him
Then you’ll hate me
Girl, I know you so well
Girl, I know your routine
Well, here comes the sun
And you’re in my arms
And my denial keeps me on the edge of the chance
That you’ll stay through the night

Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Tell me how to love, it's been so long
When a call's not enough, and you just need to touch
Thinking twice I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention
The only problem is you'll never get enough
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
What do you expect now?
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Only thing left is the sex now
Ooo, oo, ooo-oo
'Cause baby, too vexed now
Ooo, oo, oo, oo, oo
Only see me on the TV or the bed now
When a touch not enough
You were more than a fuck
Thinking twice, I'm the one
But you just need to trust
You're only looking for attention
You only notice it cause I'm never around
You're only looking for attention, oh, oh
You're only looking for attention

You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throne
I haven't been around my town in a long while
I apologize, but I
I've been trying to get this money like I got a couple kids who rely
On me
But I remember on the bathroom floor
'Fore I went on tour
Like you said we couldn't do it again
Cause you had a thing with some other man
You said it was love
And you said you were lost
Then you wished me good luck
To find somebody to love
But, oooh
Now I've heard that you're single
And uh huh, I'll give you something to live for
Yes, I will
Honey, please
You never thought you'd ever see my face again
But your love just swayed the lies
When he stared into your eyes
He just might be too good for you
You're almost dead to him
You're sleeping with a frozen heart
Well baby girl it's over now
And you can always count on me
Your unshackled boy, unrestrained to touch
So immune to love
And it feels so priceless to me
That you're always free
That you'll take me in
Now I'm everything, your everything
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in now
The same place I left you in 
I bet you'll take me in
I know you'll take me in, I know you'll take me in
The same place I left you in
We

You made me feel so good
Before I left
On the road
And you deserve your name
On a crown, on a throneMmm… Mou matenai-yo...
Yeah, people always talk about the ones that got away
I just seem to get the ones that always want to stay
I'm just too distracted with the life I'm tryna paint
Say, I got all these women too attracted to the fame
Got too many niggas that will end up in the way
Nothing's gonna stop me, I'ma get it either way
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
We can own it
Why would you wanna take away from this moment?
Woo-hoo!

Commitment is an enemy to me
But ever since her lips touched my face
It's like a kiss was laced
I'm feein', I'm feenin', I'm feenin'
I usually like to slow down the pace
Love to tease and play
But girl I need to be direct with you
Cause in my mind your voice just replays

With the winter wolves, in the dark, alone
The wildest night, I became the one
And you'll know you're mine when the silence comes
Heavy is the crown only for the weak
A knife in my heart couldn't slow me down
'Cause power is power, my fire never goes out
I rise from my scars, nothing hurts me now
'Cause power is power
Now watch me burn it down
I been down with the coldest war
And I know where I been 'cause I bled before, yeah
How do I know if I let you stay?
How do I know if we did it your way?
You wouldn't take my place
Put me away, I'd die lookin' up at your face
How do I ever know? Who can I trust?
Feelings of emptiness
Only love could kill me, God bless
A knife in my heart
Couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out
I rise from my scars
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down
Breathe, feel the air that I breathe 
Air that I, air that I breathe
Who's hotter? Been a monster with a crown
So swamped by high water, keep your head up, you might drown
In this world, it's way colder, by the day, we count it down
Been around, just been waitin' up, she gon' come around
I took a drag, bust it out the gate, my lil baby, slay
I wore a flag, put that on my face, ain't nobody safe
Lift the mask, they gon' have to see what they can't erase
I took a lot, so I took it back 
Danger's on my mind
Ain't no knife, dagger, bullet that can do it
'Fore you, yeah, you know, I go right straight through it, yeah
Heavy is the crown, but never for a queen 
A knife in my heart
It couldn't slow me down 
'Cause power is power 
My fire never goes out 
I rise from my scars 
Nothing hurts me now 
'Cause power is power 
Now watch me burn it down 
Now watch me burn it downIt has begun again, my friend

You made me fall again, my friend
How can I forget when you said love was just pretend?

'Cause she loves to lay

I fell in love with the subject of sin
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? 
I don't have to remind you 
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
I'm in control, when you give me your body, yeah
I feel our souls burnin' up when I'm, inside of you and I
And I'ma leave a mark, just to remind you, where you belong, baby
Give me your all, scream as loud as you want
I don't have to remind you, it's my need to confine you
I see your face every time I'm with somebody else
Can't you see that I want you? 
I don't have to remind you 
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belong
Where you belong, where you belongI'm running out of time
And you'll always be on my mind
And I can't make you stay
In this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep
Finally
To sleep
Finally
And I can't make you stay
In this broken place
And I hope you find peace
Close your eyes as I put us to sleep
Finally
Go to sleep
Finally
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I can't make you stay
In this broken place
Won't you find peace?
Close your eyes and I put us to sleep
Woah, oh, oh
To sleep, woah
Na-na-na-duh-na
Oh, no, no
Na-na-na-na
Oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-ohTo my fans
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to "spoon feed" my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who tell stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The Rolling Stone video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other side represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest . The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to Trilogy. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint
Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XOOh
Ooh, yeah
I just pretend that I'm in the dark, and
I don't regret 'cause my heart can't take a loss
I'd rather be so oblivious
I'd rather be with you
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I don't ever wanna know
I can tell what you done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes
I see there's something burning inside you
Oh, inside you
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to
Oh, you try to
You always try to hide the pain
You always know just what to say
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you
Oh, define you
I never lied when I cried for you
And I know you cry too 
You're reading minds, just couldn't deny you do
Always hard to say bye to you 
Love the way you're talkin', love your style, but, ooh, babe
We know that you got it from me
And it's haunting you deep, too hard not to see it
Hate the way I feel love, only hurts with real love
And it's taking every part of me, when you look, I could see love
One day, I'm giving you space
And the next day, you're giving me faces
And I like parties, not this place
It's comin' out of my bag for you to get wasted
I 
It's like I forgot that staring is rude
And that's what five shots could turn me into 
But you've done most things that gentlemens do, so 
When it's said, when it's done, yeah
I would never let you know 
I'm ashamed of what I've done, yeah
When I look at you
In your eyes 
I see there's something burning inside you 
Oh, inside you 
In your eyes
I know it hurts to smile, but you try to 
Oh, you try to 
You always try to hide the pain 
You always know just what to say 
I always look the other way
I'm blind, I'm blind
In your eyes
You lie, but I don't let it define you

Coming at you once again
With stories of truth and stories of sin
Yeah
Yeah, the ball is in your court
No defense, nobody's keeping score
No offense but I've played this before
Maybe you can and you just don't care anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Yeah
And I’m right back here when I said I wouldn't
You were never a good girl but you're a better woman now
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving, evolving
Look, you remind me of Jane Birkin, your body insane in person
Wanna do special things for you, you deserve it
But you're too famous to buy you purses
That barely scratches the surface
This time is different, you give me purpose
Tell me you taking it serious, I gotta ask how serious?
'Cause your serious has just been not that serious
Got me on tour acting like I'm not that curious
Ignoring all the pussy that's thrown at me
Been thinking 'bout home actually
Where Roxx has Kim and Mark has Ashley and Niks has Ezee
And I, I don’t even know what I have anymore
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
Evolving
E...
We are not the same I am too reckless
I'm not tryna go in that direction
These niggas they been doing too much flexing
And they're about to call the wrong attention
And I ain't got no patience, no more testing
I do shit how I want, don't need no blessing
XO niggas ain't nothing to mess with
Nobody stopping us, oh no we're destined
And everybody around you is so basic
I'm never rocking white, I'm like a racist
I don't drink my liquor with a chasin'
And money is the only thing I'm chasin'
And some dope dimes on some coke lines
Give me head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do an ounce, get some dick
Tell her friends about it
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I did it on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singin' 'bout poppin' pills, fuckin' bitches, livin' life so trill
Last year I did all the politicin'
This year I'm all focused on the vision
I think these hoes deserve another fixing
I'm talking about the ones from the beginning
Don't believe the rumours bitch, I'm still a user
I'm still rocking camo and still roll with shooters
I'm a villain in my city, I just made another killing
I'mma spend it all on bitches
And everybody fuckin, everybody fucking
Pussy on the house, everybody fucking
And I miss my city man it's been a minute
M.I.A. a habit, Cali was the mission
Cruise through the west-end in my new Benz
I'm just tryna live life through a new lens
Driving by the streets I used to walk through
When I had no crib I guess you call that shit a miracle
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it
I'm that nigga with the hair
Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
My cousin said I made it big and it's unusual
She tried to take a selfie at my Grandma's funeral
Used to roam on Queen, now I sing Queen street anthems
Used to hate attention, now I pull up in that wagon
I was broken, I was broken, I was so broke
I used to roam around the town when I was homeless
Me and Lamar would rob a nigga for his Jordans
And flip it just to get these hoes another nose fix
Now we get faded, when we want girl, we got choices
Lay them on the fucking table, we got choices
And if they wanna fuck my niggas, they got choices
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
They told me not to fall in love, that shit is pointless
Yeah, that shit is pointless
It's only meant to fall in love
That shit is pointless
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell them what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be off that coke
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it

Singing 'bout popping pills, fucking bitches, living life so trill
Life so trill
Life so trill

Going back in time when I feel her
She touching me, it's too familiar
The way she doing the thang
She does exactly the way you used to, you used to
Let me take a break, I need a breather
The way she moving, I can't believe how
She does exactly the same, I must be going insane, oh, oh
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
Girl, my head is racing
Heard shorty's been needing the rest of my mind
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her
Thought I left that part of life behind me
It's back to haunt every girl that loves me
Why can't she leave me alone?
Can't believe every girl that I hold
I see you, I see you
The greatest times we had the best of
Push back rewind but I can't delete her
Move forward into my life, I had a place and a time to apologize, to apologize
Am I going crazy?
Do I need some therapy to get shorty out of my mind?
Girl, my head is racing
Heard shorty's been needing the rest of my mind
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Am I making love to you through her?
Love through her, love through her

I used to pray to hear my songs on the radio
Growin' up, my folk was on, ain't have to kick a door
Keep sixty bitches backstage, at like every show
Ain’t no more Hanes on my balls, these are Kenneth Cole
All these squares in my pictures, yeah, we croppin' those
Let lil' shawty lick my dick, I had my boxers on
Everybody 'round me poppin, bitch, we kettle corn
Fly the PJ on the e-way with the P1
Carat and a half drippin' on my neck, son 
Take a bubble bath with a rapper's baby mama 
Young dirty nigga rockin' water like a swamp 
Yeah, I just fucked her last night, didn't tell her my name 
All these hip-hop rappers down to be Drake 
All my double cups purple like the soul plane 
Diamonds on me loud, got you silent 
Got her bouncin' on this dick like hydraulics
'Cause you know me 
You know me 
You know me 
You know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me
Record man play my song on the radio
You too busy tryna find that blue-eyed soul
I let my black hair grow and my weed smoke
And I swear too much on the regular
We gone let them hits fly, we gone let it go
If it ain't XO then it gotta go
I just won a new award for a kids show
Talking 'bout a face numbing off a bag of blow
I'm like, goddamn, bitch, I am not a Teen Choice
Goddamn, bitch, I am not a bleach boy
Whip game, make a nigga understand though
Got that Hannibal, Silence of the Lambo
Hit the gas so hard make it rotate
All my niggas blew up like a propane
All these R&B niggas be so lame
Got a sweet Asian chick, she go low, mane

You know me 
You know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me
Young, young nigga, same OG, stayin' lowkey
Stand ten toes deep, roll fleeces
G says, made a thesis, I'm a G
I'm a weakness like The Weeknd, so the remix...
I beg your pardon? It's true
The rumors that they start could make us break apart
Assumin' it influenced, all this sudden change of heart
Divorce in court and take off with the whole thing
'Mind 'em that they know me
No way you think if ever I decide to cut my hair like Abel did
Like Jaden Smith I'd prolly walk around all day with it
Okay, you lame, I'm a-okay with it
Might take the whip around my old ways
'Mind them that they know me
'Cause you know me 
You know me 
You know me 
You know me 
Every time you try to forget who I am
I'll be right there to remind you again
You know me 
You know me Scenes
The title, "M A N I A", appears in bold, red capital letters.
Murphy the leopard is in the center of an arena-like area. A white light is flashing to the beat of the song. Murphy glares up as saliva dribbles from his mouth.
Abel is seen riding in his McLaren P1, singing along to the song. There is a slow motion clip of Murphy running. Abel continues singing along to "Sidewalks" in his expensive vehicle. Cut to a view of a mountain in the distance.
There is ambience in the background. Abel, wearing a blue baseball cap, gets out of his P1. He walks into the nightclub. "Secrets" begins to play and Abel sings along. Everybody in the club is dancing. There is a young woman dancing seductively in the middle and Abel has his eye on her.
Under a fading blue light, Abel and the woman from the previous scene are becoming extremely close and dancing slowly and romantically with one another. A man is watching them from a distance with jealousy. The music fades and Abel is seen in the bathroom using water to make sure his hair looks perfect for his newly found woman of interest. The jealous man walks up to him from behind as he washes his face in the sink. He then lunges for Abel with his knife and blood spurts everywhere. The music stops and Murphy roars.
Abel is covered in blood. The man lays dead on the floor, still bleeding. The woman from earlier is stood above his body in an all-black outfit. She presumably saved Abel from being knifed. The scene cuts to the nightclub and Abel, who still has a trail of blood on the side of his face, is dancing with his woman and mouthing along the lyrics to the song  as it plays in the background. Cut to flashing blue lights.
Abel is singing to the track. Him and his girl are seen stood where Murphy the leopard was sat in the area from the first scene.

I beg you

I see that she is beautiful
The most beautiful by far
I see that she makes you feel good 'bout who you are
But you see how much I need you?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?
You see how much I care?
I've been spendin' all my time, livin' for the thrill
All this money that I've thrown
All this liquor that I've spilled
I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress
So when you ask me what I do
All I do is hurt myself
Inspiration is﻿ all I know
Inspiration is all I have
So I deserve this
I deserve your body on my mattress
What do I do now that you're gone?
What do I do when I'm alone?
You've been running in my head
What do I do when﻿ I need sex?
You're my everything
You're my heart
You're my everything
You're my heart
Ooh, I thought I told you, a long time ago
Don't you fall in love

Like meI usually love sleeping all alone
This time around bring your friend with you
But we ain't really going to sleep at all
You ain't gonna catch me with them sneak pictures
In my city I'm a young god
That pussy kill be so vicious
My god white, he in my pocket
He get me redder than the devil 'til I go nauseous
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often
Often, often, girl I do this often
In that thing, switch lane to lane, look like I spent a fortune
Awesome, 100 plus, can't get this from the auction
Need a chick to ride my dick and back it up like parking
Show that pussy, work that pussy
Who that pussy, that's my pussy
Wet that pussy, stroke that pussy
Ooh! I twist the weed
You on your phone texting your friend to come fuck
I wonder if it's the druggies wit hoes or the millions of bucks
But, ask me if I do this everyday you know
I'm ballin', make 80k straight off the plane you know
Trade my grill in for the Bentley or the Range you know
I'm in the studio just tryna get some brains you know
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often

Often, often, girl I do this often

Often
Freakier than freaky, when she climax she make pee pee
Step back like a player, turn my cheek she try to reach me
What you in this for? Another sucker for a whore
Never I, tailored by my new young Anna Wintour
Centerfold attraction, sexual compassion
Often memories are faded, these are everlastin'
Long eyelashes, palmin' her every asset
Often imitated because this life I live is lavish
Bud like a flower, Miami's new Eiffel Tower
Love in the dark to the beat of my heart
She came from the ghetto and now her closet is Neiman
Often the results of the women joinin' my team and dreamin'
Oooh, the sun's risin' up
The night's almost up
The night's almost done
But I see your eyes
You wanna go again
Girl, I'll go again
Girl, I'll go again
She asked me if I do this every day, I said "Often"
Asked how many times she rode the wave, "Not so often"
Bitches down to do it either way, often
Baby I can make that pussy rain, often
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it
Often, often, girl I do this often
Make that pussy pop and do it how I want it

I’ve been cursed with L.U.V
My visions bleed, my memories, of all the times we spent

I can’t believe I didn’t see, this moment come so fast
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place
She needs to clear, clear, clear, my mental space
Now it’s over, baby girl it’s over
I need a cure, to wash my past, all away
Cause it’s over, my mistake to chose her
Need a cure, to wash the past, all away
I let your soul inside of me, and your pain refuse to leave
It’s hard to breath when memories refuse to fade away
Won’t stop when you shut the door, all my life never think you'd go... go
You’ve been swimming through my veins, veins, veins
I need a dream, dream, dream to cure the pain, pain, pain
I need that someone to replace, place, place

Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person 
Tryna act super tough
But inside I'm a twelve-year-old boy
I see you lookin' in a strong way
But I won't give it up
Supermodels, they were all fake
'Cause I never humped
And I know you, I know you want to
But I'm man enough to say to you 
Underneath the lies and the big talk
I've been waiting for a wife
I never watched porn, never did drugs
'Cause I'm terrified
And I know you, you can't believe it's true
But I'm man enough to say to you
I'm a virgin 
Never got close enough
Cell phone blowin' up, but I'm waiting
For the right person 
You wanna hold hands then sign me up
But just know you're not gonna score

Never got close enough
Pure as a dove, and I'm waiting
For the right person

I've been tryna call
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm going through withdrawals
You don't even have to do too much
You can turn me on with just a touch, baby
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey
I've been tryna call 
I've been on my own for long enough
Maybe you can show me how to love, maybe
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
I'm just coming back to let you know 
I could never say it on the phone 
Will never let you go this time 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey
Ooh, I said, ooh
I said, ooh, I said, ooh
Hey, it's me
I know it's been a while, but
I was just thinking about you, and
I'm sorry about everything

No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust

The city's cold and empty
No one's around to judge me
I can't see clearly when you're goneI think I'm fuckin' gone, rollin' on this floor
Messin' up your carpet, I'll get on it after former
More sections of this yak on your floor
Shouldn't fuckin' roll, but I fuckin' roll
Feelin' like a million bucks before
I walk through this door, when I walk through your door
Can't believe I made it, but I made it, that's for sure
For sure, your lovin', I need more, I need yours
She ain't lookin' for that unconditional
What the fuck these bitches on? They want what I'm sippin' on
They don't want my love, they just want my potential
Fuck it, I'll keep sippin' on this, baby livin' off of this
Got me drownin' in your love, you got me drownin' in abyss
Give me wet attention, I'll start drowning from my wrists, wrist
And baby if you need a little more
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you
The feelings I would give to you
You, you, you, you, you, you, youFa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la
It's been a long year
The toughest of my life so far
I've tried to feel cheer
I'm further than the Northern Star
So when you ask me
What I want under the tree
I just want you with me
'Cause if I didn't have you
When the snow is fallin'
On that winter mornin'
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you
When everyone's unwrappin'
No matter what I open
I'd have Christmas blues
Yeah, don't want mistletoes
If I'm not there to hold you close 
A quiet Christmas Eve
Not tryna hear the angеls sing 
If I had onе wish
I'll take you down by the tree
'Cause all I want is you and me
'Cause if I didn't have you
When the snow is fallin'
On that winter mornin'
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you 
When everyone's unwrappin' 
No matter what I open 
I'd have Christmas blues
If I didn't have you 
Oh, oh 
Oh-oh, mm-mm 
I'd have Christmas blues
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la
Fa-la-la-la-la, la-la-la

Lay them on the fuckin' table, we got choices 
And if she wanna fuck my niggas, she got choices
I told her not to fall in love, that shit is pointless

Said I'm gone, I'm gone
We don't need you love no more
I'm goneWhy would you wanna bring somethin' between us?
There's nothin' between us
There's nothin'
You're the reason
You're the reason that I choose to be distant
No one's gonna know that you miss him
It's too late, I don't feel love
And to move
And the reason you do
Even though the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never win my love, no, no
Even if the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never win my love, no
Even if she needs my love, you'll never be sure, no
Oh no, not in love, not in love, no
You would seem real lonely
No reason, oh
No reason, no
Even if the baby is mine
You will never win my love, no
You will never get my love, no, no
Everything you worked on for love
You will never get my love, no
You will never get my love, no, no, no, no, babyI be getting fucked up

So ride it out for me, and take it off for me
It's a good vibe, good vibe, good vibe
Don't you ever threaten niggas with a good time
She wanna buy a dream, I said I don't sell it
But she can rent it for a night, I don't mind, open wide
Cause all this fame, I earned it, I might as well use it
Private elevator goin' straight to my unit
All my niggas 'round me, gettin' kickback pussy
All my killas 'round me, all be hiding in Stussy
Can't nobody stop me, used to be homeless
Now that penthouse at the Ritz where my home is
Tour bus like a National Geographic
Bitches runnin' wild gettin' faded in the bathroom
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
It makes me smile, it makes me smile
Cause I got it
All the pain, sweat and tears, just to get a piece
But now we got it
Man look at the kid now, can nobody stop me?
I don't got a single sober vein in my body
*Wiz laugh*
I got a lotta cash
I don't mind spending it
Do you like the way I flick my tongue or nah?
You can ride my face until you're drippin' cum
Can you lick the tip then throat the dick or nah?
Can you let me stretch that pussy out or nah?
I'm not the type to call you back tomorrow
But the way you wrapping 'round me is a prob
Ain't nobody tryna save ya
Baby, get that paper
Probably got a lot of other bitches owe you favors
Pussy so good, had to save that shit for later
Took her to the kitchen, fucked her right there on the table
She repping XO to the death
I'm tryna make these bitches sweat
I'm tryna keep that pussy wet
I'm tryna fuck her and her friends
You gonna run it for these hunnids, girl, or nah?
Show me, is you really 'bout your money, girl, or nah?
Don't play with a boss, girl, take it all
Take it for a real one, you gon' get it all
Is you really 'bout your money or nah?
Can you really take dick or nah?
Can I bring another bitch or nah?
Is you with the shits or nah?
Oh nah, oh nah

But tonight I'm gon' let you know
Let me tell the truth
Baby, let me tell the truth, yeah
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
You’re scared to be lonely
’Specially in the night
I'm scared that I’ll miss you
Happens every time
I don't want this feelin'
I can't afford love
I try to find a reason to pull us apart
It ain’t workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause, baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
I'm finding time to catch a wave
Hop in the car with you
Hoping to find the time to feel good
Wanna fight less, wanna build more
Wanna be your type, change your world
Share your life, be the only girl
Who got you tripping and moving like you don't know me
I put the bitch in position, she really owe me
Nah to 9 to 5, we do this all the time
Will you call me when I'm on your mind
Baby, can you
You know what I'm thinkin'
See it in your eyes
You hate that you want me
Hate it when you cry
It ain't workin' 'cause you're perfect
And I know that you're worth it
I can't walk away, oh!
Even though we're going through it
And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah

And it makes you feel alone
Just know that I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah
The distance and the time between us
It'll never change my mind, 'cause baby
I would die for you
Baby, I would die for you, yeah To my fans
I want to thank you for listening and being patient for as long as you have. No matter what an artist's ego clouds them to believe, you are the reason why I have been able to continue to do what I love to do and that is to entertain you. My journey for inspiration may seem like masochism to others who have not been given the task to make art, but best believe it brings me nothing but joy
Because I am a man of few words, I chose to make a viral video to show you how I felt and where I stand. I usually don't like to 'spoon feed' my audience because I grew up idolizing story tellers who told stories using symbolism, so it was in my nature to do the same. The 'Rolling Stone' video takes place in a dimly lit studio which represents the two worlds I have been stuck in. The gloomy side represents the mainstream world while the other represents the underground. The girl holding on represents you. As the world slowly gets familiar with my face the more you will lose interest . The camera lights symbolize the crossover, and when they begin to flash I look away from the underground. Even though I don't want to, it is a step that I feel I must take to evolve as an artist
This predicament is impossible to relate to unless you are put in that unique situation. I want you to know and understand that this does not mean what you think it means, and I made sure of that in my deal. You will continue to get what you fell in love with, and I will continue to give you what you ask for. I'll never make you wait again. With that being said expect more from me very soon leading up to 'Trilogy'. Thank you again for your patience and loyalty, I will not disappoint
Sincerely
Abel Tesfaye XOWoo, ooh, ah
Woo, ooh, ah
Woo, ooh, ah
Woo, ooh, ah

Gimme head all night, cum four times
Baby girl just wanna smoke a pound
Do some, do some
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell your friends about it 
Go tell 'em what you know, what you seen
How I roll, how I be on the low
Go tell your friends about it

A single teardrop falling from your eye
I don't know why I run away 
I make you cry when I run away 
You could've asked me why I broke your heart
You could've told me that you fell apart
But you walked past me like I wasn't there
And just pretended like you didn't care
I don't know why I run away
I make you cry when I run away
Take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
Save your tears for another day
I made you think that I would always stay, yeah
I said some things that I should never say
Yeah, I broke your heart like someone did to mine
And now you won't love me for a second time
I don't know why I run away , oh, girl
Said I make you cry when I run away
Girl, take me back 'cause I wanna stay
Save your tears for another
I realize that I'm much too late
And you deserve someone better
Save your tears for another day 
Save your tears for another day, ooh, girl
I said save your tears for another day
Tears for another day
Girl, I said save your tears for another day
Save your tears for another day
Save your tears for anotherYeah
Yo intenté llamar
Llevo mucho sola, la verdad
Maybe tú me enseñas cómo amar
Maybe
Ya no consumo na' 
Y tú no tendrás que hacer too much
Si me rozas ya me encenderás
Bebé
I look around and
Sin City's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Hey, hey, hey
I'm running out of time
'Cause I can see the sun light up the sky
So I hit the road in overdrive, baby, oh
The city's cold and empty 
No one's around to judge me 
I can't see clearly when you're gone
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
I said, ooh, I'm drowning in the night
Oh, when I'm like this, you're the one I trust
Y en verdad yo te volví a llamar 
Porque tengo algo que contar 
No te voy a soltar this time 
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touch
Hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey
Y llega, duermo con la luz abierta
Esperando pa' que vengas
Prefiero 'tar a tu vera
Y llega, duermo con la luz abierta
Esperando pa' que vengas
Prefiero 'tar a tu vera
I said, ooh, I'm blinded by the lights
No, I can't sleep until I feel your touchMedicate my soul with your lips, I need
I need to forget that my love's at peace
With another man who respects and treats
Treats her with a trust, and honesty
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
Make me come alive, I just want to breathe
I've been up for days, I just want to sleep
Please relieve the stress, got me on my knees
So heal me with your warmth, give yourself to me
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just want to feel again, again
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
Oh, oh
Oh
She said, "This is for your eyes
For your eyes only
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only"
But I just wanna feel again, again
This is for your eyes
For your eyes only, oh, yeah

        We found each other
I helped you out of a broken place
You gave me comfort
But falling for you was my mistake
I put you on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
Call out my name when I kiss you so gently
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of love?
Won't you call out my name? 
Girl, call out my name, and I'll be on my way and
I'll be on my—
I said I didn't feel nothing, baby, but I lied
I almost cut a piece of myself for your life
Guess I was just another pit stop
'Til you made up your mind
You just wasted my time
You were on top, I put you on top
I claimed you so proud and openly, babe
And when times were rough, when times were rough
I made sure I held you close to me
So call out my name 
So call out my name when I kiss you so gently 
I want you to stay 
I want you to stay even though you don't want me
Girl, why can't you wait? 
Girl, why can't you wait 'til I fall out of loving?
Babe, call out my name 
Just call out my name and I'll be on my way
Girl, I'll be on my—
On my way, all the way
On my way, all the way, ooh
On my way, on my way, on my way

But I kept you beside me
And if I held you back, at least I held you close
Should have known you were lonely
I know things will never be the same
Time we've lost will never be replaced
I'm the reason you forgot to love
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
You always miss the chance to fall for someone else
'Cause your heart only knows me
They try to win your love, but there was nothing left
They just made you feel lonely 
Well, I am not the man I used to be
Did some things I couldn't let you see
Refuse to be the one who taints your heart
So don't be scared to live again
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the start
I should have made you my only
When it's said and done
Woah-oh-woah
So don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again
No, don't be scared to live again, baby
Be scared to live again 
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
I've been praying that you find yourself
I hope you know that, I hope you know that
We fell apart, right from the startGirl I'm faded girl I'm fuckin' faded
I don't see two of you I see you naked
Too much smoke in here my focus gone
Misses flower bomb come get your lotus on
You just want the drugs I just want the high
I'm seeing all of your issues from the pain all in your eyes
I can get you through yo problems girl
This that up top but ill start off from the bottom girl
Say you love me I know you love me girl
Take this sip it slow tell me you love me girl
Dont judge me girl
I'm a keep sipping Texas til you touch me girl
Faded too long
Now I'm on this rolling stone
I just can't leave it alone
It feels too much like home girl

Before they all loved me
They want that XO shit well I got that XO shit
That'll make you XO quickLyrics from snippet
Girl, it's okay, you can call me by my real name
I kiss your legs, I kiss your eyes, I call you "Angel face"
And I've been single for half a decade
And I think I'm finally ready to settle down for like a bit
Until I hit the stage
And you got money, that's the last thing running through your mind
We always joke, but you can tell when you look me in my eyes
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
That I want you, that I want you, that I want you, babe
Come to my city, I like to say, I'm living pretty nice
4000 square feet at the Trump above the city lights

Yeni bir savaş için daima hazırım
Bu yoldan tekrar inmeye
Her şeyiyle aynı
Daima hazırım bir yaşam söndürmeye
Biliyorsun ki devam edeceğim
Her şeyiyle aynı
Söylesene kim beni kendimden kurtaracak
Tek bildiğim şey bu hayat iken
Söylesene beni bu cehennemden kim kurtaracak
Sensiz ben tamamen yalnızım
Kim benim için dua edecek
Benim acımı kim üstlenecek
Ruhumu kim kurtaracak
Gördüğün üzere yapayalnızım
Eğer senin için öleceksem
Eğer senin için öldüreceksem
O halde bu kanı senin için akıtmış olacağım
Dünyayla savaşırım seninle savaşırım kendimle savaşırım
Tanrıyla savaşırım, sadece söyle bana, daha ne kadar yük kaldı
Acıyla ve fırtınalarla savaşıyorum bugün ağladığım
Kapımın eşiğine seller gibi gelen, göz yaşlarımla savaşırım
Hayat yaşayan bir cehennem, sokaklarda kan birikintileri
Binanın tepesindeki nişancılar, hükümetin yardımı çare değil
Deprem, ceset düşüyor, yer yarılıyor
Yoksul dumanlı ciğerlerini ve Scarface'i kabul ediyor
Kimin bir kahramana ihtiyacı var?
Senin bir kahramana ihtiyacın var, aynaya bak, kahramanın orada duruyor
Hedefin ortasında kim en ön saflarda?
Zor zamanlar iğneyi patlatsa bile kalbim hiçbir ritimi aksatmaz
Büyük yıkım ve büyük yolsuzluk
Acı çeken adamların ruhları
Duymayan kulaklara sıkıca tutunuyor, dünyanın sonu yakın
Bunların hepsi kehanet ve çoğunluğun iyiliği için ben kurban olacaksam öyle olsun
Kim benim için dua edecek
Benim acımı kim üstlenecek
Ruhumu kim kurtaracak
Gördüğün üzere yapayalnızım
Eğer senin için öleceksem
Eğer senin için öldüreceksem
O halde bu kanı senin için akıtmış olacağım
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Kim benim için dua edecek
Benim acımı kim üstlenecek
Ruhumu kim kurtaracak
Gördüğün üzere yapayalnızım
Eğer senin için öleceksem
Eğer senin için öldüreceksem
O halde bu kanı senin için akıtmış olacağım
İnancımın yok olması durumunda, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
Kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
İnancımın yok olması durumunda, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım
Kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağım, kendi yasalarıma göre yaşayacağımLonely-lone, lonely-lone
Lonely-lone, lonely-lone
I got somethin' to tell you but don't know how I'ma say it
I guess that I can only say one thing
Girl I've been bad again
Girl I've been bad again
'Cause with this money comes problems
And with these problems come solutions
And I use 'em, when I'm faded I forget
Forget what you mean to me
Hope you know what you mean to me

From her dress
She has no confidence
She fears His holiness
Her life is nothing but a test
Cause the Bible commands her to resist the things she most appreciates
So she hides all her demons with her makeup
Hoping that he'll open the gates

High heels open toes
Shes hardly wearing any clothes
She's got her confideant
Her friend don't like men
But does what Evelyn says
And right beside her bedside
In a miniskirt that isn't ever hers
They may call it the bedside
It's the only side I hope she preserves

CoolAsk around about her
She don't get emotional
Kill off all her feelings
That's why she ain't approachable
She know her pussy got a fanbase
A couple niggas with a suitcase
Suit and tie niggas who play roleplay
When it comes to money she play no games
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting
She rather die in the club, till she
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
Six feet under she gon' get that fucking paper
You know how she get down, pop her for a check now
She don't depend on anybody
Know just what to do with her own body
Counting all that money like a hobby
She don't give a fuck about nobody
And she got her whole crew poppin'
And she bend it over like she got no back bone
Got a couple niggas blinging up a trap phone
She don't need nobody waiting back home, she got it
She lick it up just like a candy
She wanna make them leave their family
She trying to live a life so fancy
She wanna pull up in a Bentley
She ain't got time for lovin'
Louis Vuitton her husband
She rather die in lusting

Girl, I know you gotta put that body on me
Girl, 
Girl, I know you  sittin' Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
I had a good girl in my room, no tats on her skin
I put work all in her purse, she got guilt all in her grin
And I swear it be the same, every fuckin' where that I been
All you girls try to be saints, I’ll make you roll with a sinner, well
You can come to my hotel, you can bring me a friend
You can dress up like twins, I can teach you some French
Paper planes full of kush, a couple cups full of gin
Don't know what city I'm in, wake up and do it again
And if you know me well, I don't like to talk
But when I make a move, you know it's loud as fuck
And if you wanna scream, get loud as fuck baby
I can tell you've earned a bit of deconstruction
A little bit, a little bit, ooh yeah... ooh Lord
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeah
Do you feel like you'll come back around?
Does it make you strong?
Do you feel like you can take the planet on? Oh girl
Did I seem to give you a little bit more love?
To your gloomy life, to your empty life
Little life, little lie, oh yea
Do you feel like you got your money's worth?
Cause if you did this round's on me
Just promise that you'll come back to me
Feed me, baby, feed me, baby
Your hesitation speaks to me louder than million words per minute
I was born to this life you're living, in this game, oh yeah
Said nothing will ever be... ever be the same, when you're finished
I freed a couple of souls, just yesterday, ooh yeahWhen a shot turns a stare into a smile
And smiles into removals of a dress
She got confidence, and her mind is so strong
And she's been loaded like a gun
And the Bible compels her to resist the thing she most appreciates
And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face
Hannah is free , free , free 
Hannah is free , free , free 
Hannah is , Hannah and Evelyn 
Hannah and Evelyn , Hannah and Evelyn 
Her lips, so cold, high heels, open toes
Hardly wearing any clothes
She's got confidant, this friend don't like men
But does what Evelyn says
And the Bible compels her to resist the thing she most appreciates
And she hide all the demons with her makeup
Painting lies all on her face
Hannah is free , free , free 
Evelyn's free , free , free 
Evelyn's , Hannah and Evelyn 
Hannah and Evelyn , Hannah and Evelyn 
Evelyn's , Hannah and Evelyn 
Hannah and Evelyn , Hannah and Evelyn 
Evelyn's , Hannah and Evelyn 
Hannah and Evelyn , Hannah and Evelyn 
Evelyn's , Hannah and Evelyn 
Hannah and Evelyn , Hannah and Evelyn 
These girls keep touching on they bodies, ooh, yeah
These girls keep touching on they bodies, ooh, yeah
I think that they should get acquainted
Like "Hi, what's your name and your agent?"
These girls born in nineties are dangerous
So let's all get faded
These girls keep touching on they bodiesEverything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Oh yeah, uh
But baby, let's face it, I'm not into dating
I haven't been patient
Ever since I been famous my time has been racing
My motives are basic, this life I've been chasing
These hearts I've been breaking
And these girls I been tasting don't never get naked
Just put it in a ponytail, fuck 'em from behind
Fuck 'em with their clothes on, panties to the side
Put the panties to the side, like a don do
Get it wet, let it slide like a sunroof
Got goals, got dreams, got hoes, got cribs
Got niggas that'll die for a prince
Got my city on lock, XO 'til the death
Left town in a coach, came back in a jet
Come through, I'm not living like I did before
Come through, um, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, oh yeah
Oh, come through
I've been out there puttin' down that work
Come through, oh yeah, I said come through
Everything I said I'd do, I did
Come through, come through, ohhI don't wanna touch the sky no more, ooh 
I just wanna feel the ground when I'm coming down
