Don’t nobody understand me though
Tahj Money
The way I came in the game
The image that I had put out
They wouldn't expect me to have feelings
Know it probably don't seem like it
That’s why they talk about me like I ain't human, but we all is
But I'm still being me
I'm still in the streets and I'm still thuggin' until them niggas put me under, yeah
That's how we livin' and that's how we going out, you hear me? Open your mouth

I ain't know my age, he was 16, they killed Lil Dave
Mind in a rage, I'm way too young to feel this pain
I ain't know how to fade, but I dove in 'cause I'm a man
I love that girl to death, as we get old, our feelings change
I pay for therapy because my thoughts ahead of me
They keep on draggin' me, I play for keeps, they scared of me
I cannot barely, can barely sleep or even breathe
I cannot hold on without you on side of me
I never knew this fame would take the ones I love from ‘way from me
I wanna see Kacey bad, but I can't seem to call Nene
Go in with no pen and pad, I got this shit right on my sleeve
Right now my candle burning wax, I'm feelin' like it's burnin' me
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I fell in love with Kaylyn, without even knowin' this bitch done snaked me
I'm missin' Yaya daily, the one who don't make me feel basic
Happiness I'm chasin', while killers behind me tryna blank me
You don't know what I'm feelin'
Or what I'm thinkin' and you can't change me
I miss my fuckin' daddy, I've been callin' Montana my father
Times been gettin' harder
I came from nothing, now bitch, I'm royal
I call Monique my mama, but Lord knows I need Sheronda
I don't need no commas, I'm feeling like I'm going under
My paw-paw getting old, and once he gone, I'm on my own
Right now I'm all alone, I pray that grandmom keep me strong
Can't even leave my home, my bracelet beeping plus I'm down
I just wan' be gone, my son straight, my money long
Tell me what you feelin', I hope that I can help you out
My youngins in that North, I pray that y'all gon' make it out
These bitches comin' 'round, and they don't even like my songs
I'll burn up the town, before them niggas bust my dome
I wish that I can hear Dump say, "What up, lil brother," one more time
We killing shit and plus we dying
I'm gon' go off behind my brother, fuck this charge, I slang that iron
Before he go and I don't ride
I'm just a lonely child
Who wants someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, this pain away
Because my head been runnin' wild, wild
I'm just a lonely child
Who need someone to help him out, oh, oh, ah, ah
Take this pain away, my pain away
Because my thoughts been runnin' wild

Through a window I couldn't see out all I heard was some thunder
On the phone with Lashonda, she told me ashtray was dead on the corner
Started sayin' to myself I gotta get out this jungle
When them niggas killed my cousin mane that shit made me wonder
I keep a burner I refuse to let them boys put me up under
Come pour up with a real nigga
Light one up for them real niggas
I know Boozilla still with me
Yeah, I know Lil' Dave still with me
I know my grandma still with me, while I'm chasing after this mill ticket
I know my grandma still with me, while I'm chasing after this mill ticket
I hop out get the bustin' before I let myself die
Starin' down the barrel just like lookin' in your eye
Take one mine I'll make sure that we all cry
Take one of mine I swear that we gon' all cry
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Top shottah, big mon, big mon
Fah mi fi dead, we don't spare none, spare none
Dive in that water with no vest on
Only thing I got is my teflon
Watch out I bet I stretch some
Watch out I bet I stretch some
See me in that Benz, hop out that Benz and they hatin'
You can run up on me and gon' catch one to the face
Pussyhole saw me and he went the other way
I'm like wha gwan we can do it anyday
And they hatin'
Pussy hoe saw me and he went the other way
Like wha gwan we can do it anyday
I'm like whatup? we can do it anyday
For some reason I have visions of someone splittin' my wig
Lord, please forgive me, for all the things that I done did
Mom, I'm sorry for being a bad kid
I hope you forgive me and pray for me til' the endYeah, this for everybody who...
Who lost someone to the streets, or to the system
I catch myself feelin' down from people talkin' 'bout me
They don't even know me though
'Round 2005, when I wrote my first rhyme
When I first started I wanted to quit so many times
My brother told me "Trell, you ain't gotta tell no lies"
Went from the ground to my prime, now I'm on the rise
Could see the pain in my eyes but I always smile
Despite the hate, that's on my child I'll never stop
My mama asked me "Son, how it feel to be on top?"
Always had that hustler ambition since I was a child
I drop my nuts and be a man, they don't understand
No matter what I tell my fans, they don't know who I am
They criticize me and don't know me, I don't give a damn
I tell my sons that I love 'em every time I see 'em
My family talk about me, I just act like I don't hear 'em
A nigga ever cross me, swear that I wouldn't wanna be him
I'm from the streets, put you to sleep and I won't shed a tear
So when it's beef, my niggas creep, no they won't let you live
I remember everything lil' Dave said
The image of them killin' you stuck in my head
Forever thuggin', on my brother I ain't scared
I'm screamin' "Fuck em!" they gon' miss me when I'm dead
I told my girl that I love her, please don't change on me
I speak the truth, bae I'm for you, I'll put a ring on it
I tell you everything, honestly 'cause you my homie
I'll put a shield over yo' back whenever it be stormin'
My love for you, I let 'em know, yeah
Me and you, we gon' grow old, yeah
You down for me, and that I know, yeah
What we don't tell, they don't know, yeah
Up in these streets I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' hand
How can they change up on me?
So many needs so I'm workin' hard, no sleep
Yeah I'ma make it, yeah I know 'cause I believe
Could be in jail but in yo' mind you free
Right or wrong, that's yo' decision, accept it and you run with that
I'm with you then I'm with you, I won't change, it ain't none of that
I ain't gotta prove a thing, if you play me then I'm dumpin' that
Hop up in my spaceship, I'm gone, I ain't comin' back
They say "You don't know what you got until it's gone" and I see...
That I'm gone and I ain't comin' back
Got it on my own, I stayed strong and I got what I believed
Man I swear that I ain't comin' back
Told me that you with me and you lied to me
If you my nigga, you my nigga, you gon' ride for me
If you my girl, when it's time, you'd testify for me
I'd die for you, so in return you should die for me
Up in these streets, I done seen so many things
Swear I'm so young for to have so much pain
I ain't have nothin', I had to make it through the rain
They changed on me but man I swear that I won't change
Right now I'm workin' for to be a better man
Ain't have no father, so I had to take a stand
They ain't with me if they ain't feelin' what I'm sayin'
Get up, go get it, you don't need no helpin' handI'm all who you say I a-a-am
Yessir
Thug nigga from the trenches never had a heart
Drug dealer, contract killer, loyal from the start 
I put that dope dick down on shawty, I've been servin' raw
They say I'm pussy and they say I'm fake but I say
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
Got into it with my bitch, caught up while I'm tourin'
Tryna see if shawty on my dick, wonder what she doin'
You know me, real G, I text ask her, "How it's goin'"
She responded nothin', lookin' like to me you havin' fun
Look for my mama when I try to look inside my woman
Told my bae, "I wish I woulda found you back when I was bummin'"
Stayed away from all the bullshit, them niggas said I'm runnin'
Time passed over now you see that I was chasin' money
Posted on Maryland, me and Von, his mama tearin' just once
Know you seen up in the parish, like check it out that's my lil' youngin'
Nigga don't wanna sell me a brick of dope, act like my money funny
Damn what you sayin' gangsta, you gon' make me take it from you
Some hoes say I'm handsome, some of them they say I'm ugly
Some say that I'm the realest but I still ain't sayin' nothin'

Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah 
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Tryna run me up a check, late nights, early mornings
Diamonds 'round my neck, they really wet, I could've copped a foreign
Givenchy shoes, I came a long way from Ralph Lauren
Cut off my ex because my new bitch put that pussy on me
They watchin' every move I make, I guess I'm settin' trends
I had to focus on the check, told myself, "Fuck a friend"
Committed crimes so many times but I don't give a damn
I are who you say I am
Posted on high street, me and roof 'cause we been really thuggin'
Convicted felon with a dirty pistol, bitch I'm steady clutchin'
No drama sittin' in my cell like check out my lil' cousin
Can't trust these hoes because I know they come a dime a dozen
RIP to Quahfee, know my nigga at them Heaven gates
She ain't never really made love, I'm him just like Kevin Gates
20 of 'em comin', I switched to another spot
Reversible stock carbon, a new convertible drop
I was gambling with shawty, I put some work on the block
I tested her, she held a lil' quarter bird at her spot
I ain't into bustin' down a Rollie, bustin' down on bales
Don't wanna fuck me, I won't argue baby, oh well
The 18 Willard, the lever get 'em movin' mils
Millionaire dollar bond in 30 minutes and I made bail
I graduated, the square's outta town, at the room cookin' at the hotel 
Aux is outta reach, I'ma move the race car 
Hated on us and they know who they are
Still livin' large as I aim for the stars
I'm a BreadWinner don and I came from the slums
I got a stain on my arm, weather through the storm
If I tell you that I love you then you can't do nothin' wrong
Surrounded by steppers, I got control in this bitch
I'll book you for a show and get you showed in this bitch
Tell that curb boy Trell I love you with all my heart
Now we ride around in Wraiths with a push button start 
Cause I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-eh
Shittin' on 'em, I just switched from a Wraith to a Lamb,' yeah-eh-eh
I upgraded from nobody to the one who the man, yeah 
I'm all who you say I am, yeah-eh-ehYoungboy
Last life
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't right
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life
For so long, I been striving, going hard, tryna make it right
So much pain in my body, know you can see it in my eyes
You say that you was with me, promised that you was down to ride
Now when I look around, you ain't no where by my side
Hurt me so deep, but it's okay, I'm on my grind
I got two sons, I'm just 16, can't waste my time
Straight from the bottom, to the top, I gotta climb
That boy say that he don't like me, tell him fall in line
Soul survivor, I won't stop, yeah I'ma grind for it
I'm from Baton Rouge, Louisiana, I done came far
Whole lot of diamonds around my neck, yeah I'm shining hard
I'm sixteen, driving in all these exotic cars
And I don't owe nobody shit, but my mama boy
And my niggas, cause they the one's who behind me boy
Remember I ain't have none to eat, I had to go steal for it
Show you my bank account, I swear I got 6 figures large
Niggas 'round me, they hatin', prolly was snakin' for it
These niggas under disguise, livin' under the board
I guess these niggas they was made for it, but there's
No mistake he play, gon' die cause I ain't going for it
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride
Gotta stay down and get it, I know that it's gon' be alright
Can't get knocked off my pivot, I gotta play my cards right
Gotta stack up them benji's, my nigga we gon' ball for life
Aye, I can't even lie I really miss my daddy
Can't trip bout you leaving me
Wasn't for you, this wouldn't happened
Woke up with a opportunity to feed my family
My limit the stars and I wanna grab it
Yeah I just wanna grab it
I'm on a whole 'nother level right now
In this life that I'm livin', I pray I make it through the night
As I ride through my city, I'm thinkin', lookin' at the lights
For so long, we was hurtin', I got the chance to make it right
Plenty times you done hurt me, I done been all alone tonight
They claim that they with me, but shit I know that they ain't ride

Young nigga shit
Bitch, gang, gang, blatt, blatt, hrrr
38 Baby
Without no coat I was walkin' and meditatin' in the rain
Reminiscing about bein' in prison, I was locked in them chains
Without no drugs I was workin' and stimulatin' my brain
I ain't gotta act how I was actin', everything done changed
I was missing out on plenty shit, just watchin' time fly past
I was broke, down on my dick, I had to get me a bag
Havin' shootouts broad day and we was runnin' from task
I put my flex down, never sit down, I told that bitch I'll never stand down
Creepin' on your block with a hundred rounds
Go to shoot and try to run
Hop out the whip and we gon' run you down
Shoot him dead up his head, knock off his dreads
Now he can't make a sound
Kill him where he stand, we live by law and we gon' lay it down
Tell me he want smoke, 187, that's that same shit
.357 send you to hell, knock out your brain quick
Sippin' on this drank, RIP Fredo, this that bang shit
Doin' the same thing, time pass, got a bitch with a fat ass
I told her turn around and bust it open
That Soulja Slim, that C Murder, come in the tank just like a No Limit soldier

When I hit him with this Glock I bet I fold him
None of these niggas ain't never play with me
Play with me, I bet you see
Fuck that Twitter beefin', you want beef, I pull up where you sleep
Bitch I'm out the North, 38 Baby, I come from the streets
Two clips on that chopper for to stretch you when we fuckin' meet
Got 'em all boxed in at the location, the police movin' in
People tryna catch me with a pistol just to turn me in
Same shit you did to go to jail, don't do that shit again
Bitch I'm screamin' fuck it, never change, thuggin' to the end
I got a question, tell me what these niggas hatin' for?
Why they steady sayin' they gon' snatch my chain though?
You want to rap, how you gon' think without a brain though?
Take gunpowder out a bullet, put some crack, now this that 'caine flow
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose 
I'ma hit 'em with this bitch and watch 'em overdose 
Overdose, I kill 'em slow
What's the 4-1-1, they know I be, I be 'bout whatever
You ain't got no bodies, you ain't 'bout it, boy you are not a stepper
You play with me, bitch ain't no hidin', ain't nobody can help you
Send your ass to the devil, in an envelope like a letter
Got an FN with a clip with different colors up in it

Off the flap I ain't gotta smile in nobody face
Y'all tell me 'bout all y'all problems, y'all don't ask how I'm feelin' huh?
Bitch I been feelin' like I'm finna die, bitch I cry alone
This for all, this for all them young niggas who gone
And all the people who miss they babies, you heard me?
Fuck everybody who ain't mine, y'all ain't making my life no betta, gang
Young nigga fillin' up his arm with some heroin
He was abandoned as a child screamin', "Red rum"
You spell it backwards, what that mean? Nigga, murder
Livin' wrong and right, trustin' nobody 'til his time come
Batty bwoy if you cross I'ma take your life
I'm full of drugs so I'ma die if I get caught tonight
Tell my lil' brother and my sons it's gon' be alright
NBA until the end, it's a way of lifeAnd I hope, I hope everyone
Everyone I have been in a relationship with
Find someone that make them more happy than I ever did
Even tho I know you bullshitin'
And be like you don't
But I know you love me
Slatt
When it all comes down, I been here for too long
And I still can't believe that I didn't moved on 
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late
You ain't gotta move on
I done found another girl who ain't mad about the names on my face
I guess my home wasn't a home
I'll accept the fact if another man up in my place
You ain't gotta try to fix it, I ain't worried about it
And if you looking for your shit it's on the curb bout it
Bought a water meter and it's way off the meter
Yo' love is plain, Tell that hoe I don't need her
Told me to stop but drink still in my liter
Hope when you come that I be gone, I don't wanna see you
Forever I'll stay the same but I can't no mo'
Forever ducking your presence till I can't no mo'
And I remain the same with a big sack 
Said don't buy no car but I done bought a big 'bach 
They say my ex been looking for me
Where she at 
Tell her leave a message, Imma' call that bitch back 
And bae I love you
Never did you wrong but Imma leave like a thug do
And I'm regretting the fact that I even touched you
Even though you said fuck me it’s never fuck you 
When it all come down I been here for too long 
And I still can't believe I didn't moved on 
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late
I put my life on the line
I ain't never give fuck what no anybody had to say
And if them people try to come and pick me up
Tell them bitches before they come in here I'm blowing out my brains
Cause I don't know
How you would let pride come in here and catch me slipping
I always knew you would leave any day
How the fuck I ever  put myself in this position
Fake friend follow you, you follow back
But I been knew you was like that
I don't want to see it so I block you
I don't care bout that
Aye look mane the hook tell it all
When it all come down I been here for too long
And I still can't believed I done moved on
Ain't no sign of love
It done ran away without no trace
I ain't for you no more, you ain't gotta come back it's too late
I put my life on the line
I ain't never give fuck what no anybody had to say
And if them people try to come and pick me up
Tell them bitches before they come in here I'm blowing out my brains
I'll do life for you, Why the fuck can I see that you wouldn't do the samePlayboy on this bitch but he ain't playin' though
Go, now I can't be saved
No matter what I do they say that I'm wrong
Everybody postin' shit that could put me in a cage
That shit so hurtful they gon' drag me 'til they see me go
When they bring up my name they gon' speak on the problems
How the fuck I'm gon' know that she lovin' somebody?
How the fuck you gon' say I'm beatin' on somebody?
'Fore I tend to that shit I'd step on somebody
I got money to make, I just gotta deposit
I'ma hop on a beat like a vet, I'ma ride it
Everything that you say it you know that I got it
I come from the streets, I'm not worried 'bout nobody
It's enough that I'm here by myself and you know how to touch me
Trust gon', thought you loved me
You postin' that shit so you really sayin' fuck me
Keep tellin' me shit like they tryna corrupt me
I ain't do not a thing, that's a regular problem
Everyday gettin' cussed out by my mama
Herpes in my blood and that shit got me cryin'
I really got feelings, you see without science
Somebody ain't real, I'ma cut my alliance
I been through this shit now they tryna rewind it
I bury my dirt now they tryna go find it
Confirm everything, they'll never confide it
While they focus on this and children out here dyin'
But they say I promote it, they say I slang iron
They done said plenty shit, that was time after time
But I know what I know, motherfuck all the lies
I see I cannot change my time, what's left?
And I know they do not care, they gon' ride the wave 
And you see I do not care, gave her everything
Fuck everybody changed and fuck all these niggas ain't true to the game
Motherfuck what they on, shoot 'em all in their body
I'm only 18 and they talk like I'm 80
Never knew it'd be this, startin' to hate that I made it
I don't fuck with that ho, I don't care 'bout that baby
If you cheated you cheated, go fuck him again
On my soul if I could I'd kill him again
Nigga do what you want 'cause you never could win
All this money in my arm and I focused on friends
And they not a friend, if they let you do that and embarrass yourself
I won't say that I did it and perish myself
If I go back to jail that's 10 on my belt
You can't say that I don't 'cause you how that I felt
When it come down to you I don't care 'bout myself
When you given attention, you're killin' yourself
Stop respondin', play the hand that you're dealt
'Cause you know I feel like fuck 'em and I'm thuggin' for real
'Cause I know, if I fuck up my judge gon' touch me for real
So after tonight I ain't postin' nothin' else
Cherish my life with a plaque on the shelf
The love that I got, I'ma wait 'til it melt
Rather knock someone down before they'd help, bitch
Man fuck the media, how the fuck y'all keep slanderin' my name, I'm 18
Bitch I don't think I did nothin' that wrong

Feelin' like I'm from MoroccoI swear I'm traumatized, whoa
I'm caught up in that fire
I swear I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride
Percs and molly in my casket so I can roll in heaven
Get a bad bitch up out of Magic, need a ho in heaven
I need me a TEC and I need me a stick, have a shootout with the devil
No weed up in my kingdom, Ben said that he need a seven, let's go
Cheat on my girl, I'ma fuck on that ho
If I go broke I'ma stick up a store
If you got to school, go strapped with a pole
Better not let a nigga come step on you, no
Got brand new shoes, don't step on my toes
I'm ready to fight with a nigga or ho
I leave out the class 'cause I gotta go
I'm gettin' head in the bathroom
They always talk 'bout me, no they don't know 'bout me
Gotta pray before I sleep, the devil talk to me
Gotta get 'em out my dreams, 'fore he take over me
Get down on my knees, like Lord don't cancel me
I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my prideYung Lan on the track

This Is The Sound
I felt like I can do it all, so I ain't want no help
I always thought that I can fall, I was scared of myself
I never trusted none of y'all 'cause I was worried 'bout death
So many people not around who said they stay, but they left
I keep my bible on my right and keep my Glock on my left
I thought that human's feelings fake, so when they say, I ain't care
Now I'm regettin' that I ain't say, I never told how I felt
I'ma do my shit until these bitches get so mad that they melt
I see these bitches start to change soon as the fame appealin'
Go against the grain, I'll bust yo' brain
Won't say the pain I'm feelin'
You changed yo' clique, I stayed the same, my niggas hang a nigga
My nigga ain't won't bust his brain but them prices temptin'

Before I sleep, though, I think everything you was sayin'
I was too deep, though, she ain't understand who I am
I'm in the streets, though, I came a long way from the can
Memories keep me happy, so I'm doin' my dance
She here for me, though, I told her, "Hit me up when you land,"
And she so street, though, I filled her bank account up with bands
I feel I can't tho', she always tell me that I can
She all for me, she said, "Let's rock and roll," I don't give a damn
You know that I'm thuggin', you know that I'm with it, you talk to them bitches and say how I'm livin'
You let all of them hoes fuck with yo' mind and go against me and you listen
Life on the line, cases still pendin'
But I stole a car, we still spinnin'
Talkin' to you, 'fore you left, you was in it
We gon' hit the gas soon as I spit it
Warm it up, wanna ass 'til they feel it
Want smoke, give 'em gas, I feel it

You’ll never make me lose
So why you bragging on me?
Your ways was cruel, I was fooled
I was too blind for to see
My I.D. cover the news
Seems only trouble I keep
You was the one I would choose
Choose for to be there for me
Can't tell me not to do this because I do what I want
We came up out the street
Straight from the block selling raw
She said, she never would leave
Soon as she left it was hard
I wanted her here with me
She left me out with my boys
But I say, "That’s okay"
Protect my heart with that rod
I’m running far out your reach
I mean as far as the stars
Might have to cancel my cards
Don't come out after dark
I see she won't leave me ‘lone
She slashed the tires on my car
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna
Forever we get it, I'm sick of these bitches, they flow in my head, ah
We be chasing the riches, however you want it
Aim straight for the head, ah
And she know that I love her, she want me to cuff her
I think she’ll hurt me, I never would let her
I'm sending condolences inside of a letter
Still trappin' like Griselda
No, it ain't safe in these streets, all alone, ah
No, we don't play, keep that heat, we take his soul, ah
Even though when I’m wrong, I ain't never gon' lie
If I feel that I owe you, I'm gon' make it right
I'll be thuggin' and keepin' my head to the sky
Double back on a lap by myself and I cry
In the bed while I'm dreaming behind you I die
Before that can happen, I let off that fire
Trappin' and rappin', we shoot to the top
After I'm asking "Can we have a child?"
After heartbreak, I’ll cut off relations
But I be thinkin' 'bout you on the daily
Tell my niggas what up and they say that I'm crazy
Remember wit' you all them hoes, they hatin'
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, oh
Dirty Iyanna, no
Dirty Iyanna, Dirty Iyanna
Dirty IyannaYeah
Swiff D
I like this
Go
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold-blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north
But I say "All well, all praise to my god"
Left a stain in the street when we spittin' out the car
Red bandana tied 'round the rod
Hope my girl could forgive me livin' life like a star
All red bottoms lookin' like I walked on the scene
Homicide diamonds with the pistol
Young nigga came up still runnin' from the system
Caught his homeboys stealin' out the pack so he clipped 'em
Feelin' down, need somebody for to lift him
He been fightin' with his girl 'cause he say that they don't feel him 
Momma say that he got drugs in his system 
New image, old me, said they missed him
How the fuck I'm supposed to act when my father in prison
Tell another nigga listen, back then I ain't listen
Real Blood with some young niggas 'round me Crippin'
With some old heads out of jail leave a nigga missin'
Lot of money but they still don't understand how I'm livin'
From the streets to the can, either way I'm livin'
Boomer rip a nigga up  one second in a minute
Tell a nigga hit me up if he really got tension
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north
But I say "All well, all praise to my god"
Left a stain in the street when we spittin' out the car
Red bandana tied 'round the rod
Hope my girl could forgive me livin' life like a star
What I say? Press the button in the door, open up
Let my nigga out the whip, ain't no shootin' out the Wraith
Got the back and the front sewed up
Tell him spin around the block right before you catch a play
Came home started selling that yay
Got some dog food on me with some Ac' in the case
Got a K right in my home if you run in my place
Put a bullet in his dome, watch it exit his face
On my knees prayin' to God tellin' him I'm goin' home if I don't live up to goin' hard
One night I ain't go home, girl actin' crazy 'cause she mad that I'm livin' like a star
Bitch I'm straight up out them trenches, I ain't never had a heart
And I’m plugged in the socket, I ain’t never had a cord
And you want them fancy things so you better play your part
Told that bitch you don't work then I swear you gon' starve
My nigga tellin' me to praise to Allah
With some cold blooded killers standin' right in front the yard
Everybody got a pistol, neither one got a heart
Sellin' drugs, havin' fights, it was hard in the north

Then I told you that I swear that I'll never hurt you but once
Double back and show you you can't believe what come off my tongue
When I flood your wrist I'm floodin' mine, that's a one of one

Happy to show you I love you, now right now I'm ashamed of it

Ask what you doin', you say thuggin', I'm so caught up and I'm thuggin'
Tell me do you really love me? wouldn’t say I do for nothin'
I admit it ain't easy baby, it's gon' take a minute
Told you somethin' and show different, but everything I swear I meant it

I wish I was somewhere where it ain't no violence
But I've been totin' on that pole every time that I roll
Tryna bust a nigga head if he try me
At night I need someone on side me just to hold me

But free that nigga out his cell, he need a second chance
And I can probably show him how to be a real man
He went to jail behind that money, I ain't know his plan
But no more, he won't be a dummy, I'ma throw him bands
But hold up, I need to thank my grandfather
He showed me how to fix them cars, now I can work that rod now

You in the streets, so watch yo' back, don't let 'em steal you

I speak the truth, I don't wanna be with no one else
If I say "fuckin' around was worth it"
Even though I ain't perfect, it'll be a lie
Stand-up guy, never sit quiet, I could say I always tried
But now I don't want nobody around and they wonder why
Electric Slide, chopper spit static when we let off fire

She a ride-or-die, she could've left and she ain't leave my side
On the road somewhere all alone
But my mind and my head, it ain't there, baby
Off the pills, I just need to relax, baby
Insecure about myself, oh
I just want to know why I can't
Seem to cure your love
Real gangsters in disguise

I think I'm gettin' the gangster fever
Them niggas playin', got my money up now, bitch, it's 'bout time

I gotta show this ho now, bitch, I ain't playin'
Same niggas talk that shit, they don't know nothin' 'bout bein' a man
I been misused, I been mistreated, what the fuck they don't understand?
But they show sympathy for somebody who ain't got no dick inside they pants
Think like a man
On the road somewhere all alone
But my mind and my head, it ain't there, baby
Off the pills, I just need to relax, baby
Insecure about myself, oh
I just want to know why I can't
Seem to cure your love
Real gangster in disguise

I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw
Hey, Lilkdubb
I say "Oh my god, I'm scarred"
It's hard, so can you end it?
I'm a bad motherfucker
Bullets through the car, it's war
That rod, I tote it, I ain't slippin'
When I fell back, I noticed this
How you was lyin' and I was runnin' wit' the time
While you was dreamin' that I'm dyin'
I got Hassen on my brain
With a brick up on my mind
With a icy slave chain 'cause I'm rich and can't move 'round
I go wrong by lovin' you
You talkin' down and that's not true
Them people 'round, they usin' you
If I kill her, I kill you too
Said you want go back to your ex
You fuckin' wit' that nigga too
And while you fuck me, in your head, you picture him, you doin' it too
You know I stepped on that lil' boy
I tried to kill her brother too
And I got pounds by the low
You done see me distribute
You know that girl who diagnosed me
With that shit, I gave to you
Get at me, I get at you
Shit on me, I shit on you
Tell your secrets to the only thing that come out at night
Attention seekin', how the fuck they leave me traumatized?
If they know like I know, they better run, they never come outside
Real shotta stay low
And let it blow until you niggas die
I say mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the realest of them all?
Who told the truth and never let them people see a flaw?
And who the fuck got all these hoes, thinkin' that they raw?
And who been killin' all these niggas, while based outta town?
And who the fuck said you lil' bitches could re-do my song?
And either one of these bitches can't say I ain't hold it down
She tried to bless me with that pussy, told her, "Hold it down"
Let's play a game, just close your eyes and lemme burn you down
Tell your secrets to the only thing that come out at night
Attention seeking, how the fuck they leave me traumatized?
If they know like I know, they better run, they never come outside
Real shotta stay low
And let it blow until you niggas die
I say mirror, mirror on the wall
Who the realest of them all?
Who told the truth and never let them people see a flaw?
And who the fuck got all these hoes, thinkin' that they raw?
And who been killin' all these niggas, while based outta time?
And you will die if you live for to die
See the demons in your eyes

Don't fuck with that, that's my bae
I say don't fuck with that, that's my bae
When you done being a freak, bring your ass my way 
Your name could make me tat three times on my face 
Hold my styrofoam, speedin' on the highway 
No party on a Friday, chase that money like five ways
Can't listen to what I say, bitch, you know I need you
Just wanna please you, from behind, just wan'  beat you
Soon as you throw it back, I go in deep too
Now it's time to put my clothes on, I don't wanna leave you
Vision your face as I be with somebody

Hood niggas they love me, the reason you fuck wit' me I don't know why
I know it's a lie, I don't know why I'm tryin'
Tyrone on the cot, me and Trey in the ride
Start sayin' my prayers when Elijah had died

I ain't show it but inside I swear I was cryin'
Go to sleep and I picture me dyin'
Watchin' my nigga, he snortin' a line
Come from the slum, I ain't pressin' rewind
Slangin' that iron everytime that we ride

Came from the bottom, I'm up in my prime
Speak of that day and you payin' a fine
No love for a nigga, he playin', he dyin'
I admit I'm a gangster but you ain't worth it

That pain gon' come from the truth, I had to learn it
Rest in peace to my nigga, Big Dump I miss you I just wish I was there
Feed off the pain and fuck the game, shit ain't the same since you left

Loyalty, loyalty, that's what I'm claimin'

I bet my last track probably gave you lockjaw 
Watch me burn before you bitches show me love
Ain't no wrong or rights, I can't tell you how it was
But I can tell you I was born to be a thug
Don't nobody understand when your hand out
Feel the breeze, nowhere to sleep or to run and hide
Unthoughtful game, they don't see the pain when lookin' in your eyes
I'm a bloody man, I don't feel shame for all them niggas dyin'
Holdin' on to my name with nothin' to claim, when through the night, I'm cryin'
These bitches lyin', let's face the fact
Them bullets flyin', let's talk 'bout that
Couldn't grab my strap, BaBa shot back
I feel the pain of the innocent
When I did my time, I ain't feel nothin'
It was for that man who was heaven-sent
For that child who was grazed, she wasn't supposed to deal with this shit
I'm with the shit, point that Draco at your head 
But it don't mean nothin' when them white folks talkin' 'bout bread
Lost in your thoughts, without your fam, nowhere to stay
Grew in that North, learned that's one place where not to play at
Cop cars come and take your child away
Puttin' guns to the face, so ain't nobody safe
Scream 4KTrey, I wonder if I'm who the change is
Can't find forgiveness since the day heaven gates where my mans went
Watch me burn before you bitches show me love
Ain't no wrong or rights, I can't tell you how it was

Don't nobody understand when your hand out

Fuck how far these people bring me down, my head stay to the sky

What's the order? I ain't do nothin' wrong, this what I'm taught
They been fuckin' up the culture, tryna tell a nigga it's law 
My lil' nigga, he a vulture, he don't know his mom or pa 
He don't even know what's important, he just gon' knock your head off
But I'm wrong for bein' safe in this home of the land
And I stand for 3 and K, not once, not never, we ran
I been bringin' food to the plate for either the fam or my fans
Real niggas gon' know you hurtin', you ain't gotta hold out your hand
Hold your head, we are never far
As long as we stand, they'll never call
Or ask a nigga how they been or how they feelin' through the day
They'll be havin' greed or envy 'bout the money you done made
But I want all you bitches to
Watch me burn before you bitches show me love
Ain't no wrong or rights, I can't tell you how it was
But I can tell you I was born to be a thug
Don't nobody understand when your hand out
Watch me burn before you bitches show me love
Ain't no wrong or rights, I can't tell you how it was

Or maybe it's just I'm too thug for all this shit
I lost my thugs behind this shit
I'm thanking God for blessing me from above with all this shit
Let go of my love behind this shit 'cause ain't no trust inside all this
Neither of us wrong, I just wanna make sure our bond always exists
I took the wrong route, made it out, see me now
Fuck all the charges and the blogs, they never brought me down
They gon' remember what they told me 'fore they lay me down
Ride for my bros cause I'ma soldier, I'm leaving blood through the town
I ain't never changed, you can't say the same
Still want more revenge behind Dave
Chippewa Northside 38 on my knees, grandma taught me how to pray
I be wanting you inside my life but you out there fucking 'round with these lames
And I would try to make it right but you would try to make me feel ashamed
Come here, your friends, too, it's alright
Come over, stay for the night, for the night
Young nigga, broke heart, take your motherfucking soul
Finna hit five and my oldest son ain't even fucking five years old
Baby , I know 
You see me  ridin' all alone 
Baby , come see 
The good in me 'cause they won't accept me and I feel I'm scarred for my wrongs
Even though we had our moments
Why the fuck you still gon' leave me 'lone?
When you these people around me ain't right
When you know that they only 'round for my money
I remember calling yo' phone at night soon as I had caught my first homi'
Never gave a thing to me in yo' life
For to make it right, you accept the money
And I know some things that you ain't tell
Playin' on me like I gave yo' number out, but you really fuck with him
And fuck the model, I take the summers off
I replace the bitch with gems
Do dirty work in fuckin' Timbs
We leave the mark above the rim
You was like my brother, why the fuck you cross that line?
Blew that fat bitch mind before he tried
Not a army bigger that won't slay me, oh, I
Guns to yo' head, we let that smoke float to the sky
Born in, 'fore it all end, leave this message for my child
Baby , I know 
You see me  ridin' all alone 
Baby , come see 
The good in me 'cause they won't accept me and I feel I'm scarred for my wrongsBe with the one who love you

When I know I should do better, when I know I should be better, I do better
Let me love you in my own way, that's from a distance

Make 'em bump it down with them cutters when we come through
Your lil' nigga 'til the end, baby, I can't never dump you
When you can't make it to your friends, baby, I'm the one you run to
I'm high, if you could, then look me in my eyes, baby
Don't tell no lies, baby, don't come out in disguise, baby
You feeling dude, he turn you up, I'm on the side, baby
I'm just thinkin', is it that I'm crazy?

We tote four tools, we be tryna knock 'em when we slide
I zip four fools, I probably zip your manes and make you cry
Ayy, I can't hold you, I don't stay the same, you gon' need another guy
I done passed my level, way beyond, on top the sky and still gon' tell you

Fuck with you so much I ain’t tell you she already fucked me
When we had talked she told me that you really feel like fuck me
Got so much love for Montana, love him like my brother
He told me I live how I want so I’m forever thuggin’

Won’t let them know too much ‘bout me ‘cause I don’t fuckin’ trust ‘em
Called me a bum when I asked 3 ‘cause I ain’t had nothin’
Fifteen bands invested in weed just for extra money

So I had to just go 
When we first met, never knew I would feel this way 
And this you never ain't know 
And ever since that I was young you been on side me
No two-three, I don't ride cheap
These hoes came, abducted me
Try hard just for to hide me
Ain't think that you would fuck with me, back then I was nobody
You was fuckin' on that dude and his brother split my brother body, ooh, ooh
It's a cold story
I can't believe the fact you never told me
We throw out summers, we don't be outnumbered, me and my brothers roll deep
You ain't no different from that bitch, that's what exact you showed me
So I guess you ain't just think about me 
I got feelings too 
Why you cuttin' up while these people 'round me? 
I don't know why that you do 
I had no choice, I felt like I was pushed away 
So I had to just go 
When we first met, never knew I would feel this way 
And this you never ain't know
I rock out on that stage and I think about our bond
Right now I'm up in LA, ask you and my son for to come
It's been a whole half a day, I only got two response
I took the fall for my blames, thought I would die once I jumped
But I was flyin' like a eagle
I let my soul do the singin', leave the opps' bodies in the road
Oh, oh, oh, probably seen how we get dressed up for my shows
Won't let my pride ever get me vest up behind these hoes or my bros
So I guess you ain't just think about me
I got feelings too
Why you cuttin' up while these people 'round me?
I don't know why that you do
I had no choice, I felt like I was pushed away
So I had to just go
When we first met, never knew I would feel this way
And this you never ain't knowPlease don't get amazed by all these diamonds, get you a plain jane
Baby, your love like cocaine, tell 'em I want the whole thing
Off-White on my offseasons, can't take no break, we gon' run this game
I hope that you been holdin' me down, that money came
Sittin' up inside of the court hopin' not to be judged by half of the choices I made
Ridin' in a double-R, drank in my cup, intentions aimed to kill all my pain
I'm runnin' with killers, I'm with 'em, you diss 'еm then know to reclaim
Came from thе bottom, ran it up and I ain't changed
Go tell them niggas I don't owe them shit
Ran off like assassin
Got a hundred different ways for a nigga get rich
Tryna stay on that, my mind bent
Did a jail bid, where my time went
Did a jail bid, where my time went
Got a brand new piece that Shyne sent
Got a brand new piece that Shyne sent
Hundred thou' inside of my Amiris
Dirty money spent on Prada I ain't proud of
Clean lean make a dirty bottle
Solitaires lay around the collar
In the streets, you just another body
Casket real bright, but it's dark in it
Future real bright, but it's war in it
Real born killers that was taught in it
Thinkin' 'bout givin' my Maybach up, startin' to feel too regular
Young nigga walkin' with that fentanyl
Get out of line, we stretchin' you

Blood everywhere 'cause this real-deal business
Guns everywhere and I'm real-deal billin'
Ten-thousand dollar 'fit, ridin' in a Honda Civic
She ain't know what to do, she had asked me to pick it
Bought her everything, it was nothin' 'pecific
If you get distracted, if you lack on a mission
Won't ever do that, I'm on top of my pivot
I'ma show you the value of love
But on top of that, that Patek gold value is plain
I feel like this metal protecting my life
It's gon' block that static that's all in the rain

Bit on the track like a dog 
I'ma foam from my mouth like I'm having a seizure
They ain't never pick up when I call 
When they call my phone back I decline, I don't need them
I never put trust in my dog 
When I'm working, go hard, I don't wanna see him
Hundred bands, I'ma look like a Beatle
Lemon squeeze on the back of the nina
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic informed the people
Back in the trenches when I leave the studio
Great power like I'm Julio
Thirty-Five thousand on me in the back of the bucket
Turning up with a big booty ho
Stead't telling me that I need to go
I look in his face and I ask what you mean
Can't comprehend I'm full of that lean
See the flash in my pocket on top of the beam
When they speak on the topic of grimy 'lil things
Count it up, adora mi lean
What is he saying?
I don't know what he mean
I just know he got money all up in his jeans
Spit on the track like a dog
I'ma foam from my mouth like I'm having a seizure
They ain't never pick up when I call
When they call my phone back I decline, I don't need them
I never put trust in my dog 
When I'm working, go hard, I don't wanna see him
Hundred bands, I'ma look like a Beatle
Lemme squeeze on the back of the nina
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic informed the people
Hold up
Never pick up when they calling, not conversating with people
My nigga ain't coming in clutch when I need him
I think that it's love on top of a needle
Smaller my circle and cut off some people
Cause bitch you know that I'm a gangsta
Get out this body, I bet that I spank em
Come in the nawf and you entering danger
Live like a Rebel and strapped like a Ranger
Stare in your face and can tell what you thinking
Got a lil sister princess and Jalayna
Run it up, Run it up
I got a money fever
Tell me, is your mind made up?
I'm not a normal creature
Plenty nights we stayed up, I'ma misformer breather
Plus I got my mind made up
My logic conformed the people
Run it up, Run it up
Run it up, Run it up
Run it up, Run it upLotta bloodshed, lotta bloodshed when that shit happens
You just ain't scared in the dark, huh? 
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry
It ain't nice when there ain't no moon in the sky
It ain't nice when they say you wrong and you right
It ain't nice that very moment that you die
It ain't nice that they be telling all these lies 
It ain’t nice how they be playin’ with my life 
It ain’t right how we so blessed but we still slide 
Got a brand new Draco from my brother with my name on it
And that concrete under the gutter, left his brains on it 
38 Baby from the gutter, Imma claim on it 
We go and spray a nigga street, I leave a stain on it 
Gotta brand new Glock, that red redemption for you motherfuckas 
Playin with my life, gonna make me kill all of you motherfuckas 
Want me to stop but I’m going in on you motherfuckas 
Pulling up to the jewelry end for to scoop my brothers 
When its time to ride, we don’t never show no pity, nigga 
Everybody gon' die, cuttin' my ties with no killing nigga
Draco and my wife, the only people thats gon get it, nigga 
One more time, that nigga play, I'ma make him feel it, nigga 
You ever saw that Draco bust and it split a nigga
You wanna come and join us, you gotta kill a nigga 
How the fuck they hold they nuts and ain't got seven figures 
I'ma tell you bout when it get rough if you just listen, nigga
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry 
It ain't nice when a thug nigga cry 
It ain't nice when there ain't no moon in the sky 
It ain't nice when they say you wrong and you right 
Got a brand new Draco from my brother with my name on it
And that concrete under the gutter, left his brains on it 
38 Baby from the gutter, Imma claim on it 
We go and spray a nigga street, I leave a stain on it Damn
Like when a nigga be tryna be like
One count away, you know what I'm sayin'
The streets kinda pull a nigga back in man, damn
Shit be crazy as fuck man
They can't win from losing at this shit man, but you know
I was built for the pressure
Word on the street they want pressure so let's get it
Clutching on the Glock as I ride through my city
All the silent beef I ain't with it, nigga admit it
Let off shots, ain't hit shit, they think we don't know who did it
Retaliation a must, when we do it's man down
Grrr, I ain't selfish, give his ass a hundred rounds
Get out that water, you don't know how to swim, you bound to drown
Red dot on top of your nose like bozo, we 'bout to clown
I saw the change coming, all this shit I invented
How you gon' knock a man for making his own decision?
Same nigga, ain't shit really changed but my image
I had to get that bread off the ground like a pigeon
Remember coming up I used to rock the fake ice
Stood on the block them late nights, asking god to get me right
Remember shooting my shot at hoes, them bitches was uptight
Now that they know a nigga worth it, hoes fuck the first night
Moment of truth
Everything I say I'ma do, I'm who them bitches gon' choose
I'm who the trappers salute
This a moment of truth, this a moment of truth
I got the bag in the booth, I got the strap on me too
I'm in the field with the troops
This a moment of truth
Ayy this a moment of truth
I'm peepin' all the shit niggas sayin' in these songs
I made a couple moves, they look at me like I'm wrong
But last time I checked I'm 26, ain't that grown?
And last time I checked my niggas ride right or wrong
Had to hustle just to eat, got my knowledge out the street
All my sons they a beast 
I hope my daughters never ever meet a nigga like me
I ain't shit to your mamas, always took them through that drama
They didn't understand a nigga, I was runnin' up them commas
Booked up for the last two summers, making plays off a bundle
Now I'm hotter than a sauna, people's choice like I'm Obama
They say money made me dumber, just wanna see me fumble
Moment of truth
Everything I say I'ma do, I'm who them bitches gon' choose
I'm who the trappers salute
This a moment of truth, this a moment of truth
I got the bag in the booth, I got the strap on me too
I'm in the field with the troops
This a moment of truth
Ayy this a moment of truth
Fuck dude, he a lil hater and I noticed that
I ain't goin' like you might think and I'ma show you that
Different bankroll every time I blink, see I get dough like that
The Hi-Tech all a nigga drink 'less I run 'cross that Act
Stay in your place, step out of line and get you buried
You gotta think smart, play your cards solitary
I made sacrifices, went against my hood for CMG
Didn't sell my soul for money, I just saw shit that they didn't see
Rap game wouldn't accept me 'cause I wasn't pretend
I kicked the door down like SWAT 'cause they wouldn't let me in
I'm out the jungle for sure, made it out the lion's den
Sometimes it feel like the end of the row, Boyz II Men
Moment of truth
Everything I say I'ma do, I'm who them bitches gon' choose
I'm who the trappers salute
This a moment of truth, this a moment of truth
I got the bag in the booth, I got the strap on me too
I'm in the field with the troops
This a moment of truthIt's Vade on the keys
Ride around, 'round, ooh-woah
Oh, slime
Every jawn, nigga, oh
Shit, I just woke up about two hours ago
Let's go
Suited Panamera when I roll
Should I rock and roll, the life I chose
Don't know nothin' but go hard behind my bros, yeah
No longer push pain out, I'm gon' go harder with it in
Singin' that, fuck that love shit, bitch, been long gone, baby
I got trust issues, plus these drugs won't let me hold on, baby
I be wantin' to leave it all, but did too much to fuckin' make it
The ones I love, I cut 'em off, 'cause it's too much and I can't take it
I don't do no talkin' on it, either side
Them Xans what got this look stuck up in my eyes
It numb my pain, never left, it only rise
At the end, not only that your soul left, your name dies
Hate what you believe, you do that shit 'cause I won't leave
I spend the money to make emotions ease, bitch, now let me breathe
Known to draw down, we never freeze
Searchin' for love, it sure is deceiving
I still have no one on side of me
But when you see me, I be flexed up, nigga
Suited Panamera when I roll
Should I rock and roll, the life I chose
Don't know nothin' but go hard behind my bros, yeah
No longer push pain out, I'm gon' go harder with it in
My bros, yeah
I swear lil' Leaky, I miss you, nigga, yeah
Uh-uh, uh-uh, uh, yeah, yeah
Shootouts with the other side, it got confidential
Many wouldn't even have me 'round if I wasn't beneficial
I'ma always take my brother's side while hangin' out that window
50K, I spend it on some VV's, you can ask the dental
It's okay, I watched lil' Leaky serve up out them rentals
Suburbans on the highway, no, we don't do the Sprinters
And I stay street life grindin' 'cause I ain't really have a pot to piss in
A little street life shawty chasin' blue cheese 'cause he Crippin'
I feel like G life forever and always, yeah, I'm Crippin'
I'm in a street life, that's what all of my niggas been Crippin'
I'm all in love and lust, I showed you, I guess I got interference
She paint a picture perfect, two double cups help me get the image
Suited Panamera when I roll
Should I rock and roll, the life I chose
Don't know nothin' but go hard behind my bros, yeah
No longer push pain out, I'm gon' go harder with it inBitch, I had pulled up fresher than a motherfucker at my best

I'ma let it slang and pray to God, show me forgiveness when he judge me
I'ma try to aim that bitch between a nigga ears, he ever touch me
Can't trust a ho, even if these bitches really think they love me
Long as you know, never let a pussy nigga give me nothin'
Nowadays, a nigga really gettin' money, I remember back when
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own
They was actin' like they ain't hear a nigga
Now even when I'm right, a nigga wrong
Now these niggas wan' see me gone
It's probably 'cause I'm a real nigga
I told them niggas put me on, had to run it up on my own

Came back from the dead and I'm still seein' you do the same thing

'Cause my grandma dead and gone, bitch it ain't no runnin' home 
I done died and came back and I still see the same thang

And now he sittin' up in the cell for over 2 years, how I'm supposed to let go of that?
Nigga fuck that, we gon' tend to that, when they run down they pushin' his shit back

While pops in prison, mama busy, I jumped off the porch
Grew up too fast, young wilding man, not knowing I would blow
Running with Chance, writing raps, that was my thing, too
Until I seen Twan and them came through in Mustang Coupes
I've been tryna get some sleep, so I've been sipping syrup
Remember Brock brought me to his block and let me serve
He told me leave from 'round this bitch and go and shock the world
I came home from off a tour, he was dead on the curb

To keep it real, I ain't lying, I ain't got no trust
Hesitant, for to come at me how you did
Hustlin' and gettin' it in
Stacking up malondins

At the top of the biggest hotel in the city
Just me and Pete talkin' 'bout the riches

My girl flew in from Costa Rica

Already got my nigga just stalking, he a deadsitter
Before I departed away from my soul

Standing on business, don't break no rules

You don't deserve for to live pussy bitch you ain't billy
Count a million cash got the time going slow
Drugs keep a nigga calm from the shit I've seen
Riding in a wraith out through the night
Tell the detective I upgraded my necklace I'm keeping it clean
Shorty want me, her ex fuck with my ex
First first time, had to tell the queen, stop that
Boss up, cause i'm knowing that you bout that
Can't let a nigga think you an outlet

Follow my heart, I'll never let no one control my life
Kodak locked up and I miss him so I’ma send a kite
Jeopardizin' blessings, I don’t know why I still tote my pain
Get full of drugs to put my life inside my rhymes
Fell off the ladder, got back up again, I climbed
Can't trust nobody, betrayed time after time
I'm movin' on, it's okay, I'll be fine
Devil take this to my heart, I just attach it, yeah
Acrobatics, seven numbers, I just fax it, yeah
Vision clear now, I can see now, yeah

        I got the world on my back, my protect it with some body armour
With a stick i just bought from out my section with a body on it
How you beefin’ with a nigga when yo momma stay right round the corner
Im tented to this mic i take his life if he run up on me
Instagram im peepin shit that they say
Nigga broke ain't got no money wanna smoke all day
And i be rollin’ round they mind thinkin’ bout shit that they say
The same nigga that crossed that line they ain't got shit till this day
I done ran it up, up on em
Brand new benz sittin in the lot
Quarter million car parked on the block they thinkin’ thats its chopped
10 bands 20 bands you had it but what happened bitch you flopped
Ion wanna be yo helping hand so now you want knocked off my top but damn
WOAH
Times changed so now you wandering the skies
I see the pain in yo eyes most of the time you don’t smile
Spend a 100 bands up on a car that i won’t give to my dawg
It ain’t no hatred i just played we it outgrown we ain’t no child
Them niggas broke how the fuck are we gone to go to war
You ain't seen the shit that i done saw
You ain’t never shoot up out that car
I done stuck so many niggas up i swear and put that on god
Nigga ain't take nun from me fuck you mean i always played my part
Same ones who hustling from the start had a pack but never sold no drugs
I done sold over a quarter brick lil bitch now tell me where you was
On Rosevelt for some apartments
Needles and spoons inside the tub
I go by Cici’s Pizza for my smokers just to show some love 
Come back to the trap with a gun in his hand
Shakeback he knockin at the door he all in the front side man
Went and did it but shit i did it you don’t feel what im sayin’
Felt like fuck em jayboy told me he won’t cut off my hand
I gave it to em
Times changed now you wandering the skies
I see the pain in yo eyes most of the time you don’t smile
Spend a 100 bands up on a car that i won’t give it to my dawg
It ain’t no hatred i just played we it outgrown we ain’t no childDubba A flex
Louie Bandz made another one
I hope my feelings start to matter, I mean
Hope your emotions not the shit that I read
I hope my ways is not the reason you leave
I hope one day the truth not bad as it seems
You know I'm a gangsta, ain’t no changin' that
Tryna hold on to everything that I know, the only thing that make me smile
And once I leave it ain't no comin’ back, I'll take my chances
Now you don't want me apart, I guess I leave you all of that
Diamonds flashin', that's the reason you can't go back
I ain't happy, that's the reason that my heart froze baby
Ain’t have no rachet, if I did, I let that thang blow baby
’Cause you know it ain't no pussy in blood, I get it on baby
North side, where I resided
These bitches don’t want face the fact that they tryna hide me
These niggas broker than they track, they tryna ride me
I think that pussy bitch you hatin' right on side me
Killin' my insides, steady screamin' out, "I’m sorry!"
If I'm not wanted, I'm not worth it
If it be God or the Devil
I swear to follow which one call me
Callin' for money, fuck they money, I'ma die for everything that I love
Pray through the crisis, fucked my life forever, live life a thug
Gunnin' from me while I'm recordin', I might put 2 in my jug
Look fuck that bitch and fuck that nigga, mane, I know what it was
Put X in my mouth 
In the back of the car, every time I be ridin'
I could give you a smile wit' the knife in my hand
Every time that I say it, I never be lying
I could cut off the neck of the cat in the back of the house
In a pool, I feel like I'm dying
I could paint on my image, that niggas be trippin'
He really was havin' some shit, I  mine
We could be together wit' no pain
 make him numb
I could put in my Will to put the jewelry in the grave, that shit you left in the trunk
, what the fuck he jus' said, they think that I'm dumb
I'm ready to die, you know how I come
You get hit wit' that fire, you players red rum
I hope my feelings start to matter, I mean
Hope your emotions not the shit that I read
I hope my ways is not the reason you leave
I hope one day the truth not bad as it seems
You know I'm a gangsta, ain't no changin' that
Tryna hold on to everything that I know, the only thing that make me smile
And once I leave it ain't no comin' back, I'll take my chances
Now you don't want me apart, I guess I leave you all of thatVerse 1 :
I kept it gutta ain't do no complaining
I gotta cherish my only remaining
I gotta fill in the spots where it's blank
Can't hold it in ima say if i think it
Picture that image I come out and paint it
Just sippin that drank, like hatred I need it
Never change up for a fact and I mean it
Run up that money pop out when you see me
Let them shots off caught a case and I beat it
I ain't give her much and I know she won't leave me
I gave em so much and they say they ain't need me
Take a vacation then lay low I seen her
With my dogs in the pen I can't wait til they see me
Went under with money for the rainy days
I went so hard they gave me a raise
I could leave from that life but ain't selling my k's  
I could see the pain all in yo face
I see losses on the back of yo brain
Get the money and I blow out the brain
I'm so damaged I cannot be the same
I'm so damaged I cannot be the same
Hop out the bed and I get on my knees
I can't give you much tell me what do you need
I would never give up cause I know what it mean
Walk in the museum with tats on my sleeve
Stunna told me young forever you bleed
Kevin told me I'll forever achieve
Momma told me that the devil got me
Stop the stressing I can't stop if she leave
Cherish yourself for all you den done
Look in your face and I'm glad that you done
I let her come with me its time for the run 
Chorus :

Or maybe this shit gon' forever be with me
I just gotta handle with time
Can you help me understand whats wrong
Im in it can't quit it, we slangin that iron
Keeping my distance to cherish my time
Show how i feel without giving no sign
Mmmm, who i want, you who i don't wanna lose mhmm
Falling over you now im your fool
All out war, play games it make me break rules
The outcome it might leave us all doomed
I say it's whatever, I turned to the Devil
Imma live like a villain forever forever
Im the man and indeed you better be special
Hit my weed but still ain't clever
Slang heat, fuck , preach like Reverends
Killed 3, dump died, still ain't settled
Night time creep, take five, im ready
Love came in ain't make shit better
Gotta go to the dirt, Im prepared for the worse
It ain't none bout this shit I say special
But the way that they floppin because of the bezel
I call out the issues, Im naming out several
Either way it could go so I gotta be careful
I'm in love with your body, you don't give me no pleasure
Devastate you with knowledge, a statement could kill us
Just watch how you talking when im in the picture
How many hours or how many days it's gonna take for to clear out my mind
Or maybe this shit gon' forever be with me
I just gotta handle with time
Can you help me understand whats wrong
Im in it can't quit it, we slangin that iron
Keeping my distance to cheris my time
Show how i feel without giving no sign
Mmmm, To you, you make me feel i should prove
Start then stop, these gimmicks got me rude
Just for the  10 with a stick, he gon' come out the roof
Stay with the shit, let it hit, pull it back then he lettin it boom
You know that im loving you
I believe you love me without no proof
Do they really fuck with me
Seeing this shit, it ain't clear as the moon
Mmmm , who i want, you who i don't wanna lose mhmm
Falling over you now im your fool
All out war, play games it make me break rules
The outcome it might leave us all doomed
How many hours or how many days it's gonna take for to clear out my mind
Or maybe this shit gon' forever be with me
I just gotta handle with time

Louis V print on my bracelet, Burberry come on occasions 
Move like a shotta, I smoke like a rasta, she went in my pocket I caught her

 around me for a reason
Steady smokin mojo
I'm in and out of court
My daddy use to lie to me

People say they feel my pain but they don’t feel me tho
I put my whole family through shame I already know
And everything happen why they gotta blame me
My Grandma died and it ain't been the same bih
Got so much shit piled up man I can't hold it in So why you think I wrote this song?
To get it off my chest

Rest in Peace Lil Dave my nigga he got peeled
I promise before I leave this bitch Imma get a mil
I say everything happen for a reason
They killed my nigga dave man 
Man I'm in and out of jail for a reason
Family don't understand me for a reason
And All these talking down bout me
But I know they don't give a fuck about me
They see the struggle
But they don't feel the pain man
But everything that happen a blessing charge it to the game
The second verse
Man Imma make it about the stick up kids
I know we did a lotta shit we shouldn’t did
His mama told me do something but I was really trippin
I walked up into that room  I really fucking did it
My cousin Trey he up in college heading for the fame
He make it to the NBA he never broke again
I got tired of being stupid so I did shit the smart way
Shoutout to D Dawg he in the Parish on a murder case
And I can’t get a different producer they be sleeping on me
Me and  separated for a reason homie
And everything happen a blessing man I notice that
So everything you ever gave me I love you for that
Police told me my Momma she my best friend
I pray to god that my sister never need a man
To my Brother I promise Imma be your helping hand

And All these talking down bout me
But I know they don’t give a fuck about me

Pe'nem go out of state for that purp and that drank
When they come back they changing the weather
They ask whats my purpose of how i'm living
I'm growing up i take life serious

At the top of the biggest hotel in the city
Just me and Pete talking bout the riches

I'm forever being with the people who put up with my shit 'cause I know me
I've been betrayed too many times
I light one up for my dead homies, I'm droppin' these ashes, won't get 'em back
My name, niggas throwin' salt on it, everything that I claim imma stand on that
Racketeerin' got the feds on us, gang activity came to that
Say that they wanna drop bread on 'em, when we hit 'em up they ain't comin' back
23 hours and 45 minutes sittin' up in that cell, I ain't goin' back
Word on the street these niggas been dissin', when I get released imma handle that
I'm talkin' to shorty she say that she love me, you know for a fact I ain't trustin' that
These niggas been plottin', you know that I'm thuggin', he say he gon' kill me can't go like that
36 Os and a whole lotta' money, I got this shit in the backpack
I'm right at the store inside of the north, I'm playin' 'round with that crack sack
I'm bumpin' Yo Gotti that CMG 5, you lil' niggas don't relate to that
I got me a burner when Lil Dave died, he say he gon' kill me ion' play 'bout that
Seein' that blood left me traumatized, I pray to god with my nigga
Have you ever been a victim, the nigga infront of the pistol?
I be that lil' nigga who grippin', runnin' duckin' from the system
False move imma zip him, you know I ain't tellin' who killed him
Shoot at a nigga and don't say a thing, they labelled me as a top shotta
Protectin' my niggas I'm over the gang, behind the fence like a rottweiler
I can't let the drugs take over my brain, maintain and I'm goin' higher
They bumpin' my music but don't feel my pain, all of this money is hypnotizing
These niggas pride takin' over they life, so they shootin' on sight
They focus on wrong, they dance with the devil, they ain't tryna' move right
When you gone you gone, I can tell you my nigga, you'll never live twice
So stack up that money and hold your own, be a boss and pay the price
Lightin' one up for my dead homies
I'm droppin' these ashes, won't get 'em back
My name, niggas throwin' salt on it
Everything that I claim, imma stand on that

I need my brother, just like my backbone, you more than my friend
Who gone be here by time my bag gone, Hope more than my kids
Gunnin for your love like a touchdown
Babygirl you good, It's just us now
Full of drugs, seem im stranded with no trust found
I'd go crazy if i couldn't buy you a bussdown
Feel if I ain't have it you wouldn't be with me
You gon' go and be with a nigga who can provide you with it
Screaming fuck yo brother, yeaa who side you picking
I feel im right so i don't give a fuck about which way it go
Make my way through the night i can not pace slow
All this shit been crazy, I think about Draco
You lie it ain’t to my face it’s straight to my soul
Pussy ass nigga ain't safe, gon' get his head blown
Grew up havin' to play inside that red zone
Send one, im sending it back we call that ping pong
I lay alone kickin it back tryna get my head on
I got 'nun but meds in my Styrofoam
I'll be patchin up my pain till im dead n gone
Gunnin for your love like a touchdown
Babygirl you good, It's just us now
Full of drugs, seem im stranded with no trust found
I'd go crazy if i couldn't buy you a bussdown
Say my prayers so i know im protected soon as i walk in
Seeming like that im the one that they don't wanna see win
I need my brother, just like my backbone, you more than my friend
Who gone be here by time my bag gone, Hope more than my kids
Who gone be here by time my bag gone, Hope more than my kids

I can't no more, I ain't letting them people hurt me
No I can't go, I ain't letting them step on me
I ain't showing no love, they ain't ever do shit for me
I don't give a fuck, I don't care what they think 'bout me
I ain't ever switch, who the fuck done said I changed?
They say I ain't shit, why they talk down on my name?
I ain't ever let it go, Imma stay true to this game

No I don't wanna know, I don't wanna hurt nobody
They don't know, know, know, fire growing in my body
And I'm waiting on, for to step on me somebody
Got a clique with me, so solid
Sipping take narcotics
See that shit you said I caught it
Whole lotta racks up in my pocket
No I won't quit on promoting the violence
Step on a nigga, the police can't stop it
Wildlife came and took my tiger
Imma double back, bought me a lion
I stay with the shit know these bitches ain't shit
I ain't trusting no hoe cause I know they be lyin'
Take my lick no I won't tell
Way back bitch, hoe I was locked in a cell
Appreciating I know that they hating

Walk through the North, just me and Kindelle
Said they want smoke and I'm bringing them hell
Shoot out the window I'm leaving them stale
I can't no more, I ain't letting them people hurt me 
No I can't go, I ain't letting them step on me 
I ain't showing no love, they ain't ever do shit for me 
I don't give a fuck, I don't care what they think 'bout me 
I ain't ever switch, who the fuck done said I changed? 
They say I ain't shit, why they talk down on my name? 
I ain't ever let it go, Imma stay true to this game 
I don't care which way he go, Imma always stay the same 
Hop in the whip do the dash in the Bentley
It's living up when I hit it
Strapped when I float through the city 
That's how I sound when I hit it
No dealings with these bitches
Loaded I think that I'm tripping
Focus you know I ain't slipping
Pay me on scene and you know that I spit it
Fussing with my girl, say that you love me I know you don't love me
Brought you around me and you started thuggin'
Fuck all that shit I ain't worried 'bout nothing
Imma travel the world, I'm bringing you with me ain't leaving for nothing

I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-three
My city I'm the C, go hard for the paper
Live the life of monster, kicking doors for petty capers
Last time to live, somethin' like the rich folks
Tired of all this poverty, it's robbery, it's no joke
My life like a movie, talkin' straight daily
Bitch my lawyer Jewish, got a stick and I'm ready
My lil partner on the food, give him a fixing daily
I seen him in action, he hit a corner and get messy
So fuck your white flag pussy, we don't want peace
I ain't satisfied nigga 'til that ass six deep
And your partner them next, I bet that ass won't rest
So tell your mama and your sister them get out the black dress
It's up, tell me what's the knowledge
I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-three
Heard these niggas want beef
I'm in the North, niggas know I'm in the streets
He said it's up, when we catch him we gon' see
Real shooter, he stay silent, never speak
Ain't taking shit back that I fuckin' said
These niggas know how we play it
I won't hesitate to spray it
Catch you, we gon' bust your head
Forty Glock, bitch I'ma spray that
Squashing shit, no we don't play that
You want smoke then nigga say that
We gon' send shots where you stay at
Shoot your taco, you ain't with that
We gon' pull up where you lay at
Nigga know that gang be that
Plus your trap like I ain't see that
Same place that we gon' creep at
Drown, make a nigga get back
Up this bitch, bet I don't miss that
Swear that I'ma push your shit back
It's up, tell me what's the knowledge
I only send hits 'cause I only want bodies
Fuck your white flag, nigga we don't do apologies
Frank White Deck, I got hitter that's gon' slide for me
Runnin' through the bag so the plug graduated me
Racks got me cocky, my lil niggas think I'm straight from it
Cutter with the scopes, knock an opp to his fuckin' knees
Pippen in the magazine, F&N hold thirty-threeI came from nothing
Dream is the city and the Maserati
I'm fallin' off, I'm gettin' on, it's the hill I'm climbin'
My nigga, he just called my phone, DDawg caught a body
Like bangers, click, and transmission, we promotin' violence
Now watch the dog fiendin' like the life in the dark
Life Before Fame, the roads to riches, this is where it start
The killing day, retaliation, time to go to war
Cheated on every girl, trusted one and she broke my heart
I'm singin' to myself, I'm really singin' to the stars
I'm thinkin' fast, I'm trippin' hard
Portrayed in my own boy
When everybody changin' on you, had to turn to God
Knockin' no corners in my music, comin' from my heart
Now this a girl that left my mama, ain't no rules in life
She thuggin' hard, fuckin' every nigga up in sight
People don't tell her right from wrong, but it's gon' be alright
I'm prayin' for you, I pray that you don't lose your life
Yeah, you know what it is, nigga, this YoungBoy, man
You tuned into my mixtape

Red BB belt 'cause I'm a bloody stepper
So many artists leave a stain on whoever
I'm starting to think I should just go
We ain't been getting no better
Tell me a lie, I blow the brains out the reverend
Inside my cup, I see the devil
'Cause the demon always come out me all of a sudden
Inside the bank, it's a been a murder scene
'Cause whеn I walked out, they had blood on that money
I'm talking somеthing beyond the sky what I'm gon' aim for
Pull up on the side, let that thing blow
Tryna heal my pain with that drank, but it's gon' take my soul
 swerving in the range like he can't go
Hundred mil' coming, all this fame old
Soon as you changed on me, you turn to ash like charcoal
Lose feelings through the night, I'm starting to think my heart broke
Know they give me love, see they switching up
That thing getting old
Caught 'em breaking in, I'ma kick doors, we live a big code
Kickstand, sliding in, oh, and my wrist froze
She run down, I left her, I don't know where she go
Sanitary lifestyle, I'm making sure that casket closed
That 40 on me right now, I step on the bitch on my own
Clear the scene, time to leave, leave it, oh overload
Could barely breathe, get off lean, too much lean, time to go
They gon' count me in anyway, the fuck you tryna tie me for?
The RT wait, I dubbed the eight 
Red BB belt 'cause I'm a bloody stepper
So many artists leave a stain on whoever
I'm starting to think I should just go
We ain't been getting no better
Tell me a lie, I blow the brains out the reverend

On the road, where we at now 
From the studio, straight back to the traphouse 
June, you're a genius
Yeah, huh, yeah, yeah
From the studio, straight back to the traphouse 
Gettin' money on the road, where we at now 
Put down that sack, but we ain't never put them straps down
We ain't underground no more, we on the map now
From the studio, straight back to the traphouse 
Gettin' money on the road, where we at now 
Put down that sack, but we ain't never put them straps down
We ain't underground no more, we on the map now 
Came from the studio, straight back to the traphouse
We came for takin', ain't no way we gonna ask now
You know me, I can't be comin' like the cash cow
And all the money, I won't never put my strap down
Stayed down, came up, kept it one hundred
I wake up every mornin' chasin' money
I had to prove my point, you know I ain't never back down
I had got locked up, they knocked me down but now I'm standin' tall
Life from the slums, been real, I'm straight out the North
I remember hustlers spinnin' in and tryna stake it out
Gotta roll the dice, niggas takin' chances, that's the ball
Gamblin' with your life, say, "Lil' nigga, you might lose it all"
Fuck, when I first started, I ain't lyin', it feel a day ago
Facin' thirty years, I'm just stressin' about these charge and all
How deep it really is to keep it real? You will never know
They don't feel my pain, don't understand the shit that I be on
Real trapper once we get it, we gon' get it gone 
We gon' make a lil' bit extra off for every pound 
I hit a lick and with my niggas, we gon' split it all 
You know I ain't never ever put that hammer on

But I’m straight out that nawf
With some lil niggas from out Dixie
Who’ll take yo shit off
They want money

Fuck a traitor, a nigga playin’ and I’m pushin' a button
Ain’t nobody safe, I'll burn you for nothing
If that boy ain't one hunnid, we can't do a song
In a cell by myself, I did time all alone
I came up out the street, I ain’t never go wrong
Everywhere that I go, I'ma stay with that chrome
Them diamonds gon' shine on the top of VLone

Slatt
Slatt slattI say
Heart full of spaces
Dreams full of greatness
Hoping that we all can live on after death
Pain running out my body
I don’t have too much left
Without actions
You should never speak the words on yourself
But I say you are not wrong
Time to move on
Hoping that we all can play along as ourselves
Steady think bout the nights
Being all alone by myself
I just got in but coming back like I ain’t left
Four year old dreams to be promised
Tell me what would you do
Beautiful girl but I could see
Your soul is what defines you
Taking time from out your day
Just to make sure that you cute
Never dependent within
No one could do what you do
Just rode right back in that coupe
It made me feeling like something
80K a show and that’s on god
That they ain’t give us nothing
Walked from out the yard I had it hard
But I came up on something
200 on the comfort
Got that this the one came with a button
After the day if I’m not on the media
I’m thinking of some of the craziest deepest things
And I mainly by hour we on hella drugs
Several reasons why we want to get high
Heart full of spaces
Dreams full of greatness
Hoping that we all can live on after death
Pain running out my body
I don’t have too much left
Without actions
You should never speak the words on yourself
But I say you are not wrong
Time to move on
Hoping that we all can play along as ourselves
Steady thinking bout the nights
Being all alone by myself
I just got in but coming back like I ain’t left
Four year old dreams to be promised
Tell me what would you do
Beautiful girl but I could see
Your soul is what defines you
Taking time from out your day
Just to make sure that you cute
Never dependent within
No one could do what you do
After the day if I’m not on the media
I’m
Thinking of some of the craziest deepest things
And I mainly by hour we on hella drugs
Several reasons why we wanna get high

        Lyrics From Snippet
I walk with it on me, I don't need no army
It's 'bout bang, bang
Mama, I'm sorry
Mama, I'm sorry
I say mama, I'm so sorry
These niggas gon' die from all the shit they've been doin'
I say I don't need no army, bitch I walk with it on me
I close the case, knock off his face, yeah we be bringing that to 'em
I told mama I'm sorry, I can't let them stalk me
This money got them tryin' to bust my head in the rari
You want smoke then you call me
Be a gangster, say my name in your music
Cross that line and they gon' slang it for boosie
Boy you a hoe
I leave you traumatized
Mama go hear some cold shit
Cops be slidin' on us the got my ma, I apologize
Rip his fuckin' face, shoot his eyes out his fuckin head
Fuck that nigga he dead, them other niggas scared
Slime one, two, three, four this that domino
This that  on go, kill all your  folk
This N.O, This that hangin' out by the rental, This that send that nigga back, who you sent for?
Now you dangerous, back in school your mama she wouldn't even let you hang with us
Cause we were slangin' iron and smokin' angel dust
Me and five-thang, ain't no change, and it's this gorilla shit
My life get you sent that bitch, mama I'm the innocent
I say mama, I'm so sorry
These niggas gon' die from all the shit they've been doin'

I say this street shit ain't no joke, you better use yo' head
Nigga make yo’ money, Monty told me get my bread
My nigga put his trust up in a bitch and now he dead
All my niggas tellin' me I need to chill
My momma say stay out the streets, she pray I don't get killed
Can't trust no nigga or no bitch, no they don't keep it real
I'm scarred for life, yeah, I stay with it bitch, I shoot to kill
P, I put that on Lil' Dave, I'll murk one of these niggas
I’m rollin ’round I'm just waitin’ on you niggas
When I spot you bitch I got you, I been waitin' on you niggas

        I had to tell her she can go cuz i don't need her

I'm born from the store bitch i'm off the meter
I relapsed on smoke bitch i'm smokin reefer
Gang shit that bang shit that kill mang shit
I'm bored as a motherfucker i don't rap like this
You pack yo shit hoe and you left so why you call'in me
You saw my post on instagram  hoe why you stalk'in me
You meet up with the police nigga did you rat on me
I'm fresh as hell the police watch'in got them racks on me
I want a nigga fo to try me got that strap on me
I really kill like for real bitch don't play with me
Call on you boy you ain't jesus i don't need a nigga

My god mama wanna fuck me thought i was yo child
These diamonds on me got me shinin guess that change yo mind
Said you want smoke bitch you a junk'y need to change your style
Yo mama 12  you a police child
I swear i love that hoe to death but she waist my time
I went to jail to many times sat back on my grind

Don't wanna lose yo life then nigga then stay in line
I sip up on nun but lean nigga but i don't drink no wine
The police took my tiger bitch i'm bout to buy a lion
Outside my air and b i got these hoes in a line
I had a dream last night that i up and died
You bet not call my family hoe if i really died

Don't fuck with rappers i don't know i got a crazy mind
Yo boss mane wanna talk i told z bo hang up that line

I told that boy that im a killer bitch dont play with me
That fn hold 22 and it stay with me
Fuck br i hate baton rouge bitch come step on meLyrics From Snippet
I seen my pops in chains
I'm rockin' all these chains
Feel like I'm slave to the system
Dawg, shit ain't change
They ask me why I'm still reckless, throwin' up my gang
They ask me why I get this fame and still move the same
I blame it, I blame it on my past
I blame it on my wrist, it got 'em mad
I blame it on that shit I never had
Yeah, I blame it on 'em
I blame it, I blame it on this bag
I spend it tryna make up for my past
I blame it on that shit I never had
Yeah, I blame it on 'em
And I'm thankin' God, I'm famous
Made it out a place that's dangerous
I've been kickin' shit on my own
Back then, they left me hangin'
If I said I love you, I ain't never changin'
Stood up on my own, I ain't never blame it
Built a ship, it ain't never sinkin'
So strong, forever painless
Baby, tell me if you still love me if I ain't have a penny
Tell me that you gon' be here for me if I go face a sentence
Tell me that you love me when I dive up in it
No one to blame, I blow out the brain on these dirty bitches
I blame it, I blame it on my past
I blame it on my wrist, it got 'em mad
I blame it on that shit I never had
Yeah, I blame it on 'em
I blame it, I blame it on my past
I blame it on my wrist, it got 'em mad
I blame it on that shit I never had
Yeah, I blame it on 'em
Grew up in them trenches, me and Hunter had to share clothes 
Now we gettin' rich , diamonds dancin' and we sharin' hoes
My Glock got extensions, I might text you, Uncle Sam, ho
Bitch, I feel like Dora, Moncler boots
We did...
I blame it, I blame it on my past
I blame it on my wrist, it got 'em mad
I blame it on that shit I never had
Yeah, I blame it on 'em

..Yeah, I blame it on 'em 
Nah, I ain't changing homie 
That  that changed up wrongly 
They think that I'm different know I'm slippin 'cus he changed up on me 
I've been silent  that was killers but who stayed the  
Showed him all that love ain't mean shit 'cus they still blamed  it on me
But I blame it 
I blame it on my strap 
I blame it on my gun when I get mad
I admit that she's the..My heart cherish, please don't sell it or try hide it
Your love take me the highest, narcotics I'm tryna top it
Police tryna stop it, he fresher than a motherfucker
But he ain't been doin' nun wrong, the only thang he totin' that thirty burner
This for my brothers who in the slums everyday
Tryna prepare for pain cuz more heart break is on the way
Up in public we get it on smokin', shootin' heroine broad day
In the heart of Atlanta byebye screamin' 4K Trey
Big money in, she just took a ten on the way
Them perkys poppin' out her body I'm on trey
I'm on three, in my pocket, money hard like some clay
And you know we rollin hard let it spray
Thuggin' these hoes but I guess my heart decided
I just wanna be with you cuz really I been out here wylin'
Steady been outchea slidin', catch him put them hallows in his body
Livin' grimey, burglaries being committed by the silence
Fuck what they say, I'm askin' you, baby is it really love
All my niggas they right outside, I'm goin' out All out behind you
Tote that Glock i been moppin' with my thugs
I'm gone off them xans, I couldn''t remind you, oh I had to find you Like where you been at, in that north pluggin' out the socket
Right outside the house got youngins itchin', tryna blow they rocket
Smokers tryna come and jump the fences told my niggas stop it, Granny on the porch so switch yo swag cuz you know she watchin'
My nigga pulled up with the bottle
I just took a ten, took a ten
Xannies in my body fo' I even put one in
Feelin' on her body be like righteous you might win
I know that she scared to even like it all my ten
Like ow ka lata bends, choppas and FNs
We got bands, we got hell cats and some benz
In my eye spot ratchet body in my lens
She from the hood so I'm finna turn her in
Thuggin' these hoes but I guess my heart decided
I just wanna be with you cuz really I been out here wylin'
Steady been outchea slidin', catch him put them hallows in his body
Livin' grimey, burglaries being committed by the silence
My nigga pulled up with the bottle
I just took a ten, took a ten
Xannies in my body fo' I even put one in
Feelin' on her body be like righteous you might win
I know that she scared to even like it all my tenSay
Imma have to ease my into it
But look
Its recording?
Ight bet let em hear what that shit im finna speak about
Had to tell my girl, i love you cause you do it better
Ain't got no dealings with them niggas cause i know better
Master p sending wealth with a cold stepper
Im worth to much, i cannot touch em but my nigga stretch em
36 go by 1, let my OG stretch
Through the 6 with jawan, movin like the president
I got michael corleone tatted on my chest
Watching the king of new york
My son to my left
[Verse}
Beat the block up in the nawf
Come back to the house
My nigga on the phone talking raw like that we dont talk
I heard a nigga passin diamond Missouri, heard im in the south
Bust this bitch and won't take off my jewelry, make him draw the charts
Nene lookin like a muslim with a hijab on her face
Drop sum ounces in the park, most like it i do 28
Hittas on top yo car soon as we passin through the gate
Heard a nigga want war, call the place and quick to rate, yeah
You know how we be rockin we dont play no games no
Hop in the wraith this bitch all white, this that cocaine flow
Them niggas rapping bout it, never sold a thang tho
Ain't gotta say a thang they know who bringin all the load
Bae we gon show them how to win everytime that its drought time
Go go higher than the wind, never stand down everytime its war time
My nigga say allah akbar when its time for to die, scream allah akbar when its time for to die
Say imma die hard when i hop out the ride
Never i fall hard cause forever i riseTahj Money

No, no I'm not no regular nigga
Northside, I'm from the trenches
Hey, YoungBoy
Flashin' lights, cameras flickin'
High profile, I'm not no regular nigga
Northside, I'm from them trenches
Shit I used to do, ain't do it in a minute
Whole lotta diamonds, whole lotta Benzes
We was broke, now I'm gettin' money with my niggas
Weeks ago, I was wakin' up in prison
They know me everywhere I go, this one hell of a feeling
I was coolin' in my section, running 'round tryna get some dough 
One time you told me hustle to you, ain't gon' hurt no more 
Suffering from pain for so long, it just need to go 
Zone out on that drink-drink 'til I can't even pour no more
Yeah, I got racks now bitch and I did it 
At first I was slept on, put in work and now I did it 
I got caught up in the streets and I got locked up in prison 
Bitch out here she left me, she was never really with me 
We grindin' hard, it's comin' and I feel it 
Young nigga litty, turnt up when I'm in your city 
Rock out at my shows, fans say that I'm the releast
Know they stare everywhere I go and it's one hell of a feeling 
Flashin' lights, cameras flickin'
High profile, I'm not no regular nigga 
Northside, I'm from them trenches 
Shit I used to do, ain't do it in a minute 
Whole lotta diamonds, whole lotta Benzes 
We was broke, now I'm gettin' money with my niggas 
Weeks ago, I was wakin' up in prison 
They know me everywhere I go, this one hell of a feeling
It's 6PM and I still ain't ate
I'm always on time, I ain't never late
I know where I'm headed, the fuckin' bank
I hop in the Lamb', have a drink 
At ten, I'm pullin' up in your state
You know that my niggas strapped with the thing
My truck secure just like a safe
I'm shinin', iced up just like a cake
Had to focus, man, I know 
I was sleepin', I was leanin' off a four
My gang on point and I know that they gon' blow 
Nigga better play your role
Flashin' lights , cameras flickin' 
High profile, I'm not no regular nigga 
Northside, I'm from them trenches 
Shit I used to do, ain't do it in a minute 
Whole lotta diamonds, whole lotta Benzes

        Don't wanna see you frown pick your smile up i say
If they all was down i lift them all up
Different and insane what they call us
Accept all the pain what they taught us
Came up out the north i hope they love us
Straight out mom's house with my big brother
Right out 48 brought dirty cutters
Stayed inside the streets and it wasn't for us
Ridin in that foreign on the e way
Chasin up that money ima speed race
Emotions on the plate i need a clean slate
Bro not to be trusted what my jeans say
Pick it up and drop it off get it all gone
They probably wanna see me down get em all gone
Miss her friend daily all alone probably fall down
I ain't got no patients for theses songs im tryna calm down
I dont want beef so i accept for you to go your ways
He in to deep he not go love em what they say i can't take
He giving up that boy ain't nothin like back up in the days
He scarred to trust he lost his touch and what they say he can't take it
Show they all say it might rain all day
I been hearin what they all say
I left out early but came home late
Can i have my life back
Slang that iron at me you know we bussin right back
I won't show no love want whip his nose ain't no slatt
Rock out with these poles at my shows 100 racks
Dont give a fuck bout what they say i deal with pain all day
My bitch dont love me but we came a long way
Got that thirty on me and we can shoot it all day
Up in jail with my head down in the hall way
I send them back ain't no catchin that
If i fuck up then im run it back
Nigga play he go up ain't no comin back
I invest in those poles we handle that
Goin in with my bros no fallin back
Nigga if i hang up ain't no callin back
Get my hand on a zan ima throw it back
I can't take all the pain how you handle that
I can't take all the pain how you handle that

From the gutter we don't speak about nunLyrics from Snippets
Live or be killed, in other words, kill or get stepped on
 get you a tampon
One play, you get your  gone
Bullets knocked off, identify us later, nigga
 still God don't save you niggas
I don't beef talk, we erase a nigga
Shoes ripped off, he tried to run, hop out and chase a nigga
Ever since a baby, pistol packing tryna face a nigga
Used to concealing, now I show my ratchet every time a take a picture
Riding with my brothers steady thugging tryna 
Mugging, leave the  zipped the whole clique with all these pistols
Two guns 
You want it right then make it right 
We gon'  tonight bang with my knife, that's only 
These niggas ain't on nothing, we on all them
Spin through late  and I just blocked down on 'em
These niggas ain't on something, like who know something?
And we gon' hunt him down and leave him dead 
Nigga, check out how my wrist rock
I got a big Glock
I ain't worried about no opps, nigga, that's what this stick for
Dead bodies right on my block, we get you lit
You 4KTrey, we kill for you, you ain't gang, still ain't doing shit for
Got four lil' boys, I live for them
Grandma, I live for her
Northside  that's 4KTrey 
I'm a demon baby
With them sticks, go crazy
I ain't playing crazy, I got too much money and too many cars
I can  I'm on too many bars
Can't go out sad just like 
Put that 30 on your ass and who else in the car
Just  we the murder squad
These niggas ain't on nothing, we on all them

Go Grizz
You told me, yeah
Winners Circle
She told me that she loved me in that state of mind
Holdin' on to that memory, the last time you fucked me
Got me wishing I could press rewind
You say that I'm caught up thuggin', you ain't ever lyin' 
You say that I love that money, you ain't ever lyin'
And every time I think of something, you forever mine
And you say that I push your buttons, I ain't even tryin'
We on jet-skis and I punch it to the river, doing the dash on 'em
I turned you to a killer, your еx, you say put a bag on 'em
Invading, taking pictures out in public I'ma flash on em' 
Thеy lift my restrictions, so I gotta show my ass on 'em 
Polo with that tag on 'em 
Bringing out that cash on em' 
Bitch I'm too official-made, nigga I'ma swag on 'em 
 walkin' with that MAC on 'em
Had to leave the city, too much killing got the tags on 'em
Moving like a landowner
Walkin' with hijabs on her
Yeah, lil bitch from Cali acting sexy with that ass on her
Pussy got a ring on it, I'ma pour some lean on it
Draco with a drum and that MAC 9, it got a beam on it 
She told me that she loved me in that state of mind 
Holdin' on to that memory, the last time you fucked me
Got me wishing I could press rewind 
You say that I'm caught up thuggin', you ain't ever lyin' 
You say that I love that money, you ain't ever lyin' 
And every time I think of something, you forever mine 
And you say that I push your buttons, I ain't even tryin'
I had to fuck you in the trap house 
Tried to pull your hair out
VL steady knocking on our door sayin' I'm too loud
Back then, Moms never paid the rent, it's overdue now
Eviction note is posted on the door, we had to move out
Now she in a two-story house
Her son who they story 'bout
His face all over news blogs
He won it from a shoot out
 gave me blue balls
I'm going for the takedown
I want that ass up, arch your back and put your face down 
She told me that she loved me in that state of mind 
Holdin' on to that memory, the last time you fucked me
Got me wishing I could press rewind 
Gotta trust me, so don't rush it, it's gon' take some time 
You say that I'm caught up thuggin', you ain't ever lyin' 
You say I only love the money, you ain't ever lyin'

        Bitch this for lil mell that thirty eight in my blood
If we ain't beating the fuck up out a nigga i don't go to no club
When he got robbed he bounced back but he couldn't shake back from the slugs
He downed first up out that cage but still ain't change he a thug
Money orders to my nigga till i drop to the bottom
And i been tryna cool my nerves i'm drankin syrup out the bottle
I'm tryna manage all my money fo to take care of my partners
Claim they want it but duckin us but they can't run from that choppa
We quick to run them niggas  hang around nun but 100 niggas 
Claim he want smoke we bring to much straight to the head
To much preacher he chock
Straight out that north but now my niggas they go hard for the four
Claim that he lookin for me  must be a stupid mother fucker
Forty Glock ain't shit to touch under my belt i want another
Said he thuggin but from my he ain't come from the struggle
Sharrona told me kill a nigga yours ain't nothin like my mother
Rappin slow that shit been gone so i don changed up for real
I wanna change but stay the same until the day i get killed
And i ain't scared except the fact cuz bitch i know what it is
Act like you scarred to speak on that bitch i just know you ain't real
I dont know why these niggas wanna murder me
And it ain't impossible for to duck that time for first degree
I feel all alone when these niggas runnin up on me
That love make him kill but it won't make them not come fuck with me
Now all this screamin slime i slimed him out for real
That slatt i whipped him out for real
That bet we knocked him down for real
I don wet uo the whole town for real
I tend to put my hands on my girl just like my daddy still
And i except yo ways but i write verses thats just how i feel
Hold on thirty shots up in that Glock dip through that lane for real
I bust a nigga brain for real look bitch i love that pain for real
Copper in that clip once it rip you feel that stainless steal
Not happy where im at for real bitch i just want one hundred mill
I dont know why these niggas wanna murder me
And it ain't impossible for to duck that time for first degree
I feel all alone when these niggas runnin up on me
That love make him kill but it won't make them not come fuck with me
Now all this screamin slime i slimed him out for real
That slatt i whipped him out for real
That bet we knocked him down for real
I don wet uo the whole town for realBae, you gon' fix- you- you gon' fix me some tea, please?
You say "Can I love you?"
So I say "Can I trust you?"
Cause pain, that's what your love do
My only question baby, can I love you?
Brung it back, for them roxys I'd scope me a seven
I posted up on 12th Street, I reroute to 11th
Money put that pussy on me
My virginity, sell it
I looked it up to her big brother, said it was narcotic selling
I came in contact with Brianna
We had started out Texas
Walked from my house meet at a 
Grandpa's house, we was at it
Start having sex unprotected
When it came out she was pregnant
She pissеd it out in the toilet and blamed mе for all the stressing
I go post up at the trap
I got my hand on some work
I went from scuffing to the one that putting shit in the dirt
I ain't on nothing, but keep it real 'til I seen it ain't work
Relocate my heart to right here, so I say "Nene the first"
My baby mama pick me and drive me out by my nigga
We seeing this dream together, we can't live it 'cause we too distant
I thought I raised you in that way, but now I see that you different
And you ain't had me in your thoughts when you was fucking them niggas
You say "Can I love you?"
So I say "Can I trust you?"
Cause pain, that's what your love do
My only question baby, can I love you?
Bitch you selfish, said you loved me
The receipt said, I read it
But you ain't shit from all this stuff, but that's if you let me tell it
A man gon' do what you allow
Give no acceptance to petty
My name spread like confetti, and I done ran up my fetty
I drop some ounces in the pot and work that shit on the stove
Monta work that microwave like "Damn girl, work that pole"
I thought that boy was 'bout his business
Paperwork came, he told
It come to this, he not affiliate
He can't hang 'cause he foul
Ben brought me in this mentions, why he talking with ho's?
Bitch I can't kill you 'cause I love you, but you know how it goes
Antoinne finesse me out my money, so the dice done been rolled
I done fell off a thousand times
You know my own I can hold
I got so much love for your wife, but she the one broke the code
Y'all sleep together through the night, and you know that shit was wrong
You know I come from out the Nawf, so you know I get it on
So when I step behind the mic, I never put my pack down
You say "Can I love you?"
So I say "Can I trust you?"
Cause pain, that's what your love do
My only question baby, can I love you?I just walked out my show with a dirty gun
I just drunk a pint i need some more i need another one
Put down my cup and picked it up its tryna tell me somethin
I can't leave my past its on me bad im tryna step on somethin
In these designer pats these ain't no verside
Get up and chase the money even when im tired
All this pain i can't hold i ain't lying
Get on them xans you start to playin here go the fine
Ima thug this a story of a nigga with no love
Pulling up seen dump fuck around and lite it up
Keep in touch i be rollin ain't no telling where i was
What thе fuck she been trippin got no time for that girl
I fell back comе cross the track im on the block with them shottas
Get em wack how many i can't even stunt its a lot of em
Plenty money but i walk around this bitch like i ain't git a dollar
Plenty choppas we spray around this bitch and take care of problems
She wanna fuck and hang around she say she slime
Got seven watches i can't seem to find the time
They talkin down and it be fuckin with my mind
But shit im good cause they ain't never saw me cry
Rode with my thugs you disrespect we go to jail bout it
Put his ass up ain't thinking twice im going to hell bout it
I show to much love but shit i can't provide for everybody
Say what you thankin see what you feelin dont be scarred bout it
I just walked out my show with a dirty gun
I just drunk a pint i need some more i need another one
Put down my cup and picked it up its tryna tell me somethin
I can't leave my past its on me bad im tryna step on somethin
In these designer pats these ain't no verside

Been in jail to many times i ain't scarred to take the charge
Diamonds flashing on them links got me blind

Slatt
Gettin' that money like a speed racer 
And all my shows, it be pandemonium 
Used to sell drugs right on dawg but J's ain't them 
Married to the money, quarters on my cranium 
Let me show you what I made, yeah 
Two hundred thousand in two days, yeah 
All this pain never stop me, that's what made me
Told me you loved me, couldn't believe you tried to play me 
I ate free lunch, then I came up in Valley Park with dawg 
Ain't gave me nothin', they criticized me, used to call me dumb 
My neck on ice and I shot dice, it wasn't for money, yo 
So many drugs, I'm gon' get life, the police runnin' here 
I can't believe you tried to play me 
I ain't had nothin' but that's what made me 
I was small but now I'm bigger
Gettin' money with all my niggas 
Every day, still tote that pistol
I'm not no public figure 
Gettin' that money like a speed racer 
And all my shows, it be pandemonium
Used to sell drugs right on dawg but J's ain't them 
Married to the money, quarters on my cranium 
Let me show you what I made, yeah 
Two hundred thousand in two days, yeah 
All this pain never stop me, that's what made me 
Told me you loved me, couldn't believe you tried to play me
Don't care what they say 'cause I'm paid
Performin' on the main stage
Money cost the police raid
I stopped goin' to school at seventeen
I accomplished all my dreams
Can you fathom slippin' lean?
Bean, bring me all the beans
Stay true to what I believe 
Percs and molly, X 
Whole lotta diamonds, flex 
Whole lotta money, bet 
I ran up a check 
Seatbelt in the studio with his daughter, I call her Princess 
Twenty-one, I'm screamin' , shoot above your head 
Let me show you what I made, yeah 
Two hundred thousand in two days, yeah 
All this pain never stop me, that's what made me 
Told me you loved me, couldn't believe you tried to play me

These dogs tote that .50, bitch I'm booted off this Adderall 
Told that bitch to lick it, after that, I wanna fuck all of y'all 
Put that X pill in her booty and she asks what's in the Tylenol

When I hope out the shop, put a hundred racks in the account
And these diamonds gon' hit $40k in my mouth
And I come from the north and they know what we 'bout
And they know that I'm rich the way that I want

Young nigga rich but steady livin' in a convict life

It kinda hurt and I still ain't found out
The fuck wrong with you nigga?
Hundred bands from Atlantic, spent that shit and went broke
 couldn't make me with that dope, I was roped out with for that four 
I started off north side, I jumped off the porch 
I built a wall around my heart, they will not hurt me no more
I fell a victim to them bitches sayin' they lovin' they dick 
Receivin' letters from my fans, not my niggas in prison 
Back in this position again, bitch you know what's the business 
Don't got no feelings, give it up bitch
If you play I'ma rip it, I spit it 
Back in the play, more time, they threw me 20 
Mega bust, I got them pints all up in several boxes
Drugs all in my system cut them out, I'm full of toxin
Bitch don't get it twisted  we really rock shit
Thuggin' in a 'Vette with my big bro, turbocharged engine
Aggravated flesh, I owe whoever engineered it
My niggas say, "I'm trippin'," I get a bitch to bite down
Wrecked your dome, I  choke him out, we 
 thought they eatin'
Do no  when a Glock sound
I'm protected by the blood of him I can't get knocked out
How the fuck you love a nigga that you would not die for?
I love every one of my niggas, they are who I ride for
Chosen potential, my career, I done walked some miles for 
You hear that lean all on my throat, but let me come outside just to tell you I'm a rider 
And what you blessed me with, everything I earned on my soul I'ma die for
A rider, I'm a ho ready to battle
Grow old, your pockets fatter
When you die you will not have it
I'm a rider 
Imitations, they get built backwards
I think it connect with feathers
I'm proud to say I'm a pastor 
Yeah,  what you know makes you a pastor 
Livin' slow, you dyin' faster 
This life's it, so what's the matter? 
Yeah, by the store I grew  faster
Want attention real quick, I clap him
He run it, I get him 
Come from the gutter, you all from a different place
Sit down for the eatin', ain't shit on the dinner place
So different I think I'm from a different place
Only some  that cover the dinner plate
Sittin', I'm thinkin' about with my younger age
I am the only I feel that could feed him
I love my son, his mama mistreat him
Put in his ear his daddy don't wanna see him
Look at a picture forever, I see him
Nene pregnant, gotta run up that money
Heard they on me, gotta stay with a burner
Never runnin', nah, except to go under
He on live showin' every little corner
It ain't hard if I wanna pull on him
Feel like "Fuck him," but my brother won't harm him
I throw him a party whenever he stormin'
Throw him a party whenever he stormin'
I get laid back for to take off his face
He outta position I put him in place
You must never heard that metal could break
I threw a cutter inside of the lake
Body on it, it's that boy talked down on me
Free , bitch I walk with that brown on it
Dog food, bitch we savin' on every cornerCall me if I'm late, but I'm still on the way
I fill up my tank, put some miles on the Wraith
I've been sipping drank, you could see it in my face
I don't want hear what you think, all this money I done made
Me and big bro we boolin'
Smokin' right now I'm coolin'
I ain't gotta tote my Ruger
One false move he'll shoot you
Shorty so wild she give me a loan
I know she gon' suck on my ruler
And see, I don't know why by the time I got back I can safe her up back, she approving
I got big, real blue Benjis
I got real slime intentions
On them glizzies put extensions
When I walk in I be drippin'
Too much smoke my head be spinnin'
We gon' get 'em a boy, no mentions
I ain't post nothin' in a minute
Still gon' bring me in they mentions
'Cause I'm the shit, you can't tell me that I'm not
Just all the money, the bank gon' call me when it drop
I been blew up, but still ain't close until I pop
I ran it up, I got enough, but still won't stop
I don't know you get the fuck up out my face
We still be rollin', put a body on that K, yeah
We catch you slipping put your brain on top that drape
Got plenty racks inside Dior, but still don't play
Call me if I'm late, but I'm still on the way
I fill up my tank, put some miles on the Wraith
I've been sipping drank, you could see it in my face
I don't want hear what you think, all this money I done made
Me and big bro we boolin'

It's too early to be fuckin' with my head
She said, "YoungBoy, why these people sayin’, 'you dead'?"

Nigga try to get bang, he bang wrong

I ain't taking these bitches I love across the world with me
She wanna pop that P-E-R-C and I'm giving her three
I ain’t talking that down, I ain't talking ain't down, I ain't paying no fee
Warning flag go down, shoot a whole hundred rounds if a nigga want beef
Yeah, shoot that blicky, take one off

Kicking this shit in Gucci covered rhinestones
Now you only like the reason I got this check, you can do it by me
Bro standing on that page, I got two or more hundred
Take a nigga head off, then I kill him, yeah
Me and him don't play at all, nah 
Hop in the trap, get it jumping like tigger

Beat a nigga ass, probably mad I ain’t kill him
I'm a real gangbanger, I don’t fuck with these niggas
Came from the back, I was in 
Same way I ride with 
 like iPhones
I'm tryna 
Anyone beef in this real Blood business
Turning lieutenant, got shooters, on God

In the back of the car everytime i be ridin
I can give you a smile with the knife in my hand
Every time that i said i never be lyin

In the pool i feel like im dyin
I can paint him a image that nigga be trippin

We can be together with no pain
When we not together mane i feel like im numb
I can put in my words to put the jewelry in the grave

Im ready to die and you know how i come
You get hit with that fire if you play with red rum

        .Lyrics from Snippet
Ridin' with a Glock and it hold thirteen, oh 
We be duckin' from the laws, they tryna capture me, oh 
Ayy, I got experience, no degrees
I done put five on the tee 
We hunt you down about that money
You ain't gotta hire me 
But fuck that, I'm out my body
I'll stick this bitch like Meech 
Just sold two birds of the guy
Before thirty-five, talkin' E
Just like walkin' to the runway
Pull up...Lyrics from snippet
Real quick I turned her to a demon, yeah
I got her scratchin' and she screamin', yeah
I'll put a Patek Philippe on your head, ayy
I got twenty bitches in my jet, dawgI just wanna let you know i’m thinking ‘bout you right now
And I really miss you and I do care about you
I’m sorry
{intro}
Just thought that I should tell you I meant everything that I said
Right now It’s time to clear yo’ head if you been mislead
And Ian never mean to hurt you if you thinking that
And Ian never wanna see me and you come to this
Tryna do better so the judge won’t come hang my ass
But I still walk around with that Glock tucked in my pants
I got diamonds on my neck and diamonds on my hands
Used to be broke but now I got a whole lotta bands
{verse}
I put you in situations when you told me to stop
I told you that I need some time, I got shit on my mind
I been feeling like my niggas don’t wanna see me on top
It ain’t a hour through the day that Ion think about dying
Sit and laugh together tell me you remember them times
Feel like you ain’t in love with me girl
You in love with my rhymes
I’m thinking maybe it’s my money
Or the way that I shine
Or is it sum about my style
How I be toting that nine 
You know I’m really thugging I be moving ‘round all day
You know if you need sum call me and I’m on my way
Got fifty thousand in my pocket with a Glock up on my waist
Won’t hesitate I’m quick to shoot ‘em 
{verse}
Come and take a ride with a thug nigga
I been mistreated my whole life for sure yo’ love with me
Ain’t got time to start over so I think it’s bout that time that we settle
Ain’t gotta worry ‘bout a thing you know I be bout whatever
Tell me what is it gon’ take for you to realize
That I’ll give you anything just to see you smile
Ain’t got no time to play games been hurt too many times
Bitch if you love me, then you love me, don’t say you staying and you not
Tell my mama that “I love her” and I love you too
Tell my sisters and my brothers that I miss them too
It won’t be long ‘till I could hug you and could hug them too
It ain’t a night I go to sleep that I don’t think ‘bout you
I had to buy a brand new chain with yo’ name on it
And even though that I got fame I got that thang on me
You told me that you wasn’t gon’ change so don’t change on me
So don’t you ever start to think that you not wanted
{outro}
Just thought that I should tell you I meant everything that I said
Right now It’s time to clear yo’ head if you been mislead
And Ian never mean to hurt you if you thinking that
And Ian never wanna see me and you come to this
Tryna do better so the judge won’t come hang my ass

Used to be broke but now I got a whole lotta bands

Living like a rockstar 
It's the thought up in the stars 
I've been living real hard 
I've been following my heart 
I put your head on a pedestal 
Finally rich, I ain't sell my soul
I'ma shoot to the top with no attitude
Exploring the world all on my own
Op with that brr and I wet a fool
I made it far, I ain't go to school
Don't let them tell you what not to do
I live like I want, I don't follow rules
Them VVS diamonds they shut 'em
Op with that tec and you know I'ma wet him
Riding that foreign with the heavy metal
 I don't worship the devil
Brand new McLaren, ain't go buy a Tesla
Niggas be starin', I hope they don't test us
Stick to the code, they think that they code
Op with the Glock and you know I'ma  
 baby, no love for the cops
On the stove  whippin' the pot
Was on the bottom now I shot to the top
Quarter million car parked on the block
LeBron James I'ma run with that rock
Had a fight in jail, I got hit with a 
 money to niggas that locked in the box
Got a lot of blue hunnids that sit in the drawer 
Big blood 
Them niggas been killin' don't know who they are
Slide on that boy then hop in the car
Panoramic, got the glass in the car
When I look up I be starin' at stars
Pray to God because I'm livin' real hard
Not sniffin' no dope but I'm a rockstar
Living like a rockstar 
It's the thought up in the stars 
I've been living real hard 
I've been following my heart 
I put your head on a pedestal 
Finally rich, I ain't sell my soul
I'ma shoot to the top with no attitude
Exploring the world all on my own
Op with that brr and I wet a fool
I made it far, I ain't go to school
Don't let them tell you what not to do
I live like I want, I don't follow rules
Same ways them same days 
Know that I'm oldschool, I'm gon spray
98' had the  with no delay 
I put it down but got the money but caught a case 
Projects, we keep the stacks  rollies
In projects we know the struggle but keep 
Big paper, them  we gon G 
Tote , we show them niggas we gon eat 
Flippin' the hundred thou then make a mill 
A hundred miles, a hundred trials, we never chill 
Same ways them same niggas who want 
Same days the same ways we gon kill 
Kill a popper
Living like a rockstar
It's the thought up in the stars 
I've been living real hard
I've been following my heart
I put your head on a pedestal
Finally rich, I ain't sell my soul
I'ma shoot to the top with no attitude
Exploring the world all on my own

Shots let out from the couple tryna leave scene safe
When I come into with you make sure my lean straight

Put pounds of weed up in the air hope they land today
Yeah stand on the block like a soldier, used to talk to Grandma right on that sofa
Talk to Dave everytime I was loaded, taught me well so I ain't never fold
Caught a traffic and they kill my lil' homie, so I'm strapped everytime that I rollin
People be speaking they act like they know me
Half of the time when they talk I be loaded
Sellin' that dope man bun postin' on the block to the sun go up
I come down and been droppin them bodies
I swear from the strap when they come out my bank and he hittin the ground 
I be talkin' to shorty she said that she love, I know she don't love me she think I'm a clown
If he be peepin' my block tryna act like he thuggin' I oak with this bitch Ima let off some ones
 It's goin down tonight, have your shit packed between might have to leave the town tonight
When they bullets fly we might not make it home tonight
Just remember it's the reason why we back tonight
Ridin' round' with that top off for a op nigga
He say he want it got a zip em, fuck a cop nigga
North side forever we gon post up on that block nigga

And we pull up like ohh, bumbaclot nigga
You ain't got no game you must be dumb don't come outside nigga

Better stay in your position don't show off for that hype nigga
You ready for the die, it's goin down tonight, have your shit packed between might have to leave the town tonight
When they bullets fly we might not make it home tonight

You ready for the die, going down tonight

You stuck with me till all was right
And you nigga till the day that i die
And for a fact you know that we gon slide
For a fact man you know that we gon ride
Im gonna tell if they kick me out up my position
Glock up on my waist ready to face any opposition

They came off from my intention
Look im really all alone nigga

Got me in my feelings, can't believe that you gone nigga
Its finna go down nigga
Screaming right or wrong nigga
Imma drop that bag till it bust every dome nigga
All the times that we live it up together ain't the same homie

Put down my gun but now when i ride i got the flame on me
Man i need yo smile i wanna cry right now

Call up my niggas and i say retaliations a must
And all that shit they laughin bout i bring it straight to the dust

Cold world, no coat, no, no, no, no, no
Heartbreak, nowhere safe
Too much pain, when will it go?
I'm stayin' strong
I look back like, "Now who done raised they tone?" 
You in this bitch with a bunch of made niggas, you get your head blown 
Walked in this bitch with a half a million up in cash, I blow it all
Came from the bottom, beat some cases, they'd love to see me fall
I say 38, 4KTrey, that's for life
Fuck all that fabricating, spray that K, take his life
I pull that Maybach out the garage and ride
How thе fuck you take that criticism? I know you tired
You ain't got no time to bе dating, I'm on that same shit
I invited you, don't give a fuck 'bout who you came with
My love for you, not for your family, I'm known to blank shit
My trust for you been oh so damaged, where my pain went
I said big brother, oh, Dump, nigga, why you leave us?
I been buyin' them foreigns back to back, these niggas can't keep up
Tryna keep my mind from out the past, I'm smokin' on reefer
Still things I'm learning, I'm tryna see how I'm gon' keep up
Watch your words, said some shit, I'm tryna see 'bout it
This guitar hold thirty-two chords, and I got that six around me
I be in my own world, they make up stories, you can ask who be 'round me
I'm so mad at this world, not carryin' this happiness, I'ma keep clowning
I look back like, "Now who done raised they tone?" 
You in this bitch with a bunch of made niggas, get your head blown
Walked in this bitch with a half a million up in cash, I blow it all 
Came from the bottom, beat some cases, they'd love to see me fall
I say 38, 4KTrey, that's for life
Fuck all that fabricating, spray that K, take his life
I pull that Maybach out the garage and ride
How the fuck you take that criticism? I know you tired
Blow out the motor, hit the E-way, do the dash, nigga
Shorted your brother on that money, I ain't mad, nigga
Patek steady bustin' from the bezel, watch it flash, nigga

Every time they play that, I pop 'em, that's why you mad, nigga
I be up in my feelings all the time, I'm a sad nigga
And you the type that I can't fuck if I can't laugh with you
Give a fuck 'bout who you is, I'm only breakin' bread with my niggas
You ain't Fat Black or Baby Joe, I don't give a fuck if I did time with you 
I look back like, "Now who done raised they tone?" 
You in this bitch with a bunch of made niggas, get your head blown
Walked in this bitch with a half a million up in cash, I blow it all
Came from the bottom, beat some cases, they'd love to see me fall

When they get mad they say some of the hurtfulest thangs
Like fuck my pain i thank god i made it out the rain

After you did what you did did it make you feel better
I knew the truth when you told me they was lyin
I let it go i let it ride do that make you feel better
I be so hurt you see the pain in my eyes
And all this money that i got ain't never make me feel better
Im feelin down but forever i rise
The same day i close my eyes maybe ill feel better
Herpes symptoms i swear that's some shit i never saw
Get on my knees and talk to go like please heal my heart
Everytime i wanna change and have a fresher start
Thats when a nigga play some games and i declare the war
Lay in the bed and i be wishing im dead
I clear my mind and then i think about the shit that you said
Get out of line then we bustin his head
He fresh for easter all white t-shirt on we leave that bitch red
And you know and i know i kept it real from the start
I know and you know the shit you said i had caught
We know and they know im kill trent behind my brother
Northside where we started im coldhearted and im scarred

Catch 'em bad and end up sprayin' somethin'
I'm like eeny-meeny-miny-mo, put my opps up in a row 
Leave one dead, I leave one dead 
D-Rose, he way from the Bulls home 
Too much money on me, bro, hold my chrome 
Nigga try to go, then you do his ass 
If you know me, you know I’m never home alone
Got XDs by the TV stand Lyrics from snippets
Money is worthless
But keep them racks and throw 'em
I showed ’em how to make a way and I got back to 'em
Came from the bottom of the ponds just like a tadpole
All my houses got alarms, still keep my strap though
Fans taking pictures while I'm throwing Bs sitting at the light, huh
Shawty real right, huh  make the right slime
I ain’t tryna be seen with her while she shopping, let her go off with a dime
I ain't say a thing, but if you want a name, I done be the wrong kind
 I be moving fast, gotta slow down time
One wrong move, that'll leave me through, so I got it all on thе line
Talking to my brother, turned to him to a god, now hе standing tall on that line...Lyrics from Snippets
I told her how them people treated me, she say I'll make it through
She called me
She asked me to come over, I was headed right there
That's all me
I told her come outside just for a kiss
Soon as I got it, told her bye, then I left
He's a dirty slime
 lover
Lately shawty drive me 'round
She fucking up my 
I told her I ain't trust her
She found out that I love her

Yo eyes the color of the ocean
Pain runnin through my head
The sky is blue
Dont pick and choose
If i want you that pain i lose
Police draw i put my hands up
They tell me "freeze and dont move" 
What if it never rain no more?
Can you be my sunshine ?
What if I end up all alone ?
Can I call you anytime?
They like whateva whateva, come with whateva we bout it
I run with cold blooded steppas and we dont run from nobody
Inside my heart it some demons, i bring em straight out my body
That GT 5 no propeller, ain't close to FE Maserati
I ain't neva pick up a pen from the last song i wrote
I done fucked up my sack again
Wait wait man i swear i dont know
One time you left, why you leave again?
Old money leave, new money come in
Soon as you leave new one come in
Imma buy a new whip with my back end
Nigga play wrong, everybody stand around, everybody gon die
Nigga take one of mine, everybody gon cry
The shit they do, it ain't my type
When i walk in the venue im the hype
Yeah
Love is poison, be my med
Grass is green
Blood is red
Yo eyes the color of the ocean
Pain runnin through my head
The sky is blue
Dont pick and choose
If i want you that pain i lose
Police draw i put my hands up
They tell me "freeze and dont move" 
What if it never rain no more?
Can you be my sunshine ?
What if I end up all alone ?

I'm walking in the shadows of both worlds
See me walking with prophets

Travelling in my merkabar to Kabbalahs source opening a door to the living dead In in the banned movie Star Trek summoning them  bending reality to my will crystallise my energy into crystal earth open a portal in the banned movie star trek pyramids on planets

        I swear I'm traumatized, whoa
I'm caught up in that fire
I swear I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride
Percs and molly in my casket so I can roll in heaven
Get a bad bitch up out of Magic, need a ho in heaven
I need me a TEC and I need me a stick, have a shootout with the devil
No weed up in my kingdom, Ben said that he need a seven, let's go
Cheat on my girl, I'ma fuck on that ho
If I go broke I'ma stick up a store
If you got to school, go strapped with a pole
Better not let a nigga come step on you, no
Got brand new shoes, don't step on my toes
I'm ready to fight with a nigga or ho
I leave out the class 'cause I gotta go
I'm gettin' head in the bathroom
They always talk 'bout me, no they don't know 'bout me
Gotta pray before I sleep, the devil talk to me
Gotta get 'em out my dreams, 'fore he take over me
Get down on my knees, like Lord don't cancel me
I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my pride
Traumatized since I was a boy
Hit the target, we don't shoot at cars
We'll shoot at 12, nigga fuck the law
Scream fuck 'em all, we forever ball
When I hit the head, watch the body fall
It's guns up when we involved
Thirty eight baby, keep my revolver
Glizzy with a dick, that's the problem solver
Traumatized, traumatized, traumatized 
Seen my main man commit suicide
It was right in front of my eyes, I couldn't even cry
To this day I don't know why, it's still eating my insides
We gon' stand tall, we don't play soft
Catch 'em down bad and shoot his face off
I been puttin' in overtime, nigga I'ma take off
Gotta get it every minute, we don't take no days off, oh
I swear I'm traumatized, caught in that fire
Lot of bullets flying, whole lot of people dying
I swear I'm traumatized, I'm hypnotized
Like I'm a reaper, I see blood when I open my eyes
Won't sacrifice my child, 2020 we all will die
I'ma go fly high in the sky, take a doll and I pop out his eyes
Hit the gas and I jump out the ride, I'm causin' suicide
Head on collision, collateral damage, I'm letting go of my prideShow 'em I'm smart society gon' try and take it
I play my part to override what I'm facing
Preach to them yungins hold yo own you gon' make it
True to yourself, you make a promise don't break it
I'm like amen, hallelujah
I keep it moving, niggas say they wanna do me
I upgraded all my shooters
I'm like amen, hallelujah
Bitch you know this movie, nigga say he keep his toolie
I'm like bitch you better use it
Back to back taking them percocets
Hi-Tec it take away all the stress
A nigga like me you ain't never met
Sippin' that lean it give me a rush
Stack up that money you know it's a must
I am a Zo, in Kodak I trust
Think fore you speak or you'll get yo head bust
Straight out the mud I come from the dust
Try to take some then you out of luck
I'm never slippin'
They talkin' that shit but I don't give a fuck{Hook:}
Gotta watch who around you
You better not get your self caught in them schemes
We ain't the same i dont believe what you leave
In what you believe
I can't live forever i know someday that i gotta leave
Can't get caught  in the fame if i go broke i know they gone leave
X2
{Verse:}
Thought we was forever , no i wasn't ready for you to just leave
This shit ain't forever , i know someday its all gone leave im in love with that drank back to back sippin that lean
