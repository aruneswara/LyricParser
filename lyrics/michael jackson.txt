She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" 
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Hoo!
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
 Do think twice! 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
Hee!
Hoo!
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
 
But she came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume 
This happened much too soon 
She called me to her room 
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
She says he is my son 
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover...Aaow!
Cha!
Shoo-cha-choo-cha!
As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?

There's a sound at the window
Then he struck you — a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
Left the bloodstains on the carpet
And then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been hit by—
A Smooth Criminal
Aaow!
So they came into the outway
It was Sunday, what a black day
Every time I tried to find him
There were no clues, they’re behind him
And they end up never knowing
Who’s the suspect or what to expect
Mouth-to-mouth resuscitation
Sounding heartbeats, intimidation
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay? Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Annie, are you okay? Are you okay?

Annie, are you okay? Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by—
You've been struck by—
A Smooth Criminal
Choo-cha, choo-cha
Aaow!
Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
Aaow!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Hoo!
Aaow!
Annie, are you okay? 
Will you tell us that you're okay? 
There's a sound at the window 
Then he struck you, a crescendo Annie? 
He came into your apartment 
Left bloodstains on the carpet 
And then you ran into the bedroom 
You were struck down
It was your doom Annie 
Annie are you okay?

He came into your apartment, 
Left bloodstains on the carpet

You were struck down 
It was your doom Annie 
Aaow!
Aaow!
Shoo-cha-choo, shoo-cha-choo!
Aaow!
Aaow!Ayy, wild things you're doin' at night
Trips to wherever feels right
Doin' it all just to feel things
Drinking's enough of a vice
Drugs just aren't suiting you right
You were just fine as a real thing, thing
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
I can't recover from our last conversation
You called me weak
And you tested my manhood as we yelled at each other
You wanted me to gon' put my hands on you
Just to show you I love you
You know I can't jeopardize both our reputations
Despite what you say
Despite what you choose to do with yourself this summer
You're actin' out, you know you love to see me down
Stressin' over somethin' 
You, you, you, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
I don't know what you're sayin'
You, you, you know
That's not the way to get over me
All of a sudden you say you don't want me no more
All of a sudden you say that I closed the door
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
It don't matter to me
It don't matter to me what you say
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heart
Girl, your love, you think you broke it
I'm leavin' you today, you broke my heartAll I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Don't worry what people say, we know the truth
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Enough is enough of this garbage
All I want to say is that they don't really care about us
Skin head, dead head, everybody gone bad
Situation, aggravation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Bang bang, shot dead, everybody's gone mad
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Beat me, hate me, you can never break me
Will me, thrill me, you can never kill me
Jew me, sue me, everybody do me
Kick me, kike me, don't you black or white me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Tell me, what has become of my life?
I have a wife and two children who love me
I am the victim of police brutality, now
I'm tired of being the victim of hate
You're ripping me of my pride, oh, for God's sake
I look to heaven to fulfill its prophecy, set me free
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Trepidation, speculation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Black male, blackmail, throw the brother in jail
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Tell me, what has become of my rights?
Am I invisible 'cause you ignore me?
Your proclamation promised me free liberty, now
I'm tired of being the victim of shame
They're throwing me in a class with a bad name
I can't believe this is the land from which I came
You know, I really do hate to say it
The government don't wanna see
But if Roosevelt was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, speculation, everybody, litigation
Beat me, bash me, you can never trash me
Hit me, kick me, you can never get me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
Some things in life
They just don't wanna see
But if Martin Luther was livin'
He wouldn't let this be, no, no
Skin head, dead head, everybody's gone bad
Situation, segregation, everybody, allegation
In the suit, on the news, everybody, dog food
Kick me, kike me, don't you wrong or right me
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about us
All I wanna say is that they don't really care about usI said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying 
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under

And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
If you can't feed your baby 
You'll be always trying
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustling, stealing, lying
Now baby's slowly dyin'
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over

You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

For once in my life
Gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Na-na-na na-na-na nana-nana
I've been a victim of a selfish kinda love
It's time that I realize
There are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me pretending that they're not alone
A willow deeply scarred, somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind, ya see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart 
Then you close your mind 
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror
 I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that
Change!
Woo, woo  woo, woo, woo, woo, woo
Gonna feel real good 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh no
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, Shamone 
Just lift yourself, you know
You've got to start with yourself,  hoo!
 I gotta make that change today, woo!
 You got to, you got to not pick yourself, brother, hoo! 
You know 
I've gotta get that man, that man 
You got to, you got to move, Shamone, Shamone
You got to stand up  stand up  stand up, stand up and lift yourself now 
Hoo, hoo, hoo! Ow! 
Make that change, Shamone 
You know it, you know it, you know it, you know 
Make that change!It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
But all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight
Night creatures call and the dead start to walk in their masquerade
There's no escaping the jaws of the alien this time
They're open wide
This is the end of your life, ooh
They're out to get you
There's demons closing in on every side
They will possess you
Unless you change that number on your dial
Now is the time
For you and I to cuddle close together, yeah
All through the night
I'll save you from the terror on the screen
I'll make you see
That this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years 
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver 
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!Looking out, across the nighttime
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
 Why? Oh, why?
 Why? Oh, why?
Looking out, across the morning
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why , why 
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha 
Why , why , does he do me that way?

Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!

Ooh, tell 'em!

If they say why , why 
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da-da
Why , why , does he do me that way?
I like living this way
Why? Oh, why? 
Why? Oh, why? 
Why? Oh, why? They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it 
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man 
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it 
Just beat it 
Just beat it 
Just beat it 
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it, just beat it 
You have to show them that you're really not scared 
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare 
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it, beat it, beat it, beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight

No one wants to be...Think about the generations and say that we wanna make it a better place for our children, and our children's children, so that they, they, they know it's a better world for them, and think, if they can make it a better place...
There's a place in your heart
And I know that it is love
And this place could be much brighter than tomorrow
And if you really try
You'll find there's no need to cry
In this place, you will feel there's no hurt or sorrow
There are ways to get there
If you care enough for the living
Make a little space
Make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
If you want to know why
There's a love that cannot lie
Love is strong, it only cares for joyful giving
If we try, we shall see
In this bliss, we cannot feel
Fear or dread, we stop existing and start living
Then it feels that always
Love's enough for us growing
So make a better world
To make a better world
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
And the dream we were conceived in will reveal a joyful face
And the world we once believed in will shine again in grace
Then why do we keep strangling life?
Would this Earth crucify its soul?
Though it's plain to see
This world is heavenly
Be God's glow
We could fly so high
Let our spirits never die
In my heart, I feel you are all my brothers
Create a world with no fear
Together, we'll cry happy tears
See the nations turn their swords into
Ploughshares
We could really get there
If you cared enough for the living
Make a little space
To make a better place
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me
And the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place
For you and for me
Heal the world
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Heal the world 
Make it a better place
For you and for me and the entire human race
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
There are people dying
If you care enough for the living
Make a better place for you and for me
Make a better place 
Make a better place 
Make a better place 
Heal the world we live in 
Save it for our children 
Heal the world we live in 
Save it for our children 
Heal the world we live in 
Save it for our children 
Heal the world we live in 
Save it for our childrenYou'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

Yeah, right. Too late. Sure. Eat this
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
Now, I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the going gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places, faces
Where your blood comes from is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinking of being my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's tough for you to get by
It's black, it's whiteYou know, I was
I was wondering, you know
If you could keep on
Because the force
It's got a lot of power
And it make me feel like ah
It make me feel like… ooh!
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperatures rising now
Power is the force, the vow 
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why 
So get closer 
To my body now
Just love me
Till you don't know how 
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Touch me and I feel on fire
Ain't nothing like a love desire 
I'm melting 
Like hot candle wax
Sensation 
Lovely where we're at
So let love take us through the hours
I won't be complaining 
'Cause this is love power 
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force, don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone

In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me not alone
Oh together together
Not not being alone
Not not being aloneI don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had

I cannot explain these things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me, fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you'll need

I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I 
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life

Ahnest du den Schöpfer, Welt?
Such' ihn über'm Sternenzelt!
Über Sternen muss er wohnen
Hold me
Like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee
You are my friend
Carry me
Like you are my brother
Love me like a mother
Will you be there?
Weary
Tell me will you hold me
When wrong, will you scold me
When lost will you find me?
But they told me
A man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end
But I'm only human
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show it to me?
That you'll be there for me and care enough to bear me
Hold me
Show me
Lay your head lowly
Told me
Softly then boldly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human
Lead me
Hold me
Love me and feed me
Yeah, yeah
Kiss me and free me
Yeah
I will feel blessed
I'm only human
Carry

Carry me boldly
Carry me
Lift me up slowly
Yeah
Carry me there
I'm only human!
Save me
Lift me
Heal me and bathe me
Lift me up, lift me up
Softly you say to me
I will be there
I will be there
Lift me
Lift me up slowly
Carry me boldly
Yeah
Show me you care
Hold me
Hoo!
Lay your head lowly
It gets lonely sometimes
I get lonely, yeah, yeah
Softly then boldly
Carry me there
Need me
Hoo!
Love me and feed me
Lift me up, hold me up
Lift me up sometimes, up sometimes
Kiss me and free me
I will feel blessed
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care?
Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part
For you're always in my heartI'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!
I'm tired of you telling, the story your way
You're causing confusion, you think it's okay, damn it!
You keep changing the rules, while I'm playing the game
I can't take it much longer, I think I might go insane!
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream?
Make you want to scream?
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You find your pleasure scandalizing every lie
Oh Father, please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop fuckin' with me, make me want to scream!
Oh my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned the TV
This evening, I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice! 
(A man has been brutally beaten to death by police
After being wrongly
Identified as a robbery suspect!
The man was an 18 year-old black male!)
With such delusions don't it make you want to scream? 
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!
Oh brother please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!When the world is on your shoulder
Gotta straighten up your act and boogie down
If you can't hang with the feelin'
Then there ain't no room for you in this part of town
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all 
Live your life off the wall 
You can shout out all you want to
'Cause there ain't no sin in folks all gettin' loud
If you take the chance and do it
Then there ain't no one who's gonna put you down
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself 
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you
Life ain't so bad at all
If you live it off the wall
Life ain't so bad at all 
Live your life off the wall 
Do what you want to do
There ain't no rules, it's up to you 
It's time to come alive
And party on right through the night 
Gotta hide your inhibitions
Gotta let that fool loose deep inside your soul
Wanna see an exhibition 
Better do it now before you get too old
'Cause we're the party people night and day
Livin' crazy, that's the only way
So tonight, gotta leave that nine to five upon the shelf
And just enjoy yourself 
Groove, let the madness in the music get to you

Life ain't so bad at all I just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I doEvery night she walks right in my dreams
Since I met her from the start
I'm so proud I am the only one
Who is special in her heart
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine, m-m-m
I know she's mine
Because the doggone girl is mine m-m-m
I don't understand the way you think
Saying that she's yours, not mine
Sending roses and your silly dreams
Really just a waste of time
Because she's mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
I love you more than he
Well I love you endlessly
So come and go with me
To one's town
But we both cannot have her
So it's one or the other
And one day you'll discover
That she's my girl forever and ever
Don't build your hopes to be let down
'Cause I really feel it's time
I know she'll tell you I'm the one for her
'Cause she said I blow her mind
The girl is mine
The doggone girl is mine
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
She's mine, she's mine
No, no, no, she's mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
The girl is mine ; yep, she's mine 
The girl is mine ; yeah, she's mine 
Don't waste your time
Because the doggone girl is mine
The girl is mine, the girl is mine
Michael, we're not going to fight about this, okay?
Ha, ha, Paul, I think I told you I'm a lover, not a fighter
Eh, I've heard it all before, Michael
She told me that I'm her forever lover, you know, don't you remember?
Well, after loving me she said she couldn't love another
Is that what she said?
Yeah, she said it; you keep dreaming

Ooh
I love you, baby
I want it, baby
OohI was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feeling insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was dogging me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a beggar boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came and again, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel 
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside?
Like a stranger in Moscow
Lord have mercy
Like a stranger in Moscow, hee!
Lord have mercy
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talking danger
We're talking danger, baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm living lonely
I'm living lonely, baby
Stranger in Moscow
Why have you come from the West
Confess, to steal the great achievements of the people
The accomplishments of the workerThe way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line 
Come go with me
I said I have no time 
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone 
My baby cried 
She left me standing alone 
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous 
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch
A kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew
But I was living in vain 
She called my house
She said you know my name 
And don't you pretend
You never did me before  
With tears in her eyes  
My baby walked out the door 
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous 
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
Hee-hee!
Oooh!
Oooh!
Hoo!
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
Cause it's dangerous
Dangerous 
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money
Throw away my time 
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous 
The girl is so dangerous  
Take away my money 
Throw away my time 
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous 
The girl is so dangerous 
Take away my money 
Throw away my time 
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous 
The girl is so dangerous  
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Freind of mine
Hoo!

I don't care what you talkin' 'bout, baby
I don't care what you say
Don't you come walkin' beggin' back, mama
I don't care anyway
Time after time I gave you all of my money
No excuses to make
Ain't no mountain that I can't climb baby
All is goin' my way
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?
So just leave me alone, girl 
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl 
Leave me alone–stop it!
Just stop doggin' me around 
Hee-hee!
Hoo-hoo!
There was a time I used to say "Girl, I need you"
But who is sorry now?
You really hurt, you used to take and deceive me
Now who is sorry now?
You got a way of makin' me feel so sorry
I found out right away
Don't you come walkin', beggin', I ain’t lovin' you
Don't you get in my way
('Cause there's a time when you're right
And you know you must fight)
Who's laughin', baby? Don't you know
(And there's the choice that we make
And this choice you will take)
Who's laughin', baby?
So just leave me alone, girl 
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl

Don't come beggin'
I love you
I don't want it
I don't need it
I don't love yaI gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
It is a friend of mine?
Is it my brother?
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can’t take this stuff no more
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me
And she promised me forever
That we'd live our life as one
We made our vows
We'd live a love so true
It seems that she has left me
For such reasons unexplained
I need to find the truth
But see what will I do
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
It is a friend of mine?
Is it my brother?
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
Hee-hee, hee-hee!
Don't try to pick me
Don't try, quit it
I never was, I never would
Just won't stop
Don't bother me
Don't bother me
It is a friend of mine?
Tell me, I'm bothered!
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
And it doesn't seem to matter 
And it doesn't seem right 
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure 
'Cause I'm lying to myself

And it doesn't seem right
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
'Cause I'm bothered every day
And she didn't leave a letter
She just upped and ran away
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right 
'Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure

'Cause I'm lying to myself 
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself

You have to rub it
She wants to give it

Now I'm just wonderin', why you think
That you can get to me, with anything
Seems like you'd know by now, when and how I get down
And with all that I've been through, I'm still around
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes
And there's no way you'll ever get to me
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me?
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you, baby
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
Oh, dah, ah, well, ah, ah
Now you can't stop me, even though you think
That if you block me, you've done your thing, ah
And when you bury me underneath all your pain
I'm steady laughin', hah, while surfacing
Don't you ever make no mistake
Baby, I've got what it takes 
And there's no way you'll ever get to me 
Why can't you see that you'll never ever hurt me 
'Cause I won't let it be, see I'm too much for you baby
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can't believe it, you can't conceive it
And you can't touch me, 'cause I'm untouchable
And I know you hate it, and you can't take it
You'll never break me, 'cause I'm unbreakable
You can try to stop me, but it won't do a thing
No matter what you do, I'm still gonna be here
Through all your lies and silly games
I'ma still remain the same, I'm  un-  breakable

We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you are always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like BenThere'll be no darkness tonight
Lady, our love will shine 
Just put your trust in my heart
And meet me in paradise 
Girl, you're every wonder in this world to me

She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my lifeButterflies

He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
Listen, I got problems of my own
Flashing cameras, taps on my phone
Even in my home, I ain’t safe as I should be
Things always missing, maybe it could be
My friends, but they ain’t friends if they robbing me
Stopping me, from making a profit, see
Apology shallow like the ocean
I guess I'll resort to gun-totin'
If I was dead broke and smoking
I'd probably be by my lonesome
I'ma kill a nigga, I ain’t joking
Indo smoke got me choking, I'm hoping
A fool come slipping, so I can blow him open
This time around I changed up my flow
Got rid of the Rotts, got Pits by the door
A real set of peoples to watch my back
Stay away from strangers so I won't slack
And I know my nigga Mike like that
Baby
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought, they thought they really had control of me
This time around, babe!
He really thoughtHave you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me
People say I'm not okay
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood
I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like pirates in adventurous dreams
Of conquest and kings on the throne
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
Look within your heart then ask
Have you seen my Childhood?
People say I'm strange that way
Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my ChildhoodReady?
One, two, three, four
This is it, here I stand
I'm the light of the world, I feel grand
Got this love, I can feel
And I know yes for sure, it is real
And it feels as though I've seen your face a thousand times
And you said you really know me too yourself
And I know that you have got addicted with your eyes
But you say you going to live it for yourself, oh
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan 
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand
This is it, I can say
I'm the light of the world, runaway
We can feel, this is real
Every time I'm in love, that I feel
And I feel as though I've known you since a thousand years
And you tell me that you've seen my face before
And you said to me you don't want me hanging 'round
Many times want to do it here before, oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan 
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, baby, just understand

Feel my song, we can say
And I tell you I feel that way
And I feel as though I've known you for a thousand years
And you said you want some of this yourself
And you said you want to go with me all the while
And I know that it's really true myself, oh yeah
I never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my plan 
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please dear, understand 
Ah-ayy

Falling in love wasn't my plan 
I never thought that I would be your lover
Come on, please dear, understand 
Never heard a single word about you
Falling in love wasn't my planSmile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smileWhat you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
What you're gonna do, cause I'm gonna get you
No where to run no where to hide
All the things you said, and the things you've done to me
You can no longer make me cry
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile, baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on
I'm the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
You tricked me nine to five, loving you is a crime
People telling me, you got another guy
I been abused, watch me light in fuse
Said you'd be my wife, nothing but big lies
Don't know what I've done, everything you got
Things you done to me, are coming back to you
You know just what I've done, the things you done to me
I'm the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta
What you're gonna do
You ain't no friend of mine
The blue gangsta
See, I am so amused to the things you said
And the things you have done to me
There is nothing in this world to make me change
You make me want to sing
Aaaah

You ain't no friend of mine
Look what you put me through
Now that I am the blue gangsta

Dom Sheldon is a cold manYour love is magical, that's how I feel
But I have not the words here to explain
Gone is the grace for expressions of passion
But there are worlds and worlds of ways to explain
To tell you how I feel
But I am speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
When I'm with you I am lost for words, I don't know what to say
My head's spinning like a carousel, so silently I pray
Helpless and hopeless, that's how I feel inside
Nothing's real, but all is possible if God is on my side
When I'm with you I'm in the light where I cannot be found
It's as though I am standing in the place called Hallowed Ground
Speechless , speechless , that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away and nothing is for real
I'd go anywhere and do anything just to touch your face
There's no mountain high I cannot climb
I'm humbled in your grace
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am far away, and nothing is for real
Speechless, speechless, that's how you make me feel
Though I'm with you I am lost for words and nothing is for real
Speechless
Your love is magical, that's how I feel
But in your presence I am lost for words
Words like
Like, "I love you"Money
Money
Lie for it
Spy for it
Kill for it
Die for it
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do me for the money
They don't care, they use me for the money
So you go to church and read the holy word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care
They'd kill for the money
Do or dare
The thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge
You're called the "Just Few"
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
If you show me the cash, then I will take it
If you tell me to cry, then I will fake it
If you give me a hand, then I will shake it
You would do anything for money
Anything, anything 
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything 
Anything for money 
Would lie for you
Would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
Insurance?
Where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers
'Cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie, then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt, then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance, then you will dare it
You would do anything for money
Anything, anything 
Anything for money 
Would lie for you, would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything 
Anything for money 
Would lie for you, would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything 
Anything for money 
Would lie for you, would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
Anything, anything 
Anything for money 
Would lie for you, would die for you 
Even sell my soul to the devil
You say you wouldn't do it
For all the money in the world, I don't think so
If you show me the man, then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie, then I will tell him
If you're dealing with God, then you will hell him
You would do anything for money
Anything
Anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
Even sell my soul to the devilI wake up my girl, get me mad right

Life's about a dream
I'm really undefeated when MJ's on my team
Theme
Reality brings forth realism
It's the man of steel
Organism, T.W.I.S.M

It's on my mind
And nothing really matters
I've got to be on time
Look in the view mirror
Is he hot on my tracks?
Is he getting nearer?
I feel some heat is on my back
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
Doing it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
Mind is like a compass
I'm stopping at nothing
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Ain't nothing gonna stop me
Ain't no stop and go
I'm speeding on the midway
I gotta really burn this road
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
Doing it on the highway
Gotta have it my way
Mind is like a compass
I'm stopping at nothing
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Speed demon, you're the very same one
Who said the future's in your hands, the life you save could be your own
You're preaching about my life like you're the law
Gonna live each day and hour like for me there's no tomorrow
Go!
Go!
Go!
Aaow!
Speedin' on the freeway
Gotta get a leadway
Got fire in my pocket
I just lit a rocket
Just pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket right
Just pull over, boy, and eat your ticket
Pull over, boy
Pull over, boy, and get your ticket rightSpeculate to break the one you hate
Circulate the lie you confiscate
Assassinate and mutilate
As the hounding media in hysteria
Who's the next for you to resurrect
JFK exposed the CIA
Truth be told the grassy knoll
As the blackmail story in all your glory
It's slander
You say it's not a sword
But with your pen you torture men
You'd crucify the Lord
And you don't have to read it, read it
And you don't have to eat it, eat it
To buy it is to feed it, feed it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Though everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual, actual
They say he's homosexual
In the hood
Frame him if you could
Shoot to kill
To blame him if you will
If he dies sympathize
Such false witnesses
Damn self-righteousness
In the black
Stab me in the back
In the face
To lie and shame the race
Heroine and Marilyn
As the headline stories of
All your glory
It's slander
With the words you use
You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Then why do we keep fooling ourselves
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
Everybody wants to read all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine
Or see it on the TV screen
Don't make it factual
See, but everybody wants to believe all about it
Just because you read it in a magazine

She's blonde and she's bisexual
Scandal

You're a parasite in black and white
Do anything for news
And you don't go and buy it, buy it
And they won't glorify it, 'fy it
To read it sanctifies it, 'fies it
Why do we keep fooling ourselves
Slander
You say it's not a sin
But with your pen you torture men

'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that
We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking

Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children

Where she was all alone
And so was I
So I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that
Was really into me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a place
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She lied to you, lied to me
Thought she was loving me, loving me
Yeah
I never would have thought she was living like that
Her words seemed so sincere
When I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl, she had to be
An angel sent from heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised her kids the very best she can

Loving me while she was still your wife
She thought that loving me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
Yeah
Why.. Ooh no
Alright
Ohh
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man

With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She lied to you, lied to me
Because she had a family, family
YeahHold my hand, feel the touch of your body cling to mine
You and me, making love all the way through another night
I remember you and I walking through the park at night
Kiss and touch, nothing much, let it blow just touch and go
Love me more, never leave me alone by house of love
People talk, people say what we have is just a game
Oh, I’ll never let you go, come here girl
Just got to make sweet love ‘til the break of dawn
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
Hold my hand, feel the sweat, yes you’ve got me nervous yet
Let me groove, let me soothe, let me take you on a cruise
There’s imagination I bet you've never been there before
Have you ever wanted to dream about those places you’ve never known
 there’s no sun up in the sky
 I can see it in your eyes
 girl you got to understand
It’s the way that I love you, let me show you I’m your man
Break of dawn
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
Let’s not wait, the sun is out, let’s get up and let’s get out
It’s the day, a brand new day, let’s both go outside and play
Let us walk down the park, making love ‘til it’s dark
Let me move, let me soothe, ‘til the break of dawn and you know it’s true, oh
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
I don’t want the sun to shine I want to make love
Just this magic in your eyes and in my heart
I don’t know what I’m going to do - I can’t stop loving you
I won’t stop ‘til break of dawn making love
Break it downLike a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
Born to amuse
To inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night
Like a sunset
Dying at the rising of the moon
Gone too soon
Gone too soonHe gives a nervous smile, tries to understand her side
To show that he cares
She can't stay in the room
She's consumed with everything that's been going on
She says
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Everything will be alright, he assures her
But she doesn't hear a word that he says
Preoccupied, she's afraid
Afraid that what they're doing is not right
He doesn't know what to say, so he prays
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
Don't let go of my hand
He's working day and night, thinks he'll make her happy
Forgetting all the dreams that he had
He doesn't realize it's not the end of the world
It doesn't have to be that bad
She tries to explain, "It's you that makes me happy"
Whatever, whatever, whatever
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't let go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you go of my hand
Whatever happens, don't you let go of my hand
Whatever happens, just don't let go of my hand
Thank you, man
Thank you, CarlosAs I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, then got out, and looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling, like a mist
So I walked down, toward the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
As she took me right through the fog
I saw a beautiful city appear
Where kids are playing and people are laughing and smiling and nothing to fear
She says this is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down in my eyes, and started crying, and grabbed my hand, you've got a friend
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done, it really looked like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds, and the flowers, surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness, how in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket, took my wallet all out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought, you could be in another world
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no nameYou can't win, you can't break even

Baby I’ll stay, Heaven can wait

I would tell them bring me back to her
It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay
Heaven can wait
You're beautiful, you're wonderful
Incredible, I love you so
You’re beautiful
Each moment spent with you is simply wonderful
This love I have for you girl it’s incredible
And I don’t know what I’d do, if I can’t be with you
The world could not go on so every night I pray
If the Lord should come for me before I wake
I wouldn’t want to go if I can’t see your face, can’t hold you close
What good would Heaven be
If the angels came for me I’d tell them no
Tell the angels no, I don’t want to leave my baby alone

It’s a chance I’ll take, maybe I’ll stay
Heaven can wait
Unthinkable
Me sitting up in the clouds and you are all alone
The time might come around when you’d be moving on
I’d turn it all around and try to get back down to my baby girl
Can’t stand to see nobody kissing, touching her
Couldn’t take nobody loving you the way we were
What good would Heaven be
If the angels come for me I’d tell them no
Tell the angels no, I don’t want to leave my baby alone

Leave us alone

Leave us alone
Please leave us alone
Please leave us alone
Oh, leave me alone
Please leave me alone
I said leave me aloneWell, well, uh
Well, well
If I could tear down these walls that keep you and I apart
I know I could claim your heart and our perfect love will start
But, girl, you just won't approve of the things that I do
When all I do is for you but still you say it ain't cool
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
Why can't you feelin' me 
I can do anything 
Even when I beg and plead 
Girl won't give in to me 
Well, well
See
Well, well
C'mon now, oh
Now many times I've told you of all the things I would do
But I can't seem to get through no matter how I try to
So tell me how does it seem that you ain't checking for me
When I know that I could be more than you could ever dream
If there's somebody else, he can't love you like me
And he says he'll treat you well, he can't treat you like me
And he's buying diamonds and pearls, he can't do it like me
And he's taking you all across the world, he can't trick you like me
Why can't you feelin' me, c'mon now 
I can do anything 
Even when I beg and plead, c'mon now 
Girl won't give in to me 
Now some way I'll have to prove all that I said I would do
Giving you everything, fulfilling your fantasy
Then maybe you'll change your mind and finally give in time
Then I'll be showing you what other men are supposed
To do for you, my baby
Yo, mami, stop the fronting, I'm real with mine
All the things that I promised, I'll fulfill in time
Chains and the bracelet, got the realest shine
So many trips, ya'll have jetlag and still be fine 
You can trip, but this money ain't long enough
He can spit, but his game ain't strong enough
Now the way you resisting, this ain't cool
It's like nothing seems to work, she's invincible
Why can't you feelin' me, c'mon now 
I can do anything, c'mon now 
Even when I beg and plead, c'mon now 
That girl won't give in to me, ohh 
You ain't feelin' me, whoa, yeah 
She's invincible, yeah 
Why ain't you tellin' me, baby 
Why can't you feelin' me, yeah 
You see that girl won't give in to me, yeah, yeah 
Why can't you feelin' me, c'mon now 
I can do anything, c'mon now 
Even when I beg and plead, c'mon now 
That girl won't give in to me, yeah, yeah Somebody killed little Susie
The girl with the tune
Who sings in the daytime at noon
She was there screaming
Beating her voice in her doom
But nobody came to her soon
A fall down the stairs
Her dress torn
Oh the blood in her hair
A mystery so sullen in air
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair
Everyone came to see
The girl that now is dead
So blind stare the eyes in her head
And suddenly a voice from the crowd said
This girl lived in vain
Her face bear such agony, such strain
But only the man from next door
Knew Little Susie and how he cried
As he reached down
To close Susie's eyes
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
Oh the blood in her hair
It was all for God's sake
For her singing the tune
For someone to feel her despair
To be damned to know hoping is dead and you're doomed
Then to scream out
And nobody's there
She knew no one cared
Father left home, poor mother died
Leaving Susie alone
Grandfather's soul too had flown
No one to care
Just to love her
How much can one bear
Rejecting the needs in her prayers
Neglection can kill
Like a knife in your soul
Oh it will
Little Susie fought so hard to live
She lie there so tenderly
Fashioned so slenderly
Lift her with care
So young and so fairShe's got the look, she's so fine
And you know damn well the girl will be mine
She's got the breaks, she's the scene
And you know damn well she gives it to me
Uh-huh!
Black jeans and a turtleneck sweater

She only knows how low that she can go
She speaks the lines that can control my mind
Wherever she goes I know my eyes follow
She blew a kiss, I swear that it was meant
Only for me, then spoke with her body
Her only goal is just to take control
And I can't believe  that I can´t tell her no
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
She plays a game with such an innocent face
I didn't know heartbreaking was her case
Her actions confess and put me through the test
I was surprised that I was caught inside
Now she's thinking that I will never know
And she'll keep playing until I let her go
But I hope in time that she will finally realize
I'm onto her game and she'll get played the same
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreaker
I never thought that I would stop dreaming about you
Stop being without you
But everyone told me so, to stop caring about you
And start being without you
But I’ll find a way to go and start doing without you
And stop talking about you
And what will she say?
She will say I was the man that got away
You playing, huh?
I thought it was love with this game, huh?
When your dealing with the emotions of pain, huh?
Take a closer look when your dealing with a stranger
I can't change her, no
Heart murder in place then you'll see
A one hill from Pepsi, they see
One hard player, she's a star player
I need this crap, huh?
I didn't see the heartbreaker, so come on
That girl I can't take her
Should have known she was a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her she's a heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen it coming heartbreaker
That girl I can't take her
Should have seen right through her
She's a heartbreakerOnce, all alone
I was lost, in a world of strangers

If they're somewhere out on the streetTonight’s story is somewhat unique and calls for a different kind of introduction
A monster had arrived in the village
The major ingredient of any recipe for fear is the unknown
And this person or thing is soon to be met
He knows every thought, he can feel every emotion
Oh yes, I did forget something didn’t I? I forgot to introduce you to the monster
You’re fearing me, ‘cause you know I’m a beast
Watching you when you sleep, when you’re in bed, I’m underneath
You’re trapped in halls, and my face is the walls
I’m the floor when you fall, and when you scream, it’s ‘cause of me
I’m the living dead, the dark thoughts in your head
I heard just what you said
That’s why you’ve got to be threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
You think you’re by yourself, but it’s my touch you felt
I’m not a ghost from Hell, but I’ve got a spell on you
Your worst nightmare, it's me, I'm everywhere 
In one blink I’ll disappear, and then I’ll come back to haunt you
I’m telling you, when you lie under tomb
I’m the one watching you
That’s why you got to be threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
The unknown monster is about to embark
From a far corner, out of the dark
A nightmare, that’s the case
Never Neverland, that’s the place
This particular monster can read minds
Be in two places at the same time
This is judgment night, execution, slaughter
The devil, ghosts, this monster is torture
You can be sure of one thing, that’s fate
A human presence that you feel is strange
A monster that you can see disappear
A monster, the worst thing to fear
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened 
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened 
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened 
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened 
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened 
While you sleep, while you creep, you should be threatened 
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened  
Half of me you’ll never be, so you should feel threatened by me

Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life

There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door

But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity

And will the sun ever shine
In the blind man's eyes when he cries?

Is to reach for the truth, the truth

If sending your love is all you can give
To help one live

Helping one heal

To love and to teach you

Brother to brother

Just sending your love has the power to heal
So let's all give
What have I got that I can give?

To love and to teach you
To hold and to need you

The system's in control, it's all ran by the book
I've got to get away so I can clear my mind
Escape is what I need, away from electric eyes
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They then lie on my name, and put them town to town
Don't have a place to run, but there's no need to hide
I've got to, find a place, but I won't hide away
Escape
Got to get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships
Got to go away
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape
I do what I want to cause
I got to face nobody but me
Escape
I tried to share my life with someone I could love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to?
When it’s my personal life then I don’t live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
To be concerned about you, I can do what I want to
Escape
Got to get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships
Got to go away
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape
I do what I want to cause
I got to face nobody but me
Escape
When I go
This problem world won't bother
Me no more
Escape
Got to get away from a system
Lose in the world today
Escape
The pressure that I face from relationships
Got to go away
Escape
The man with the pen
That writes the lies that hassle this man
Escape
I do what I want to cause
I got to face nobody but me
EscapeIt's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the bein' in love that makes me cry, cry
You think we're fallin' in love
Got me fallin' in love
You're not like anybody I ever knew
But that don't mean that I don't know where we are
And though I found myself attracted to you
This time I am trying not to go too far, 'cause
No matter how it starts, it ends the same
Someone's always doin' someone more
Trading in the passion for that taste of pain
It's only gonna happen again
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
And though I am tryin' not to look in your eyes
Each time I do, they kind of burn right through me
Don't wanna lay down in a bed full of lies
And yet my heart is sayin', "Come and do me!"
Now we're just a web of mystery
A possibility of more to come
I'd rather leave the bed to see of what might be
But here I go fallin' again
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry, cry, cry
Over you, over you 
It's the fallin' in love 
Got me fallin' in love 
Cry, Cry, Cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
I'm fallin' in love 
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
I'm fallin' in love 
I'm fallin', I'm fallin', I'm fallin'
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
It's the fallin' in love that's makin' me high
It's the being in love that makes me cry, cry, cry
I'm fallin' in love 
I'm fallin'Love was taken from a young life
And no one told her why
Her direction has a dim light
From one more violent crime
She innocently questioned why
Why her father had to die
She asked the men in blue
How is it that you get to choose
Who will live and who will die
Did God say that you could decide?
You saw he did not run
And that my daddy had no gun
In the middle of a village
Way in a distant land
Lies a poor boy with his broken toy
Too young to understand
He's awaken, ground is shaking
His father grabs his hand
Screaming, crying, his wife's dying
Now he's left to explain
He innocently questioned why
Why his mother had to die
What did these soldiers come here for?
If they're for peace, why is there war?
Did God say that they could decide
Who will live and who will die?
All my mama ever did
Was try to take care of her kids
We're innocently standing by
Watching people lose their lives
It seems as if we have no voice
It's time for us to make a choice
Only God could decide
Who will live and who will die
There's nothing that cannot be done
If we raise our voice as one
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from you, baby
We can't take it
We've already had enough
Deep in your soul and let God decide
It's up to me and I am still alive
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't take it
We've already had enough
It's going down baby
It's going on baby
Deep in my soul baby
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me
They've gotta hear it from you
They've gotta hear it from us
We can't, we can't
We've already had enough
You're my lover
We've already had enough
They've gotta hear it from me, in the dark from me
As my brother, it's too much from me
As my brother, baby
As my lover
We've already had enough 
Oh lord, oh lord
Leaving much longer
Oh no
Why did you do it?
Why did you do it?
Please don't let it
Oh no, oh no
Why did you do it?
Oh, don't do it
Oh no, oh no, oh no
Please don't do it
Why did you do it?
Oh no, hold on
YeahWe pray for our fathers, pray for our mothers
Wishing our families well
We sing songs for the wishing, of those who are kissing
But not for the missing
So this one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
When you sit there addressing, counting your blessings
Biding your time
When you lay me down sleeping and my heart is weeping
Because I’m keeping a place
For all the lost children
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children, wishing them well
And wishing them home
Home with their fathers
Snug close and warm, loving their mothers
I see the door simply wide open
But no one can find thee
So pray for all the lost children
Let’s pray for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children, wishing them well
This is for all the lost children
This one’s for all the lost children
Just think of all the lost children
Wishing them well, and wishing them homeHee-hee!

That ain’t what it's all aboutSun comes up on this new morning
Shifting shadows, a songbird sings
And if these words could keep you happy
I'd do anything
And if you feel alone, I'll be your shoulder
With a tender touch you know so well
Somebody once said it's the soul that matters
Baby, who can really tell when two hearts belong so well
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Moon shines down on this good evening
One warm kiss in the cold night air
For this good love I'm receiving
I'd go anywhere, just as long as you were there
And maybe the walls will tumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
When I say I love you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Oh, and on these quiet days
Where souls embrace so silently
Oh, the rain may wash away
All these words that young lovers say
And maybe the walls will crumble
And the sun may refuse to shine
But when I say I need you
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Baby, you gotta know that's for all time
Say that you'll never go, that's for all time
Baby, you'll never go, that's for all timeLipstick in hand, Tahitian tanned in her painted on jeans

She was taught that that's not clean
She's headed for the big time, that means

She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
She's going Hollywood, she's going Hollywood tonight
It's true that you may never ever have that chance again 
She gave up her life to follow her dreams
Left behind everything for the movie scene
Nothing more she could want, she was determined to follow her plan
She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad
Now that she got her dream, she became a star
It all looked so good, but only good from afar
Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera, every guy wished they could
Now it's back to reality, for Ms. Hollywood

After the staring, what did you say?

Doo-doo-do-do-doo
Hee-hee-hee-hee! Don’t walk away
See I just can’t find the right thing to say
I tried but all my pain gets in the way
Tell me what I have to do so you’ll stay
Should I get down on my knees and pray
And how can I stop losing you
How can I begin to say
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away
I close my eyes
Just to try and see you smile one more time
But it’s been so long now all I do is cry
Can’t we find some love to take this away
‘Cause the pain gets stronger every day
How can I begin again
How am I to understand
When there’s nothing left to do but walk away
See and why
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
With everything we said and all we done now
Don’t let go, I don’t want to walk away
And why
All my dreams been broken
I don’t know where we’re going
When everything begins to set us free
Can’t you see, I don’t want to walk away
If you go, I won’t forget you girl
Can’t you see that you will always be
Even though I had to let you go
There’ nothing left to do
Don’t walk awayComo la brisa tu voz me acaricia y pregunto por ti
Cuando amanece tu amor aparece y me hace feliz
Me conoces bien y sabes también que nadie te querrá como yo
Tú me haces sentir deseos de vivir
Junto a ti por siempre, tu amor es mi suerte
Tu voz me llama, tú eres quien gana en mi corazón
Porque me has dado algo sagrado con tu pasión
Me conoces bien y sabes también
Que no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Y cuando no estás no hay felicidad
Mi vida no es vida si tú te vas
Todo mi amor eres tú
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás no hay quien me de lo que das tú
Pues todo mi amor eres tú
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo sé
Pero siento que te quiero y solo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien y sabes también
Que yo no puedo vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tu
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás no hay quien me de lo que das tú
Pues todo mi amor eres tú
Cambiaremos al mundo mañana
Cantaremos sobre lo que fue
Y diremos adiós a la tristeza
Es mi vida y quiero estar junto a ti
Todo mi amor eres tú
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás
No hay quien me de lo que das tú
Todo mi amor eres tú
Todo mi amor eres tú...All along I had to talk about it

It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she is around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes awayOne day in your life
You will remember a place
Someone touching your face
You will come back and you will look around, you will
One day in your life
You will remember the love you found here
You will remember me somehow
Though you do not need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You will remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you are always waiting
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I will be there
You will remember me somehow
Though you do not need me now
I will stay in your heart
And when things fall apart
You will remember one day
One day in your life
When you find that you are always lonely
For a love we used to share
Just call my name, and I will be thereThere we are as cold as ice
Asking me to love you
And often be your friend
There you are, I walk alone
Telling me to love you
And often be your end
She told me she was givin' me
A life-time love forever true
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin' to keep from feelin' blue
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa 
Tschada dada dada naa 
Come on set me free
There I am so all alone
And I'm so sad and lonely
Tell me what will I do
I can’t reveal, I’m holdin' on
I want you still to love me
I feel I am your fool
They told me you should sing a song
Of happy when your feelin' blue
I b'n singin' for so very long
Still cryin', tell me what should I do
All I know is
Tschada dada dada naa 
Tschada dada dada naa 
Come on set me free
She told me she'd be givin' me
A life-time love so guarantee 
But she left me for another man
And I’m singin', cryin' helplessly
But I’ll keep singin'

 Hello August moon, where are the stars of the night
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
And I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of you until the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you
And I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
It seems you don't know, we reached the higher mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, ooh
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed
But I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do
I'll be loving you, that's what I want to do

Baby don't make me Feels like a fire
That burns in my heart
Every single moment that we spend apart
I need you around
For every day to start
I haven't left you alone
Something about you
Is there in your eyes
Everything I'm looking for I seem to find
All this time away
Is killing me inside
I need your love in my life
I wanna spend, time to live in
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
Fought in a battle, where nobody won
Left ourselves a mountain to be overcome
You cannot run away, past the said and done
I need us to carry on
I wanna spend, time to live in
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
You tried everything, you never thought of before
When you live, in your love
And you give, in your love
Always give up some more
Nothing here means anything
Never did
I can live, I can breathe
I can die in my sleep
Because you're always there in my dreams
I wanna spend, time to live in
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you again
I wanna spend, time to live in
I wanna fall with you again
Like we did, when we first met
I wanna fall with you againAll alone wishing on stars
Waiting for you to find me
One sweet night I knew I would see
A stranger who would be my friend
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Like it was written in the stars I knew
My friend, my someone in the dark was you
Promise me we will always be
Walking the world together
Hand in hand where dreams never end
My star secret friend and me
When someone in the dark reaches out to you
And touches off a spark that comes shining through
It tells you never be afraid
Then somewhere in your heart you can feel the glow
A light to keep you warm when the night winds blow
Look for the rainbow in the sky
I believe you and I
Could never really say goodbye
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Wherever you may be
I will look up and see
Someone in the dark for me
Though you are gone star far away
Each time I see a rainbow
I will remember being with you
Smiles coming through my tearsShe's from a world
Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
I was the clown
And she was the dancer
We both knew it wouldn't work
But we took our chances
What I can't recall
Is if there was a girl at all
Or was it my imagination?
I still remember
All of those faces
And now all I have is memories
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me
Don't you know?
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
I lost my heart 
I lost 
I lost my girl 
Who left my heart in pieces
 Lost my heart
 Lost my girl
Who ran away
I lost 
I lost my girl 
Ooh, oh, lost, oh, lost 
I lost
I lost my heart 
I lost 
I lost my girl Alone tonight
Begin tonight
Till it's all right
Damn lover friend of mine
She got your number, she know your game
She put you under, it's so insane
Since you seduced her, how does it feel
To know that woman is out to kill?
Susie got your number, and Susie ain’t your friend
Look who took you under with seven inches in
Blood is on the dance floor, blood is on the knife
Susie's got your number, and Susie says it's right
Susie says it's, Su-Su says it's
Susie got your, Su-Susie got your
Blood is on, is on, blood is
The dance floor, the dance the night
I never knew, but I was walking the line
"Come go with me," I said I have no time
And don't you pretend we didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried, she left me standing alone
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
This is Heartbreak Hotel, it's so evil
Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Ten years ago today
Dangerous, and Susie ain’t your friend
Dangerous, with seven inches in
Dangerous, blood is on the knife
Dangerous, and Susie says it's right
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see the truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So just leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Leave me alone, girl
Leave me alone
Stop it, just stop dogging me around
It was blood on the dance floor, to enjoy that simple dance
It was blood on the dance floor, everything was on my side
It was blood on the dance floor, like it was love and true romance
It was blood on the
And I just can't take it, the girl won't break it
You've been, you've been, you don't, you don't, don't
You don't, you don't, don't mess with my baby
She don't, she don't, she don't know it
She just, she just, mess with my babySister don't read, she'll never know
What about love?
Living a Christian song
What do we care, if she runs away?
What about love?
What about all I pray?
Go through the words, she knows a priest
What about God?
Living is all I see
What will you say, think she will say?
What about love?
That's all I pray
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I’d like to have my child
Sister confused, she went along
What about love?
What about all I saw?
Biding her time, breathing the words
Singing a song, reciting a Bible verse
Father's confused, mother despair
Brother's in curse
What about all I've seen?
You know the line, you came alone
What about heart?
That’s all I've known
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Those abortion papers 
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child
Look at my words
What do they say?
Look in my heart
Burning is all heartbreak
What do you get?
What do you say?
What about love?
I feel my sin
Those abortion papers
Signin' your name against the Word of God
Those abortion papers
Think about love, I'd like to have my child

She could have been grateful
Where will she go?
What will she do
Through the world?
Sister don't know, where will she go?
What about love?
What about all I saw?
What will you care?
Don't be so confused
Love all the things
It's just the things I do

Give me one and don’t adore me
Tell me things you all believe I do
All the things I wanna say and
Tell the things you are to me and
All the lies you have to say I do
Ooh, ooh, ooh, baby
Yesterday was when I felt down
And you came with my stuff and put my fate on the ground
And you have to say that you looked at me
With all the things I do
That's why I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine
You're the one that I adore
Just kiss me once, I wanna know you
Feel the vibe that I can feel in mine
If you are the one for me
Just tell me twice and I will see
The heart and soul of all the things I feel
Ooh, ooh, ooh-noh
Yesterday was when I felt down
I started tryin' to make you think I was around
You know, life was just a thing that goes past the way I do
Because I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I mean mine 
Alright
Ahh ahh
Oh yeah
Yesterday was when I felt down
I started to try to make some sense like I was around
And was tryin' to make the way to see, what a thing I do
You know 'cause I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
I want to be
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow 
The feel of letting my hair blow
To take my time wherever I go
Free, free like the wind blows
To fly away just like a sparrow
The feel of letting my hair blow
 
To take my time wherever I go
I've got to be free, free, free, freeNo sense pretending it's over
Hard times just don't go away
You got to take that chip off your shoulder
It's time you open up
Have some faith
Nothing good ever comes easy
All good things come in due time
Yes it does
You got to have something to believe in
I'm telling you to open your mind

In your mind you will find
A world of sweet harmony
Birds of a feather will fly together
Now music, music and me
Music and me Hey my girl
She does something to my chemistry
And when I'm close I'm sure
I raise her temperature
'bout three degrees
Everyday, yeah
In every way she
Makes my motor purr
And I reciprocate
My life I dedicate to lovin' her
So we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And I don't have to ask
Cause I know it's
Gonna last eternally
Understanding
Whenever handing any alibis
Instead of what you do
Where you been or what's the use
We're making nice
You see we've got a good thing going
A real good thing going yeah
That girl and me
And she don't have to ask
Cause she know it's
Gonna last eternallyNever try to talk about it
It's got to sound good to me inside
I have to think about it
I'm so undemanding
Cause they say love is blind
I've lived this life pretending
I can bear this hurt deep inside
The truth is that I'm longing
A love that's so divine
I've searched this whole world wishing
She'll be there time after time
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
I've lived my life the lonely
A soul that cries of shame
With handicapped emotions
Save me now from what still remains
I'll be your story hero
I'll serenade in rhyme
I'm just needing that someone
Save me now from the path I'm on
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
When you say we will dance 'til the light of day
It's just like the children running with joy
When we pray will you promise me you'll always stay
It's because I'm needing that someone
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
Cause all I do is hand out a heart that needs your love
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out
Someone put your hand out
I'm begging for your love
All I do is hand out

But girl, you know it's true

In time I knew that love would bring
This happiness to me

I waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Oh, oh, oh, oh, who'd think that I 
Have finally found the perfect love I searched for all my life

I am the moonlight, you are the spring, our life's a sacred thing
You know I always will love you, I am forever
I am the one who came when you fell down
I was the only one around 
When things will hurt you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who said that you are free?
When livin' seemed so hard to be, and things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever
I am your friend through thick and thin
We need each other
We'll never part
Our love is from the heart
We never say, "I don't need you"
We are forever
I am the one who said that you are free
When it seems so hard to be the only one
And nothing would cheer you
I am forever
Wasn't it I who carried you around?
When all the walls came tumbling down
When things would hurt you
I am forever, I am forever
We are forever, we are forever
You are the sun that lights up the sky when things are shaded
Let go and then we do get back, I was the only one around
When things would hurt you
We are forever, I am forever, we are forever, I am forever
We are forever,   keep on, we are forever,  keep on, have to be strong
We are forever, we are forever, oh right
I am forever, we are forever, I am forever, we are forever, we are forever
I am forever, I am foreverPeople always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
Yeah, uh
Uh, uh
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one, who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 'cause the lie becomes the truth
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
For 40 days and for 40 nights
The law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
Cause we danced on the floor in the round
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
Do think twice
She told my baby we'd danced 'till three
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo my baby cried
His eyes looked like mine
Go on dance on the floor in the round, baby
People always told me be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts
And mother always told me be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do cause the lie becomes the truth
Hey
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son, oh, oh
Woah, woah
Uh uh, yeah, yeah, yeah, number one
Woah
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean... Billie Jean...
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean...I took my baby on a riverboat cruise
And she was well aware
I was excited 'bout the way that things could've been
She said that I don't care
I wore a face no one could recognize, in disguise
Someone called out my name
They thought of takin' pictures, autographs, then they grabbed
My joy had turned to pain
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm done in my pain, don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
I am a cover of a magazine, what a scene
They know my every move
"Just sign your name on the dotted line, you'll be fine"
That always bothers me
Get in your car, you want to take a ride, look behind
Someone is followin' you
You try to get away, you turn 'round fast, but too bad
They know your every move
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
If you're reachin' for fortune and fame
And I feel the pressure settin' in, I'm livin' just to win
I'm feelin' all this pain, don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' your pain
It's the price of fame, you pay the price of fame
My father never lies 
My father never lies
My father never lies 
So don't be feelin' this way, boy
I like to take some time and get away, then they say
Is that boy still alive?
The weak that really start takin' pills, what a thrill
Only the strong survive
Father always told me
You won't live a quiet life
They start to wonderin' where have you been?
I feel the envious look at me
Their mistaken jealousy
Well then stand here in my shoes
And get a taste of my blues
It’s the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't be feelin' this way
It's the price of fame
You pay the price for fame
So don't you ever complain
Pay the price of fame
You pay the price of fame
My father never lies 
My father never lies, baby
My father never lies 
So don't be feelin' your pain, boyJe ferme les yeux
Je me sens fiévreux
Sans toi j'ai froid
J'aimerais t'appeler
J'aimerais prononcer que toi, que toi
Ce que je ressens
Personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien de t'aimer
Pour la première fois
Je sais que c'est toi
J'ai besoin de rêver
Je vais t'emmener
L'été finira
Près du feu de bois
On fera l'amour
Blottie contre toi
Je te dirai tout bas
Tu me rends folle
Ce que je ressens personne ne comprend
Je me sens si bien près de toi
J'en perd ma fierté
Je ne veux plus tricher
La vérité pour moi
C'est la vie avec toi
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et si ca stoppe
Je crois que je deviendrais fou
Je ne veux pas la fin de nous
Et danser tout l'hiver
Sans toi c'est un enfer
Ne t'en vas pas
Et pouvoir t'embrasser
J'en tremble rien d'y penser
Tout te donner
Les femmes d'avant toi
Ne comptent même pas
J'ai oublié tout ton passé
Le terre pous trembler
La guerre éclater
Je supporterai tout
Écoute-moi mon amour
Notre amour brillera dans ce monde
Il m'a vraiment tout apporté
Donne-moi ton corps et ton âme
Pour te dire amour, toujours, je veux te garderEverybody wanting a piece of Michael Jackson

Hee!
Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearnin'
I promised I would never ever be returnin'
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearnin', hee, hee!
As we walked into the room, there were faces
Starin', glarin', tearin' through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scarin' me
We walked up the stairs still concealing gloom
There were two girls sittin' in my room
She walked up to my face, and said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon 
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So this is Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I am undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other, hee, hee!
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's trial thought in beguile
This is scarin' me
Then the man next door had told
He's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scarin' me
We came to this place, where the vicious dwell
And found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue, every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through 
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart 
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! 
Ten years ago on today 
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! 
Hoo!
Someone stop my heart 
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! 
Ten years ago on today 
Hurtin' my mind, hoo! 
You break my baby’s heart 
This is Heartbreak Hotel 
Just welcome to the scene, hoo!
No, oh IAnd now a behind-the-scenes treat from the original voice-over session for "Thriller", with Michael and Vincent Price. You'll also hear the never-before-released second verse of Vincent's rap, written by Rod
Okay, tape's rolling. Any--anytime you want
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
This is Vincent Price
Michael Jackson is...
The Thriller!
*Vincent laughs*
Do we both say it?
Say it together?
"Inviting you to."
I say "inviting you to"? All right. Yeah
Okay
Any time. Tape's rolling
Hi, this is Michael Jackson
And this is Vincent Price, inviting you to...
The Thriller!
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize your neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
The demons squeal in sheer delight
It's you they spy, so plump, so right
For though the groove is hard to beat
Yet still you stand with frozen feet
You try to run, you try to scream
But no more sun you'll ever see
For evil reaches from the crypt
To crush you in its icy grip
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40,000 years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the Thriller
Can you dig it?
Hmmm-Hahahahaha...
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA!
AHAHAHAHAHAHAHAHA
Ahahahahahahah...
Hmmph, that's great fun!
Great, thank you. Cut
Okay. All right!This is not your ordinary record
Record, Re-re-record, re-re-re-cor-cor-cord 
Ignorance of people purchasing diamonds and necklaces
And barely able to keep the payments up on their lessons
And enrolled in a class and don't know who the professor is
How low people go for the dough and make a mess of things?
Kids are murdering other kids for the fun of it
Instead of using their mind or their fist, they put a gun in it
Wanna be a part of a clique, don't know who's running it
Tragedy on top of tragedy you know it's killing me
So many people in agony, this shouldn't have to be
Too busy focusing on ourselves and not His Majesty
There has to be some type of change for this day and age
We gotta rearrange and flip the page
Living encased like animals and cannibals
Eating each other alive just to survive the nine to five
Every single day is trouble while we struggle and strive
Peace of mind's so hard to find
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn
How can we preach, when all we make this world to be
Is a living hell torturing our minds?
We all must unite, to turn darkness to light
And the love in our hearts will shine
We're disconnected from love, we're disrespecting each other
Whatever happened to protecting each other
Poisoned your body and your soul for a minute of pleasure
But the damage that you've done is gonna last forever
Babies being born in the world already drug addicted and afflicted
Family values are contradicted, ashes to ashes and dust to dust
The pressure is building and I've had enough
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now
Problems, complications and accusations
Dividing the nations and races of empty faces, a war is taking place
No substitution for restitution, the only solution for peace
Is increasing the height of your spirituality
Masses of minds are shrouded, clouded visions
Deceptions and indecision, no faith or religion, how we're living
The clock is ticking, the end is coming, there'll be no warning
But we live to see the dawn
I wanna shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now
Shout
Shout
Shout
Shout
Shout, throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout
You know it makes me wanna shout
Throw my hands up and shout
What's this madness all about?
All this makes me wanna shout, come on now

Huh!
Oh!
Get back on me
Ho!
You know I work too hard for this kinda play 
I wrote a letter, for the ghetto of the CIA 
I don’t care a jack, or about what cha’ do 
Just put your dime on the line baby, cause I own you 
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel 
One blow to the head is all you need
Cheater  Do it!, What! )
Now you better go and get yourself some attitude 
I know your name and the game is “I own you” 
You  telling me that you’re coming to a
Compromise 
You’re smiling at me while, you’re stealing right before my eyes )
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need
Cheater 
I can't, huh!
Jack, oh-oh
I hurt my backbone baby
I start to give it up
Life is an aggravator
Sometimes I part it up
I broke my radiator
I am indestructible
I pray to leave my body
Do not you ever call
I don’t care a jack, or about what you do 
Just sign your name on the line baby, I own you 
Cheater 
Somebody said, give up instead on how you feel, 
One blow to the head is all you need
Cheater
 
Cheating baby 
 
Ooh-ooh
Cheater
Ooh-ooh 
 Cheating baby
 Cheating baby
Oh-oh
Cheating baby
You are a cheater She was there just sitting at the table
Thinking now that things won't be the same
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
I never thought she'd leave me here forever
But who knows just what the future brings
And wouldn't you like to go with me?
And she answered "No" to me but
I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Take away this never ending sorrow
Take this lonely feeling from my soul
If only I knew what things bring tomorrow
She'd be sitting here beside me
And my heart would then be whole
So hope to make a change now for the better
Never letting fate control my soul
And I'm hoping that my prayers will see
The day that she'll come back to me
But I guess I learned my lesson much too soon
Ooh, ooh
Yes, I guess I learned my lesson much too soonAll alone, she's in the ego zone
The word is out that you're doin' wrong
On the move, got fire in your shoes
By word of mouth you are on the loose
You're livin' on sunset time 
Feelin' bad you're living much too fast
The truth, the truth that you're on the pass
In the raw, they don't know what you saw
From word of mouth you're breakin' every law
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Morning rider
You're a Saturday nighter 
On the go, got fever in your soul
You better not shout where you gonna go
Living hot, doing what you should not
The break's on me then what do you get
We're livin' on sunset time 
Shoot the breeze, you feel that she's the tease
Your night is free what you want to be
Who's to trust when livin' dangerous?
Tonight's your night, but this is what you lose
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Getting higher
You're a Saturday nighter 
You are there when the night's in town
Standin' there with the top of the round
They don't care about the things you used to say
You're like the cinema, you think there's nothin' wrong 
Goin' town, you do it every time
The word's got out that you're on the line
On the moon, got fever in your shoes
The night's on you, what are you gonna to do?
Sunset Driver
Midnight rider
Friday's brighter
Got to reach that driver
You're a Saturday nighter 
 
 
 There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than this
How do we cope in a world without love
Mending all those broken hearts
And tending to those crying faces
There must be more to life than killing
A better way for us to survive
Why should it be just a case of black or white
There must be more to life than this
Why is this world so full of hate
People dying everywhere
And we destroy what we create
People fighting for their human rights
But we just go on saying c'est la vie
So this is life
There must be more to life than living
There must be more than meets the eye
What good is life, if in the end we all must die
There must be more to life than this
There must be more to life than killing
There must be more to life than this
I live in hope for a world filled with love
Then we can all just live in peace
There must be more to life, much more to life
There must be more to life, more to life than this

Just take your time and you'll see that the magic's on its way 
Girl, if we try, we can set all our senses reeling 
That's the day
You know I got the hots tonightAlone she lies waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the room
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon
She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon Sadness had been close as my next of kin
Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lamb was I, till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Till now
Happy, yeah yeah
Happy, oh happy
Happy oh yeah HappyDa-da-da

If you don't want me
And if you don't love me
Aow!
If you don't love meNow I got a mission
The story unfolds
What the wise men have told you, is already known
That a woman and a man
Should go by the plan
And we find out, how high we can fly
There's just one religion
One family of love
We suffer the children
As God cries above
And the giving, not the taking
With hearts open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And what of our world
What does it become
When the damage is done?
And you held out, you said no, you stand up
Only God knows
That it’s all in the game
It’s all in Your Name
Carry me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name
Look to Heaven
An Angel appears
To love and protect us
Through all of our tears
And the gateway to peace
It stands open wide
And it looks like we fall
And it burns like a flame
Any ground that I claim
So what is my life
If I don't believe
There is someone to watch me
Follow my dreams
Take all my chances, like those who dare?
And where is the peace
We're searching for
Under the shadows of war?
Can we hold out, and stand up, and say no?
Only God knows
That it's all in the game 
It's all in Your Name 
Follow me to the Gates of Paradise
They're the same
It's all in Your Name

And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do, 'cause the lie becomes the truth"

You were struck down
It was your doom

Everywhere I turn, no matter where I look
The system's in control, it's all run by the book
I gotta get away so I can free my mind
Xscape is  from the 
No matter where I am, I see my face around
They pin lies on my name then push from town to town
Don't have a place to run but there's no need to hide
I gotta, find a place, but I won't, hide away
Xscape
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away
Xscape
Xscape
I do what I wanna cause I gotta face nobody but me
Sometimes I feel like
I've gotta get away
I tried to share my life with someone I can love
But games and money is all she ever thought of
How could that be my fault when she gambled and lost?
I'm tired of silly games, it's time to make a change
Why is it I can't do whatever I want to
When it's my personal life and I don't live for you
So don't you try to tell me what is right for me
You be concerned about you, I can do what I want to
Xscape 
Gotta get away from the system rules in the world today 
Xscape
The pressure that I face from relationships has to go away

XscapePlanet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth, are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart soft and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
In my veins I've felt the mystery
Of corridors of time, books of history
Life songs of ages throbbing in my blood
Have danced the rhythm of the tide and flood
Your misty clouds, your electric storm
Were turbulent tempests in my own form
I've licked the salt, the bitter, the sweet
Of every encounter, of passion, of heat
Your riotous color, your fragrance, your taste
Have thrilled my senses beyond all haste
In your beauty, I've known the how
Of timeless bliss, this moment of now
Planet Earth are you just floating by, a cloud of dust
A minor globe, about to bust
A piece of metal bound to rust
A speck of matter in a mindless void
A lonely spaceship, a large asteroid
Cold as a rock without a hue
Held together with a bit of glue
Something tells me this isn't true
You are my sweetheart gentle and blue
Do you care?
Have you a part?
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love youPlanet Earth, my home, my place
A capricious anomaly in the sea of space
Planet Earth are you just
Floating by, a cloud of dust
Do you care, have you a part
In the deepest emotions of my own heart
Tender with breezes caressing and whole
Alive with music, haunting my soul
Planet Earth, gentle and blue
With all my heart, I love you
What about sunrise
What about rain
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain
What about killing fields
Is there a time
What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before
Did you ever stop to notice
The crying Earth the weeping shores?
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
I used to dream
I used to glance beyond the stars
Now I don't know where we are
Although I know we've drifted far
]
Hey, what about yesterday
What about the seas
The heavens are falling down
I can't even breathe
What about apathy
I need you
What about nature's worth
It's our planet's womb
What about the holy land
Torn apart by creed
What about the common man
Can't we set him free
What about children dying
Can't you hear them cry
Where did we go wrong
Someone tell me why
What about baby Boy
What about the days
What about all their joy
What about the man
What about the crying man
What about Abraham
What about death again
Do we give a damn
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo Hoo
Aaaaaaaaah, OoooooooohKonvict
I met her on the walk way
Staring as she walked pass
She looked back at me sideways and said
I can't help but to ask
I said, "You want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something"
We end up going back to her place
Wish I could tell you what I saw
The sexiest women in a negligee
We hit it off until the morning
You heard her say
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa

Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
You're too high to get over 
Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying to start my baby crying
Talking, Squealing, lying
You got my baby crying
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa

Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa 
It's getting a little crazy 
Always messing with my baby 
And that's the reason she cries
When I am not by her side
I have the loneliest night 
But what I love 'bout you
Always pop up when I'm thinking about you
I want to bring back the night and share that look on your face
When you say
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa 
Ma ma se, ma ma sa, Ma ma ku sa

Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder When you're down and troubled
And you need some lovin' care

Right till the end, right for youAs I drove across on the highway
My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do
So I stopped and got out
And looked down, I noticed I'd got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car like sideways
So I can find, what I can fix
I looked around there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange, feeling like a mist
I walked down, toward the end of a road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said don't you worry my friend
I'll take care
Take my hand
I'll take you there
Ooh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
As she took me right through the fog
I seen a beautiful city appear
A'Where kids are playin' and people are laughin' and a'smilin' an' Nothin' to fear
She said this is the place where no people have pain
With love and happiness
She turned around, looked down
In my eyes, and start'd cryin'
An' grabbed my hand
You've got a friend
Woh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Woh-oh-oh
Yeah, doggone, oh-oh
She started likin' me
Kissin' me, and huggin' me
She didn't really really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen
And things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world, could I wanna leave
So then I went in my pocket
Took my wallet on out
With my pictures of my family and girl
This is the place that you choose to be with me
When you thought
You could be in another world
Oh oh-oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name

She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food

She must be outta her mind

She works so hard, just to make her way
For the man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, she dare'd not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home

Just watch your mouth, Boy 
Just watch your mouth 
Your Brother
Yes your mother
Ask your sister
That's me
You're doing wrong   The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different about this girl
The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura of her presence
Every head turned feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust woman to man
So open the door, and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move, set me free
I never knew but I was walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
And don't you pretend
We didn't talk on the phone
My baby cried she left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
'Cause I know how lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover friend of mine
Just open the door, and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me, you'll never tell
Touch me there, make the move
Cast the spell
Keep it in the closet
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
Do, do, do, do
Dangerous
Dangerous
Dangerous
It that, it thatI met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
I never would have thought
She was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me yeah
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she had a family, family, yeah
Why.. oooh ooooh
Oh-oh-oh-oh
I’m in love
I didn’t know she was already spoken for
‘Cause I’m not that kind of man
I swear that I would've never looked her way
Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that
I’m holdin' her to blame
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me but she was still your wife
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she got a family, family, yeahPeople
People make the world go around
Teachers on strike, no more school today
They want more money but the board won't pay
People
Everybody is talking about ecology
The air is so polluted that it is hard to breathe
People
But that is what makes the world go round
The ups and downs a carousel
Changing people’s heads around
Go underground young men
People make the world go round
Old folks judge you by the clothes you wear
They swear you're a hippy if you have long hair
Young politicians fight for poverty
While people still cry for equality
 Maybe you and I cannot do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way
Empty words are not enough
Where there is hurt will be a crush
When there is thirst we will fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share
Maybe you and I cannot do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way
In despair we will be the hope
And the prayer that frees the soul
We will be there to share each lonely road
Because we love, I know
We care enough
Maybe you and I cannot do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way
Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you will see
Love is all we need
Maybe you and I cannot do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today

Tears fall like rain
I want to come home again
I want you to
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Take me back
Take me back where I belong
That is with you baby
Ain't no love in this world

Every place I go with everything I do
I still feel the need for you
Come on and
I am on my way back to you
And I want to make it up to you
And all the problems that I caused you
If it takes my life I will make it up to you
I just want you to take me, take me
Take me, take me, take me, take me
Take me back, forgive me
Take me back where I belong
If you can, if you can find it
In your heart to forgive meI've had my eyes on you
For three long years
When no one else wanted you
I took you in and held you near
But then you drifted away
After you said you'd always stay
How could you be so mean and untrue?
He didn't want you until he'd seen
What my love did for you, yeah
 Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home
Yeah yeah yeah
 I've had no love affairs
For three long years
Remember how I used to care
When you were down, I dried your tears
Who did you think was the fool?
I let you treat me so cruel
This is the moment of truth for you
Do you think your playing is through?
I don't think I can trust you
 Ooh baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Yeah baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?
Yeah yeah yeah
 What goes around, comes around
He put you down, now you're the clown
Yeah yeah baby, what goes around, comes around
I knew he'd soon be gone
Na na baby, he put you down, now you're the clown
And you want me to come back home?Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
I told my mama how I feel about your power
Your love can heal, no doctor's remedy
Ever do what you do for me
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Eeny weeny teeny bit of your love
Baby it is all I need, it is all I need
Since the day I have been loving you
I cannot catch a cold, I cannot catch the flu
The sweet loving you have been giving me
Has become my daily need
Just a little of your love, every day
It is all I need, that is all I need
Just a little bit baby
That is all I need, that is all I need
So do not send no doctor to my door
Because Doctor John has been here before
Do not you send him, just come yourself
Bring your love and nothing else
Ooh just a, just a
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor away
Just a little bit of you every day
Will surely keep the doctor awayEverybody is somebody's fool
The world is the biggest school
As you live, you learn, though a torch will burn
Everybody is somebody's fool
You go through life making fools of others
Pretending you are giving them love
But remember sister or brother
You all have to answer to the one up above
 
It's beautiful to watch love begin
But oh so sad when it ends
As you got through life remember this rule
Everybody is somebody's foolCome into me, I know mystical garden
Orchards and violets, all mysteries are parted
Life is a mirage ghost, imagination
Pure inspiration called justification
Nothing's impossible, nothing's concealed
Everything here is for real
What gives fantastic ghouls all in your head?
Who creates these wonders like nobody can?
Siegfried & Roy
You know it's Siegfried & Roy
So be it

I'm gonna Siegfried & Roy
When it's Siegfried & Roy, it's the mind over magic in true
Your own thoughts play the game in the magical wonders they do
The mind in the magic is you
Move of the head, and I'll change your emotions
Strange things appear, from euphorics, devotions
Everything's happening, nothing's unreal
Hallucinating the mind in the real
Seeing black panthers that suddenly fly
White tigers stalking your mind
Hallucinating the things that you see
This kind of magic's so hard to believe
Be it...

Siegfried & RoyHello August moon, where are the stars of the night?
You promised me too soon cause it's been cloudy all night
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
And I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home instead
But I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
Hello midnight lover, you're the one I adore
And I'll be thinking of ya 'til the stars are no more
If it's cloudy or blue, I'll stay here with you
We'll make a wish and then we'll kiss, our love forever true
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay here with you
And I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
I'll be loving you, that's what I wanna do
It seems you don't know, we reached the highest mountain
Every time I seem to disappear
And together we will fly, we'll dance up in the heavens
I can really feel it when you're near, oh-hooo
And the weatherman said, if you're not well stay in bed
Cause I've been feeling down and blue and it's cloudy in my head
Instead of going out to some restaurant, I'll stay home in bed

Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable

Because I want to be more than just your number one fan"

We must give a helping hand
Whatever happen to our heroes
They must get another chance
We drove closer, closer and closer
And even though we are almost there
You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I am taking you away
Tonight
Come together all the people 
Here is your chance to make it right 
And even though we are getting close
We are not there just yet
And even though we are almost there
You are all I need in my life
You are all I dream here at night
Close your eyes imagine I am taking you away
Then one more time close your eyes
I am always here to stay
Tonight
We can do it againIf I had my way girl
I would never leave for a minute
But things do not always turn out
The way we want them to
So while I am away
I want you to remember
How much I love you
I love you, I love you
Let this love lift you up
When you are feeling blue
Wherever I go, I will be loving you
Think of me when you see
Places we once shared
Whatever I do, someday I will need you there
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I will always come home
I will come home to you
Even though we both know
You are not in my arms
Wherever I go, you are always in my heart
Just you ask, I will come back
Though we are miles apart
Whatever I do, I will come to where you are
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I will always come home
I will come home to you
Wherever I go, whatever I do
I will always come home
I will come home to youFather comes home from work, and he's scared to death

If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too

How could this be you're not here with me
You never said goodbye, someone tell me why
Did you have to go and leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself: how did love slip away?
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone, I am here with you
Though you're far away, I am here to stay
But you are not alone, I am here with you
Though we're far apart, you're always in my heart
But you are not alone... lone lone why lone
I Just Can't Stop Loving You
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong

Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you

And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
Noche de estrellas
Haz que me quiera
Como a ella yo
De madrugada
Ven que te espera
Todo mi amor
Soy joven, lo sé
Pero siento que
Te quiero y solo vivo por ti
Me conoces bien
Y sabes también
Que yo no puedo
Vivir sin tu amor
Todo mi amor eres tú 
Todo mi amor eres tú
Cuando no estás
No hay quien me dé
Lo que das tú
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, hey...farewell to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you
No, baby
Oh!
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tú
And if I stop...
Oh!
Then tell me just what will I do
What will I do? Uh...ooh...
I just can't stop loving you
Hee! Hee! Hee! Know I do, girl
Pues todo mi amor lo eres tú

And if I stop...
Then tell me, just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you

I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
Hee hee hee, hee hee hee
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
I said you wanna be startin' somethin
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over
Too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too hight to get over 
Too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You got to be startin'
You wanna be startin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
You wanna be startin' somethin'
Somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin'

Ah...Take you there
They told him don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it , just beat it
Beat it, beat it 
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is you fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it 
Just beat , just beat it

Who's badLove is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You persuaded me to love you
And I did
But instead of tenderness
I found heartache instead
Into your arms I fell
So unaware of the loneliness
That was waiting there
You closed the door to your heart, girl
And you turned the key
Locked your love away from me
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You made me love you
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You said loving you
Would make life beautiful
With each passing day
But as soon as love came
Into my heart
You turned and you walked
Just walked away
You stripped me of my dreams
You gave me faith, then you took my hope
Look at me now
Look at me
See what loving has done to me
Look at my face
See how crying has left its trace
After you made me all your own
Then you left me all alone
You made your words sound so sweet
Knowing that your love I could not keep
My heart cries out for your touch
But baby, you are not there
And the lonely cry fades in the air
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
Love is here
And oh my darling, now you are gone
You made me love you
Oh oh my darling, now you are gone
Talking about love, love, love, love
Ooh ooh my darling, now you are goneYou are there like the laughter of a child
When I need just a smile
Suddenly the sun shines for a while
Everywhere sounds of love are everywhere
And my heart sings along
Thanks to you I finally got a song
Because you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
Each time my world seems like it is falling down
Things look up just having you around
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you are there
Like a rainbow after rain
Like the night follows day
You are the answer to the prayers I say
And you are there
You are there
You are there somewhere
No matter where I go or what I do
You are there to help me see it through
So every night I say a prayer
Just because you are there
Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there, somewhere
And as the years go by we will stay as true
What you are for me I will be for you
And every night I will say a prayer
Just because you are there
Ooh, you are there
Ooh, you are there
Everywhere, you are thereOW!
As he came into the window
It was the sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you OK, Annie? Annie, are you OK?
So, Annie, are you okay, are you okay, Annie?
Annie, are you okay?
Will you tell us that you're okay?
There's a sign in the window
That he struck you - a crescendo, Annie
He came into your apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
Then you ran into the bedroom
You were struck down
It was your doom
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by a smooth criminal
OW!
OW! WOO! WOO! WOO!
Aaow!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know!
I don't know why baby!
I don't know
Daggonit!
Annie, are you okay?
So, Annie, are you okay?
Are you okay, Annie?
You've been hit by
You've been hit by a smooth criminalI sing of what you see and might think about
Because of what you see
Moving hands, mobile faces
Where by the ear
Not the eye traces what's on the mind
So when you see hands
Weaving the space between friends
Think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
Believe it they ramble on exactly as we would
And talking with someone we know
And even they stumble on expressions as we would
And talking with anyone
So..
When you see hands weaving
The space between friends
Think of them as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
So think of hands as being
As though you are seeing voices
Think of them as being
As though they were seeing voices
Speech without sound face to face, hands unbound
Weaving the space between friends
So, think of them as being
As though you were seeing voices
So think of hands as telling or asking
Or spelling out choices
Just think of hands as being
As though you were seeing, voices
Voices, voicesI will plant you a garden
Of laughter and tears
With rain and with sunshine
Love will grow through the years
The dream that we are dreaming
Have time to come true
Because we have got forever
And forever is meant for so very few
We shall have music
We shall have to rhyme
We shall have each other
One minute after the end of time
Then we will add up the pleasures
And treasure the sums
Caring is sharing
The cake and the crumbs
How lucky we are to be me and youIs It Scary
I have seen the Book of Tales
Crafted by magical hands
Older than time itself
Its pages are filled with darkness
And mystery
There's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's climbing up the stairs
There's a spirit in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
'Cause they're hiding everywhere
Is that scary for you, baby
Am I scary for you, boy
Is this scary for you, baby
Is this scary for you
You know the stranger is you
Is this scary for you, baby
{Sorcery...Illusions...}
There's a creaking on the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin nearly open
Where a restless soul is pokin'
I am gonna be
Exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Perform before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
I always feel like
Somebody's watchin' me
Threatened
All hail, the king has risen
You're by yourself, but it's my touch you felt
I'm not a ghost from Hell, but I've got a spell on you
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
You should be watching me, you should feel threatened
Why you sleep, why you creep, you should be threatened
Every time your lady speaks she speaks to me, threatened
Half of me you'll never be, so you should feel threatened by me
What you have just witnessed could be the end of a particularly terrifying nightmare
It isn't - it's the beginningJust because you know I love you so much
Don't be afraid to tell me you are sad
Because you lost his love
Though your love is not for me
I don't wanna to see you in misery
So come on, baby come on
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
All your troubles to me
Big girls ain't supposed to cry
If you do I will understand
Maybe I can show you how you can win his love again
It may seem strange I know
But it is just that I love you
So come on, baby come on
You can cry on my shoulder
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
Now you've given him all you had
He better stop treating you so bad
Come on baby 
Come on, oh yeah
You can cry on my shoulder, yes you can girl
You can cry on my shoulder
And bring all your troubles to me
Yeah babe, yes you can now
Darling, ooh, ooh yes, yes you can girl
I will be there to help
You can cry, you can cry, you can cry
Baby
Oh yeah babe, yeah babe
You can cry, you can cryCinderella, stay awhile
You are the one
That I have been looking for
Cinderella, when you smile
All around me sunbeams
Start to fall
Midnight is so near

Now that you are here
Stay awhile

That the magic slipper's
Going to fit
Cinderella, do not go

Love that is sweet and pure
Love that will endure

All my fairy tales are coming true
Well my only fear
Is midnight is so near
Please do not disappear
Stay awhile, oh
Cinderella, stay awhile
Do not you go
OhIt's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
‘Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one’s gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it’s thriller
Thriller night
You’re fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
‘Cause this is thriller
Thriller night

From the beast about to strike
You know it’s thriller
Thriller night
You’re fighting for your life

Killer, thriller
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight

Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell

When I had you to myself
I didn't want you around
Those pretty faces always made you
Stand out in a crowd
Then someone picked you from the bunch
One glance was all it took
Now it's much too late for me
To take a second look
Oh, baby, give me one more chance
Won't you please let me
Oh, darling, I was blind to let you go
But now since I see you in his arms
I want you back
Yes, I do now 
Ooh, ooh, baby 
Yeah, yeah, yeah 
Now, now, now
The Love You Save
When we played tag in grade school
You wanted to be it
But chasin' boys was just a fad
You crossed your heart, you'd quit
When we grew up you traded
Your promise for my ring
Now just like back in grade school
You're doing the same old thing
Stop, the love you save maybe your own
Darlin' take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
Darlin' look both ways before you cross me
You're heading for a danger zone
I'll Be There
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there
With a love that's strong
I'll be your strength

She is so true, oh yeah
Her dreams are tumbling
Her world is crumbling
Because of you, uh uh
One day you will hurt her just once too much
And when you finally lose your tender touch
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
Her feet may wander, her heart may stray
Shoo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-Be-Doo-DA-day
You are going to send your baby straight to me
I am going to give her all the loving
Within my heart, oh yeah
I am going to patch up every single little dream
You have torn apart, understand me now?
And when she tells you she is crying her last tear
Heaven knows I am going to be somewhere near
Oh yeah-yeah, you better
You better listen to me, yeah
Heartaches are calling and tears are falling
Because of you, oh yeah
And when you are gone she will know

And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?
Yeah, hold on, yeah
Hold on, oh, yeah
When weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human
Yeah, oh, hold on
Yeah, oh, yeah
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?
 Show me
 Told me
 Yeah
 I'm only human

 I get lonely, yeah yeah

 Hoo
 Give me up, hold me up, give me up sometimes
 oh, sometimes
 Yeah
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heartDie for it
So you call it trust but I say it's just
In the Devil's game of greed and lust
They don't care, they'd do it for the money
They don't care, they use it for the money
So you go to church, read the Holy Word
In the scheme of life, it's all absurd
They don't care, they'd kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
You're saluting the flag, your country trusts you
Now you're wearing a badge, you're called the 'Just few'
And you're fighting the wars, a soldier must do
I'll never betray or deceive you my friend but
If you show me the cash then I will take it
If you tell me to cry then I will fake it
If you give me your hand then I will shake it
You do anything for money
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Insurance, where do your loyalties lie?
Is that your alibi? I don't think so
You don't care, you'd do her for the money
Say it's fair, you sue her for the money
Want your pot of gold, need the Midas touch
Bet you sell your soul, 'cause your God is such
You don't care, you kill for the money
Do or dare, the thrill for the money
Are you infected with the same disease
Of lust, gluttony and greed?
Then watch the ones with the biggest smiles
The idle jabbers 'cause they're the backstabbers
If you know it's a lie then you will swear it
If you give it with guilt then you will bear it
If it's taking a chance then you will dare it
You would do anything for money
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil
Anything, anything
Anything for money
Would lie for you
Would die for you
I even sell my soul to the Devil

I don't think so
If you show me the man then I will sell him
If you ask me to lie then I will tell him
If you're stealing with God then you will hell him
Anything

We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger baby
Like a stranger in Moscow
I'm livin' lonely
I'm livin' lonely, baby
I was wandering in the rain
Mask of life, feelin' insane
Swift and sudden fall from grace
Sunny days seem far away
Kremlin's shadow belittling me
Stalin's tomb won't let me be
On and on and on it came
Wish the rain would just let me be
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Here abandoned in my fame
Armageddon of the brain
KGB was doggin' me
Take my name and just let me be
Then a begger boy called my name
Happy days will drown the pain
On and on and on it came
In the rain, and again, and again
Take my name and just let me be
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
When you're alone
And you're cold inside
Like a stranger in Moscow
Like a stranger in Moscow
We're talkin' danger
We're talkin' danger babyHah!

Too young to really be in love
They say that love is a word
A word we have only heard

This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at all
And yet we are not too young to know
This love will last though years may go
And then some day they may recall
We were not too young at allMorning glow, morning glow

Missing on the chance to fall in love 
Feeling like your love is dangerous, but I love you, girl
Feeling like I'm never good enough
Let the heaven open, it's raining in heaven
Feels like warm July
We'll be something new, I'm here for you
And there's no need to cry
Heaven's like water, water
Drowning my love, it feels like
Heaven's like water, water
People leave me alone
Heaven's like water, water
What am I to do?
Feeling like this is the start of something new
Feeling like this is the world of me and you
Cause you aren’t judging me, You just touching me
You aren’t bugging me, I'm waiting on you
I'm hoping it's true, baby, it's you
When the storm is ranging
We can walk the moon
Girl, I love you, you're my fortune
You keep me alive
I lie awake, I count the days
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes away
I'd rather stay, I rather play again
When I'm not there with you forever, always
Don't you do this to me
Tell the angels no
I don't want to leave my baby alone
Won't you leave us alone
Tell the angels no
I don't want to leave my baby alone
It feels like, leave us alone
Leave us alone, it feels like
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
How does it feel
All over me, it's all over me
All over me, it's all over me, it's all
All over me 
It's all over meInto each life some rain falls
Then comes the snow
But after the snow
The flowers will grow
Girl when my life got stormy
You stayed for the ride
You stayed my side
You make the sun shine
I am up again I never let you down
Nothing is ever going to stop me now
Up again I never let you down
I love you
This Humpty Dumpty is lucky
He had his fall
But after it all
He brushed himself off
Knowing how much you loved me
I made one more try
I reached for the sky
And I made it this timeWelcome to Hollywood
That's what they told you
A child star in Hollywood
That's what they sold you
Grace with beauty, charm and talent
You would do, what you were told
But they robbed you, of your childhood
Took your youth, and sold it for gold
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star to me
Lovely Elizabeth
You have surpassed them all
My friend Elizabeth
Learned to outlast them all
Many started, back when you did
Lost their way, and now they are gone
But look at you, a true survivor
Full of life, and carrying on
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star, that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?
Elizabeth, I love you
You're more than just a star
This is your life
You seem to have it all
You reached your peak
They wanted you to fall
It's very sad, this world can be so bad
But through all the heartaches
When they put you down
You know, you were the victor
And you earned the crown
It's like, walking through the fire
Determined to win
You were, beating life's battles
Again and again
Elizabeth, I love you
You're every star that shines in the world to me
Elizabeth, can't you see that it's true?
Remember the time, I was all alone
You stood by my side and said
"Let's be strong"
You did all these things
That only a true friend can do
Elizabeth, I love you
The world knows your worth now
Of all the things on earth now
I pray one day I'll be just......like you!Another day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Alone, alone
Why, alone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
And I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone, oh
Whisper three words and I'll come runnin'
And I, girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
For I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
You are not alone
For I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
You are not alone
You are not alone, oh

Love me when you talk to meI don't want to move when I'm in her hands
There's nothing I can do or say. Uh!
Put everything on hold. Cancel all my plans
Tell everybody I'm away - Hey
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I'll give her anything she wants
She's trouble 
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble  He! O
She's trouble 
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble 
I never knew what's running through her mind
No telling what she's going to do - e
Her every move is like a danger sign
And daring me to come on through - Hey!
She may be bad, but she feels so good
I give her anything she wants
She's trouble 
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble  He! O
She's trouble 
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble 
She's trouble
She knows what I like
I got a feeling I'm falling 
Trouble
There's no hope in sight
I'm in way over my head
She's trouble 
She only needs to touch me
I'm in trouble  O!
She's trouble 
I know just when she does it
I'm in trouble  O!
She's trouble 
Only needs toBen, the two of us need look no more
We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I will never be alone
And you my friend will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There is something you should know
You have got a place to go
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it is "us", now it is "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They do not see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I am sure they did think again
If they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like BenTo make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style
If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools
If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest
(Law without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smileNever have I ever been so sure
Never thought I'd see you walk in that door
I can make you feel 
No remedies 
Would you rather be, right here with me
I want you right here next to me
Do you really want to stay?
Do you want to walk away
Girl I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
Do you really want to stay?
Do you really want to go?
So I'm writing you this letter just to say goodbye
I'll be standing in the rain, in case you change your mind
She never thought she'd be here waiting on me
I'd never thought I'd be here back in my ways
When you're in need
Your fantasy 
Would you rather be, right here with me
Girl get into me
Anything, oh anything
To chase the rain goodbye
When you left with all your dreams
I couldn't say goodnight
She was contagious, she was contagious
She was my baby
To carry on , I love you
Say goodbye, say goodbye
Don't go away
Stay by my side
Stay by my sideLove, Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love, Love
Love, Love, Love, Love

Euphoria
That is the new word for today
Euphoria
It is very easy to say
Say Euphoria and you will feel fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
Do what you wish, be what you are
What a victorious thrill
Wearing a smile, all of the while
Feeling the world standing still
Watch rainbows glow rest on a bed of flowers
Then dial a star
Anything is in your powers
Euphoria
Full euphoria
Knowing no ills, needing no pills
Singing a rock and roll hymn
Feeling glorious, full of love
Fine from the start
You can close your eyes
And see the world with your heart
How good to be happy and free
Living the way that you choose
Healthy and clean
Cannot understand anyone having the blues
Euphoria never to feel frustration
How great to give love without invitation
Euphoria, euphoria
Long as we love each other
Euphoria, euphoria
Living for one another
Euphoria, euphoria
That's one word for heaven

Control of meThe way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was walking the line
She never thought that I would have the time
She never think that I was going alone
She never thought and then she ganged up the phone
She's so
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch, a kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
She never thought that I was walking the line
She never think that I would have the time
She never thought that I were going alone
She never think and then she ganged up the phone
She's so
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to god
'cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
 vegetation
 voice of information
 constellation
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
'cause it's dangerous
I never thought that I was walking the line
She never think that I would have the time
She never thought that I were going alone
She never think, and then she ganged up the phone
She's so
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time

With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped)

Then Happy came one day, chased my blues away
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when Happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was
Where have I been?
What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until Happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let Sadness see what Happy does
Let Happy be where Sadness was till nowCan you feel it , can you feel it, can you feel it ?
Can you feel it , can you feel it, can you feel it ?
All the colors of the world should be

Now, tell me

Words like, like, "I love you"
Human Nature
Looking out
Across the night time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the night time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Looking out
Across the morning
Where the city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say
Why, why, tell 'em that it's human nature
Why, why, does he do me that way
If they say
Why, why, da, da, da, da, da, da, da, da
Why, why does he do me that way
I like livin' this wayAlphabetical Order:

Baby don't change it...I woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going no-o-where
When I saw my sweet melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of a love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you’ve told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday
Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it’s music to my ears
Every word that you say-ay-ayyy
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only

I'm goin' back to Indiana​
I think I love you
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there  I'll be thereFree and untamed that is how I have grown
Settling down is not my nature
Roots I will never own
Oh your smile
But tell me, I am not your child
How can you cage a bird
Born to be wild
I am Johnny Raven
By and by 
Oh, I am going to leave your nest girl
Another nest to try
Ooh Johnny Raven
Girl you know I should not have loved you
Yeah, but I got to leave you
When my restless heart says goodbye
Look at you little girl
You feel love so deep
If I could change in a second
I would change for you like that
Stay right here for keeps
But I am home free for no thrills
Stray I will
Seems I got to need one girl
Never can feel
Everybody knows my name
I am Johnny Raven
Yeah, yeah by and by
I am going to fly
When you cry part of me is going to dieIt is time you put away your fear
And It is time try to dream a little big
It is time to give your dreams another chance
And It is time to take away the will in hand
To the flames that is burning strong
To the rain that is coming on
I will be holding on to memories
I can make it on my own
I believe I am ready to win
I know I am ready to soar
If you pick me up when I down
Turn it all around
I know I am ready to win
They say It is a miracle today 
You are never going far today 
Life is your chance 
You got your chance
Go get your win
It feels like I can fly with broken wings
Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I am never turning back again
They say I am dreaming life away
And I cannot get back my yesterday 
So I say I never saw love without you
Call my name!
And I know I am ready to win
You and me, baby
I believe it, baby
I know I will win
Sing, yeah!
Baby, I know!
Yeah, yeah, I believeHee!
Live and sin
Ten years ago on this day, my heart was yearning
I promised I would never, ever be returning
Where my baby broke my heart and left me yearning
Hee! Hee!
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring, glaring, tearing through me
Someone said, "Welcome to your doom"
Then they smiled with eyes that looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me
This is Heartbreak Hotel
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
So evil Heartbreak Hotel
This place is Heartbreak Hotel
Someone stop my heart 
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! 
Ten years ago today 
This is Heartbreak Hotel, hee! 
We came to this place where the vicious dwell
Found that wicked women run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through
OW!You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love, I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name and I'll be there
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Yes I will, yes I will
Let me fill your heart with joy and laughter
Togetherness, well that's all I'm after
Whenever you need me, I'll be there
I'll be there to protect you
With an unselfish love I respect you
Just call my name and I'll be there
And oh, I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad that I found you
I'll be there with a love that's strong
I'll be your strength, I'll keep holding on
Yes I will, yes I will
If you should ever find someone new
I know he'd better be good to you
'Cause if he doesn't, I'll be there
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
Just look over your shoulders, honey, ooh
I'll be there, I'll be there, whenever you need me, I'll be there
Don't you know, baby, yeah yeah
I'll be there, I'll be there, just call my name, I'll be there
I'll be there, I'll be thereThere is a time when we should hear the certain calls
'Cause the world it seems it's right in this line
'Cause there's a chance for taking in needing our own lives
It seems we need nothing at all
I used to feel I should give away my heart
And it shows that fear of needing them
Then I read the headlines and it said they're dying there
And it shows that we must heed instead
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Give in your heart and you will see that someone cares
'Cause you know that they can feed them all
Then I read the paper and it said that you've been denied
And it shows the second we will call
We are the world
We are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Now there's a time when we must love them all
And it seems that life, it don't make love at all
But if you'd been there, and I'll love you more and more
It seems in life, i didn't do that
We are the world, the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, are the world
We are the children, are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving, let's start giving
But there's a chance we're taking, taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Come on, yeah
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, 'cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day
Just you and me
Oh yeah, we got it
We are the world, shalom
We are the children, shalingin
We are the ones who make a brighter day, shalom
So let's start giving, cause that's what we're being
There's a chance we're taking
We're taking our own lives
It's true we'll make a brighter day

My life, you are my life
You are my world, yea girl
I will always be with you tonight
Ooh, I just want to fall tonight with youIf I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For everytime I didn't understand
I'd be the world's poorest millionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
I would get embarrased
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two

Something evil's lurking from the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, OW!
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
]
Darkness falls across the land
The midnight hour is close at hand
Creatures crawl in search of blood
To terrorize y'all's neighborhood
And whosoever shall be found
Without the soul for getting down
Must stand and face the hounds of hell
And rot inside a corpse's shell
(I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe, ooh)
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
'Cause I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try
Thriller, thriller night
So let me hold you tight
And share a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
Girl, I can thrill you more
Than any ghoul would ever dare try

Then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor
She said later
What has come of all the people
Have we lost love of what it's about
I have to find my peace
'Cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom
What are the possibilities
I told my brother there'll be problems
Times and tears for fears
We must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it, HOO!
Jam, jam
Here comes the man, hot damn
The big boy stands with an upper hand
Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man, Mike's so relaxed

Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turned up the collar on my favorite winter coat
This wind is blowin' my mind
I see the kids in the street, with not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind, pretending not to see their needs
A summer's disregard, a broken bottle top
And one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind, ya know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways

I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
You gotta get it right, while you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart 
Then you close your mind 
 I'm starting with the man in the mirror, oh yeah
 I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you want to make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that change

 Hoo, hoo, hoo, OW!
 Go make that change, shamone
 You know it, you know it
You know it, you know
 Make that changeIf'n I was God
Well just for spite
I wouldn't set the sun at night
'til everyone was treated right
By everyone else they see
If'n I was God
I'd fix it so, without explaining
Folks would know, they'd know
What's goin' on inside
Of everyone else like me
Nobody hurts nobody else
Oh no I wouldn't let it be
Nobody have a need to pray
Except for thankin' me
If'n I were God
I'd make us wise
So everyone could realise
That everywhere beneath the sun
Everyone needs, everyone
And God, that ain't half what I would do
If'n I were You-oo-oo-ooo-oo-ooo-hoooo

Why don't you?
Give me, give me, give me
Give me half a chance
Why don't you?
Give me, give me, give me
Give me half a chance
Why don't you give me?
Why don't you give me, baby?I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
It is a friend of mine?
Is it my brother?
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
Have mercy
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
It is a friend of mine?
Is it my brother?
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
I am the damned
I am the dead
I am the agony inside
The dying head
This is injustice
Woe unto thee
I pray this punishment
Would have mercy on me
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm bothered everyday
And she didn't leave a letter
She just up and ran away
It is a friend of mine?
Is it my brother?
Somebody hurt my soul, now
I can't take it cause I'm lonely
Now won't you tel me
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have a, have a, have a have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
Have mercy on me
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything

Against my window pane
And wonder if you
Are watching snowflakes, too
I take a walk downtown
To where you used to meet me
There's joy everywhere
But all that's waiting there is
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
I hear the Christmas bells
The happy people singing
The songs of good cheer that only brings me tears
I sadly close my eyes
And say a liitle prayer
You'll be waiting there for me
I look but all I see is
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas Eve
This is the season of love
But I'm as sad as I can be
Why did you have to leave me?
Just a little Christmas tree
Looking sorta sad and lonely just like me
No one seems to care
They just went away and left it standing there
All alone on Christmas EveLike you really used to before we met in the fall

Are a result of the fact that children have had their childhood stolen from them
The magic, the wonder, the mystery, and the innocence of a child's heart
Are the seeds of creativity that will heal the world
I really believe that
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for the world that I come from
'Cause I've been looking around
In the lost and found of my heart
No one understands me
They view it as such strange eccentricities
'Cause I keep kidding around
Like a child, but pardon me
People say I'm not okay
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?
When I create my music, I feel like an instrument of nature
I wonder what delight nature must feel when we open our hearts and express our God-given talents
What we need to learn from children isn't childish
They know the way to summon things that lie waiting to be recognized within our own hearts
People say I'm strange that way
'Cause I love such elementary things
It's been my fate to compensate
For the Childhood  I've never known
Have you seen my Childhood?
I'm searching for that wonder in my youth
Like fantastical stories to share
The dreams I would dare, watch me fly
Before you judge me, try hard to love me
The painful youth I've had
Have you seen my Childhood?She never show me her love

And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone

Anytime she goes away

It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it

Keep it in the closet
If you can get it
It is worth a try

I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me

We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere 
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
I used to say I and me
Now it's us, now it's we
(I used to say, I and me
Now it's us, now it's we)
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
 like Ben 
Like BenYou take sugar and spice
Everything nice
And you got a little girl
You take snakes and snails
Some puppy dog tails
And you got a little boy
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice and everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
Something else to do
You take a walk by the sea
Two hearts on a tree
And you got a little gladness
Blue eyes cry
Two hearts say goodbye
And you got a little sadness
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Heart on a tree
Walk by the sea
Snakes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all right
One more thing
You take a cruel word spoken
Pride gets broken
And you got a little break-up
You take a little bit of soul
Sweet words being told
And you got a little make-up
That's what love is made of
That's what love is made of
Words being told
With a little bit of soul
Pride gets broken
Cruel words spoken
Hearts say goodbye
Eyes start to cry
Walk by the sea
Snkaes snails puppy dog tails
Sugar and spice everything nice
Yeah yeah all rightThere comes a time when we heed a certain call
When the world must come together as one
There are people dying
And it's time to lend a hand to life
The greatest gift of all
We can't go on pretending day by day
That someone, somewhere will soon make a change
We all are a part of God's great big family
And the truth, you know
Love is all we need
We are the world, we are the children
We are the ones who make a brighter day
So let's start giving
There's a choice we're making
We're saving our own lives
It's true we'll make a better day
Just you and me
Send them your heart so they'll know that someone cares
And their lives will be stronger and free
As God has shown us by turning stone to bread
So we all must lend a helping hand
When you're down and out, there seems no hope at all
But if you just believe there's no way we can fall
Well, well, well
Let's realize that a change can only come
When we stand together as oneYour givin me true love
And everyday i thank the lord
For a feeling that's so new
So inviting so exciting
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
Pulling me closer, closer to your arms
Then suddenly your lips are touching mine
A feeling so divine, still i need a path because
I'm lost in a world
Made for you and me
Oooh...
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
Ooooh... baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Played sweet and tenderly
Everytime your lips meet mine, my baby
Baby, baby
I feel the joy begin
Don't let this feeling end
Let it go on and on and on now baby
Baby, baby
Those tears that filled my eyes
I cried not for myself
But for those who have never felt the joy of love
Baby, baby
Whenever your near
I hear a symphony
Each time you speak of me
I hear a tender note so sweet of love
Baby, baby
As you stand there holding me
Whispering how much you care
A thousand violins fill the air, now
Baby, baby
Don't let this moment end
Keep standing close to me
So close to me my baby, baby, baby
Baby, baby
I hear a symphony
A tender melody
I hear a symphonyI took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
No, I believe in miracles, and a miracle has happened tonight 
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, I ain't second to none
And I told about equality, and the truth, either you're wrong or you're right
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this Devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the goin' get's rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
So when the goin' gets mean
Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war 
On a global scale
I'd rather hear of both sides this tale
You see it's not about races 
Just places, spaces 
It's where your blood comes from
It's where your face is
I've seen the blood get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life bein' a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kickin' dirt in my eye 
But if you're thinkin' about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of bein' my brother, it don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's whiteLonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'
Just give me another chance for a romance
Come on and tell me when do you return
'Cause every day that you been gone away
You know my heart does nothin' but burn, cry
Lonely teardrops, my pillow nerver dries
Lonely teardrops, come home, come home
Just say you will, just say you will, say you will
My heart is cryin', cryin'Like a comet
Blazing 'cross the evening sky
Gone too soon
Like a rainbow
Fading in the twinkling of an eye
Gone too soon
Shiny and sparkly
And splendidly bright
Here one day
Gone one night
Like the loss of sunlight
On a cloudy afternoon
Gone too soon
Like a castle
Built upon a sandy beach
Gone too soon
Like a perfect flower
That is just beyond your reach
Gone too soon
Born to amuse, to inspire, to delight
Here one day
Gone one night
Like a sunset
Dying with the rising of the moon
Gone too soon

Ladies and gentlemen
Father comes home from work and he’s scared to death
Mother runs to the table and the note she read
Father runs to the table he said what’s going on?
Mother cries desperately, our little baby is gone
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
She wrote that she's tired of step-daddy using her
Saying that he'll buy her things while sexually abusing her
Just think that she’s all alone somewhere out on the street
How will this girl survive she ain’t got nothing to eat
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Maintaining this is the same old thang
Little stress, little fault, too much change
I see you kept it moving, you see I kept improving
See now we have an agreement, remember how I used to walk up and down the street man
Put it down to the streets watching saying hood it down
Just to earn nothing what good is it now
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Save me from this living hell
Save me cause that I'm gonna do
Save me I'm tired and I'm fed
Save me cause this because of you
Save me cause I’m on a debt
Save me cause I don't want no more
Save me cause terror arrived
Save me
Now she’s on the move, she’s off to Hollywood
She says she wanna be a star, she heard the money is good
She gets off from the train station, a man is waiting there
I’ll show you what the money is, girl just let down your hair
He’s taking her on the streets of sunset boulevard
She’s selling her body ha girl that will take ya far
The police comes around the corner somebody up there told
He’s arresting this little girl she’s only 12 years old
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are
Do you know where your children are?
Because it’s not 12 o’clock, and they’re somewhere out on the street
Just imagine how scared they are X 4

" An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice" sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM. I use "recontexualization" of these lyrics to revisit the killings of Trayvon Martin, Oscar Grant, and the countless number of innocent youths that have fallen prey to violence in Southwest Chicago. "They don't care about us" was shouted as a veiled response to the Rodney King beating , but could it have also been a foretelling or foreshadowing of the tragic humanitarian failures incurred during Hurricane Katrina? One violent scene in the film will be staged to replicate the horrific Rodney King beating. The film asks the question, as Michael did repeatedly via his music: How culpable are WE... when society cannot fully function in the realm of justice? The character "Griot" is the conduit for Michael's often overlooked and under recognized political orientation, a perspective that is often over shadowed by the glow and power of his popular music and larger than life persona. "Griot", pictured here and played by actor Brandon Hirsch, is a one man Greek chorus; "A broken ear witness to unspeakable crimes ". I am blessed and grateful to have an amazing crew and unbelievably talented cast whose creative currency will super charge every pixel of every single frame. As a team of artists, we are especially excited about hiring  local youth from Inglewood and South Central Los Angeles to work on the film, so that they can benefit from the experience of participating in a local professional film production.  Formerly incarcerated Youth from my non profit  FYI FILMS  Films by Youth Inside,  which empowers incarcerated youth via story telling  and digital film making worked as both talent and crew on this GL! ! Lastly, I'm grateful to have the support of  Black Hollywood Education Resource Center. I began writing Griot's Lament the night that Michael left us. In my heart , it is my sincere hope that Griot's Lament is a fitting tribute to the King of Pop, whose music is the soundtrack to much of my life.
Mini Review of Griots Lament by Akello Stone
"These days we are bombarded with lots of visual media, stories and messages in the forms of videos. Most of it is completely unimaginative but Griot's Lament is much different It truly is a short-form "theatrical experience on the small screen" that evokes thoughts with the kind of intellectual depth, auditory stimulation and cadence, and visual creativity that many of us so desire. It truly captures the wonder, the suspense, the social commentary that can draw you in and leave you sitting - wanting more." Bravo!

Trayvon Martin Revisited Via Michael Jackson’s Lyrics in “Griot’s Lament”
JULY 16, 2014 • ENTERTAINMENT, FEATURED • VIEWS: 221
There’s a new trend in entertainment, repurposing the lyrics of artists like Tupac  and now, a new web series, Griot’s Lament does the same with the King of Pop’s lyrics.  It is excellently done and one of the most innovative web series that I’ve seen in a long time and it comes from director, Aleks Munoz.
Here is what the Director had to say about his latest effort, “My next film “GRIOT”S LAMENT” applies Michael Jackson’s lyrics to the artists’ ongoing exploration of metamorphosis as a threshold of change, and as medium for identifying political and social injustices .”
An innocent black man was killed, and we are that injustice” sang Michael alongside his sister Janet in the song SCREAM.

As jacked as it sounds
The whole system sucks, damnit
Hee…ahh…hoo hoo
Peek in the shadow

Then you better prove you're right
You're sellin' out souls but

I've got to get stronger
And I won't give up the fight
With such confusion, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Somebody please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it
Stop pressurin' me

Stop pressurin' me
Just stop pressurin' me
Stop pressurin' me

Oh, my God, can't believe what I saw as I turned on the TV this evening
I was disgusted by all the injustice, all the injustice
Now who’s deceivin’ ya to believe in a
Monotonous fever mainstream mumble the media made up
Keeping a shadow on people, the slaves of the day
Deceived and believed that we’re equal to rights
Peep and getting even
And even when breathing, we can’t inhale freedom
Save the playa haters for later, it’s demons I’m weaving
We’re needing a scheme, it’s making me feel like screaming
With such collusions, don't it make you wanna scream?
Make you wanna scream
Your bash abusin' victimize within the scheme
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize
Oh brother, please have mercy, 'cause I just can't take it

To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something

So, Massa, she was stupid
With the seed that she was bathing
When mama took the street
They said that she was sitting
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Hustling, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You just got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle

With a friend to call my own
I'll never be alone
And you, my friend, will see
You've got a friend in me
Ben, you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind
And don't like what you find
There's something you should know
You've got a place to go
I used to say "I" and "me"
Now it's "us", now it's "we"
Ben, most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do
I wish they would try to
I'm sure they'd think again
If they had a friend like Ben
Like Ben
Like BenLive in sin
Ten years ago on this day
My heart was yearning
I promised I would never ever be returning
When my baby broke my heart and left me yearning, woo
As we walked into the room
There were faces staring
Glaring, tearing through me
Someone said welcome to your doom
Then they smiled with eyes
That looked as if they knew me
This is scaring me, hoo
We walked up the stairs
Still concealing gloom
There were two girls
Sitting in my room
She walked up to my face
Said this is the place
You said meet you right here at noon
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel
Evil Heartbreak Hotel
Hope is dead
She thought that I had cheated for another lover
I turn my back to see that I'm undercover
Now I can't convince this girl there ain't no other
Someone's evil to hurt my soul
Every smile's a trial thought
In beguile to hurt me
Then the man next door had told
She's been here in tears for fifteen years
This is scaring me, woo
We came to this place
Where the vicious dwel'
Found that wicked women
Run this strange hotel
There was Sefra and Sue
Every girl that I knew
And my baby said love is through
Welcome to Heartbreak Hotel

Hoo! Hoo! Hoo! I took my baby on a Saturday 
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
No, I believe in miracles, and a miracle has happened tonight 
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday sun
I had to tell 'em, I ain't second to none
And I told about equality, and the truth, either you're wrong or you're right
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I am tired of this Devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the goin' get's rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
So when the goin' gets mean
It don't matter, it don't matter, it don't matter
It don't matter
Protection
For gangs, clubs, and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war 
On a global scale
I'd rather hear of both sides this tale
You see it's not about races 
Just places, spaces 
It's where your blood comes from
It's where your face is
I've seen the blood get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life bein' a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kickin' dirt in my eye 
But if you're thinkin' about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're thinkin' of bein' my brother, it don't matter if you're black or white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's white
It's black, it's whiteBillie Jean
Who's bad?
She was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" 
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Hoo!
Rock with You
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone
I wanna rock with you 
Dance you into day 
I wanna rock with you 
We're gonna rock the night away 
Bad
Your butt is mine, gonna tell you right
Just show your face in broad daylight
I'm telling you on how I feel
Gonna hurt your mind, don't shoot to kill
Shamone, Shamone
Lay it on me, all right
Well they say the sky's the limit
And to me that's really true
But my friend you have seen nothing
Just wait til I get through
Because I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know I'm bad, I'm bad
You know it 
You know I'm bad, I'm bad 
You know 
And the whole world has to answer right now
Just to tell you once again: Who's bad?
Thriller
It's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
You know it's thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Ooh, babe, I'm gonna thrill you tonight
Thriller night, babe
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years 
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver 
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
Don’t Stop ’Til You Get Enough
Oooh!
Lovely is the feeling now
Fever, temperatures rising now
Power is the force, the vow 
That makes it happen, it asks no questions why 
Keep on with the force don't stop
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Keep on with the force don't stop 
Don't stop 'til you get enough
Black or White/Remember the Time
I took my baby on a Saturday
Boy is that girl with you? Yes, we're one and the same
No, I believe in miracles, and a miracle has happened tonight 
But if you're thinking about my baby, it don't matter if you're black or white
Protection 
For gangs, clubs, and nations

It's a turf war

I'd rather hear of both sides this tale  
You see it's not about races  
Just places, spaces   
It's where your blood comes from
It's where your face is 
I've seen the blood get duller
I'm not gonna spend my life bein' a color  
 
Scream
I'm tired of injustice, I'm tired of the schemes
The lies are disgusting, so what does it mean, damn it?
You're kicking me down, I got to get up
As jacked as it sounds, the whole system sucks, damn it!
Hoo!
Peek in the shadow, come into the light
You tell me I'm wrong, then you better prove you're right!
You're selling out souls but I care about mine
I've got to get stronger, and I won't give up the fight!
With such confusion don't it make you want to scream? 
Your bash abusing victimize within the scheme!
You try to cope with every lie they scrutinize!
Somebody please have mercy, cause I just can't take it!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make me want to scream!
Stop pressuring me, just stop pressuring me
Stop pressuring me, make you just want to scream!
Wanna Be Startin' Somethin'
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you
Help me sing it

This time going to do my best to make it right
Can't go on without you by my side, hold on
Shelter come and rescue me out of this storm
And out of this cold, I need someone
Oh why oh why why why...
Tell her this for me
All I need is...
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
Searching for that one who's going to make me whole
Help me make these mysteries unfold, hold on
Lightning about to strike in rain only on me
Hurt so bad sometimes it's hard to breathe
Oh why why
Tell her this from me
All I need is...
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love
One more chance at love

And I would walk around this world to find her
And I don't care what it takes no, why
I'd sail the seven seas to be near her
And if you happen to see her
See, tell her this from me
One more chance at love

No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Even though the pain and heartache
Seems to follow me wherever I go
Though I try and try to hide my feelings
They always seem to show
Then you try to say you're leaving me
And I always have to say no
Tell me why is it so
That I never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
Every time I think I've had enough
I start heading for the door
There's a very strange vibration
That passes me right through the core
It says, "Turn around, you fool"
You know you'll love her more and more
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye
Oo oo, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh, I never can say goodbye
Oo oo, I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Never can say goodbye
No no no no
Never can say goodbye
I keep thinkin' that our problems
Soon are all gonna work out
But there's that same unhappy feeling
And there's that anguish, there's that doubt
It's that same old, 'Did you hang up?
Can't do with you all the time'
Tell me why is it so
Don't wanna let you go
I never can say goodbye, girl
Oo oo, baby
I never can say goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh, I'm never gonna say you goodbye, girl
Oo ho, I'm never gonna say you goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo
Oh no, I'm never gonna say you goodbye, girl
Oo oo, baby, I'm never gonna say you goodbye
No no no
No no no, oo oo Cuántas personas se perderán y nadie protestará?
 Cuántos pequeños van a llorar y nadie lo evitará?
 Un poco de amor, no hay más que pedir
 para vivir
 Cuántas miradas se esconderán
Pretendiendo no saber?
 Que al mundo herido hay que ayudar
 y es de todos el deber
 Con una oración
 y un poco de fé
 ayudaré...
 Voy a dar todo para ti
 Voy a dar todo para ti
 Ayuda y abrigo
Abrazo de amigo
Amor para ti
 Todos hermanos que el llanto cruel no nos deja hacer la paz
 Todos unidos de corazón y la unión nos salvará

Para vivir...

Amor para tiShe was my life and my greatest star
She was my life when I lost my faith
I never knew how much she loved me
Perhaps it could be, cause she never felt like I've
She had my hand and she gave me a break
Why did she hurt me that way
She was my baby but it doesn't matter anymore
She was my love and now she's gone
They told me you don't know about this girl
She was loving me
She was my dream and my happiness
She was my friend and my deepest journey
Now I can’t stand seeing her face again
Perhaps it could be, cause she's got someone elseOoh, farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh
I found my happiest days
When you came to see your grandma in May
I bumped into you at the corner store
I told you that you sure looked good, now
Your grandma's house was next to mine
We were together most of the time
But summer's gotten away from us
Time's moving too fast for us
Bye-bye, don't turn around
'Cause you might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, ooh yeah
When you return to your hometown
And you discuss your trip
Will I be the guy that you put down
Or someone that you don't forget? No
I'll never forget you
And maybe next year when you're out of school
You'll return, but until you do, baby
Bye-bye, don't turn around
You might see me cry
Farewell my summer love, farewell
Girl, I won't forget you
Farewell, my summer love, farewell, yeah
Ooh, farewell, farewell

If you remember my name 
Drop a line sometime, yeah, yeah, ooh

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom
She was struck down, it was her doom

The girl was dangerous
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch
A kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity

Deep in the night
Deep in the night
Deep in the night
The World don't seem like it's too bad of a place
Deep in the night
The World don't seem like it's too bad of a place
The World don't seem like it's too bad of a place
The World don't seem like it's too bad of a placeShe's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
And so I've learned that love it's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late
And she's... out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
I kept my love for her locked, deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my... lifeHold me like the River Jordan
And I will then say to thee, you are my friend
Carry me like you are my brother
Love me like a mother, will you be there?
Yeah, hold on, yeah
Hold on, oh, yeah
When weary, tell me will you hold me?
When wrong, will you scold me?
When lost, will you find me?
But they told me, a man should be faithful
And walk when not able
And fight till the end but I'm only human
Yeah, oh, hold on
Yeah, oh, yeah
Everyone's taking control of me
Seems that the world's got a role for me
I'm so confused, will you show to me
You'll be there for me and care enough to bear me?
 Show me
 Told me
 Yeah
 I'm only human
 Hold me
 Yeah, I can
 Yeah
 I'm only human
 Carry
 Carry me
 Yeah
 I'm only human
 Lift me
 Give me up, give me up
 I will be there
 Told me
 Yeah
 Yeah
 Hoo
 Get lonely sometimes
 I get lonely, yeah yeah
 Yeah
 Hoo
 Give me up, hold me up, give me up sometimes
 oh, sometimes
 Yeah
In our darkest hour, in my deepest despair
Will you still care? Will you be there?
In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part for you're always in my heartYou're good
You're so goodGo with her and with me yeah

You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something

When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor

To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining

You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable, aow!
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
If you can't feed your baby 
You'll be always trying
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustling, stealing, lying
Now baby's slowly dyin'

You got to be starting something

Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it and then one day you get it
It's so good too but it's just like my girl
When she's around me I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones 'cause ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she's gone
Wonder if she's gone to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And this house just ain't no home
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sun, ain't no sun
No no no
Anytime she goes away
Ain't no sun when she's gone
It's not warm when she's away
And she's always gone too long
Anytime she goes awayChris Tucker: Oh man! Look at that girl, right there!
Goodness gracious! That girl fine, man!
Look at it, she just too fine! She know she fine too!
She is banging!
She's off the hook!
She looks good, you're right
Hey, I bet you, can't nobody get that girl
Chris, I can get her
You can't get that girl, Mike
I guarantee you can't get that girl!
Watch me get that girl
I bet you never-Neverland, you can't
I can get her
All right! Shomon, then. Shomon!
Watch
I don't think they're ready for this one
Darkchild
I like that
My life will never be the same
'Cause girl you came and changed
The way I walk
The way I talk
I cannot explain
These things I feel for you
But girl, you know it's true
Stay with me
Fulfill my dreams
And I'll be all you need
Feels so right
I've searched for the perfect love all my life
Feels like I
Have finally found a perfect love this time
Come on, girl
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
In time
I knew that love would bring
Such happiness to me
I tried to keep my sanity
I've waited patiently
Girl, you know it seems
My life is so complete
A love that's true because of you
Keep doing what you do
Think that I
Finally found the perfect love I've searched for all my life
Think I'd find
Such a perfect love that's awesomely so right
Girl
You rocked my world
You know you did
Everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
And girl, I know that this is love
I felt the magic's all in the air
And girl, I'll never get enough
That's why I'll always have to have you here
You rocked my world
You know you did
Everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rocked my world
You know you did
And everything I own I give
The rarest love who'd think I'd find
Someone like you to call mine
You rock my world
The way you talk to me
The way you're loving me
The way you give it to me
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my world
Come on, girl
Come on, girl
Baby, baby, baby
It's you and me
You and me
You and me
You rock my world
You rock my world
You rock my worldAnother day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought i heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens i will bear
But first i need your hand
Then forever can begin
Everyday i sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
Whisper three words and i'll come runnin'
And girl you know that i'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
For you are not alone
For i am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
For you are not alone...She was more like a beauty queen
From a movie scene
I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
Be careful of what you do
'Cause the lie becomes the truth"
Hey-ay
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son, hoo
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and for forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round
Take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
She told, "My baby, we'd danced 'til three"
Then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cryin'
His eyes looked like mine 
Do a dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
But she came and stood right by me
With the smell of sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room, hey-ay
Billie Jean is not my lover, hoo
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son
A-hee hee hee

She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
She says he is my son

What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?

We both found what we were looking for
With a friend to call my own I'll never be alone
And you my friend will see you've got a friend in me
Ben you're always running here and there
You feel you're not wanted anywhere
If you ever look behind and don't like what you find
There's something you should know you've got a place to go
I used to say "I and me"
Now it's us now it's we
Ben most people would turn you away
I don't listen to a word they say
They don't see you as I do I wish they would try to

You are a cheater Legendary producer Quincy Jones talks about historical meeting between Michael Jackson and Prince, the making of Bad the short film, and one of the tracks Streetwalker did not make the album.
Michael was saying "Let's go" you know, and so we started, like as usual, he goes on the studio, he starts a lot of stuff, you know, those hundreds of tapes and stuff like that, you know, and it was great. And this is the one where I asked to write all the tunes, and I can see him just drawing as an artist and understand the production and all that stuff. Bad was conceived, I wanted to do it with Prince, you know, It would've been great, man, really well, you know, it's just for drama, man, you know how it fights as two of them, you know. I have a video with him coming to kick Michael's ass and says "Your butt is mine", you know, I mean, that's what it's written for, you know, to do that, and I set up the meeting with Prince and Michael, this is the historical night, Prince finally said "You don't need me, to be honest", and I'm like "It will be him without me", you know.

You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor
With a fever, but nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', lyin'
Sayin' you just wanna be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

And too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Billie Jean is always talkin'
When nobody else is talkin'
Tellin' lies and rubbin' shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always tryin'
To start my baby cryin'
Talkin', squealin', spyin'
Now baby's slowly dyin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'

You're a vegetable, OW...
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
If you can't feed your baby 
You'll be always tryin'
To stop that child from cryin'

That you know you shouldn't have
The more you know you shouldn't have it
The more you want it
And then one day you get it
It's so good too
But it's just like my girl
When she's around me
I just feel so good, so good
But right now I just feel cold, so cold
Right down to my bones
Because ooh
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
It's not warm when she is away
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
And she is always gone too long
Anytime she goes away
Wonder this time where she is gone
Wonder if she is going to stay
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes away
I know, I know, I know, I know
I know, know, know, know, know
I know, I know
Hey I ought to leave
I ought to leave her alone
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
Ain't no sunshine when she's gone
Only darkness every day
Ain't no sunshine when she is gone
And this house just is no home
Anytime she goes awayThe song you're about to hear, Fly Away, was originally recorded during the Bad album sessions. The song was cut from the final selection of tracks.Hee-hee!

The way you make me feel

You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy

Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind

The way that you made me feel
A burning deep down inside
A love that I cannot hide
I know it's you honey baby, yeah
That makes the world go round
And it's keeping me here loving you baby
Laying all my troubles down
Here I am baby come and take me
Here I am baby come and take me
Take me by the hand
Oh, show me here I am baby, take me
Oh.. it always ends up this way
Me begging you every day
From love that I cannot hide
You broke my heart into half
I know it's you and me
Baby yeah...I'm gonna make a change
For once in my life
It's gonna feel real good
Gonna make a difference
Gonna make it right
As I turn up the collar on
My favorite winter coat
This wind is blowing my mind
I see the kids in the street
With not enough to eat
Who am I to be blind
Pretending not to see their need?
A summer's disregard
A broken bottle top
And a one man's soul
They follow each other on the wind you know
'Cause they got nowhere to go
That's why I want you to know
I'm starting with the man in the mirror
I'm asking him to change his ways
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Nanana, nanana, nana, nana, uh-huh
I've been a victim of
A selfish kind of love
It's time that I realize
That there are some with no home
Not a nickel to loan
Could it be really me
Pretending that they're not alone?
A willow deeply scarred
Somebody's broken heart
And a washed-out dream
They follow the pattern of the wind you see
'Cause they got no place to be
That's why I'm starting with me
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
And no message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make that, change
I'm starting with the man in the mirror 
I'm asking him to change his ways 
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make the change
You gotta get it right
While you got the time
'Cause when you close your heart
You can't close your, your mind
That man, that man , that man 
That man, that man, that man, that man
That man, that man
No message could have been any clearer
If you wanna make the world a better place
Take a look at yourself and then make a change
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Hoo, hoo, hoo
Gonna feel real good, yeah 
Yeah yeah, yeah yeah
I'm gonna make a change
It's gonna feel real good, shamon 
Just lift yourself
You know it
You've got to stop it yourself 
Hoo 
I've gotta make that change today
You got to move, you know it, you know it
Yeah, brother
Here for the brother
You know it, you know it, you do
You know it, you know it, you do, ooh, oh
Gonna make that change today, yeah

Good night, everybody
Thank you
I'm gonna make that change, shamone
I love youI just want to lay next to you for a while
You look so beautiful tonight
Your eyes are so lovely
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me at all
I just want to touch you
And hold you
I need you, God I need you
I love you so much
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
Cause I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I doYou've been hit by—

As he came into the window
Was a sound of a crescendo
He came into her apartment
He left the bloodstains on the carpet
She ran underneath the table
He could see she was unable
So she ran into the bedroom

Okay, I want everybody to clear the area right now!
Aaow!There's a ghost out in the hall
There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Oh, babe
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo!
Dah
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's taunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is this scary for you, baby?
Masquerade the heart is
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See, the evil one is you
Is this scary for you, baby? 
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Tell me, hoo! Hoo! Hoo!
Oh, babyTwenty five miles from home, girl
My feet are hurtin' mighty bad
Now I’ve been walkin' for three days
And two lonely nights you know that I'm mighty bad
But I got a girl waitin’ for me
That's gonna make this trip worthwhile
You see, she's got the kind
Of lovin' and kissin' make a boy go stone wild
I got to keep on walkin'
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can’t lose my stride
I got fifteen miles to go now
And I can hear my baby callin’ my name
It's as if, as though I’m standin' at her front door
And I can hear that doggone thing
Now I'll be so glad to see my baby
And hold her in my arms one more time
And when I kiss her lips I turn backward flip
And I forget about these feet of mine
I got to keep on walkin'
Oh, I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y’all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
Yeah, I got to walk on let me tell you
Y'all hope my feet don't fail me now
I got five more miles to go
I got nine, eight, seven, six, oh six
I got five more miles to go now
Over the hills just around the bend
Although my feet are tired, I can't lose my stride
I got to get my baby back again
I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
I got to walk on
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
Oh, I got to walk on, Aaah!
Let me tell you, y'all I'm so tired
But I just can't lose my stride
I got to keep on walkin', Aaah!
I got to walk onIf I had a penny
For every time I didn't hold your hand
If I had a nickel
For everytime I didn't understand
I'd be the world's first billionaire
'Cause you're not there
And no one ever told me
What you already knew
If I had only reached out
I might still be touching you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
You've got, you've gotta to touch
You gotta touch the one who loves you
I would get embarrased
For every time a movie made you cry
You get sentimental
And I would never know the reason why
I'd hold the world's highest record
For my selfish pride
Is it really over?
Can I get close to you?
I only want to show you
That I've learned a thing or two
Touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch you
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You got to touch the one you love
If you want the one you love to touch
You've got to touch the one you love

I met her on my way to Chicago
Where she was all alone
And so was I so I asked her for her name
She smiled and looked at me
I was surprised to see
That a woman like that was really into me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me, yeah
I never would have thought
She was livin' like that
Her words seemed so sincere
And when I held her near
She would tell me how she feels
It felt so real to me
This girl she had to be
An angel sent from Heaven just for me
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she was lovin' me, lovin' me yeah
She tried to live a double life
Lovin' me while she was still your wife
She thought that lovin' me was cool
With you at work and the kids at school
She said that it would never end
Tried to keep me any way she can
She'd lie to you, lie to me
'Cause she had a family, family, yeah
Why.. oooh ooooh

Now I feel so much shame
And all things have to change
You should know that
I’m holdin' her to blame
She said she didn’t have no man
Raised the kids the very best she can
She told me she was all alone
Said at home she didn’t have no phone
She said just to give her a page
Fifty nine was the code she gave
She'd lie to you, lie to me

Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?

Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We’d be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we’d stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me

Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me
You always knew just how to make me cry
And never did I ask you questions why
It seems you get your kicks from hurting me
Don't try to understand me
Because your words just aren't enough
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Love is a woman
I don't wanna hear it
Give in to me, give in to me
You and your friends were laughing at me in town
But it's okay and it's okay
You won't be laughing girl when I'm not around
I'll be okay

Better, a peace of mind, no
Don't try to tell me
Because your words just aren't enough
Love is a feeling
Quench my desire
Give it when I want It
Taking me higher
Talk to me, woman
Love is a feeling
Give in to me, give in to me, give in to me
Oh, love is a feeling

'Cause I'm on fire
Talk to me, woman
Quench my desire
Give in to the feelingJust promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we will be making a vow, to just
Keep it in the closetHoo!
I don't know, bet you wanna try
Every time you see
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk?
You know, we'd stay on the phone at night till dawn
Do you remember all the things we said?
Like, "I love you so, I'll never let you go"
Do you remember, back in the spring?
Every morning, birds would sing
Do you remember those special times?
They'll just go on and on
In the back of my mind
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Those sweet memories
Will always be dear to me
And girl no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now baby
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Hoo!
Do you remember, girl?
On the phone, you and me
Till dawn, two or three
What about us, girl?
Do you, do you, do you?
Do you, do you?
In the park, on the beach
You and me, in Spain
What about, what about
Grrrrrat, tat tat, tat

Please don't you ever get up 
Just get your weight off of me
Please don't you ever get up 
I tried to give
Please don't you ever get upReaching out
Across the night-time
The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice
Shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out
Into the night-time
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town
Is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
Reaching out
To touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl
She knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Ha-wah-oh-wah
Ha-wah-wah
Reaching out
Into the night-time
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out
I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
Everybody sing
If they say, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
Everybody, "Why? Why?"
Tell 'em that is human nature
Why, why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Ooh, tell them
Why does he do me that way?
If they say, "Why? Why? Why? Why?"
Ooh, tell 'em
Why does he do me that way?
I like living this way
Ha-wah-oh-wah

Wah...I just want to lay next to you for a while
Dedicated for this song to all of the people from Japan, for my dear friend, Yoshiaki
Your mouth is so sweet
A lot of people misunderstand me
That's because they don't know me
Each time the wind blows
I hear your voice so
I call your name
Whispers at morning
Our love is dawning
Heaven's glad you came
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I'm so proud to say I love you
Your love's got me high
I long to get by
This time is forever
Love is the answer
I hear your voice now
You are my choice now
The love you bring
Heaven's in my heart
At your call, I hear harps
And angels sing
You know how I feel
This thing can't go wrong
I can't live my life without you
I just can't hold on
I feel we belong
My life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
At night when the stars shine
I pray in you I'll find
A love so true
When morning awakes me
Will you come and take me
I'll wait for you
You know how I feel
I won't stop until
I hear your voice saying, "I do"
"I do"
This thing can't go wrong
This feeling's so strong
Well, my Life ain't worth living
If I can't be with you
I just can't stop loving you
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you
We can change all the world tomorrow
We can sing songs of yesterday
I can say, "Hey, Farewell" to sorrow
This is my life and I
Want to see you for always
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do 
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do
I just can't stop loving you 
I just can't stop loving you 
And if I stop
Then tell me just what will I do

Now she wanna call me conceited
'Cause I'm a Smooth Criminal
I told her to Beat It
When a lil' love was all I needed
You talkin'? I call it how I see it
And now I mean it I'm out for good
Like a lot of you into movin' out the hood
But if I told you take me back you would
Too late me and P like Pac & Suge 
Had you into cars with a metro
With a couple superstar from the ghetto
Now you feelin' so soft and you let go
Of da T.E.M.P.A Mental

A friend you'll never be
Obviously you've never been with a real O-G
From the H-I-T, rollin' B-I-G
Pass it through V-I-P
It's the refugee 
We come spread some love, like the gold rush
It was the things you did, that used to mean so much
Wwherever you touched, the way you used to blush
Now I made you brush? Don't believe in such 
Nonsense, lovers don't promote violence
Nonsense, just like the dollar, no cents, no good
I can feel it through my sixth sense
What's this, wanna suck my existence? 
But still I believe in you and me
Quite frankly that's how it's supposed to be
That kind of love that can end any poverty
So I keep you scoped like a Kennedy 
What you gonna do?

Cause I'm gonna get to you
Nowhere ta run, nowhere ta hide
All the things you said
And the things you done to me
You can no longer make me cry
Look what you done to me, baby
I can no longer smile baby
And I've waited so long, just to carry on

You give me fever like I've never, ever known
You're just a product of loveliness
I like the groove of your walk, your talk, your dress
I feel your fever from miles around
I'll pick you up in my car and we'll paint the town
Just kiss me baby and tell me twice
That you're the one for me
The way you make me feel
You really turn me on
You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone
I like the feelin' you're givin' me
Just hold me, baby, and I'm in ecstasy
Oh, I'll be workin' from 9 to 5
To buy you things to keep you by my side
I've never felt so in love before
Just promise baby, you'll love me forevermore
I swear I'm keeping you satisfied
'Cause you're the one for me
The way you make me feel

You knock me off of my feet
My lonely days are gone

But mine and my baby
G'on, girl! Aaow!Do it one more time. I sung the wrong lyrics
She's out of my life
She's out of my life
And I don't know whether to laugh or cry
I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
It's out of my hands
It's out of my hands
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted, I was so cavalier
Now, the way that it stands
She's out of my hands
So, I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love won't wait
Now, I've learned that love needs expression
But, I've learned too late
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my lifeDonated... by blaqsoul [Verse

So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying, "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need"
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touchin' me so to start
She says, "There's no turnin' back"
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana
Oh no, oh no
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan after the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying, "That's okay
Hey, baby, do what you want
I'll be your night lovin' thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I wanna go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star"

Dirty Diana, no
Woo-hoo
She said, "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleepin' alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said, "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright"
Diana walked up to me
She said, "I'm all yours tonight"
I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright
But unlock the door
Because I forgot my key"
"He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me"
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, no

She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
A slave to the rhythm of

Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you from the beast about to strike
This is thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller tonight, yeah
Ooh woo, oh
You hear the door slam and realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand and wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes and hope that this is just imagination
But all the while you hear a creature creepin' up behind
You're outta time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller. OW
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of forty thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller, hee hee hee, thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight

So let me hold you tight and share a killer, thriller, OW
ThrillerAll along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see
Cause' when he's in your arms
You're throwing rocks at me!
Who do you love?
Is it me?
With you?
I don't know
Who do you love?

If you can't answer
You know me
There is nothing in your eyes
But that's the way you cry girl, 
All is grand, all is bright
Eh-eh-eh

When I come to you
You're sitting in your room
You sit around in the strangest place
So take off the mask

Of popcorn and candy
Pony rides for a dime
Little children laughing
I'm from a world
Of disappointments and confusions
But I want her to be mine
I started talking
She kept on walking
She disappeared into the crowd
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who left my heart in pieces
Lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran away
Two different people
In love for an instant
To see that the circus came today
Sometimes I can hear the calliope
And I can hear her calling me
I lost my heart
On the carousel
To a circus girl
Who ran awayWith the Child's Heart
Go face the worries of the day
With the child’s heart
Turn each problem into play
No need to worry, no need to fear
Just being alive makes it all so very clear
With the child's heart
Nothing can ever get you down
With a child's heart
You’ve got no reason to frown
Love is as welcome
As a sunny, sunny day
No grown-up thoughts
To lead our hearts astray
Take life easy, so easy, nice and easy
Like a child, so gay and so carefree
Yeah
The whole world smiles with you
As you go your merry way
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing's gonna get me down
Oh with a child's heart
Nothing's gonna get me, nothing's gonna get
Nothing’s gonna get me down
Oh with a child’s heart
Sing nothing's gonna get me, nothing’s gonna get

Happen in the streetYou'll never make me stay
So take your weight off of me
I know your every move
So won't you just let me be?
I've been here times before
But I was too blind to see
That you seduce every man
This time you won't seduce me
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you please
I have the stuff that you want
I am the thing that you need."
She looked me deep in the eyes
She's touching me so to start
She says: "There's no turning back."
She trapped me in her heart
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, nah
Dirty Diana, no
Dirty Diana, let me be!
Oh no, oh no, oh no
She likes the boys in the band
She knows when they come to town
Every musician's fan
After the curtain comes down
She waits at backstage doors
For those who have prestige
Who promise fortune and fame
A life that's so carefree
She's saying: "That's okay
Hey baby, do what you want
I'll be your night-loving thing
I'll be the freak you can taunt
And I don't care what you say
I want to go too far
I'll be your everything
If you make me a star."

She said: "I have to go home
'Cause I'm real tired you see
But I hate sleeping alone
Why don't you come with me?"
I said: "My baby's at home
She's probably worried tonight
I didn't call on the phone
To say that I'm alright."
Diana walked up to me
She said: "I'm all yours tonight."
At that I ran to the phone
Saying, "Baby, I'm alright."
I said: "But unlock the door
'Cause I forgot the key."
She said: "He's not coming back
Because he's sleeping with me."

Then happy came one day
Chased my blues away
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
Happy, that's you
You made my life brand new
Lost as a little lam was I till you came in
My life began when happy smiled
Sweet, like candy to a child
Stay here and love me just a while
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was
Where have I been? What lifetime was I in?
Suspended between time and space
Lonely until happy came smiling up at me
Sadness had no choice but to flee
I said a prayer so silently
Let sadness see what happy does
Let happy be where sadness was till now
Till now happy, yeah yeah happy
Yeah happy, oh happy
Happy, oh yeah happyI woke up yesterday
Knowing I was lost in the past somewhere
I felt my destiny was a sad parade
Going no-o-where
When I saw my sweet melodie
Like a song, you enchanted me
And the sound of your voice
Made my heart keep time
To the music of a love that filled my mind
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Doo-doo-oo doo-oo dooo-doo ooo-ooo
The long and winding road
Is much shorter now that you're here with me
The questions in my mind
Have been answered now that you’ve told me
All the colours are brighter now
And the darkness is lighter now
In my mind I can hear
The band start to play
Hello tomorrow
Goodbye yesterday
Melodie, you're my symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Beautiful morning
Oh happy day
And you know that it’s music to my ears
Every word that you say-ay-ayyy
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya only
Melodie, you're a symphony
A love song to me
You're my only, only
Melodie, you're my everything
Make me wanna sing
For ya onlyNation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last
Go with it, go with it

The world keeps changing, rearranging minds and thoughts
Predictions fly of doom, the baby boom has come of age, we'll work it out
I told my brothers don't you ask me for no favors
I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?
I just want you to recognize me in the temple
You can't hurt me, I've found peace within myself
Go with it, go with it

Who's doing me by
It's worth the giving
It's worth the try
You cannot cleave it
Or put it in the furnace
You cannot wet it
You cannot burn it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
It's just a feeling
You have to soothe it
You can't neglect it
You can't abuse it
It's just desire
You cannot waste it
Then, if you want it
Then, won't you taste it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
One thing in life you must understand
The truth of lust, woman to man
So open the door and you will see
There are no secrets
Make your move
Set me free
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
I'ma get it
I'm with you
Keep it in the closet
If you can get it
It is worth a try
I really want it
I can't deny
It's just desire
I really love it
'Cause if it's aching
You have to rub it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Just open the door and you will see
This passion burns inside of me
Don't say to me you'll never tell
Touch me there
Make the move
Cast the spell
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or do to each other
For now we'll make a vow, to just
Keep it in the closet
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
Because there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
I swear there's something about you baby
That makes me want to give it to you
There's something about you baby
That makes me want
Just promise me whatever we say
Or whatever we do to each other
For now we'll make a vow to just
Keep it in the closet
She wants to give it
Ahh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ahh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ahh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ahh, she wants to give it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
She wants to give it
Ahh, she wants to give itIt's close to midnight
Something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight
You see a sight that almost stops your heart
You try to scream
But terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze
As horror looks you right between your eyes
You're paralyzed
'Cause this is thriller
Thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the beast about to strike
Thriller
Thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer
Thriller tonight, yeah, ooh, baby, oooh!
You hear the door slam
And realize there's nowhere left to run
You feel the cold hand
And wonder if you'll ever see the sun
You close your eyes
And hope that this is just imagination
Girl, but all the while
You hear a creature creeping up behind
You're out of time
'Cause this is thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, aow!
The foulest stench is in the air
The funk of 40 thousand years
And grisly ghouls from every tomb
Are closing in to seal your doom
And though you fight to stay alive
Your body starts to shiver
For no mere mortal can resist
The evil of the thriller!
Thriller, thriller night
And no one's gonna save you
From the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller, chiller
Thriller here tonight
Thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance
Against the thing with 40 eyes, girl
Thriller, thriller night
You're fighting for your life
Inside a killer, thriller
ThrillerBlack or White
I took my baby on a Saturday bang
Boy, is that girl with you?
Yes, we're one and the same
And I told 'em about equality
And it's true, either you're wrong or you're right
But, if you're thinking about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Can’t Let Her Get Away
I try so hard to love you
Some things take time and shame
I think the whole world of you
Your thoughts of me remain
I'll play the fool for you
I'll change the rules for you
Just say it and I'll do
Just make this dream come true 
If I let her get away
Though I'm begging on my knees
I'll be crying everyday
Knowing the girl that got away
I can't let, I can't let her get away
I can't let
Dangerous
The way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Who Is It
I gave her money
I gave her time
I gave her everything
Inside one heart could find
I gave her passion
My very soul
I gave her promises
And secrets so untold
And she promised me forever
And a day we’d live as one
We made our vows
We’d live a life anew
And she promised me in secret
That she'd love me for all time
It’s a promise so untrue
Tell me what will I do?
And it doesn't seem to matter
And it doesn't seem right
‘Cause the will has brought no fortune
Still I cry alone at night
Don't you judge of my composure
‘Cause I'm lying to myself
And the reason why she left me
Did she find in someone else?
Remember the Time
Do you remember when we fell in love?
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began?
It just seemed like heaven, so why did it end?
Do you remember, back in the fall?
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands?
In each other's eyes, we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
When we first met, girl
Do you remember the time?
When we fell in love
Do you remember the time?
Give In to Me
She always takes it with a heart of stone
'Cause all she does is throw it back to me
I've spent a lifetime looking for someone
Don't try to understand me
Just simply do the things I say
Love is a feeling
Give it when I want it
'Cause I'm on fire
Quench my desire
Give it when I want it
Talk to me, woman
Give in to me, give in to me

From a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean
I am the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She said I am the one
Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes
That dreamed of being the one. Who will dance
On the floor
In the round. People always told me
Be careful of what you do. And don’t go around
Breaking young girls' hearts. And mother always told me
Be careful of who you love. And be careful of what you do
Cause the lie becomes the truth. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
For forty days and forty nights
Law was on her side
But who can stand when she’s in demand
Her schemes and plans. Go dance on
On the floor
In the round. So take my strong advice
Just remember to always think twice
She told my baby
We'll dance till 3: 00
And she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby cries
His eyes were like mine 
Go dance
On the floor
In the round
People always told me
Be careful of what you do
And don't go around
Breaking young girls hearts
She came and stood right by me
Just the smell of her sweet perfume
This happened much too soon
She called me to her room. Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son. She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl
Who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
But the kid is not my son
She says I am the one
She says he is my son
She says I am the one
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my loverI said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
I took my baby to the doctor with a fever
But nothing he found
By the time this hit the street
They said she had a breakdown
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, lying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You love to pretend that you're good
When you're always up to no good
You really can't make him hate her
So your tongue became a razor
Someone's always trying
To keep my baby crying
Treacherous, cunning, declining
You got my baby crying 
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable, aow!
Billie Jean is always talking when nobody else is talking
Telling lies and rubbing shoulders
So they called her mouth a motor
Someone's always trying
To start my baby crying
Talking, squealing, spying
Saying you just want to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You're a vegetable 
You're a vegetable 
Still they hate you 
You're a vegetable 
You're just a buffet 
You're a vegetable 
They eat off of you 
You're a vegetable, aow!
Aow!
Hee-haw
Oooh!
If you can't feed your baby 
Then don't have a baby 
And don't think maybe 
If you can't feed your baby 
You'll be always trying
To stop that child from cryin'
Hustling, stealing, lying
Now baby's slowly dyin'
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
I said you want to be starting something
You got to be starting something
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too high to get over 
You're too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
Lift your head up high and scream out to the world
"I know I am someone," and let the truth unfurl
No one can hurt you now because you know what's true
Yes, I believe in me, so do believe in you

No one wants to be...To make my father proud
To make my mother smile
I need not conquer worlds, or fame
Nor set the pace for style
If I can follow through
On what they gave me as my tools
I'll find a way to sail my course
Avoiding ships of fools
If I don't come up, number one
I'll stand not well apart
As one for numbered numbers
When knowing in my heart
I've done all to be done
To always do my best
By listening to me myself
So he can do the rest
(Law without compromise
Shall follow the feel of constant care)
In my eleventh hour
I'll be a man aware
To face whatever falls my way
Prepared then unashamed
To just be called a part of God
For which I have been named
A man and woman's youngest son
While growing still a child
And that will make my father proud
And make my mother smileThe way she came into the place
I knew right then and there
There was something different
About this girl
The way she moved
Her hair, her face, her lines
Divinity in motion
As she stalked the room
I could feel the aura
Of her presence
Every head turned
Feeling passion and lust
The girl was persuasive
The girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew but I was
Walking the line
Come go with me
I said I have no time
She said don't you pretend we didn't
Talk on the phone
My baby cried
She left me standing alone
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
She came at me in sections
With the eyes of desire
I fell trapped into her
Web of sin
A touch
A kiss
A whisper of love
I was at the point
Of no return
Deep in the darkness of
Passion's insanity
I felt taken by lust's
Strange inhumanity
This girl was persuasive
This girl I could not trust
The girl was bad
The girl was dangerous
I never knew
But I was living in vain
She called my house
She said you know my name
And don't you pretend
You never did me before
With tears in her eyes
My baby walked out the door
She's so dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to God
Cause I know how
Lust can blind
It's a passion in my soul
But you're no damn lover
Friend of mine
I cannot sleep alone at night
My baby left me here tonight
I cannot cope 'til it's all right
You and your manipulation
You hurt my baby
And then it happened
She touched me
For the lips of
A strange woman
Drop as a honeycomb
And her mouth was
Smoother than oil
But her inner spirit and words
Were as sharp as
A two-edged sword
But I loved it
Cause it's dangerous
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
Take away my money
Throw away my time
You can call me honey
But you're no damn good for me
Dangerous
The girl is so dangerous
I have to pray to GodLa-la-aa-ah
Butterflies, inside

Don't acknowledge my smile, when I try to say hello, to you, yeah
Ah, an' all you got ta do is not answer my calls when I'm try'n'a get through
Keep'n me wonderin' why-y-y, when all I can do is sigh
I just wanna touch you
I just wanna touch and kiss
And I wish that I could be with you, girl
Tonight, you give me
'Cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
All I got to say is that I must be dreamin', can't be real
You're not here with me, see that I can feel ya near to me
I caress you, let you taste the just so blissful, lips then
I would give you anything baby
Ah, just to make my dreams come true
Aow baby, you give me butterflies
Saw you, baby

You give me 
'Cause you give me butterflies, inside inside and I
Tells ya, babyAnother day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone 
I am here with you 
Though you're far away 
I am here to stay
But you are not alone 
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone 
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh

I took my baby on a Saturday bang
"Boy, is that girl with you?"
Yes, we're one and the same
Now I believe in miracles
And a miracle has happened tonight, hee
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
They print my message in the Saturday Sun
I had to tell them I ain't second to none
And I told about equality
And it's true - either you're wrong or you're right, hoo
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
Don't look at that
Hee-hee
I am tired of this devil
I am tired of this stuff
I am tired of this business
So when the going gets rough
I ain't scared of your brother
I ain't scared of no sheets
I ain't scared of nobody
Girl, when the goin' gets mean
Protection for gangs, clubs and nations
Causing grief in human relations
It's a turf war on a global scale
I'd rather hear both sides of the tale
See, it's not about races
Just places
Faces
Where your blood comes from
Is where your space is
I've seen the bright get duller
I'm not going to spend my life being a color
Don't tell me you agree with me
When I saw you kicking dirt in my eye, hee-hee
But if you're thinkin' about my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're think of bein' my baby
It don't matter if you're black or white
I said if you're think of bein' my brother
It don't matter if you're black or white
Alright

Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air?
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you wanna see
It's you whose taunting me
Because you're warning me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you?
Or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you wanna see eccentricalities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
There's a creaking in the floor
There's a creep behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin that lay open
Where a restless soul has spoken
I'm gonna be
Exactly what you've come to see
So did you come to me
To see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes
A haunting ghostly treat
The ghoulish trickery
And spirits dancing in the night
But if you came to see
The truth, the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, woo
Masquerade the heart
Is it the height of hurting souls
I'm just not what you seek of me

Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, woo
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is that scary for you, baby?
Tell me, woo

Ooh babyShe was more like a beauty queen from a movie scene
I said don't mind, but what do you mean I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
She said I am the one who will dance on the floor in the round
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
It's close to midnight and something evil's lurking in the dark
Under the moonlight you see a sight that almost stops you hearts
You try to scream but terror takes the sound before you make it
You start to freeze as horror looks you right between the eyes
You're paralyzed
‘Cause this is thriller, thriller night
There ain't no second chance against the thing with forty eyes, girl
Thriller , thriller night
You're fighting for your life inside a killer, thriller
I said you wanna be startin' somethin
You got to be startin' somethin'
I said you wanna be startin' somethin'
You got to be startin' somethin'
It's too high to get over
Too low to get under
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
It's too hight to get over 
And too low to get under 
You're stuck in the middle 
And the pain is thunder 
You got to be startin'
You wanna be startin'
You got to be startin' somethin' 
You wanna be startin' somethin'
Somethin' somethin' somethin' somethin'

In my trials and my tribulations
Through our doubts and frustrations
In my violence, in my turbulence
Through my fear and my confessions
In my anguish and my pain
Through my joy and my sorrow
In the promise of another tomorrow
I'll never let you part

DangerousNation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last

My jeep began to rock
I didn't know what to do, so I stopped, and got out
And looked down, I noticed I've got a flat
So I walked out, parked the car, like sideways
So I can find what I can fix
I looked around, there were no cars on the highway
I felt a strange feeling like a mist
So I walked down towards the end of the road
And in the fog, a woman appeared
She said, "Don't you worry, my friend, I'll take care
Take my hand, I'll take you there"
Oh
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name
Take me to a place without no name
As she took me right through the fog
I seen beautiful city appear
Of where kids are playing and people are laughing
And smiling and nothing to fear
She said, "This is the place where no people have pain, with love and happiness
She turned around, looked down at my eyes, and they started crying
And grabbed my hand, you've got a friend"
Oh
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name 
She started liking me, kissing me, and hugging me
She didn't really, really want me to leave
She showed me places I've never seen, and things I've never done
This really looks like a lot of fun
I've seen the grass, and the skies and the birds
And the flowers surrounded by the trees
This place is filled with love and happiness
How in the world could I wanna leave? Oh
Take me to a place without no name 
Take me to a place without no name

Here comes the rain
And heartache pain
What can i do but wait for you?
Darling, the days I had were cold
Now our separate ways we go
It seems you want more
Than the love I can give
But I can't make you stay
And you've got your life to live
But if it gets too rough
Call on me
Dreams of golden glare
Taking you away from here
But if ever things that have to be
Turns your dreams around
Love and understanding is what you need
If you can't get enough
Call on me
I'm so sad you're leaving
It's gonna kill me not to be with you
But I want you to be happy
If heartache's what you want
Then I want it too
So goodbye with all my prayers
For your happiness in a world elsewhere
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there
Call on me, call on me
Yes, happiness waits for you elsewhere
Remember this
Should you arrive and it's not there

I'm still all alone
How could this be
You're not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl, you know that I'll be there
I'll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone

Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk
You know we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said
Like I love you so, I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had

The city winks a sleepless eye
Hear her voice, shake my window
Sweet seducing sighs
Get me out, into the nighttime
Four walls won't hold me tonight
If this town is just an apple
Then let me take a bite
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
Reaching out to touch a stranger
Electric eyes are everywhere
See that girl, she knows I'm watching
She likes the way I stare
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
I like livin' this way
I like lovin' this way
Why? Oh, why?
Why? Oh, why?
Reaching out... across the nighttime
The city's heart begins to beat
Reaching out, I touch her shoulder
I'm dreaming of the street
If they say why , why 
Tell them that it's human nature
Why , why , does he do me that way?
If they say why , why 
Ooh-ooh, tell 'em!
Why, does he do me that way?
If they say why
Cha-da-cha-sha-sha-sha-sha-sha

She dances to his needs
She dances 'til he feels just right
Until he falls asleep
She dances at the crack of dawn
And quickly cooks his food
She can't be late, can't take too long
The kids must get to school
She's a slave to the rhythm
She's a slave to the rhythm of
She's a slave to the rhythm
To the rhythm, to the rhythm, to the rhythm
Rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm, rhythm
She works so hard just to make her way
For a man who just don't appreciate
And though he takes her love in vain
Yet she could not stop, couldn't break his chains
She danced the night that they fell out
She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit
As she ran out the door
She danced through the night in fear of her life
She danced to a beat of her own
She let out a cry and swallowed her pride
She knew she was needed back home, home
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm
'Cause she's a slave to the rhythm of

A slave to the rhythm of

Your promise for my ring
Now just like back to grade school
You're doing the same old thing
Stop! The love you save may be your own
Darling, take it slow
Or some day you'll be all alone
Darling, look both ways before you cross me
You're headed for the danger zone
I'll Be There
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back

Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way
Empty words are not enough
Where there's hurt we'll be a crush
When there's thirst we'll fill each other's cup
Because we care we love enough to share 
Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day 
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way
In despair we'll be the hope 
And the prayer that frees the soul 
We'll be there to share each lonely road 
Because we love, I know 
We care enough 
Maybe you and I can't do great things 
We may not change the world in one day 
But we still can change some things today 
In our small way
Just a little time is all it takes
What a difference just a smile can make, you'll see
Love is all we need 
Maybe you and I can't do great things
We may not change the world in one day
But we still can change some things today
In our small way

I don't know - don't you wanna chill with me
Every time you see me, hahaha
Do you remember when we fell in love
We were young and innocent then
Do you remember how it all began
It just seemed like heaven
So why did it end?
Do you remember back in the fall
We'd be together all day long
Do you remember us holding hands
In each other's eyes we'd stare
Tell me
Do you remember the time when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Do you remember how we used to talk
You know we'd stay on the phone at night 'til dawn
Do you remember all the things we said
Like I love you so, I'll never let you go
Do you remember back in the spring
Every morning birds would sing
Do you remember those special times
They'll just go on and on in the back of my mind
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time?
Those sweet memories will always be dear to me
And girl, no matter what was said
I will never forget what we had
Now, baby
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?
Do you remember the time when we first met, girl?
Do you remember the time  when we fell in love?

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?

She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        Alone she lays waiting
Surrounded by gloom
Invaded by shadows
Painting the
The light from the window
Cuts through the air
And pins the child lying there
Scared of the moon
She pulls up the covers
And shivers in fright
She hides from the color
That rides on the night
The light through the window
That lights up the sky
And causes her mournful cry
Scared of the moon
There's nothing wrong
Don't be bothered they said
It's just childish fantasies turning your head
No need to worry
It's really too soon
But there she lies shivering
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
The years go by swiftly
And soon childhood ends
But life is still fearful
When evening descends
The fear of a child
Still intrudes the night
Returning on beams of light
Scared of the moon
The feeling of terror
She felt as a youth
Has turned from a fantasy
Into the truth
The moon is the enemy
Twisting her soul
And taking its fearful toll
Scared of the moon
But now there are others who sit in a room
And wait for the sunlight to brighten their gloom
Together they gather
Their lunacy shade
But knowing just why they're scared
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moon
Scared of the moonDance!
Uh, let me see ya move... c'mon!
Yeah, dance!
Uh, let me see ya move...
Baby, love never felt so good
And I doubt if it ever could
Not like you hold me, hold me

Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many struggles must there be
Before we choose to live the prophet's plan?

Don't let no one get you down
Keep moving on higher ground
Keep flying until
You are the king of the hill
No force of nature can break
Your will to self-motivate
She say this face that you see
Is destined for history
How many people have to cry
The song of pain and grief across the land?
And how many children have to die
Before we stand to lend a healing hand?
Everybody sing
Every day create your history
Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history
Every page you turn you're writing your legacy
Every hero dreams of chivalry
Every child should sing together in harmony
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the world
How many victims must there be
Slaughtered in vain across the land?
And how many children must we see
Before we learn to live as brothers
And be a family? Oh

Every path you take you're leaving your legacy
Every soldier dies in his glory
Every legend tells of conquest and liberty
Every day create your history

A mother cries
The promised child shines in a baby's eyes
All nations sing
Let's harmonize all around the worldThere's a ghost down in the hall
There's a ghoul upon the bed
There's something in the walls
There's blood up on the stairs
And it's floating through the room
And there's nothing I can see
And I know that that's the truth
Because now it's onto me
I don't understand it, hey
I don't understand it, OW
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But there's no one sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul has fallen
I don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Don't understand it
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see, won't ya
Got ghosts, got 'em breakin' the walls
Got ghouls, got 'em breakin' the halls, gotta see
And who gave you the right to scare my family?
And who gave you the right to share my baby? She needs me
And who gave you the right to shake my family tree?
They put a knife in my back
Shot an arrow in me
Tell me, are you the ghost of jealousy?
The ghost of jealousy
There's a thumping in the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody's sitting there
There's a ghostly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open

I don't know whether to live or die
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my life
It's out of my hands
It's...can I come down there?
To think for two years she was here
And I took her for granted I was so cavalier
Now the way that it stands, oh yeah
She's out of my hands
So I've learned that love's not possession
And I've learned that love don't wait
Now I've learned that love needs expression
But I learned too late
And she's out of my life
She's out of my life
Damned indecision and cursed pride
Kept my love for her locked deep inside
And it cuts like a knife
She's out of my...life, mhmAll along I had to talk about it
But like a two-edged sword
It cuts you and it stabs me
All along I knew you were a phony girl
You sit behind the mask
And you control your world
You sit around and I watch your face
I try to find the truth
But that's your hiding place
You say you love me but it's hard to see

She wanted Hollywood, she wanted it bad

Imprisoned in every paparazzi's camera
Every guy wished they could

And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear

Then forever can begin

Still she could not stop, couldn't break his chains

She swore she'd dance no more
But dance she did, he did not quit

There's a ghoul beneath the bed
Now it's coming through the walls
Now it's coming down the stairs
Then there's screaming in the dark
Hear the beating of his heart
Can you feel it in the air
Ghosts be hiding everywhere
I'm gonna be, exactly what you wanna see
It's you who's haunting me, 'cause you're wanting me
To be the stranger in your life
Am I amusing you, or just confusing you?
Am I the beast you visualized?
And if you want to to see, eccentrialities
I'll be grotesque before your eyes
Let them all materialize
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Is it scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Is it scary for you, baby?
There's a creak beneath the floor
There's a creak behind the door
There's a rocking in the chair
But nobody sitting there
There's a ghastly smell around
But nobody to be found
And a coffin inlay open
Where a restless soul is spoiling
I'm gonna be exactly what you gonna see
So did you come to me to see your fantasies
Performed before your very eyes?
A haunting ghostly treat, the foolish trickery
And spirits dancing in the light
But if you came to see, the truth the purity
It's here inside a lonely heart
So let the performance start
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
So tell me, is it scary for you baby?
So tell me, is it crazy for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
You know the stranger is you
Am I scary for you?
Masquerade the heart
To hide a hurting soul
Trust not what you see of me
Cause the heart reveal the proof, like a mirror reveals the truth
See the evil one is you
Is that scary for you, baby?
Am I scary for you? Oh
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is it scary for you?
So tell me am I scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you, baby?
Is scary for you baby?
Am I scary for you?
Is this scary for you?
I'm tired of being abused
You know you're scaring me too
I see the evil is you
Is it scary for you, baby?Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
With your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just
Light up your face with gladness
Hide every trace of sadness
Although a tear may be ever so near
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just...
Smile, though your heart is aching
Smile, even though it's breaking
When there are clouds in the sky
You'll get by
If you smile
Through your fear and sorrow
Smile and maybe tomorrow
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smile
That's the time you must keep on trying
Smile, what's the use of crying?
You'll find that life is still worthwhile
If you just smileWhat about sunrise?
What about rain?
What about all the things
That you said we were to gain?

What about all the things
That you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the blood we've shed before?
Did you ever stop to notice
This crying Earth, this weeping shore?
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
What have we done to the world?
Look what we've done
What about all the peace
That you pledge your only son?
What about flowering fields?
Is there a time?
What about all the dreams
That you said was yours and mine?
Did you ever stop to notice
All the children dead from war?

Aaaaaaaaah, Oooooooooh
Hey, what about yesterday?
What about the seas?
Heavens are falling down
I can't even breathe
What about apathy?
Ravaging the seas?
What about forest trails
Burnt despite our pleas?
What about the holy land
Torn apart by greed?
Where did we go wrong?
Someone tell me why
What about baby boy?
What about the days?
What about all their joy?
Do we give a damn?
Aaaaaaaaah 
Oooooooooh 
Aaaaaaaaah 
OoooooooohAnother day has gone
I'm still all alone
How could this be
You’re not here with me
You never said goodbye
Someone tell me why
Did you have to go
And leave my world so cold
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You’re always in my heart
But you are not alone
'Lone, 'lone
Why, 'lone
Just the other night
I thought I heard you cry
Asking me to come
And hold you in my arms
I can hear your prayers
Your burdens I will bear
But first I need your hand
Then forever can begin
Every day I sit and ask myself
How did love slip away
Something whispers in my ear and says
That you are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we're far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone
Oh, whisper three words and I'll come running
And girl you know that I’ll be there
I’ll be there
You are not alone
I am here with you
Though you're far away
I am here to stay
But you are not alone
I am here with you
Though we’re far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone 
I am here with you 
Though you're far away 
I am here to stay
But you are not alone 
I am here with you
Though we’re far apart
You're always in my heart
But you are not alone 
You are not alone
You are not alone
Say it again
You are not alone
You are not alone
Not alone, not alone
If you just reach out for me, girl
In the morning, in the evening
Not alone, not alone
You and me, not alone, oh
Together, together
Not not being alone
Not not being alone
You believe in me

Makin' funky tracks with my man Michael Jackson
Smooth criminal, that's the man cause Mike's so relaxed
Mingle, mingle, jingle in the jungle

Nation to nation, all the world must come together
Face the problems that we see then maybe somehow we can work it out
I asked my neighbor for a favor, she said later
What has come of all the people, have we lost love of what it's about?
I have to find my peace cause no one seems to let me be
False prophets cry of doom, what are the possibilities?
I told my brother there'll be problems, times and tears for fears
But we must live each day like it's the last

I'm conditioned by the system, don't you talk to me, don't scream and shout
She prays to God, to Buddha, then she sings a Talmud song
Confusions contradict the self, do we know right from wrong?

I'm missing on a chance to fall in love
I do got it
Feeling like your love is dangerous
But I love you, girl
Feeling like I'm never good enough
So let the heavens open
It's raining in heaven
Feels like warm july
Will be something new
I'm here for you
And there's no need to cry
It feels like water, water drowning my soul
It feels like water, water
It won't leave leave me
It feels like water, water
What am, I, what am I to do?
Feeling like this is the start of something new
Feeling like this is the world of me and you
Cause you ain't judging me, you just touching me
You ain't bugging me
I'm waiting on you, I'm hoping it's true
Baby, it's you
When the storm is raging, we can walk the moon
Girl, I love you
You're my fortune, you keep me alive
It feels like water, water drowning my soul
It feels like water, water
It won't leave me alone
It feels like water, water
What am I, what am I to do?
I lie awake, I count the days
When I'm not there with you, I cry my eyes awake
I rather stay, I rather play a game
When I'm not there with you, forever. always water, water
Don't you do this to me
Tell the angels, no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
Won't you leave us alone?
Tell the angels, no, I don't wanna leave my baby alone
It feels like leave us alone
Water, water

Water

WaterIt's time you put away your fear
And it's time you time to dream a little big
It's time you gave your dreams another chance
And it's time you take away the win in hand
To the flame is burning strong
To the rain is come n' gone
I'll be holding onto memories
I can make it on my own
I believe I'm ready to win
I know I'm ready to sour
If you pick me up, when I am down
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win
They say it's a miracle today
They say
Oh my
You were never going far today
They say
Hold on
Now is your chance
Hold on
You got your chance
Oh my
Go get your win
Hold on
It feels like I can fly with broken wings now
Now the wind is blowing strong
I can do it on my own
I can do it all alone now
And I'm never turning back again
I believe I'm ready to win
Oh my friend
I know I'm ready to sour
If you pick me up, when I am
Turn it all around
I know I'm ready to win
They say I'm dreaming life away
They say I throw it all away
And I can't get back my yesterday
Dream again
So, I say, I never saw love without you
Sing it, world
I believe I'm ready to win
I believe a miracle
I know I'm ready to sour
Oh my friend
Hee-Hee
If you pick me up, when I am down
You're picking me up
Oh-hhh
Turn it all around
And I know I'm ready to win
You and me, my baby
And I know I'm ready to win
I believe it, baby
Sing it
I know I'm ready to win
Ready, yeah
Sing
I know I'm ready to win
Believe it in your heart!
Believe it in your soul!
Yeah-hh
Baby, I know
I know I'm ready to win
Yeah-hh
Yeah-hh
I believe!
I know I'm ready to win
Yeah!Heard he grew up in queens
Took a bullet to the brain
Dug a step into fame
But that don't mean a thing
Said he'd rather be king, with absoulete reign
Till he finds himself a victim of the game
He was stabbed in the back, as a matter of fact
Then his life became serious
Marching like a soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Show you things, that make a man a king
Marching like a soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Why don't you shine, like you're the man again?
People say that you're blind
Then they say that you're fine
But they won't help you find, find the road again
If they won't help you fight, so they torture your mind
They leave you delirious
Hee-Hee-Hee
Oh my
Marching like a soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Show you things, that make a man a king
Marching like a soldier
Marching like a soldier boy
Why don't you shine, like you're the man again?

Marching like a soldier boy
Why don't you shine, like you're the man again?
Marching like a soldier

I heard you're packing to leave!
I come running right over
I just couldn't believe it

Refrain
Oh baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kicking away?
We've got a good thing goin', baby
We've got a groovy thing
I've never done you no wrong
I never hit you when you're down
I always gave you good thing
I never ran around

Refrain
Oh baby, baby
You must be out of your mind
Do you know what you're kicking away?
We've got a good thing goin', baby

No no no no, no no no no

I said, "Don't mind, but what do you mean, I am the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round?"
She said I am the one
Who will dance on the floor, in the round
She told me her name was Billie Jean
As she caused a scene
Then every head turned with eyes that dreamed of being the one
Who will dance on the floor in the round
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
Don't go around breaking young girls' hearts" 
And mother always told me, "Be careful of who you love
And be careful of what you do 
'Cause the lie becomes the truth" 
 Louis
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son, hoo!
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Hoo!
For forty days and for forty nights, the law was on her side
But who can stand when she's in demand?
Her schemes and plans
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, hee!
So take my strong advice, just remember to always think twice
 Do think twice! 
She told my baby we'd danced till three, then she looked at me
Then showed a photo of a baby crying, his eyes were like mine 
'Cause we danced on the floor in the round, baby
Hee!
Hoo!
People always told me, "Be careful of what you do
And don't go around breaking young girls' hearts"
 
But she came and stood right by me
Then the smell of sweet perfume 
This happened much too soon 
She called me to her room 
 Louis
Billie Jean is not my lover 
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no-no-no
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
But the kid is not my son 
Ah, hee-hee-hee!
Hee! Hoo!
 Louis
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son
No-no-no, hoo! 
Billie Jean is not my lover
She's just a girl who claims that I am the one
But the kid is not my son
No-no-no, no-no-no-no
She says I am the one, but the kid is not my son 
She says I am the one 
She says he is my son 
She says I am the one
 Louis
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover
Billie Jean is not my lover 
Billie Jean is not my lover...Control this!
Control this now
Hoo!
This time around, yeah!
Hoo!
He really thought he really had a hold of me
He really thought he really had control of me
He really thought he really had control of me
He really thought he really had
This time around I never get bit
Though you really want to fix me
This time around you're making me sick
Though you really want to get me
Somebody's out, somebody's out to get me
You really want to fix me, hit me
But this time around I'm taking no shit
Though you really want to get me, you really want to get me
