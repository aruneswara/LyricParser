Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it low-key like Thor lil' bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilin' like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack, in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "Fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling "Fuck me"
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh, generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting, blam
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere, they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me, take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain-dead, take a tug and then pass
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted 
I think we all addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I think we all addicted 
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter, juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson 
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope, see 
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm off of codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I think we all addicted 
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses

They be like, "There he go!"
You old Petey Pablo, take your shirt off
Wave 'round your head like a helicopter
I ain't put enough weed in the blunt
All you do is smoke tobacco
Where the hell you get them from?
Yeezy said he ain't make them
My niggas chasin' bounty hunters
And gettin' chased by their baby mamas
My first tat was on my stomach
Got a pocket full of money 
And a mind full of ideas
Some of this shit may sound weird
Inside of the Maybach
Look like it came out of Ikea
Run shit like diarrhea 
Big yacht, no power steering 
Aye, aye, captain 
I'm high, captain 
I'm so high 
Me and God dappin' 
This is my blessin' 
This is my passion

Lord, free the Carter, niggas need the Carter
Sacrificin' everything, I feel like Jesus Carter
Hold up, I got this sewed up, my soda poured up
My woes up, I'm flippin' those bucks, they doing toe tucks
I rolled up and let the smoke puff
I lay down, toes up
Hold up, get too choked up when I think of old stuff
Move on, put my goons on, they kidnap newborns
In the streets my face a coupon
Her pussy too warm
All these bitches come to do harm
Just bought a new charm
Fuck the watch, I buy a new arm, you lukewarm
I'm Uncle Luke with the hoes
Pretty bitches, centerfolds
Tippy toes around my crib in they robes, just their robes
Half a milli' in the safe, another in the pillowcase
Codeine got me movin' slower than a caterpillar race
Fuck wrong with you? What you were thinkin'?
What you thought it was?
I just popped five Percocets and only caught a buzz
And if that label try to stop me
There gon' be some crazy Weezy fans waitin' in the lobby
Mula, baby

Your boy like, "I'm the one who showed you"
He want his percentage

See my face in the streets, in the tweets
And a Reader or a RedEye if you read Sun-Times
She got blisters on her knees, she's a fiend for the D
Even though I only beat one time
One time, it was one two times
It was two plus me equals threesome time
Shouts out to Nate, I jackball and I bop, I flex
Got neck from all these thots I sex
Rastafari them shottas, yes

I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
Move to the neighborhood; I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers 
Still with the Save Money militia 
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits

Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz

I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared tooWe don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
'Cause she don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
When did you change?
Wendy, you've aged
I thought you'd never grow up
I thought you'd never
Window closed, Wendy got old
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
She don't laugh the same way no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
Where did you go?
Why would you stay?
You must have lost your marbles
You always were so forgetful
In a hurry, don't wait up
I was too late, I was too late
A shadow of what I once was
'Cause we don't, we don't do what we say we're gonna
You were always perfect, and I was only practice
Don't you miss the days, stranger?
Don't you miss the days?
Don't you miss the danger?
We don't  do the same drugs no more 
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more

We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs, do the same drugs no more
We don't do the, we don't do the same drugs
Turn it around
I remember when
This age of pathetics
Don't forget the happy thoughts
All you need is happy thoughts
The past tense, past bed time
Way back then when everything we read was real
And everything we said rhymed
Wide eyed kids being kids
Why did you stop?
What did you do to your hair?
Where did you go to end up right back here?
When did you start to forget how to fly?
It's so natural
Just like Juicy Fruit
Works like a magic trick
Please give me half of that
We don't, we don't, we don't
Don't you color out
Don't you bleed on out, oh
Stay in the line, stay in the line
Dandelion
Do the same drugs no more

When the praises go up, the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
It seems like blessings keep falling in my lap
I don't make songs for free, I make 'em for freedom
Don't believe in kings, believe in the Kingdom
Chisel me into stone, prayer whistle me into song air
Dying laughing with Krillin saying something 'bout blonde hair
Jesus' black life ain't matter, I know, I talked to his daddy
Said you the man of the house now, look out for your family
He has ordered my steps,  gave me a sword with a crest
And gave Donnie a trumpet in case I get shortness of breath
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone 
I'm gon' praise Him, praise Him 'til I'm gone

When the praises go up  the blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
The blessings come down
When the praises go up, the blessings come down
They booked the nicest hotels on the 59th floor
With the big wide windows, with the suicide doors
Ain't no blood on my money, ain't no Twitter in Heaven
I know them drugs isn't close, ain't no visitin' Heaven
I know the difference in blessings and worldly possessions
Like my ex-girl getting pregnant
And her becoming my everything
I'm at war with my wrongs, I'm writing four different songs
I never forged it or forfeited, I'm a force to be reconciled
They want four-minute songs
You need a four-hour praise dance performed every morn
I'm feeling shortness of breath, so Nico grab you a horn
Hit Jericho with a buzzer beater to end a quarter
Watch brick and mortar fall like dripping water, ugh

When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost
Let's get lost
Damn, I'm in so deep, girl, probably 'cause you're empty
You can't even speak , damn, your mouth so minty
Ooh, your mama hate me, daddy wouldn't let you
If he ever met me, if he ever met you
Put that shit behind us and put this in your sinus
Mine is all up in my gums, minus all that shit it's lined with
I say oh-oh-oh-oh, you been scratchin', you been fiendin'
I'ma fix you, I'ma fuck you, I'ma get rid of them demons
It's my

Let's get lost, let's get lost
Damn, I need a minute, aight, leggo
She fell in love, it fell apart, aight, let go
She met her match, I let her match
She lit her match, she let me smoke
Yeah, me mad petty, yeah, me bogus
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, me know
Yeah, she knew too , it made her love it
Her pussy like me, her heart like, "Fuck it"
So dance for daddy like Gator
Ain't no partners on this trip
And lose yourself in my room
And find yourself in my grip
I'm sayin'
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
I blessed myself inside your arms one day
Swear to God there I was when the dress
And the silver buttons fade away
Miss Mary Mattress, geriatrics
Fuck me into open caskets, I wanna die with this
I wanna stop seeing my psychiatrist
She said "Pill pop, baby girl, 'cause I promise you, you tweaked
The empty bottled loneliness, this happiness you seek
The masochism that you preach
Practice backflips, tragic actress
On a movie with no screen
When the only time he loves me is naked in my dreams
My druggy, when I'm ugly, hug me
When I'm bummy, scummy, I'm your hubby
Let's get lost, let's get lost
IghKicked off my shoes, tripped acid in the rain
Wore my jacket as a cape, and my umbrella as a cane
The richest man rocks the snatch-less necklace
Spineless bitches in backless dresses
Wore my feelings on my sleeveless
My weed seedless, my trees leafless
I miss my diagonal grilled cheeses
And back when Mike Jackson was still Jesus
Before I believed in not believing in
Yeah, I inhaled, who believed in me not breathing in
Cigarette stained smile all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
I seen it happen, I seen it happen, I see it always
He still be screaming, I see his demons in empty hallways
I trip to make the fall shorter
Fall quarter was just a tall order
And I'm hungry, I'm just not that thirsty
As of late, all my verses seem not so verse-y
And all my words just mean controversy
Took the team up off my back, like "That's not your jersey?"
Stressin', pullin' my hair out, hoping I don't get picked
All this medicine in me hoping I don't get sick
Making all of this money hoping I don't get rich
'Cause niggas still getting bodied for foams
Sometimes the truth don't rhyme
Sometime the lies get millions of views
Funerals for little girls, is that appealing to you?
From your cubicle desktop, what a beautiful view
I think love is beautiful too
Building forts from broken dams, what a hoover could do
For future hoopers dead from Rugers
Shooting through the empty alley
Could've threw him an alley-oop
Helping him do good in school
Damn that acid burn when it clean ya
I still miss being a senior
And performing at all those open mic events
Eyes closed, eyes closed seeing arenas
And I still get jealous of Vic
And Vic's still jealous of me
But if you touch my brother
All that anti-violence shit goes out the window along with you
And the rest of your team
Smoking cigarettes to look cooler
I only stop by to look through ya
And I'm only getting greedier
And I'm still Mr. Youmedia
And I still can't find Talent
And I'm still choosing classmates that wouldn't fuck
Mom still thinks I should go back to school
And Justin still think I'm good enough
And Mama Jan still don't take her meds
And I still be asking God to show his face
And I still be asking God to show his face
I am a new man, I am sanctified
Oh, I am holy, I have been baptized
I have been born again, I am the White Light
Rain, rain don't go away
Igh!Angels, na, na, na, na, ah
I got my city doing front flips
When every father, mayor, rapper jump ship
I guess that's why they call it where I stay
Clean up the streets, so my daughter can have somewhere to play
I'm the blueprint to a real man
Some of these niggas toss they tassel for a deal man
I ain't goin' to hell or to Hillman
Igh, Igh, Igh, Igh, for my real fans
I got caught up with a little Xan
Can't stop me but it slow me though
Yeah a nigga famous, you don't know me though
But every DJ still play me though
Damn man, I don't even need a radio
And my new shit sound like a rodeo
Got the old folks dancing the Do-si-do
'Til they fuck around and sign me to OVO
Oooh, I just might share my next one with Keef
Got the industry in disbelief, they be asking for beef
This what it sound like when God split an atom with me
I even had Steve giving out apples for free
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me they keep me surrounded
Who is you, and who the fuck is you, and who is him?
All of a sudden, woo wap da bam
You can't touch me
Na, na, na, na, I got angels
I got angels
I ain't change my number since the seventh grade
This for my day one, ten years, seven days
A week, niggas never tired on they Kevin Gates
And if they rest in peace they bunny hopping heaven's gates
It's too many young angels on the southside
Got us scared to let our grandmommas outside
You gon' make me take the campers way downtown
You gon' make me turn my BM to my housewife
I just had a growth spurt
It done took so long, my tippy toes hurt
You can keep the nose ring, I don't have to soul search
I'm still at my old church, only ever sold merch
Grandma say I'm Kosher, momma say I'm culture
GCI, 1-0-7-5, angel goin' live
Power 92, angel, juke, angel gon' juke
GCI, 1-0-7-5, goin' live
Power 92, angel gon' juke, juke, juke, juke
They was talking "woo this woo wap da bam"
City so damn great, I feel like Alexand'
Wear your halo like a hat, that's like the latest fashion
I got angels all around me, they keep me surrounded
Wap the bam 
I got angels

Na, na, na, na

I got, I gotWe used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work, your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place, but in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shorties with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do, I'll get close to you
I remember you, you used to, I remember you, 'cause
We've got so much history, baby , maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe , I'm crazy 
We never rolled at the Rink, we would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more, you just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down," Chris Brown, I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing, it's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist to your hips and your legs in my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor, all the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do what grown folks do when they grown and they dating
We've got so much history, baby , maybe 
Maybe you and I were meant to be, maybe I'm crazy
Crazy 'bout you
We gon' get it poppin', we gon' get it jukin'
We gon' throw a party, and we ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend, came up for the weekend
Rollin' with your party, so tell me what you thinkin'
Said we gon' have a juke jam, we gon' have a juke jam

Hey, this ain't no intro, this the entree
Hit that intro with Kanye and sound like André
Tryna turn my baby mama to my fiancée
She like music, she from Houston like Auntie Yoncé
Man my daughter couldn't have a better mother
If she ever find another, he better love her
Man I swear my life is perfect, I could merch it
If I die I'll prolly cry at my own service, igh-igh!
It was a dream, you could not mess with the Beam
This is like this many rings
Y'all know wha' mean?
This for the kids of the king of all kings
This is the holiest thing
This is the beat that played under the Word
This is the sheep that ain't like what it heard
This is officially first

Ayy, ayy, I get my word from the sermon
I do not talk to the serpent
That's the holistic discernment
Daddy said I'm so determined
Told me these goofies can't hurt me
I just might make me some Earl tea
I was baptized like real early
I might give Satan a swirlie
Wish I could tell you it's ready
Tell you it's ready today
They don't give nothin' away
You gotta fight for your way
And that don't take nothin' away
'Cause at the end of the day
Music is all we got

Even better than I was the last time
Rap just make me anxious, and acid made me crazy
Them squares just made me looser and that wax just made me lazy
And I still make this song, and I'ma make another
If you ever actually hit me, better watch out for my brother
Better bet I'd take that deal, gotta watch out for my mother
Get a watch with all that glitters, come in clutters, different colors
Ben-a-Baller, Benford, butlers, chauffeurs, hit a stain-er, did I stutter?
Did a ton of drugs and did better than all my Alma mater
Motherfucker money dance, hundreds xan, gallon lean
Make a joke 'bout Leno's hair then piggyback on Fallon's spleen
Balancing on sporadicity and fucking pure joy
Nightly searches for a bed and I just came off tour with Troy
But I can't complain, I got some motherfucking bitches
How many lab partners have I fucked since I got suspended?
Mr. Bennett, you done did it, you did it, you did it
You did a good ass job, you did a good ass job
And I'm good, igh

Twerk, twerk, merge, swerve, dang, pick a lane
Flip a bird, pigeon, plane, it's a word, it's a shame
But God I'm good, swear I couldn’t be better
Kicking dirt on the shirts of the lames
Keep a tab on my exes, keep some X on my tongue
Keep my work out in Texas, that's just me flexing my lungs
See them showing they teeth, that's just them flapping they gums
If they bite and I'm snapping, clap clap, collapsing they lungs
Call me Chancelor The Rapper, please say, "The Rapper"
Magical word , please say "Kadabra"
Replay the replays, Green Bay, the Packers
Cremate your teammates and freebase the ashes
Matches to gas leaks, dusted dusk 'til dawn
It's just us, and trust ya bottom, bitch, my stuff the fucking bomb
I'm the motherfucking fucker, fuck, a nigga's fucking dumb
This your favorite fucking album, I ain't even fucking done

Soil as soft as mama's hands
Running water, standing still
Endless fields of daffodils and chamomile
Rice under black beans
Walked into Apple with cracked screens
And told prophetic stories of freedom
Found warmth in a Black queen for when I get cold
Like Nat King, I'm doing the dad thing
I speak of wondrous unfamiliar lessons from childhood
Make you remember how to smile good
I'm pre-currency, post-language, anti-label
Pro-famous, I'm Broadway Joe Namath
Kanye's best prodigy
He ain't signed me but he proud of me
I got some ideas that you gotta see
Make a vid with shawty and they ship it like the Odyssey
They never seen a rapper practice modesty
I never practice, I only perform
I don't even warn, I don't eat it warm, I won't be reborn
I speak to God in public, I speak to God in public
He keep my rhymes in couplets
He think the new shit jam, I think we mutual fans
I used to dance to Michael, I used to dance in high school
I used to pass out music, I still pass out music
The people's champ must be everything the people can't be
I'm getting artsy-fartsy, house full of some Hebru Brantleys
You must’ve missed the come up, I must be all I can be

What's good good? And what's good evil?
And what's good, gangstas? And what's good, people?
And why God phone die every time that I call on Him?
If his son had a Twitter, wonder if I would follow Him
Swallow them synonyms like cinnamon Cinnabon
Keep all them sentiments down to a minimum
Studious Gluteus Maxim models is sending him
Pics of they genitalia, tallied up ten of 'em
I slurped too many pain-kills down, I'm off a lot
I got a lot of off days, but it ain't often that I'm off the clock
You what I mean, I got the Chicago Blues
We invented rock before the Stones got through
We just aiming back 'cause the cops shot you
Buck buck, bang bang, yelling "Fuck Fox News"
Booyaka buckle up, motherfuck opps too
Ain't no knuckling up 'em young 'cause it just not cool
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass
Everybody's somebody's everything
I know you right
Nobody's nothing

I know you're right
I used to tell hoes I was dark light or off-white
But I'd fight if a nigga said that I talk white
And both my parents was black
But they saw it fit that I talk right
With my drawers hid but my hard head stayed in the clouds like a lost kite
But gravity had me up in a submission hold
Like I'm dancing with the Devil with two left feet and I'm pigeon-toed
In two small point ballet shoes with a missing sole
And two missing toes
But it's love like Cupid kissing a mistletoe
Nice to see you, Father New Year
Middle finger Uncle Samuel
Shooting death with weighted dice
And hitting stains on birthday candles
I know somebody, somebody loves my ass
'Cause they help me beat my demon's ass
Like Cassius ducking the draft and now the fight is over
The type to love from a distance, not the type that told her
Spent three days on the rap, trash it and type it over
With babies on the block underarms like fighting odors
Coppers and quotas, hold ya head like 2Pac had taught
Obviously, they are on a come up
With better chances tobogganing in the fucking summer
Concoctions for the bad days and a condom for the good ones
All odds against us, we tryna get lucky, doper than Lucky
You're ending happy, that's only a tugging
Like Satan masturbating, shit come hot, but y'all still love me
Ugh, how Father Time a deadbeat? Maybe I'm adopted
That'll explain why all of my shit been so timeless, igh
Everybody's somebody's everything, nigga
Nobody's nothing, nigga

Nobody's nothing at all

Bunch of tank-top, nappy headed bike-stealin' Chatham boys
None of my niggas ain't had no dad
None of my niggas ain't have no choice
JJ, Mikey, Lil Derek and them
79th Street was America then
Ice cream truck and the beauty supply
Blockbuster movies and Harold's again
We were still catchin' lightnin' bugs
When the plague hit the backyard
Had to come in at dark cause the big shorties act hard
Okay now, day camp at Grand Crossing
First day, niggas shootin'
Summer school get to losin' students
But the CPD getting new recruitment
Our summer don't, our summer
Our summer don't get no shine no more
Our summer die, our summertime don't got no time no more

Mama hair salon doin' perms out the armchair
Dad was workin' late, he treat the crib like it's a timeshare
I would mow some lawns
Fold my ones like a lawn chair, hugh, hugh
Now I'm the same way, overtime all the time, every night, hey
Ready my blessin', now I'm ready how I wait

Some of my homegirls got lost in the paperwork
They was good friends but I faked the flirt

Fucked up and fucked all my friends

I always bring my friends, my friends, my friends, my friends upIf this is my last sh- my last shit
Uh, it definitely be mad important
And it would have to sound like a Prince song
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucking, motha, shut your mouth
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
Somebody pray for the god, oh lord
I wonder what Michael's on
Son jammin' to his shit, rappin', trappin', trippin' 'cid
And sniffing glue and chewing Vicodin
Shoulda died, yelling YOLO was a lie
And you a liar wonder why you wanna die so young
You and I look just alike
And I'm afraid that this one right here
Might be last time that I write a song
Lot of niggas wanna go out with a bang
But I ain't tryna go out at all
So I ain't tryna go out at all
Got a lot of ideas still to throw out the door
Last Chance joint gotta be a dance joint
From an introspective drugged out standpoint
Throw bands joint, wanna hold hands joint
Old school for my own old man joint
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit 
Why toss my filter when she saving my life?
The same shit that kills us, always feels so right
That's why I pray to the dealer, God know who he be
Truth be told, he juiced me, introduced me to the lucy leaf
Oh-oh-oh, I seen the light, I lost my lighter
Bic flick, kick the habit and the bucket, fuck your supplier
Lies, Levis on fire, flyer on the wall, I'm brighter
In the darkness of the night, in the sky I get higher, higher
Still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfucker, motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth
This part right here, right now, right here, this part my shit
I play this so loud in the car, I forget to park my whip
I lean back, then spark my shit, I turn up, I talk my shit
Hope you love all of my shit, I hope you love all of my shit 
I'm still a chain-smoking, name dropping
Good looking, muhfuckin', motha, shut your mouth
Brain broken, Frank Ocean listening, stain hitting
Satin woodgrain gripping, paint dripping, motha, shut your mouth

The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Lord rain down on me so I can move on water
Like children at the altar, like God inside my house
I love you, I love you, you looking holy like Mama
You made a church out of feathers, so when she fly to the Father
She know the choir gon' follow and all the offering paid
She gave my name away to your holy house
She like my blessings in disguise
She like her Jesus mountain high
So He can watch her lonely child, I know my God
I know my God seen His breaks and His edges
Are jagged for giving that pain to His city in gold
Like everything is everything
Like all them days He prayed with me
Like emptiness was tamed in me
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
And all that was left was His love
Never, never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
Never, never, never 
This thirst in my soul 
Where else can I go?  but You? 
I may cry a river 
But You take each drop and You wash 
Me new 
This water is deep 
Jesus, rescue me 
Take me to Your mountain 
So someday Chicago will be free 
Be free 
The water may be deeper than it's ever been
Never drown
The water may be deeper than it's ever been

The first is that God is better than the world's best thing
God is better than the best thing that the world has to offer
Magnify, magnify, lift it on high
Spit a Spotify to qualify a spot on His side
I cannot modify or ratify, my mama made me apple pies
Lullabies and alibis, the book don't end with Malachi
Devil will win employee of the month by the dozen
'Til one score and three years from the third when he doesn't
My village raised 'em a child, come through the crib and it's bustin'
You meet anyone from my city, they gon' say that we cousins
Shabach barak, edify
Electrify the enemy like Hedwig 'til he petrify
Any petty Peter Petigrew could get the pesticide,
79th, 79th
I don't believe in science, I believe in signs
Don't believe in signing, I seen dollar signs, color white collar crime
Good God, the gift of freedom,
Hosanna Santa invoked and woke up slaves from Southampton to Chatham Manor
My dream girl's behind me, feel like I'm James Early
The type of worship make Jesus come back a day early
With the faith of a pumpkin seed sized mustard seed
Hear, for I will speak noble things as entrusted me
Only righteous, I might just shrug at the skullduggery
I couldn't stand to see another rapper lose custody
Exalt, exalt, glorify, descend upon the earth with swords
And fortify the borders where your shortage lie
I used to hide from God, ducked down in the slums like "shhh"
I was lost in the jungle like Simba after the death of Mufasa, no hog, no meerkat
Hakuna matata by day, but I spent my night time fighting tears back
I prayed and prayed and left messages, but never got no hear back
Or so it seemed
A mustard seed was all I needed to sow a dream
I build the ark to gently, gently row my boat down Noah's stream
Sometimes the path I took to reach my petty goals was so extreme
I was so far down in the mud, couldn't even let my light shine
But you was always there when I needed to phone a friend or use a lifeline
From a lofty height we wage war on the poltergeist with the exalted Christ
Spark the dark with the pulse of light
Strike a corpse with a pulse of life
I spit on the Tidal, it's tidal waves
I spit on the Apple and kill a worm
A fire in Cali'll swallow a valley
For every African village burned
Jay Elect would've never made it
O' son of man, O' son of man
Who was the angel in Revelations
With a foot on water and a foot on land?
Who was the angel that rode a Harley
From the project to the house of Parliament
And opened the book in the Devil's chamber
And put the true name of the Lord in it?
Old Jerusalem, New Jerusalem
Comes like this beast with a ball of fire
They poisoned the scriptures
And gave us the pictures of false messiahs, it was all a lie
Mystery babylon tumbling down
Satan's establishment crumbling down
This is the year that I come for the crown
Bury my enemies under the groundWe just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been smoking a bowl
We just been

She don't got time for a whole
Little bit of time that we have
We used to purchase a half
It don't be no time to smoke
I'm always throwing on clothes
She always throwing a fit
We don't got no time for no sex
I just put milk in the bowl
She don't be cooking at all
She just put weed in the bowl
She don't have time for herself
She putting points on the board, yes
You know she carry her own
You know she carry a child
She wake up at crack of dawn
She don't be cracking a smile
So when she packing the bowl
I grab her, I tell her

Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh
She said, "Let me lick this blunt"
Slow it down for a second
Break it down, ooh

Truth being told, we used to movies and bowl
We used to Netflix and roll
I used to pass her the smoke
She used to laugh at my jokes
You pat my back when I choke
Wish we were stuck in our ways
We way too young to get old
We stuck together like oowops
We smoke to Fetty, sing ZooWap
Traphouse 3, Guwop
I should've knew when I grew up
It would be no time at all
We went from White Owls to Raws
We went from joints to a bowl
She need a second to breathe
We need an actual smoke sesh
Let me crack your back
Slow it down for a second
Take it down, ooh
Let me run this back
Slow it down for a minute
You deserve, you deserve
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve a smoke break
We deserve, we deserve
We deserve a smoke break
I don't have time to finesse
I put some ice on your neck
But I ain't holding you back
I spend my time on the road
Super ain't saving no hoes
I don't have time to patrol
Let me break these bales right down for a second
When it touch down, ooh
I got to lay back the roof
I got her breakin' the rules
She can't be taking no calls
When she involved with a boss
Please don't get lost in the sauce
Please don't get lost in the sauce
She been like this from the door
Told me her mom was a ho
I gave her Percs for herself
I give her Perc for esteem
I'm tryna crown me a queen
You hear the chains when they cling
I take the molly, it's clean
I push the whip with the wings
I gotta be overseas
I gotta be on the pedal
I push it down to the floor
I got designer galore
I keep some Goyard and 'gars
I smoke out all of my cars
You smell the weed in the air
You smell the smoke in the seats
You went and had our child
You didn't abandon the D
You got me twisted at least
You can
Let me crack your back
Let me rub you all over
Take it down, ooh

Make you dinner or somethin'

Hope your pussy get herpes and yo' ass get lupus
Deuces Douches, deuce deuce, I'll shoot ya 
Shoes might boot ya and a suit might suit ya

You know, Chance. Let me tell you something. You know, I could never be more proud of anything in my life, you know, than I am of you and what you've done. Chance, you have done remarkable and wondrous things, so you don't have to tell me thank you for anything. I'm supposed to do this, that stuff for you anyway, and ya know, just keep doing what you're doing. I am very, very proud of you. Just keep doing what you're doing, okay?
Thank you, love you
Alright, son. Love you too, take care
Alright, bye-bye
Thanks for coming guys
'Member sittin' in class the first time listening to Dilla
Everything's good
Rubbin' on yo chin, sippin gin, Margiela brand chinchilla
Everything's good
My manager backpack packed with packs of cigarillos
And some fruit snacks, and some killers
Phone numbers on speed dial, call them, save monkey guerillas
Everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodbyes
I ain't really that bad at leaving
I ain't really always been a good guy, I used to be thirsty thievin'
Runnin through purses, even persons leave 'em hurtin', bleedin'
I ain't really help the helpless
I used to be worse than worthless
Now I'm worth hooks and verses
I'm good like books in churches
Harolds and Hooks and Churches
Everything's good
See my name when you Google search it
Use a card when I make a purchase
Everything's good
But I knew I was fly when I was just a caterpillar
That I'd make it even if I never make a milla
When I meet my maker he gon' make sure that we chillin'
And everything's good
I ain't really that good at goodnight, I ain't really that bad at sleepin'
With bad bitches, put 'em aside, I used to be thirsty creeping
Now I'm out working evenings, birthdays, even Tuesdays
Wednesdays, Thursdays, weekends, rehearsing verses, murdering merch and events
Damn, it feel good to be a gangsta
And it feel good for me to thank you
Put money back in your bank account
Off of songs I barely could think up
'Cause a lot of songs niggas gon' make up
Make sense, but they never gon' make a sound
And I'm better than I was the last time, crescendo
Thanks Justin, lending them pencils
Mr. Menzies, Mensa, Chris Minto
The time I beat Chris on Nintendo
Na-na-na, hey, hey, good intro
Remember jacket shoppin' after listening to Thriller
Remember the first time you heard this through and thought, "Damn that's that nigga"
Everything's goodHere's a tab of acid for your ear
You're the plastic, I'm the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan's Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I'm drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I'm the Don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I'm a kamikaze and I'm a kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the nine in all blue, yelling, "I'm a neutral"
But I'ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I'ma fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele & Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hands, son, breaking walls like Samson
But I'ma throw a tantrum 'til I'm on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighters up 'til life is up and light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it's nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.44's for 15, yeah my nigga, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan

To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, now, now, now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, igh
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down, down, down
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions hit it vividly and pass me
Don't answer about your problems
Or your issues or your Ashleys
It's a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminines getting intimate
All broads is frivolous, homies could get they dividends
Is he illiterate? Literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger affiliate
Sick twisted prick, sick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man, fuck this shit
Igh, I burned too many brain cells down
I burned, I burned, haha

Burned too many brain cells down, sing it with me

What's better than tripping is falling in love
What's better than Letterman, Leno, Fallon, and all the above
What's better than popping bottles trying to ball in the club
Is the first caveman pops with his son, ball and a club
What's better than paper is ballin' it up
What's better than followers is actually fallin' in love
What's better than frolicking, follies, fallin' in mud
Rolling in green pastures, wanderin', followin' love
What's better than eating is feeding your fam
What's better than meetings is missing meetings to meet with your fam
What's better than leaning and needing a Xan
Is hitting your xan dreaming a dream could mean leaving the land
What's better than yelling is hollerin' love
What's better than rhymes, nickels, dimes and dollars and dubs
Is dialing up your darling just for callin' her up
It ain't nothing better than fallin' in love
Igh
I've seen it come back, back, back and forth
You hit the nail right on top of the head
I know you've seen it all before
But when it looks you in the eyes
It ain't nothin' you could say but "That's love"
That's love
That's love
That's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh
That's love
That's love
That's love, that's love, that's love
I love you

That's love
That's love, that's love
Say that's love, ooh, ooh, that's love 
That's love, that's love, that's love, that's love, ighCharlie Bartlett, John Bender
Class switcher, time bender
Chance Bennett, a peculiar name
Graduation night teachers Ferris Bueller'd my name
You made a mixtape? Good job, I hope you get a good job
We was all outcasts, only listened to Good Mob
I performed at fun fair, fun fact
I'm never going back to school, been there, done that
They see my little 10 Day tape and my dumb raps
Don't call it impossible, if you really want that
They send my ass to summer school, don't call it a comeback
I just came to beat a bully's ass and get my lunch back
Chano y tequila, you know you know you don't want that
I rap my songs in Spanglish, I wrap my weed in blunt wraps
Wrapped up in this one line I hope that shit get unwrapped
As if niggas was getting signed off of a line off one rap
Yo Vic, remember when they called us some freshmen niggas rapping?
Now I ain't gonna be a freshman and I'm rapping
I should've learned a lesson from all of this shit happening
I just look over to Justin for refreshments of the Captain
It's sipping when it's weak sauce, it's shots if it's cracking
Sip it when we tear up, and chug it if we laughing
Fuck it if we're fucked up I never thought of Chatham
Until the day they said I would have to chat without 'em
And I'm just in the studio hoping that it sounds right
Here's a brighter bulb for your limelight
And this is your night, homie, shine bright
This for everybody's fucking prom night
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
Uh, yo, this prom shit feel like the Grammys, yo
These pictures Granny took gonna make me ask, "Where'd Granny go?"
So pass the Sanyo to Auntie Jo
And snap a couple candids to the family, get some cameos
You can change the clocks but you can't change hours
I'm waiting on the day Spring can't bring flowers
Let me ask for minutes from dad for those campaign hours
And pour these thirsty hoes a couple champagne showers
And hop up in that limo, the hood going dummy
The hood fucking love me, the hood think we lovely
So go and pop some bubbly, this right here's to loyalty
This to a moment's glimpse at royalty
This is for my momma Jann who spoiled me
Look what we've accomplished
Time flies, watches look like magnets on a compass
Before we dip, Gladys said a prayer over the limo
Bumping 10 Day with the angels with Jesus shopping my demo
And rode up out of Chatham, the whole hood clapping
And damn it would be crazy if any of this shit had happened
But it didn't, I missed prom, I missed it to spin
I did a show at AKIN and I would do it again
'Cause it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
And it's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
Look at, look at your business tux, all night airplane
Go and get your racist on, all white everything
I'm on my paper now, put that on my heading
I ain't even write this down, I don't write e'rything
I know y'all don't like everything
She want a night she can call her wedding
Giving Eskimo kisses, with some Eskimo bitches
Nose diving, going all night sledding
Coked out like, "Don't change when you grow up
I hope you get some change when you blow up"
'Cause honestly I've always loved the way that you could throw up
Rest up on my shoulder, float up, flying lotus
"You deserve a warm towel, you deserve a soda
You deserve a quiet room, you deserve a sofa
You deserve a Ferrari and a matching tiara
And a hand to wipe away all that running mascara"
But I, I want to thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
Thank you for this prom night
I really enjoyed my prom night
It's alright, and it's okay
And we're all good, we're with homies
Any problems, you can call us
It's all love, it's all love
So good, so right, hey baby
So good, so right
You know it feels so good
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonight
So good, so right
To be with you tonightTurn the radio up and we can have a good time
Got me feeling like J.J. on Good Times
Back when Thelma had that ass, hope the fam good
My sister said she likes my raps 'cause it sounds good
Told me not to cut corners, use to cut quarters
Sitting in the room, on the phone, cooking up orders
'Til my pops popped me off, that was family matters
Used to watch him in the kitchen sipping Sammy Adams
Now I'm rollin', iPhone Stolen
Mama whip with 5 of my guys, 4 holdin'
Trying to live our lives like our lives are so golden
Got big shoes to fill like try an' go bowling
'Til we strike out, we just hoping we don't strike out
4th quarter, how you gon go and take Mike out?
Summertime Chi, I had to pull the bike out
Riding, getting nice 'cause it's nice out

Sing all you want, just don't Drake on they ass
Shore you got drive, don't turn fake on they ass
Good morning, good raps, good morrow, good luck
Tonight you could blow, tomorrow you suck
Bizarro, my carro, I borrowed from Chuck
A new SLR and Ferraro deluxe
No money for the meter when I'm parkin' 'em
Gassed than a bitch no car with him
Market him, tell him that he's buzzing like a game of Operation with Parkinson's
Young kid rappers, kidnapper
Young whippersnappers that will whip past ya
Will get at you, come get at you
Wanna break ya off, come Kit-Kat you

Go ahead and send an application if you need work
If it need hurt, then I'ma bring hurt
How you finna see the clouds if you never seen dirt
Now you finna play it loud, listen how it's goin' down
Didn't know the name before bet you niggas know it now
Chi-City niggy, made a 50 out a penny
Got some titties at the cribby and the Savemoney with me and we going in
Going all out for them hoes again
Now I'm fin' to bring the fucking flow and bend it back
And show it's more to this than rap
Love my parents for supporting 'cause they know I'm finna crack
Know my niggas got my back, got some niggas selling packs
But I'm tryin' to get 'em cheese so I can get 'em out the trap
Now my figures getting fat, a lot of hoes be tryin' to jack

For the fam, all my friends, when my mans go awayHe should try enjoying life, rather than spending his time trying to outsmart me. While he's alive, that is
I know what you're saying but it's not that simple, it's just human nature
What's that guy doing, I wonder?
I still got orange and white cassette tapes
Tents where my neighbors came to spectate
Niggas that's tough now used to get little in the dark
It's all cool now, we're all little kids at heart
Accident prone Chance, y'all remember 'bout
The time I cracked my head open at Auntie Linda's House?
From diapers to outfits to castles to Elmos
From Santas to Grandmas to Gameboys and cell phones
Rocked your world, fourth grade talent show
Jada and Justin's birthday magic show
Games of tips taking niggas to school
Two quarters and I'll bust your ass at pool, on bull
Round here we lose best friends like every week
I like to think we playin' a long game of hide and go seek
And one day maybe I'ma find Terrance and I could lead them
Kids of the Kingdom singing 'bout freedom
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
Let's take it back like Indian givers
To Indian burns and Jiminy Crickets
To the smell of Pillsbury on biscuit mornings
To puffy winter coats and Christmas mornings
I used to chill with the kids next door
And SpongeBob came around 'bout four
And then I'd hang with Bart's guys
Around the bend was Smart Guy
Flipping through the picture books
Checking through my archives
Remember the old days, the ones you'll never get back
At the end of parties, passing around gift bags
Now we blow entire O's at one kick back
MY$FITS and mismatch that get off like wrist slaps, uhh
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my God
Remember Jeepers and Odyssey Fun World?
Young pimpin' like you oughta see one girl
Mama Jann, mama Charlie, and my mama Lisa
Booster seat used to boost my kitty, Connie's Pizza
And every year we made a Christmas list
And Auntie Linda cooked a Christmas dish
And all of our grandparents made a Christmas wish
Like "Lord, let me see another year like this", uhh
Heads down, eyes shut, time to play Seven Up
Heads bowed, hands clutched, bottles gone, Heavens up
Smile comes through, though my eyes might cry
When they reminisce over you, my God
When they reminisce over you, my GodI believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise
Chancelor the rapper, Chatham the hood
Santa to children, had to bag up the goods
They say I'm savin' my city, say I'm stayin' for good
They screamin', "Chano for mayor," I'm thinkin' maybe I should
Fucked a few A&R's, told 'em, "Bitch I can’t wife you"
Told your ass since day one, I don't like labels or titles
I'm a rascally rabbit, I know that tricks is for addicts
That need fixes for habits, in love with carrots and cabbage
I'm a savage, established, bad bitch magnet, I'm magic
Your majesty, I'm majestic, I think my message is massive
Think you passive aggressive
I think you passed up your prime
Think you passed up your chance to be Chance
Now pass it to Arab
I should have rhymed it with rhyme
Ain't we been here before?
Ain't my principal told me that I can't rap at that show?
Then I rapped at that show, simple as that
Got a complex from Complex off of the simplest raps
And it goes like...
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir
I believe that if I fly, prolly end up somewhere in paradise
I believe that if I fly, I'll prolly end up somewhere in paradise
Blow out your speakers, roll some more loud
That's the sound of the reefer, I think my parents is proud
Thank my fans in the bleachers
Think my teachers need features
I think I'm walkin' with Jesus, I knew my feet wouldn't drown
I been close to the edge, I been trippin' and stuff
Somebody slipped me a mickey but I ain't giving a fuck
Really, a milli'? How 'bout six billion more
Or I'm outie like how'd he cut that umbilical cord?
As I smoke herb in this Uber suburban dressed in an Urban Outfitters
Shirt and burgundy pair of Jordans
I asked the acid if words were worth worryin' over
Her explanation seemed agitated
She said let me answer your question
With some questions questionin' yours
Like why the devil can't get you?
And why these labels can't catch you?
And why'd he make you so special, why did he bless you?
Think about it
I woke up this mornin', I woke up this mornin'
Gotta smile when I say that shit, I woke up this mornin'
Go!
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir
I believe, I believe, there's somewhere out there for us all
There's a paradise 
I believe that if I die, I'll see my homies somewhere in paradise
Fannin' the fire, hands is up higher
Cannot believe it, damn I'm a rider
Ridin' on twenties, twenty years prior, I couldn't buy a
Forget it you get it
God is so awesome, devil's a liar
Take 'em to church, but I need a choir
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believe
Somewhere in paradise
I believe, I believe, I believeYep, igh, igh, igh

That racket over the net, ooh, give me my tennis
Shoes, give me a minute, ooh, I can't be tardy
My class is already started, they told my mom I'm retarded
But that 10 Day done in one night, Honda from a Hyundai
No tassel in the spring, but after summer I'm alumni
They took my nigga one night, and I was standing right there
An inch away from Heaven, a million songs from right here
A step away from South by, a swing away from Cali
A hook away from verses, I'm a dad away from rapping
So at the school they arrested him, back seat, squad car, nestled in
Shouts to the bitch nigga Heselton
Wit' his Big Show body ass wrestlin'

I wonder if we'll make it back
I wonder "Can I pay her back, please"
65th and Ingleside
Way before Jamie got his jingles right
I was sleeping with you every single night
But I was still tryna act single right
65th and Ingleside
I was stacking chips like bingo night
I didn't have to pay for a single light
So I'ma make sure everything go right
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Your sister owned the house we lived in
On the East Side that you rented
Little two flat, inexpensive
I didn't have a glove to pitch in
I didn't have a pot to piss in
Not to mention in Dro City
Not a lot of jobs with pensions
All my raps was 'bout suspension
Then one day Donald took me on tour
Young broke Chano ain't broke no more
Thought you wouldn't want me come and darken your doorstep
But I still haven't given you what's yours yet
65th and Ingleside
Moved downtown for a single life
None of my stars ever twinkled bright
'Til God decide to come bring you by
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okay
Where's the return on investment? My first A&R
That shit was played unless you would hit play in the car
We hit the Shell station, I tell you stay in the car
Back in the spot, don't put it in park
Leave that bitch running in case I come running
And skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, grab the gold SCAR
There it get late 'fore it's dark
Kensli couldn't play in the park
Now she could play in the stars
High rise, eye to eye with fireworks
So high your ears fire, they might've burst
Every time they buy a verse, I buy a purse
But you can't buy back time, that's just not how it works
Three jobs, you afforded the crib
Fuck child support, you supported the kid
A full rack a month, nothing short of my rib
So you first up, go in order of dibs
My big homie told me, "Nigga growth and development
Go and settle down, don't settle for settlement"
She got you closer to God than you two ever been
She moved over from Evanston, you moved over from Eggleston
First lady you knew, you can't marry her?
Got shit sonny, now you can't share?
New Dad step in, you can’t stare?
You knew the power in the woman that could lead you in prayer
On 65th and Ingleside
Feel like you remember every single lie
Truth is I just really need your finger size
So I can make sure that they make the ring so tight
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
So you know
There's a way, out of no way
Swear I know everything's gonna be okay
Gonna be okayMhm, New York to Chi-town, rrr
Yo, Pi'erre, you wanna come out here?

Livin' with the people I'ma die around

I could do things in a plain white tee
And some blue jeans, introducing
My lil' boo thing, she gon' stick with thick or thin
That's a mood ring , everybody eats 
You just don't keep receipts, I'ma just press delete 
Always ten toes like feet , came with some built-in cleat 
You don't need help like cheats, you don't need help like Meeseeks
World on my back like leech , mafia fam like Meech 
Steady, keep growin' like Ch-ch-chia
Bringin' my son to the beach 
Never sit in my seat
I cannot be impeached, wash the bitch down with bleach
Yeah, I stuck around, aw, lookie now
Suki-suki now, got a Grammy, I ain't lyin'
Ask Cookie now, got my hoodie down
Get it goodie now, get into it now

Gimme five, it's a vibe, in the hood like drivebys
I ain't talkin' wavin' hands when I'm in Dubai, bye
With the people that I love, rep 'em 'til I die-die
And I'm fly, when you fly they give you the side-eye, ooh
I just hit the plug, 'bout to buy a pound 
Fendi on my moon boots, higher ground 
Pistol on my lap when I ride around 
People I could trust when I'm not around 
Loco, I go loco, took a oath, though 
No Grammy, still a goat, though
You seen how a true queen and a hoop dream
Made my Pinkprint the routine
Treats, everybody eats
Most of them stay quiet but everybody peeps
Feet stay up in some heat 
Act like they don't follow, but everybody sheep
Ahh-ahh, ohh-ohh

Back then, I was broke, I can buy it now 
Got a bitch who love me, I can die around 
I'm on my fourth cup and I'm tired now 
Your gas tank 93 so you can't ride around
Name hold weight, elites
Get head in the car with my seats 
Like my pants no crease 
Gotta watch out for a leech
No two fish, Uber Eats
Perky one-two-threes
New Era hat say "3"
Fuck a bitch while she bleed
She nameless like Lil Keed
Drink my seeds, yes, indeed
Fuck with Chance, he elite
I got a bitch and she don't cheat
Foreign car, beep-beep
Get out my way, I'm OC
I can't go back to DOC
Even though I'm ODB 
I put my bitch in Saint Laurent 
Smokin' gas like Chevron 
Ain't got a Grammy, soon one'll come, mmh

Livin' with the people I'ma die around Do you remember how when you were younger
The  summers all lasted forever?
Days  disappeared into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
I remember the summer Lil' Chano got ahold of his household
The  same summer that widowed Gwyneth Paltrow
Back  when I could trust in my dogs like Balto
My family The Sopranos, these niggas is altos
First  album, every track could be the outro
Velcro to shelltoes, things that we will outgrow
Used to rock South Pole, summers taking the 6 bus to South Shore
Never sold out but now we out-sold
That  was the summer I learned to love the great outdoors
Learned you get the feds if you can't keep yo' mouth closed
That summer left a couple marks like Groucho
That halo can turn hollow, depending how low
That summer left a couple tan lines
I love my city they let me cut the line on the Dan Ryan
They walk on eggshells and landmines
They communicate with handsigns
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
I remember the last summer of the teens
I can't recall too many summers in between
Will Smith, Genie, Donald Glover, Lion King
My daughter on the swing like the 2017 Cubs
My daughter mother double-ringed up
Finger look like jean cuffs, or two lean cups
Used to have obsession with the "27 Club"
Now I'm turning twenty-seven, wanna make it to the 2070 club
Put the 27's down, Lord, give me a clean lung
Took the ring up out the box, I know this ain't no brief love
This story arc so sharp that it made the streets flood
This the type of covenant you keep love, deep love
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever?
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling forever
Do you remember how when you were younger
The summers all lasted forever? 
Days disappear into months, into years
Hold that feeling foreverFuck with me y'all
I mean either way you stuck with me y'all
I'm coming at these rap niggas first
And for most that's unluckily y'all
Better know it
Just a mustard seed dog that I ever really needed
Nigga's just tryna see Jesus
Sipping water like it come with different cheeses
All of your opinions facetious, it's feces
I got a thesis or slick dissertation
Our entire species is young and impatient and passive
All at the same damn time, why? Chi to kill them with kindness
Hit them with the Visine, try to cure the blindness
Couple coffee beans for the sinus
Folgers the best part of waking up
Is the alignment of self with God, and that isn't for a selfish heart
My intention was to flood the scene
I don't ever really hug the scene
Y'all know I been submarine with this shit
Little more Actavis how I lean with this shit
Black as hell, still the cream of this crop
With dream, no king just Ving Rhames with six shots
It's the dawn of the dead and I feel so alive
And the free been in here you can tell by my mind, like
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way up, you steady talking that shit
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy, you just a...
Lazy male complaining about how in high school he could, but his ACL
Ay be clear, this my daddy house, you just the uncle from ATL
Boy get your big....grown ass on
Old ass home, broke ass drinking up all the milk
But can't do no laundry, e-Harmony romance on
Watch your tone folk, talking to grown folk
Yeah, yeah, get that bass out your voice, you were sounding like Tone Lōc
Now watch how I move, different chapters
Decisions, missions, visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud, "My favorite rapper a Christian rapper"
And he got fate in his faith in his soul
And a tape, and a cape and that drape from out west
To the lake and it cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait but it never come late
From tobacco back roads to bus seat back rows
A Black boy, black rose, back rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountains peak and plateaus plateau, ya kna wha' mean?
You just a grown ass kid, who the fuck do you think you is?
The sun is only half way risen, you haven't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy, get up out of here with all that noise
You ain't ever gonna find no joy playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...
Kinda crazy how it fall up in your lap right?
Shit was determined in a past life
If you ask nicely, mad, nice
Even with mad lights you couldn't see the boy
Up in class like I'm only half right, they ain't believe the boy
Wave when you pass them, moments you should bask in
Wonder if the Lord's on my side, let me ask him, or ask her
I don't need a password, don't ask about my past word
Living until my last words, wondering if this music got the slash in
Don't forget the cash and mix in with the passion, oh
If I don't feel the love then I'mma pass end
Shit is everlasting, I'mma have a blast and uh
I'mma have a good day, I'mma stay zonin'
I might get high as shit or I might stay sober
Might roll a J and I might just pass it
Might hit the Bay and I might trip acid
They tried to treat us like some bummy little sneakers
I tell 'em "When you dream, make sure that you dream big"
You could be cool and an Uber driver
The next minute you in Aruba, you scuba divin'
I hope they sell you the truth and that you survivin'
Don't do how they gon' scrutinize 'em
And looking at the youth, tryna euthanize 'em
If it was up to you they would nuke the projects
Get up off that bed, big fella
You a grown boy, big fella
You need your diaper change, big fella
You still catching a bus nigga and living at mom's crib, big fella
You been tryna get money
You only got ten singles in your pocket, big fella
Get up now, big fella, find you a job
Still playing Xbox 360, you ain't even got an Xbox One
You got a PS1 and an Xbox 360, big fella
Go find you a job, today, right now, big fella
The sun is almost gone, big fella
Get up now, big fella
(...playin' yourself like a toy
Boy you just a...)
Get up, big fella
What is you doing?
You been sleeping all day, big fella
You ain't even got no pillows or no cover or no sheets on your bed, big fella
It's time to find another hustle, big fella
That scamming ain't cutting it, big fella
Get up now
Get up, get up, get up, big fellaIt just don't get better
It don't get better
It just don't get no better
It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better
I hate my bed, I hate my home, I hate my job
I hate the wife, I hate the kids, I hate the dog
I hate the sun, I hate the rain, I hate the clouds
I hate the TV, hate the dinner, hate the couch
I hate the car, I hate the bus, I hate the road
I hate the bar, I hate to drink, I hate to smoke
I hate a stranger, hate his boss, I hate his friend
I hate the womb, I needed room, I ate my twin
I hate my hands, handshakes, pancakes, milkshakes
Child-resistant locks on the pill case
I hate inflation, hate the store, I hate to choose
I hate the war, I hate the poor, I hate the news
I hate the late, I can't be early, hate to wait
I hate my lovers cause the way they suffocate
I fuck to hurt, it hurt to date, I hate to date
I fuck to hate, I hate to love, I hate to hate
And it just don't
And it just don't
And it just don't
It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no better
I hate to lose, I hate to try, I hate to win
I hate to cruise, I hate to fly, I hate to swim
I hate the optimistic smirks on the face of children
I hate the government and those who deface its buildings
I hate artists, hate creatives, I hate bright people
I hate darkness, I hate racists, I hate white people
I hate small speakers, I hate loud speakers
I hate great concerts, I don't like crowds neither
I hate money, I hate change, I hate hope
I hate funny, I hate strange, I hate dope
I hate charities and parodies and tragedies
I hate carrots, peas, asparagus
Virtually all vegetables, circuses, all festivals
Texts that are oversexual, motion because it's perpetual
I hate schedules, calendars, reminders
Cause they just remind us that tomorrow gon' be just as timeless
I fucking hate you
And it just don't
And it just don't
And it just don't
It don't get no better
It don't get no
It don't get no better
It just don't get no betterYup
And we back 
Na-na-na 
If you blink you might miss it
You gotta click it or ticket
You gotta go get the gettin' before it's gone
End it quickly as it begun
Life is short as a midget, but mine's a little LeBron
Been a minute since Eminem was a blonde
I need a peace prize‚ mom invented the bomb
A nigga wanted more‚ I would only sit on the lawn
A nigga up next like strongly scented colognes
I'm 'bout to book a show at the Dimmsdale Dimmadome
I still could hit up Sony today and get a loan
And shout out to Miss Sylvia Rhone‚ we get along
But that boy advance gotta be bigger than Diddy Kong
I need stock and it gotta be Pippi Long
Can't stop, won't stop boppin' like Diddy's song
My next tour got eight legs like daddy long
I'm 'bout to have two kids that like daddy's song
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody 
We know who we are 
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a "Mrs." today
This is, this is the day
Took it the scenic route, but this is the way
That's old news, baby, this is today
They gon' miss us today, you a "Mrs." today
Backyard blasted, dance 'til it's grassless
Patio glass, the mazel tov cocktails
Bomb, b-bombastic, used to drop acid
Marli come soon, I only drop classics
Everyone ask
"When that heat gon' drop?"
"When that knee gon' drop?"
"When is he gon' pop the question we all got?"
"'Cause this could be y'all block
You're livin' in a glass house, we can see y'all clocks"
But I can see you from the other side, see y'all rocks
And we could've been Magneto, if you seen our locks
But we share it with the world, not just fans
Come out clean lookin' like we jumped the broom and the dustpan
So now it's here and we actin' out
Dame Dash, champagne in the back of Tao
Now I'm back in my bag and the cat is out
Burn a hole in my pocket like a Black & Mild 
We can't be out here pleasin' everybody 
I know, you know, we know just who we are 
And if you with me, then I'm with you darlin' 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Hey, we made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it 
I just wanted to keep on playin' 
We made it, we made it
I'm feelin' grateful
I'm here with my favorite
Oh God, I'm thankful
Our song and we played it
So good, we played it 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long 
Baby, all day long
Baby, all day longYeah
My baby mama went celibate
Lies on my breath, she say she couldn't take the smell of it
Tired of the rumors, every room had an elephant
Tryna find her shoes, rummagin’ through the skeletons
She took away sex, took me out of my element
I tried to do the single-dad mingle-dance
At the club with the iron in my wrinkled pants
You could fall much faster than you think you can
Big hands for my ring, I'ma need a Pringles can
I just want the shine back like a Eagles fan
My ego like, "Ah damn, there he go
Prayin' again, again, the same ol’ thang"
I mean, I ain't gon' promise that the pain go away
And you can take your sweet time, but she ain't gon' wait
'Cause a new coat of paint don't make the stain go away
But he go high 
And we go high
They go low, we go…
Higher, higher
My wife nanny like Fran Drescher
Three damn Grammys, my Granny like, "No pressure"
So much style, my stylist got no dresser
Fuck goin' straight to the pros, I’m professor
Fuck bein’ one of the G.O.A.T.s, I'm Gotenks
Tried to try that with my girl, she "No thanks"
Dropped the bomb, I couldn’t find a Tom Hanks
Got me pressed, tryin' to find DeVon Frank
Who the fuck rocked the boat? It's gon' sank
Shootin’ at me point blank with those blanks
They don't take teenage angst at no banks
Tried some new hues like Langston gon' paint
You gotta come harder than that
Eh, eh, eh, eh, eh
It's two different things
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's too bad, and it's so sad
It's two things 
It's too bad, and it's so sad
We give the glory to You, God
One livin' true God, You make us booyah
And throw up the Wu like U-God
They prop up statues and stones, try to make a new God
I don't need a EGOT, as long as I got You, God
Deep breathe, the woosah
Pretty sure I need You in this season like a flu shot
I just sit and wait like I'm with Kirsten when she shoe shop
Know you always with me like how Diddy be with Blue Dot
Got us movin' 'round without the straps like a tube-top
Got me big comfy like Molly's couch
Floatin' 'round the city like Malcolm X dolly'd out
They highly doubt, I guarantee it
This the part of my life my Lifetime movie prolly 'bout
When they come to jump a board, I won't ollie out
I too was once a snotty nose with a potty mouth
One day you get 1 OAK, then poppied out
And poppin' out don't seem as popular as just passin' out
When time get rationed out, you get rational
Folks become pageants inside the fashion house
They start to clash and you let 'em hash it out
But stay passive, so if they crash, you got a fastened belt 
Lord bless my lineage, let me be the skinniest
Let me get some time with him, let him know who Kenny is
Children born in one's youth are like arrows in the hands of a warrior
Well, I got an extendo with a long nose like Phineas
Kids proud like Penny is
BeBe & CeCe, I need like 20 twins
Got her in my family like Indian
Feel it in your gut like when you uppercut Ballchinians
Speakin' of guts, hers pokin' out like Winnie in the red shirt
I don't have to teach you a lecture about how sex works
I found out diamonds make pressure
I used to dive headfirst, just know I had to let go of the flesh first
It's true, God, this union was for You, God
We standin' at the stoop, we want to make it to the rooftop
You told us bring some people through, we tried to bring a few, God
We tried to form a new bond, just tell us what to do, GodIce, melting in my chain
Pretty as my hair
Ugly as my name
Dirty as my gold
Comfy as my chair
Ugly is my name
Ugly is my name
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
My sword look just like Michael's
He lent it to me, this a house of God
I'm just leasing, he rent it to me
This sentence he penned it too
That's a Gmail, he sent it to me
I can send you his contact, hit him if you in combat
Hit him if you in traffic, even if there ain't no static
That's my G, he got me shinin'
My hair, he made it tangled
My seed, don't need no lining
A halo fits on an angel
And if the shoe fits, I'll tie his and let the kiddie rap
Finally give the city back, and ask God for a piggy-back
Up on his shoulders I notice, I'm within earshot
I yell, "Thanks for makin' us in your image
You got a good sense of hubris"Sparring is training, chain-snatching the slaves
But a rap song is a match in a cave
Dim lit, wet wick, wicked wrath in its way
Drunk off of light, lies, laughing
Claiming asylum while shying in shade
I can't stay silent, I go violent when my violets is gray
And my roses is black
Fuck the pharaohs and the Pharisees, Moses is back
I don't need to see a Sphinx to know they noses was black
I don't know one Temptation that had Otis's back
Sparring is training; this a jumping jack
I'm the scariest Jack in the pumpkin patch
Float like my jumper wet, sting like a bumblebee
I swing like a lumberjack, go back when I'm up at bat
They tried to label me a non-rapper
I'm an independent contractor, card cracker
Sparring is training without the training wheels
You made it, you made it, you made it, yeah, you made a deal
You played it straight, hated, graduated
Waited-waited, you still a waiter still
Mice will always find out ways to steal
Picture me, fifth of Hennessy and a Swisher Sweet
Fake identity, 'til a plug named Trinity shook me
"Wake up, wake up," like "Remember me?"
Said one plus one make three, and you finna see
You ain't as grown as you finna be
You got them young nigga tendencies
Mm... Sentimental energy
I let the light in beside him, I stand like angel
Sparring is training for an apathetic halo
Apologetic, nonreligious, consequential fable
Like good is good, the love in me is goodly, or godly
The Bible say mistakes is necessary
So I Mississippi monologue to granny house
My soloist is sold out to attentive God
Cornbread on my table when I say my prayers
On airs, to stairs where shadiness is time to rest or manifest
Sparring is training, I know they think me bumblebee
Afro-Americano Sunny D, but bet I sting, no die
Sparring is training, Jacob wrestled with God
In the desert 'til he broke him and he blessed him
And he rescued his heart
I struggle with love, I juggle my loves
I cuddle and coddle, ship wreckin' bottle, I huddle in hugs
Sparring is training bra, Ramses watching raining frogs
Jigga watching Damon, Damon watching Wayans Bros
A tandem unicycle with two pilots in different maps
]
You giving back? 
Tit for tat
Synagogue and bottle caps
A body in the underpass says, where's my Jesus?
Pledge allegiance to the money now
We runnin down to kiddie parks where darker kids be casualty
Like come with me, to the museum
Excuse them, they know of what they do
Sparring is training, don't let Denzel Training Day you
Sensei could catch a fade too
We be on that elegant, hella melanin
Pelle Pelles since they crayons and jelly pens
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none
And now you know Noname ain't never for none
Ayo, you know Chano ain't never for none
Ha-HA!! And you don't stop
Ayy! Ayy!
Boom bap, and you don't stop
Hahahahaha!
I told you that was gonna be fun though
Nah that was... Oh shit!Happy Holidays
She could say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
Mama you know, Mama you know its gonna rain
Father you know
Promised, you said it would rain, finally I'm home
You left on the light when I left on the flight, but I made it alright
I've been waiting all week, I've been waiting all night
Jason Van Dyke
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at Church on Sunday
Open Mike coming on Monday
I wonder what the internet gonna say
When SNL end with the Indie
Then the third tape slide down the chimney
Via Kirsten, Kinsley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy, Austin win the Emmy, Mama Jan too
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rainToday I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out
Luckily, my ex ugly
I don't eat, so she can't get no lunch with me
I don't reach, so she can't get in touch with me
Can't be buds with me
Don't know what to be
She gon' cuss at me
Told her "give it a rest," so I keep custody
Keep it all side-eyes and side-hugs with me
I know that my girl's trust is a luxury
I don't want my next album sounding all Usher-y
But I must confess, I must confess
For every single ex, I want the best
I really wish you nothing but success
I know it's gonna work out
Doesn't it get dark, right before the sun peeks
And bears his face? And doesn't it get so hard to breathe?
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
With nothing left to give, with nothing left to say
When no one says they're wrong, or sets the record straight
But it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out, it's gonna work out
That shit might hurt now, but I'm with her now
Don't need closure now, just keep the shirt now
Sorry you were led to believe
Bunch of different stories that was never to be
No you isn't ugly I just said it to be
Funny we both know that you look better than me
Sorry I started runnin' when you ran into me
I'm just tryna be the kinda man I'ma be
And I'm getting better gotta hand it to me
Seem to always work out when you hand it to Jesus
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work out
I believe in long distance love, God that's above
Bond that's so strong can't let y'all bald-headed—
Yeah, y'all interrupt, you all in a rush
We all gon' meet up in the up, in the upper room
If I run into em', I'll be ru-running to em'
We could re-run the show, we could re-bump into 'em
If we read the wrong one, we could re-jump the broom
If we read the wrong one, baby we jump the groom
I'm ready to be groomed
I'm ready to assume, the position is filled
I was ret since the womb
I was not made for this, this was made for me
And it's gonna work out
Today I missed my workout, but it worked out
Now I'm missing work now, but it worked out
Had to buy a crib, 'fore I bought my first house
Had my first kid, I love how she turned out
I love how she turned up, even if I'm burned out
I'ma have so many seeds, I could have a birdhouse
I'ma love on they mama, I hope it work out
I hope it work outOh, no, no, no, no-no
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
I wonder if Gladys smiles when angels bring my name up
Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dogs and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt ya hand on my head, yelling: "Call his father"?
But people don't hear ghosts, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I'ma do the same thing
You're droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like, how you got the drive, but don't know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose, dope and mixes
Let ya throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Blast off
Dropping tapes 'til I losted count, coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowns
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
Yeah, I'm steady crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God
Your little angels falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around
Oh, non je t'en prie, nous ne sommes pas chez nous
Oh, je t'assure que ce n'est pas grave
Non laisse-moi!
Mais qu'est-ce que tu as aujourd'hui?
J'ai que les hommes me dégoûtent. Vous ne pensez qu'à ça
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
And I'll gamble away my fright
And I'll gamble away my time
And in a year, a year or so
This will slip into the sea
Well, it's been a long time, long time now
Since I've seen you smile
Said it's been a long time, long time now, now, now
Said it's been a long time, long time now
And it's been a long time, long time nowBaby, I look good, I look handsome
Baby,  I look good, I look handsome
Somebody  gon' take me for ransom
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none
Baby,  you look good, you look pretty
I  know why you stopped fuckin' with me
It's a lot of bomb in the city
But  you know nobody could get 
It's a hottie, it's a body, we ain't missin' no meals

Big fine, rotisserie 
My big tongue make it slippery 
I give you a sec' I'll let you shake it out 
Now, let's run it back, this time don't make a sound

You out here bakin', hot like Megan on my bacon when it pop 
Baby, you look good, you look gorgeous

Somebody gon' take me for ransom 
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none 
Baby, you look good, you look pretty 
I know why you stopped fuckin' with me 
It's a lot of bomb in the city 
But you know nobody could get
Well-known all across the globe
For my player ways and my skimpy clothes
Houston hottie with a model body
I'ma bust it open like a centerfold
Bad bitch with a lot of options 
After me, it's really hard to top it 
She don't suck it sloppy, she don't like to ride it
She don't lick the balls, she ain't really wifey, ah 
All that talking shit, you know that excite me 
And I know that mean you love me
When you tell me you don't like me 
And I know you need some pussy
When you argue and we fightin'
Don't you put them in our business
If we beefin', keep it private, huh 
Baby, you look good, you look handsome 
Rich nigga put that dick up for some ransom 
Before I let you go, I had to have some 
Rich bitch so you know I got my bands up

Somebody gon' take me for ransom 
Everybody 'round me was dancin'
Ain't nobody 'round me could have none 
Baby, you look good, you look pretty 
I know why you stopped fuckin' with me 
It's a lot of bomb in the city 
But you know nobody could get I can't believe it
Must be the luckiest guy alive
Somehow, I arrived
But we're only gonna survive if we go crazy
Yeah the only way to survive is to go
Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive is to go crazy
Oh my God, think it's the greatest day of my life
So glad you arrived

Fuck it

Still wanna, drink it, fuck it, drink it, drink it, fuck it, shoot it
I don't wanna, just get it, get it, get it, get it
Oh, Lord
Oh my god, think it's the greatest day of my life 
So glad you arrived
But the only way to survive is to go crazy
Yeah, the only way to survive...
In the simulation
This is the only part I like
Or I might just be a molecule of Christ
Folding in a universe of dust and light
Or maybe we're just molecules in the body of ChristThis is six blunt rotation music
This is just got off six-month probation music
This is steppin' on the beach
When you're too drunk to feel a beat
This that laughing in a condo
Throwin' shit down in the street
This that shouts to the Ave, shouts to the lab
Shouts to the clucks, shouts to the strags
This for every math class that I ever had
So fuck you if I failed, and fuck you if I passed!
For shitty summaries and bummers in the past
'Cause some of our teachers act as if summer was for class
Some of us is seein' summer, some of us have passed
Some of us ain't seein' summer, some of us have passed
So I'm just glad to say I'm sippin' rum up out a glass
'Cause some of us is only sippin' some up off the grav'
And heaven's gates look a lot like prison from the Ave
We on the ground yelling, "Give my nigga back!"
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down 
Another weekend full of blunts and brews
Too comfortable, yelling "Fuck a school"
Ain't seen the world before noon in like a month or two
Blunts to the face, bottles to the dome
Niggas never need no cup
Livin' out dreams, never givin' hopes up
Ridin' with them Vill niggas, never givin' no fucks
In the game tryna get our feel, tryna get a deal
Tryna get a mill, tell 'em that
Just ridin' around with my niggas and them
Real white nigga man mean real appeal
We go all out 'til we fall out
Niggas get called out then hauled out
With the windows down we like to smoke all out
Drink 'til I fall out, fuck is you talkin' 'bout boy
The Village is my brothers
It's me, Mikey, Kembe trappin'
Hella love for Chance The Rapper
We know 10 Day is a classic, on God
And I just want to roll with my windows down
And I just want to roll with my windows down
Uh, this is for sand in my shoes, shout out to Oak Street
For the free train rides, shout out to Polk Street
To the ice cream man you just on hella dirt
How you don't see us can't hear us, you Helen Keller?
But I'ma save my dollars for Mary Jane and embellish her
Inhalin' her, smellin' her, maybe sellin' her
You niggas got cold feet, shouts to Luke Helliker
But that's my homie, my dude be droppin' hella verses
So, shouts to D.O.C. and Nu Tribe too
Man we out this jam, see how new guys do
But its still save money like a coupon
So you can catch me off of the Ave gettin' my stoop on
And I just want to roll with my windows down, yeah
And I just want to roll with my windows down, yeah, oh, ooh, haOh yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, gotta throw it down
Side chicks can't dance like this, uh
Side niggas can't dance like this, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Side niggas can't step like this, uh-uh
Side niggas can't stand like this, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah 
What you know about this? This before your time
I used to two-step in the 019
I always been fine, this is not new wine
I just happened to find a way to live my whole life in my prime
Side niggas don't look this good, can't cook this good
Can't fuck this good, can't get right
You send him to the store and forget that he left
You send me to the store, I come back with a chef
I'll come back out of breath
While your side nigga sittin' at the club with a booty on his chin like a cleft
I don't never want two that's the same as the next
I made the three more famous than Steph
No cap, that's a roundhouse kick to a Jameson's neck
I got a Jada Pinkett keeping sure my shame is in check
Cross-legged in the dojo, my master, mentor
Side chicks can't take out splinters
Side chicks make they Kool-Aid with Splenda
Side chicks can't come to Auntie Linda's house
They gon' send her off, they gon' send her out
To buy more things that they hid in the couch
Don't you know that side niggas can't cop no Tesla?
Pull up in a ring like wrestlers
Hop out at the soccer game with the VVS's and a bunch of snacks
Model X Falcon, backseat, doing jumping jacks
20-1-9, I want it one of a kind
2020, I'ma be ahead of my time
Twenty thousand leagues, the biggest fish in the pond
But if you never go fishing, it's something you'll never find
We can be , eternal 
We can be , eternal 
I know some shawties that'll blast for me over blasphemy
And throw that ass for me, so molasses-ly
Huh, slow motion so I had to see
Before you start, fill my glass, wipe my glasses
I love her passion, ooh 
I drunk her passionfruit 
I'm runnin' through your organs like when a pastor hoop
I wanna pass the ball, I don't pass the ball
I'm Kobe, baby, I ate it up
I ain't ate all month, you lookin' like a plate of lunch
Said her her name was Angie and she love to get stoned
Almost fell in love, I hurt my heart from these songs
Tourmaline on, she can feel it in the stones
Huh, now she giving me ultimatums
I told her I hate tomatoes, some chances, I gotta take 'em
I can't see for the life of me
Why all these hoes like me when I got wifey?
Side chicks can't do flat twists
Bet a dollar you could buy me a Brisk 
Side chicks can't cook no grits
Grits, nigga, grits
We can be , eternal 
We can be , eternal 
Side chicks can't dance like this, uh
Side niggas can't dance like this, no
No, no, no, no, no, no, no, no
Side niggas can't step like this, uh-uh
Side niggas can't stand like this, uh-uh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Oh yeahWell we must be some zanies and fools
To  take a gamble on this love just like we do
What  a wonderfully crazy thing to do
Love like magnets, we were powerless to choose
I'm so powerful every time I look at you
No  memory of anything I couldn't do
It's  possible, so possible
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah,  yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Once upon a time I was unsure of myself
I would always claim I never had no help
Looking to the mirror, the most unfair of all
Hit  the Player's Ball, it was unbearable
Another big birthday, another milestone
To make your birthstone feel like rhinestone
The caterpillars that had burrowed inside my belly
Started to flutter before I learned how to fly
I had a bunch of midlife crises 'fore I turned twenty-five
The teachers put me in the back row, I was learning to hide
'Cause when the teachers call you special, that's the perfect disguise
I had to bury all the dancing that would burgeon inside
I got quiet, thought that silence was the perfect reply
I turn to Casper any time a nigga turn on the slide
Until I turned up at the talent show, a permanent high
I had Jesus behind the wheel before I learned how to drive
'Cause it's poss'...
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
Once upon a time, a lady who tried twice
At being a good wife and giving a good life
To both of her lil' girls with ballerina tights
She called up the RE/MAX and opened her own site
Closing open houses, hired her own type
Alimony is phony, she paid for her own flights
Crazy office parties, she's throwin' 'em inside
And my mama sealed my fate when she opened the invite
The lady had a plan, she knew it all in advance
The party was a good mixture of employees and friends
She told the people comin' to make sure they bring their kids
Yeah, bring some food, but just make sure you bring your kids
After we arrived and after standing around
The lady tinked her glass and told us, "Gather around"
For a special performance from her daughters, she said it proud
"But tonight they not my daughters, tonight they Destiny's Child"
Out from the back came three lil' survivors
In formation, choreo tighter
One on the left, I think I might like her
One on the left, I think I might love her
Lady just folds her arms, rubs her hands
All of the lessons learned, how to dance
All of these moments left up to chance
Everything will go right as it can
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible
It's possible
Once upon a time, I had carats supplied
To a pair of fair rings I would share with the bride
Every kiss begins with Claire's cut clarity size
They were forever, but marriage had an apparent decline
Now we live in fear of doin' what our parents was tryin'
So every Rapunzel don't got the kind of hair you can climb
Ever since they lost a slipper, every pair that they find
They say these boots were made for dancing like Mary J. Blige
We live a life apart, life so hard
Life'll never really end up like the start
We learned together how the back door feels
And we was jumping over brooms in tobacco fields
We was the same, all black folks still
Until the white man found out black votes steal elections
So they legitimized us, but behind us
It's still black folks at the back door still
For every small increment liberated, our women waited
And all they privacy been invaded
Almost every trait I got through the slave owner gone
Skin brown, nose round, but the Bennett made it
Now I wanna give it to her, Sierra Leone, serenade
Sometimes love come with its own barricade
Sometimes love just gotta hold, marinate
Let it hold, let it wait, here it go, here it go
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible 
It's possible
It's possible
Ayy, yo
Once upon a time, a girl from Trinidad
Had to fly to Canada and sneak into the land
Of the free and of the brave, feet under the sand
And I came in realizing nothing free in the land
Dreams of making money, had to split it with Sam
All that Making the Band, yeah, I could've did it, but damn
Rather really be on the come-up, had to stick to the plan
Went from rockin' with Fendi, now Fendi know I'm a brand
That's how God do, I'm in your top two
And I ain't number two, conquered rap, then the pop too
You gon' stop who? Get off cock, boo
Since "Itty Bitty Piggy," giving bitches what they bop to
I met my husband when I was seventeen out in Queens
If you love it, let it go, now I know what that means
While he was up North for a body
I bodied everybody and got known for my body
My nigga home now, he the Clyde to my Bonnie
'Bout to walk down the aisle and be a mommy
Ooh, I remember when I cried like, "Why me?"
Now I wouldn't exchange my life for Armani
Sometimes I feel like I'm dreaming and then it hits me
Gotta remember who I am when it slips me
Kids running up to the car yelling, "Nicki"
All my bad bitches, I know that y'all with me
Fuck they thought was sittin' in my seat?
Got a big bowl of ice cream sitting in my Jeep
Got some killers that'll put you on ice, so don't sleep
'Bout to dead this whole beef and rock some gold teeth
It's possible, it's possible
It's possible to meZaytoven
IGH! What? Why you followin' me?
Where you think...?
Ain't you...? Ugh
Why the hell you standin' front of me?

I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016
Niggas been hatin' since 2014
'Cause they ain't wanna see a youngin' on the big screen
This shit ain't been the same since 2015
I lost a lot of people in 2016
The Lord told me they wasn't meant for me
The hoes won't get a red cent from me
If I get locked down would you sin for me?
She ain't go for you but she went for me
Ayy, look what you done done to me
Remember when they used to make fun of me
I pull up like trucks and they run from me
Blue cheese, yeah my pockets where the hundreds be
I ain't met a bitch yet say she done with me
Bitch keep tryna show me her tongue ring
I'm a king so she honor me
I still keep a stick like a pogo
You say you gonna rob me, that's a no-no
I still get them things in for the low-low
Yeah we got more pumps than a GoLo
Long nights in the skreets like a hobo
A nigga diss on me, he a homo
He claim he don't know me, but his ho know
The rap game ain't the same since Lud Foe
Since Lud Foe
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016
Fuck 2016
I'm a boss, I got sauce, now she wanna striptease
Man I made it out the hunnids, I only count blue things
I only drive big wings, all I drive is big wing
Hit the studio with you, got 'bout 20 16s
We gon' leave all the rumors back in 2016
It must suck to be you, got your girls in the Lex, peace
Baby girl say she 20, actin' like she 16
Leave that fake flexin' up in 2016
Don and Blitzen on your baby, slidin' in them Vickies
Got a donkey on you, baby, can't believe it, Ripley's
Merry Christmas, space jammin', swear I got 'bout six rings
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
G, go somewhere, would you lose my number please?
You still out tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you in 2016
I shoulda left you back in 2016
Now I shoulda left you back in 2016
They shoulda left you back in 2016
You a throwback with your old ass
Talkin' 'bout, "We go back"
You need to go back
To wherever, I don't give a fuck, go 'way
Leave your attitude at the doorway
Leave your ass too at the doorway
I ain't never like your ass no way
I ain't never like your ass, I ain't never like your ass
I ain't never like your ass no way
Why your ass workin' that same old tired ass job?
They ain't fire your ass in '08?
Now I'm 'bout to show your ass
Shoulda walked by your ass
I ain't tryna find your ass no way
Got too many bodies you a throw 'way
Rest in peace to great David Bowie
Please can we get back Prince?
Please can we get back Kim?
Bo Slice, boy I swear that they gave you life
Shoulda left your ass in the pen'
Please can we get back Craig Sager?
Leave your ass at the rim
Three feet, no pressure, no press, no questions
Actually one simple question
Why the hell you standin' front of me?
I swear you just said you was done with me
You still all tahm 'bout what you gonna be
Need to get some money
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
I shoulda left, shoulda left you
I shoulda left you
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeahI get sad when I look at the stars
They so pretty, you can't tell 'em apart
You think they close but really we far
And really, they ain't even that much closer to God
It's much harder to sin naked
I walked past apple trees and didn't take it
I thought about stone mattresses, thin blankets
Really long winters spent in a windbreaker
I'm a temptation door-knocker, down there on Lower Wacker
I'm a rich excuse for a father, you just can't tour a toddler
She turnin' 2, she don't need diapers, she just need her papa
I really need a break, could really use a nap
My daughter barely recognize me when I lose the hat
You go so far, you hit a point where you can't Uber back
The other day, I told a hummingbird he too relaxed
I did my worst, I did the work, I had to skip the label
I go to church, they want a flick, I want to flip the table
I knew the worth before the birth when it was just a stable
And now it's just a fable, and it's just as fatal
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes, yeah
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes
Alright
Spirit's moving now
I think my little cousins want they cousin back
The automatic quarterback that doesn't rap
They know I used to drive to Hammond for the Roman candles
Lied about coming back, the last straw that broke the camel
It ain't really fun to hang out with me no more
We can't go to River East to hang at the beach no more
It's messed up, I made it this way, and my feet so sore
But it's all downhill from here, I could teach snowboards
I miss my mom, I miss my time, I miss my prime
In high school, I missed my prom, I ditched my date, I missed my beat
Kissed my teeth, kicked my feet, hooped and hollered
Now I just sip my tea, sit my ass on my ass
Send my Tweet, fold my arms, twist my weed
If I hadn't heard the news, I would've known what he say
But the recliner on my chair is like an emergency brake, you know
First world problems that niggas make up
Have a dream and then never wake up
When so much turns to too much
Have a dream and then never wake up
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes, here it comes
Ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes
Ready or not, here it comes
Three verses, hell yes
I still ain't get my Grammys in the mail yet
I just want my mama happy like a toy sale
And to stay connected to the world like a long-ass voicemail
I hear the seams snappin', and I'm the team captain
No more knee slappin' or shoe shinin' or shoe signin'
'Til the dream happens, I'm just gon' keep rappin'
And y'all just keep clappin' and keep actin' like
Flint got clean water and y'all don't got teen daughters
And black friends and gay cousins, y'all just gon' say nothin'
Know that the day comin', knees bowed, tongues confessin'
The last ones gettin' first dibs on blessings
Now these the first world problems that niggas make up
Keep on playin', we gon' shake this shit up
Keep on tellin' us we makin' it up
The American Dream, may you never wake up
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it comes,  ready or not, ready or not
Ready or not,  ready or not, ready or not
The day is on its way, it will not wait another day
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, I cannot wait, here it's to stay
No more, no more 
The day is on its way, it couldn't wait no more
Here it isYou are very special
You're special, too
Everyone is special

Niggas was busy scrappin', put 'em up
I was too busy rapping, good as fuck
Niggas don't act like grown ups
When niggas don't get to grow up
Niggas don't wanna throw hands
That's what made me wanna throw up
But these young gunners ain't nothin' but young stunners
And niggas see you as come ups so niggas just wanna run up
Niggas asking, "What up?" I said on my soul, I'm a hundred
My niggas stay in the low end, the others stay in the hundreds
My daddy throw me the hands and my momma told me to love 'em
My neighbors told me they hunting, I hope I make it through summer
They stole one of my niggas, I should have seen that one coming
My priest told me it's angels, my niggas told me its nothing
I'm thinking about my nigga he thinking before he die
I'm going to war with fate and I'm going to war with God
I'm burning up all the papers 'cause all the reporters lied
I called up my lil' homie, bought him a .45
Brown boys are dying and none of 'em were for business
And all of em' love they momma and all of they mommas miss 'em
And this shit is just stupid, this shit is fucking senseless
The news shouldn't support it, this shit is getting expensive
I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And now for something completely different
And I don't know why I sleep with my eyes wide
Hoping that I find you
And hoping that I find you

Birdman handrub
This shit fit me like a damn glove
Shit cleaner than a hand scrub
Feel better than DJ Khaled fan love
This the rock that gave pride to a man cub
Ain't no love in hip-hop
There ain’t no keepin' up with the Bennetts
Ain't no diamonds in the chain but it’s in the pendant
I only own fishbowls, but my rentals tinted
You know I'm used to movin' units like a rental tenant
Real lieutenant, God's army
He like a doctor, he'll never let a shot harm me
I'm a force in the field, I never take damage
I create panic 'cause niggas wanna act fake satanic
And the labels get straight frantic
Their boardrooms look like eight Channing Tatums and a Peyton Manning
And they all been married
They celebrate anniversaries and nurseries and try to play Santa
But they don't sell marriage no more
Guess bein’ all alone ain’t so scary no more 
Guess our lives ain't for sharin’ no more
Guess the tale can't end like a fairy no more, but...

Anything is possible if Gucci can do it 
Tractor trailer full of kush, bet Gucci could move it
Used to drive a Buick, now a Rolls Royce 
I'm the young hoes' choice that make the old hoes moist
All these millions separate all the men from the boys
All these wars I went through, felt like a soldier deployed
I'm the trap god but I give the glory to God
It's a knife on my K and my tongue is a sword
I'm the plug and the cord, get it all in accord
White rings seasick, Gucci went overboard
Hublot surfboard, brought sand to the beach
All white tux on, brought the church to the streets

I was off campus but the officer
Told the office that he saw me from the parking lot
But it's all good, I'm off that
I'm just finna off his ass, off of the Ave while rocking all black
Dip off and hide the garbage bags in the dip spot
Just to make sure that I don't get caught
Buying hella bug spray, making sure I get off
They told me gon' rock it, I told them that it's lift off
How all my homies get caught? Picked off by a dick cop
Why you allowing hiccups? Why you just didn't slip off?
And now I'm at the precinct, and I'm off of my square
Having a white cop beat me while he offers me squares
You gon' torture me, yeah? Well, that's awfully fair

WalaRoosters calling in the distance
It was all us crammed in the house
Back when my dad was the man of the house
A lot of dads left, they abandoned the house
My dad Joe Jack, start a band in the house
He said one friend, one friend in the house
Only one friend in the whole wide world
One day will come when you only have each other
Never give it up for a boy or a girl
We come in peace but we don't come in pieces
We on some tag-team WWE shit
We look just alike, the prestige is so prestigious
The splitting image of Lupita standing on them beaches
Don't tweak and don't be facetious
Those shells'll shred you to pieces
These niggas faking like demons
But I'ma send 'em to Jesus 
Versus all of you heathens
They think I'm reading Ephesians
I have all these niggas hiding, avoiding meetings like vegans
I got the keys like I'm Keegan
I'll line the trunk with the bleach
And I'll leave you inside the freezer and let you chill for the weekend
But forget over the weekend and come back inside a month
And I throw you inside the trunk but it's plastic so it ain't leakin'
But we can be cool
We can be cool
Me and my brother
We can be cruel
Find your ass
Line your ass up
Go to work on 'em
Roosters calling in the distance
It's a lot more crammed in the house
Back when Chance was the man of the house
Baseball bats if they ran in the house
We from out south like birds in the clouds
When I was eleven, heard my homie dad died
This shit deeper than music, I got PTS for life
So if you do production just make sure the drums right
The independent Bennetts will never need your advice
Our image won't diminish 'cause Charlie and Marley right
Me and Chano like Peschi and Robin's life
A made man, we just makin' the songs right
You just makin' the song hype
I really snapped, the last time I rapped I was movin' packs
In adolescence, seen ambulances, learned other lessons
Catchin' blessings, overstretchin' from first-hand impressions
Chano called my phone voicemail, hope he don't get a message
Heard that I exit from my axis off that intersection
So if you say somethin' 'bout big bro, bitch, I'ma smack you reckless
We from down south, we bogus twice and we are not from Texas
One more rep, can't run around strapped, so I walk around like pedestrian
Chi-town summer lookin' like my numbers, and you know how I'm bomin', ain't checkin' it
Called big bro, now we run it up, set it up, get it up, nigga, now let's begin
OTF, free Durk and them
We was inside with a curfew then
What's fire without earth and wind?
And what's a fight when it's worth the win? YeahAh-ah, ah-ah-ah

You a Yogi, you should idle while in child's position"
I be like, naw, these my sons, this prenatal care
I'mma show em how to make it here and make it fair
Take it there, they could kill me and I ain't gon' care
You is just an ankle weight, lighter than some angel cake
Sweeter than some maple syrup, easier than Ableton
Make a plate and make a player

Eat your dinner 'fore you say your prayer

Or change language and subject change up
Her boy's a long way from red dolls and green rangers
Things ain't been the same since Ms. Patterson called me famous
I saw your reflection in a toilet full of vomit water
You don't think I felt your hand on my head yelling, "Call his father"?
But people don't hear ghost, so how they gon' play me?
Money saved me, so I'ma do the same thing
You droppin' pounds, gettin' small on some sick shit
Like how you got the drive but don't know how to use a stick shift?
You better not miss this, overdose dope and mix this
Let your throat close with a boatload of dope quotes within it
Long time now since I seen you smile
Long time, long time now since I seen you smile
And it's been a long time, long time now
Since I seen you smile
Dropping tapes 'til I lost the count
Coughing out blood
Dropping weight like I lost an ounce
Throwing words and tossing nouns
NY traveling, I'm Boston bound, bossing 'round homies
And talking down to shorties while I'm jotting down
Notes to spit to Harlem crowds
Surfing through the Harlem crowds
At the crib, I'm falling down
I'm on the floor, crawling 'round
I'm calling out to God, "You're little angel's falling down
Save me from my darkened cloud
Reach your hands and arms around"
Long time, long time now, since I seen your smile
We miss you
10 day
It's been a really, really long time, long time
Since a goof-ass nigga done tried me
Label niggas wanna sign me
And lame ol' nigga wanna buy me
Food and weed and drink and shit
Just as long as you inkin' shit
Sometimes I can't pay for food
'Cause sometimes I can't think of shit
Where's your head at? Where's your head at?
Singing my shit like you just said that
Wanging my shit like, "Where'd you hear that?"
Young-ass nigga, where you headed? Long time to get famous
Life's whatever you make it, just thank God that we made itI let the sun come down
Without telling you exactly what I mean
And you might never know
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me
Yeah
Yeah, yeah
Please don't let my death be about my death
Please don't make no movies about my death
Please make my death about my life
If you make a movie 'bout my life, make it right
Please don't make no holograms, don't wanna do it twice
You wanna use my likeness, please approve it through my wife
And if you get the license then you better use it right
Don't misconstrue my offerings to offer new advice
If I said it, I meant it
If I'm dead, it's cemented
And cinder block cemeteries already ascended
I'll leave you my last name I left on the last plane
Too much baggage but you can carry on Bennett
I just wanna make sure that my words touch you
Pinky swear and kiss it
Promise no one'll hush you
Jump and hit the blocks, I promise you'll see the mushroom
Clouds and the dust soon
Leavin' more thoughts than there are bristles on a brush broom
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
And you might never know
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down
I let the sun come down without letting you know exactly what I mean
Exactly what you mean to me
7 PM thoughts in my home
Who to put in my will, who to put in my won't
Some people my blood, some people my flesh
That's the difference 'tween catch and fetch
I don't want nobody to be at my wedding
That won't be there for my marriage
They can see that shit on Facebook
They can like it, they can share it
Like, "Look at that lil' dress and how she wear it
I thought that pregnant belly prolly tear it"
"You know they only did this shit for money"
"I know one day that they just gon' co-parent"
"I gotta zoom in, count up all the carats"
"I know that nigga probably went to Jared"
"I know that nigga probably so embarrassed"
But they don't know nothin', baby
That's why I tell you when I say it, I say
Don't look down, don't look down
When they, when they try and make up all that bullshit
I just tell you
Don't look down, don't look down
And when we goin' towards the sky, when we get into that atmosphere
Don't look down, don't look down
And when they go into the comments, we like a comet
Don't look down, don't look down
Don't look downShawty, she got the body

You are the prototype
I love you like you love your photo likes
When you post your life
Some of these hoes just wanna Instagram me
You out here trying to win you an Instagrammy
Instant pancakes in the morning
Aunt Jemima try to Andre Benjamin me
I'm sorry Ms. Jackson, but your daughter do dicks
Wouldn't be my old bitch if you taught her new tricks
But she do do the one thing, with her tongue ring
When she bust like a gun range
I had a couple pics, record her out her panties
But, that's just chump change
She the type of bitch that loves to say she's mixed
But when she say the roster she always say "Black last"
You know who you is and you know what it is
I love you with your black ass
You helpless thing, wish you gave me more head
And have way more self esteem
But I wish she gave me way more head
Way more then I ever gave a fuck about your self esteem

Oh my god, oh my god I’m a novelty
At least that’s what she said when she swallowed menovelty
Your bitches had the ball, my bitches pass the ball
And this dick is a gift for that love degree, hey
Heard you graduating, girl congratulations
This ain't prom but can I take you home as if your fam was waiting
At the front door with that 44 cocked

Do it for the 1-9 love, 1-9
For the 1-9, for the 1-9 love
Do it for the 1-9
We do it, we do it for the 1-9 love
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me, I got you always
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever
Always, always and forever

Ooh, I've got you, oh-oh-oh
Ayy, call me Young Mister, Mister Tongue Twister
Niggas couldn't touch the flow if they was playing Twister, right
A minute in it, they turn to Sonny Liston, right
It's plenty of pullin' up, I'm gettin' blisters
Ever since I kissed her
Everyone seem like they got something to say
Like the day after the big day
Is supposed to be super bad like we won't stay
It's supposed to be super scary like we don't pray
We treat the bad advice like bad breath
Either give a compliment or couple mints, depends what we have left
Findin' good news in the bad press
Tell 'em break a leg like an actress, hit with a jab step
1-9 love, that's forever, it'll never stop
1-9 Love, that's a record I'll never drop, uh
1-9 love, that's a one time love
That's a one time, one time, every time it'll be the
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with , a grain of sand
Or leave it all up to me , I got you always
Always, always and forever, ever

Always, always 
It's been a minute, I've been messin' with ya, I could never switch up
Turn my life around, I'm tryna go to Heaven with ya
I would sit there in the waiting room together with ya
Magazines, pat my jeans, have a beverage with ya
Count my blessings with ya
They prefer success less than when we stress, bet
Forget about all the drama and the comments they left
Out rightly fine, the bottom line is right on top of they text
You gotta remember that the enemy is not of the flesh
You gotta remember that our imagery is made from the best
So pray for the best
Hands high, caught the garter, caught the Hail Mary
Married, tossed the veil, moved to Fort Lauderdale
1-9 to 9-1, that's the goal
9-1 dash, that's the soul
Can't keep track of lies that they told
So extra in the background, that's they role, but
Lot of folks share they opinions
Same folks so easy offended
One thing I'll always remember
They here today, but we'll be together forever
Around the world, people tend to lend advice
We can't blame them, it's all just by design
Take it all with , a grain of sand

I got you, you've got me
I don't care what people might say
I know you know
I've got you alwaysYou gotta schedule vacations in your five-year plan
You gotta schedule celebrations in your five-year plan
You gon' have several revelations in your first five days
In your first five minutes, have your first five fans
For like forty-five minutes, take your first shift break
There's no time for impatience in your five-year plan
You got time for hesitation in your five-year plan
A lot of shit came at you in a five-year span
If you followed your flight plan, you'd be right here prayin'
Eyes closed, right now sayin', Lord of Lords
I know you gave abundantly, even gave up your son for me
No need for sacrifice in my plans
And I love to say your name, it come from my diaphragm
I just had to scare 'em off and draw a line in the sand
Anything you gave to me, they couldn't pry from my hands
Anything you gave to me, I know it's right for my brand
I know shortcuts cut short long runs
I seen niggas on one try the wrong one
Get trunked, sing the same song, Ken Jeong swung
Giant mistakes on fee fi foenem
Probably keep both of 'em, you got time for missteppin'
Time for them weapons, formed but not prosper
Time for them lessons, time for them blessings
Time for first, second, third, fourth impressions
Time for reflection, time for confession
Time will heal all, let's get a good stretch in
Things that's in the way of my goal
Things that eat away at my heart
That's just, just the way of the art
I know that I had a good start
I wish I could play a guitar
I, I  know that I'm gonna be
Better than I ever was
I told 'em they gonna see
I just want everybody ta
Love, love, love
Time has, time has come
Time has, time has come
To be who you are
Be who you are
Time has, time has come
Time has come
To take it all in, take it all in
Take it all in
The time has come
Time has come, time has come
Know who you are
Know who you are
The time has come
Time has come, time has come
To take it all in
Who's that in the back of the back?
You deserve a plaque and a pat on the back
I see y'all in your suits like the Cat in the Hat
With the clean black slacks and the jacket to match
Found your way back like a Cadillac with the flats
Came around like satellite, down like a battle axe
Why do you word insure me like it's Aflac?
I don't know, why do birds Burt Bacharach?
Why do worms prefer habitats?
Why did it occur where it happened at?
Why ain't no apples in Apple Jacks?
Are you ready for The Big Day?
I don't know, but you're well on your way
Somebody hurt you really bad
And you don't know what to do
And you think how so many people live through things like this
Sounds crazy but it's true
You can get over anything, almost
I'm telling you the truth
The one thing left to say is...EarlOnTheBeat, EarlOnTheBeat 
Chance , Boat 
Chance , Boat 
Chance , Boat 
Fed up with niggas, they frontin' like loans
Fuckin' this model lil' bitch from the back 
In the tinted Maybach, almost broke all her bones
She don't do Backwoods, only do bones 
Sometimes a cone if she out on the golf field
It was white like snow, it stood out at the show
I made 250 cash in three days on the low
I was out in L.A. walkin' 'round like the po'
Got a stick in the coat 'cause these niggas be on me
I love what I do, but this shit make you phony
I can't trust a soul 'less that boy really know me
You don't really know me, you hang 'round the homies
Shame in the game, no, I don't work for Sony
This ain't overnight, I move like politicians
Someone snatch my chain, they'll be hopin' and wishin'
My life is non-fiction, I sold out the Brixton
I shot a AK, that shit sound like a Braxton
On the west side where them boys really taxin'
 Yep,  yep
My newest bitch, she a work of art, I could sell her at an auction
Bought a new watch and that shit dipped in frostin'
I take the play, I'm Randy Moss-in'
I am no weirdo
I am a Martian
The play was a option
My tape was a caution
I coulda had plaques, I was too busy flossin'
Too busy crossin' the street, I got hits, I got drip like a faucet
This house is too little, it feel like a coffin
I go hit the club like the ball when I'm golfin'
I ball in the swamp with alligators
The house is too big, I got hella waiters
The nanny got stuck in the elevator
Just give me the key to the microwave
The safe is too big to hide the safe
The wave is too big to ride the wave
To ride the wave, to ride the wave 
I keep on all of my VVs in the shower
I'm blacker than Howard, I'm blacker than Morehouse
I'm blacker than Power
I'm blacker than black people watchin' Black-ish while they TiVo-ing Power
I'm back in Atlanta, I'm back at the house
I'm back at the crib, I'm back in the South
This all makin' sense like the back of the couch
You start actin' up, you get smacked in your mouth
Smacked in your mouth by a nigga rockin' six rings
24 karat, all gold, like a young king
These niggas playin' both parts like Regina King
Dick in the spleen, turn the bitch 'to a young fiend
No limit, AmEx, I don't carry no cash
I don't fuck raw 'cause these hoes make me nut fast
Top of the year, tax came, I was too sad
Coulda built a whole middle school out in Trinidad
Funny guy probably goin' to hell 'cause he sin bad
Think like a billionaire, two-seater, tryna fit the whole VIP in there
Shouldn't even be in here, why it had to be in here, fuckin' up the scene in here
I don't take pills, got bills like a white man
Buyin' every whip, I ain't got time to finance
Life like a movie, I was born at the Sundance
Buddy actin' up, somebody come and get mans
I'ma take a bitch for a week to the villa
All-black ski mask gripped like a killa
New whip doin' doughnuts, J Dilla
Went to Panera in a Panamera
Eeny, meeny, miny, moe 
Black Rolls Royce like John Doe 
Ayy, got him on the tip toes 
Sit a little high like twenty floors
Sit a little high like nosebleed 
Always ten toes like both feet 
You come into to the room, make the hoes leave
I come into the room, make 'em holy
I run through the city like the red line
Young nigga 'bout to make headlines
Sun-Times facin' that deadline
Bout to start makin' up stories like bedtime
Old mayor 'bout to face fed time
Age him like red wine, me, I'ma age like water
When it's all done, I'ma head to the Father 
'Til that day, take the Benz to the barber
Got a chop her off the top, got a date with your daughter 
Your house not a home like Luther Vandross
You always outside like Superman's drawers
But get in that car, that little ass car
It's a little too far, can't Uber, can't walk
Good guy probably get in Heaven through the side door
Ridin' through the city on my high horse
Big, big TEC on my body like a cyborg
Leave you on a low note, leave you on a high court
I'm a lil' yachty on a big boat
Check the temperature like big toe
Got good aim with the sig
Got a major laser like Diplo
 Heeeee
Boat, Chance
Boat, Chance
Boat, ChanceIt could be 
Everyday 
Everyday, it could be 
It could be wonderful 
Wonderful 
Hey

It could be wonderful
It could be wonderful everyday 
Everyday, it could be, everyday 
Hey, it could be everyday 
It could be 
Every day when you're walking down the street 
Everybody that you meet
Has an original point of view
And I say hey! 
Heyyy! 
It could be so wonderful
Everyday it could be, it could be
It could be wonderful, wonderful
Heyyy! 
It could be 
It could be wonderful 
It could be wonderful, everyday 
It's a simple message
And it comes from the heart
Believe in yourself
For that's the place to start
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other
And I said Hey!
What a wonderful kind of day
We can learn to work and play
Get along with each other
Listen to your heart
Listen to the beat
Listen to the rhythm
The rhythm of the street
Open up your eyes
Open up your ears
Get together and make things better
By working together
Its a simple message
And it comes from your heart
Believe in yourself
As thats the way to start
I'm gonna get by when the going get rough

I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down

I'm gonna get by when the going get rough
I'm gonna love life 'til I'm done growing up
And when I go down
I'ma go down swinging
My eyes still smiling
And my heart still singingHeads bowed for the curly-haired sons of Abraham

Chance the Rapper, song singer, senior, bong steamer
Light up, Hot Wheels, locked up, wrong steamer
Dreamer, long Bimmers, our neighbors their, lawns greener
We wrestle with envy, then act up, John Cena
Chancellor Bennett, referred to as word chemist
The bourbon and slurred sentences is turning up burning bridges
Cigarette stained smile, all covered in sin
My big homie died young, just turned older than him
Getting hyped up off them bad bitches on it
Getting knocked up off a nigga, bad luck
Getting scared now with them IRS audits
All the tax money that I didn’t add up
That I didn’t get yet, but they think that I got it
Keep a long shirt so they think that I got it
And if they all dummy and a nigga get bodied
It was really, really ill, I know a nigga held up
Hell yeah I’ll always get a pic with y’all niggas
Word to my fans, all six of y'all niggas
I seen all the tweets and the tips from y’all niggas
Got hands for them niggas that pick on y'all niggas
Loving your love, an album to come
I bet that you love it, comes out in a month
Chance, the astounding class clown
That turned out to amount into something, 3001
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
Knock knock said the fist to the world
Shine sun through the mist and debris
Bang bang said the fist to the young
Silence from the lips of the free
Say something important, say something important
Make money the end of the week
But that shit coming soon, I’m getting hungry
Might sell out in a couple of weeks
But my crib they buckin’
And they just called Buddy, that’s lil bro
Even though last time we spoke
We was arguing, but we still stay close
Ask God to watch the squad
On God, battle niggas to the death, alright
Fuck your squad and the whole facade
I ain’t never scared of where a nigga reside
Extra mild sauce on the side, extra mileage on the ride
Express, I'mma grab my chain
Cause it’s extra violence all on the nine
Ten days, that’s an awful lot
Eleven squares in like fifteen minutes
Sixteens when that album comes
Spit twelve real quick for a listening picnic, igh!
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up
I count my blessings too often
My best friends on one hand
My sheep when I’m done here
Gotta get up, get up

No, you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl, who you want around?
I know I'm not that nigga that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where was you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, I'ma tell you that
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home
I know this sound crazy, but you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby 
You don't understand me, I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey, I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone, we should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Auntie Cam and all of them
And they act like Maury
They say, "Where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like Lena Horne in “The Wiz”
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some, "Don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby 
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family 
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the babyWhat to get the man who has everything?
Tryna fit myself into a schedule and a wedding ring
Tryna eat everything
I was raised, it come across my plate, then I better swing
Tryna turn Confederate flags into confetti strings
I'm tryna back up my baby mama like Kevin Federline
Heard they got some nice-ass houses out there in Beverly
Never leave where I came from
I just need me some stockings
And the chimney they could hang from
Photos so my kids can find out where they got their names from
Christmas cards so gorgeous, other families wanna frame one
Real talk, I need a front yard, a backyard
A side yard, a side yard, inside bar, a dry bar
Nine cars and a garage, and it's on hella acres
I'm tired of people visitin', takin' the elevator
Well, we'll keep the elevator
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Don't gifts get re-wrapped?
That shit could get sticky like tree sap
I gave you free raps, that shit sound like free facts
Which is 'bout as common as free blacks
Stuck like freeze tag from one of these random police stops
Look like the treetops soon as the breeze stops
And once the debris drops, the streets 400 degrees hot
Please, man, we needin' some freeze pops
What in the world for the man who has everything?
Man, West Chatham Park could use some better swings
Used to be disheveled, I went and shoveled everything
Tell Santa to show up to doors he never ring
He never ring
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
That's all I ask
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
That baby is a genius
Don't teach him 'bout Santa 'til you teach him 'bout Jesus
Don't take him out the snow to try to take him on beaches
I swear, it's enough leisure in this world to get lost
What's the point of gainin' chicken if you lose all the sauce?
What's the point of gainin' chicken if it can't get across?
Lost the cold hard cash, they said, "Damn, that boy soft"
Same niggas lost their souls in a fuckin' coin toss
I guess I cleaned up, Santa don't miss no names but I miss Fatimah
It's been a minute since I've seen her
Them the type of things I hate to bring up, just like the prenup
That shit be see-through like John Cena, Aquafina
But like the Christmas tape, there's things that I gotta get clear
Like my papa ask the same question every year
"What to get for my boy who has everything?"
I said, "I'll take anything but everything," you know?
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you
Love me forever, that's all I ask of you

Big ol' Birkin bag she could lean on like a crutch

I say, "Yop, you know you my favorite shooter"
Yop, bing-bing-bang-booka-booka

We run plays, this shit a sport

Screamin', "Fuck the other grass"
She want that gas and not that dirt
She want that cash and I'm like Turk
I want that cash, and she like work, work, work
I'm just tryna get to it in a new way
With the band on a beeper or the two-way
We could get on the Venmo, what's to it?
We could run just together, what's to it?

By the low, I come from the trenches, we was by the store
Baby, no, I don't wanna buy your love, but my heart is cold
Gotta roll, all my homies old and I keep 'em close
Lucid dream, ridin' that hemi thing, swear I do the most
Brand new fiend, she drink anything, she might need a Coke
Never sleep, gotta get to this bag, I ain't goin' broke
Wanna kick it with me, but I ain't got no legs, I been on the go

I've got plans to hug and kiss ya
I've  got plans to hug and hug and hug you

Let's go on the run
It's  time to hit the road
We got one place to go 
Peace poof
Meep-meep, I feel like Road Runner
I  get my feet loose
I got that Superman hidden under my cheap suit
Sittin', just waitin' for Lois to wanna leave too, me too
I swear we gotta get away, anywhere that we can
Just meet me by the water, I'll be there with the sand
And if it goes left, that's according to plan
Sometimes you gotta chop the wagon off of the band
She broke up with her boyfriend
The people wanna know what he said
They wanna know the way how
You can break her heart like that
Through it all, I could see someone with personality
Someone who doesn't think like me
Someone who doesn't feel like me
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo, doo-doo, doo-doo-doo-doo
I wanna run away now
Doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo-doo

Lot of matcha and lattes when it's gettin' late
The mattresses can inflate
Walk out like a zombie from the stu' and assimilate
Humans to simulate
Morning in the bed, close the lights and dim the drapes
Always Matt Damon when you come Jimmy Kimmel late
Tryna fill the shoes, Nick Cannon with rental skates
Pissed like urinal cakes

Turn the fur to thin air, it's a thousand degrees, set it free

Coming together in love

We could have a silent night
Long as I'm up by your side
You won't need them boots or the furs
Give it to you proper, yes sir
Stay the night, baby, here's a shirt
Let's get close and blame it all on the weather
Girl, you know you deserve so much better
Let's make a snowman and ball together

She on the pole, she Santa's helper
It ain't nothing no one can tell her

Hey, Ya! When the fuck you gonna grow up?
When that money gonna show up?
Thought that 10 Day shit would blow up
Got you stressed, ripping your 'fro up
Smokin' squares, fuckin' your throat up
And a nigga from your iPod in the party and they know ya
And your teachers wanna claim ya, they critically acclaim ya
Used to criticize your mistakes, "Mr. Bennett's Mr. Famous"
Mrs. Rownd just heard your mixtape, "the misogynistic mischief"
You the reason for the mishaps, and should keep coming up missing
You're a top dog; you the top, dog
They can't even catch up; you so hot, dog
And it feels good, and it feels dope
You still steal shit, cause you still broke
And you really wanna drop, really really hot
Shit that they really wanna cop, but they wouldn't give a fuck
If you won a Grammy, if you end up in the Hall of Rock
Then you end up in a hole from a hammy to the top
Got 99 problems, got a 100 to the drugs
I should finish up this verse, but you know I don't give a fuck
YOLO!
Yo-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh-Oh, YOLO 
Shouts out my juice, bitch, my cup runneth over
Bout now them suits fit, my cuffs button golden
So bitch suck my dick, igh, bitch, suck my dack
I been riding 'round in that steamer with that steamer in my lap
I swear I used to give a fuck, but now I give a fuck less
What do I think of success? What do you think of fuck fest?
You ever had a foursome? You ever been a suspect?
You ever passed the fuck out? You ever failed a drug test?
I learned from getting bumped that bumping Ye could make it be okay
All that jumping, dunking shit can't make a 3 go way
I been up inside the stu' for fucking three whole days
Yelling, "Fuck the cops, it ain't nothing to box"
So somebody pour me another shot like SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS
SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, SHOTS, Drop, drop, drop, drop
Give a fuck, fuck that-that Is you going, dot, dot, dot?
Like a lot, lot, lot, lot, do the fop, bop, bop, bop
Don't stop, stop, stop, stopAll
All, all, all
All the things
All the things, things
All that glitters is not gold
All, all, all, and all gold is not reality
Real is what you lays on me
How's everybody doing?
We were all that matters, family's all that matters
This is just business, see you right after
Nothing comes before ya, nothing else matters
All of this is for ya, you are all that matters
I dance around the darkness down on Billie Jean Road
If I ain’t toured then we still’d be broke
Thought I got the formula, bon appetite
I got a beat in case my baby baba ever leak
Wise beyond my years but way behind my peak
You gotta eat, this a step to my princess
Point of interest, fourth and inches
Hallelujah, the kid grew up, the crowd cheered the child
Booya, mic drop, I walk home
 + The Dells]

All these fancy things 
I'll tell you that all, my weight in gold

In this part of my life, I'm growing up and I- and I wanna, I wanna do this the right way, go, go out of it, grow out of it, in the best way possible, so thank you guys who's been there thus far, and it's only gonna get better...

Yellow in hue, standing in plain sight
This caught my eye and spoke to my soul
"What a good deed," I said
Thank you, Father, Father
Thank you, Father, Father
They built a town on top of a hill
It was yellow in hue, 'cause it was bursting with light
And that's when I caught a view, what a magnificent sight
'Cause it reminds me of You, I guess

Yooooo Yooooo Yoooo
Will we continue on
String along
We need time
You reach into the bowl of car keys
Making eye contact, as if to say 'hows that"
Are you fucking happy now
Grab his wrist and wriggle past me
As Jenny licks her lips
Time to teach a young dog tricks
And how to bow
Remember when you couldn't hurt me
We reached a breaking point
As you lit your joint and we crossed the severn bridge
For the addy and your cold out, splow me out
Again
And you kiss him
And I kiss her
And I love her
We all go home again
She know my favorite flavor skittles
She know everything we argue 'bout
Where everything in our crib at
And every time you walk up out
She know whenever we fighting and whenever we cool
But my favorite thing she know is that she'll never be you
She know she'll never have her song, She know she'll never have my son
She know she'll never have your pain, she'll never have to have a hunch
She know everyone that I lie about, heard every freaking word
She know everything you wonder bout, and it hurt her even worse
Who'd you rather be?Merry Christmas, lil' mama

Merry Christmas, lil' mamaI've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
Move to the neighborhood, I bet they don't stay for good, watch
Somebody'll steal daddy's Rollie, call it the neighborhood watch
Pray for a safer hood when my paper good, watch
Captain Save-a-Hood, hood savior, baby boy
Still getting ID'd for Swishers 
Still with the Save Money militia 
Trapped in the middle of the map
With a little-bitty rock and a little bit of rap
That, with a literary knack
And a little shitty Mac, and like literally jack
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
They murking kids, they murder kids here
Why you think they don't talk about it? They deserted us here
Where the fuck is Matt Lauer at?
Somebody get Katie Couric in here
Probably scared of all the refugees
Look like we had a fuckin' hurricane here
They'll be shooting whether it's dark or not
I mean, the days is pretty dark a lot
Down here, it's easier to find a gun
Than it is to find a fucking parking spot
No love for the opposition, specifically a cop position
'Cause they've never been in our position
Getting violations from the nation, correlating, you dry snitchin'
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I've been riding around with my blunt on my lips
With the sun in my eyes and my gun on my hip
Paranoia on my mind, got my mind on the fritz
But a lot of niggas dyin', so my 9 with the shits
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
I know you scared
Me too
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared too
It just got warm out, this the shit I've been warned 'bout
I hope that it storm in the mornin', I hope that it's pourin' out
I hate crowded beaches, I hate the sound of fireworks
And I ponder what's worse
Between knowing it's over and dyin' first
'Cause everybody dies in the summer
Wanna say your goodbyes, tell them while it's spring
I heard everybody's dying in the summer
So pray to God for a little more spring
I know you scared
You should ask us if we scared too
If you was there
Then we'd just knew you cared tooKid: "I'd like to know what you're going to do when you retire from boxing?"
Ali: "I really don't know, I want to say something right here this might make you all think. When I get out of Boxing or when I'm through, I want to do all I can to help people. What's the best thing I can do? Get ready to meet God."
Back in time
I lost track of time
Rolling on the road
Christmas Eves and Valentines
Seemed like the days before
I came I went I did well
I did I really meant well
But I almost missed my beat
So thank you for saving me a seat
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no where better, better
God is watching me
God don’t praise me because I beat Joe Frazier
God don’t give nothing about Joe Frazier
God don’t care nothing about England or America
As far as wealth
It’s all his
He wants to know how do we treat each other
How do we help each other
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock 
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock
Steady hold
I've grown weary and old
We're as close as we'll ever be
I was gone I had places to be
And of course you're in the last place I look
I swear ain't no where greater
Ain't no where brighter
Ain't no where better, better, better, better
Ain't no one prettier
Ain't no one wiser
Ain't no one better, better
And I'm still standing here
Standing still
I won't be moved
How used to do when
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock 
I was a rock
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rock 
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock 
I was a rock and roller
Back in my day 
But now I'm just a rock
I was a rockDear Theodosia, what to say to you?
You have my eyes. You have your mother’s name
When you came into the world, you cried and it broke my heart
I’m dedicating every day to you
Domestic life was never quite my style
When you smile
You knock me out, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
You will come of age with our young nation
We’ll bleed and fight for you, I'll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you, I’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Yeah, you’ll blow us all away
Someday, someday
Oh Philip, when you smile I am undone, my son
Look at my son. Pride is not the word I’m looking for
There is so much more inside me now
Oh Philip, you outshine the morning sun, my son
And when you smile, I fall apart
And I thought I was so smart
My father wasn’t around
My father wasn’t around
I swear that I’ll be around for you
I’ll do whatever it takes
I’ll make a million mistakes
I’ll make the world safe and sound for you…
Oooh
We’ll bleed and fight for you
We’ll make it right for you
If we lay a strong enough foundation
We’ll pass it on to you
We’ll give the world to you
And you’ll blow us all away
Someday
Someday
Yeah you'll blow us all away
Someday
Oooh
Someday
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Whatever it takes
Ooh, so make
The world safe and sound for you
Someday, someday
Someday, someday
The world safe and sound
I'll make the world safe and sound
For you
Someday
Someday
We'll make the world safe and sound for you
Someday
You will know you're strong enough foundation
One day
SomedayChristmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
When Jesus, was a little boy 
They tend to forget about love
Let's get right back to joy
Baby, let's light up the Christmas tree
Spike the eggnog with the Hennessy
Spread the love that heat the coldest winter
Jingle Bells is all I could remember
'Tis the season we should spread the cheer
Christmas caroling, door-to-door
Can't forget just what we do this for
When can we can get back to the joy?
Got some hot chocolate for you, baby
Silent nights, just hit me up
Can't tell me that you not my angel
We should make snow angel doves
Outside, lookin' Christmas and you just who I'm thinkin' of
Favorite time of year, why can't you feel the love?
Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
When Jesus, was a little boy 
They tend to forget about love
Let's get right back to joy
Why y'all always arguing and carrying on?
Christmas was meant for sharing a bond
Google "Chicago Bettie Jones", them kids buried their mom
Sometimes I dream of moving a spot where cops carry batons
So I could visit with jet lag, lose all my checked bags
To wake up in my old room with beauties from Jet Mag
I hate when y'all talk about bail money
Who go to jail for me and who tryna steal from me?
I got that Sister Carolyn Jenkins KOK covenant love
I'm covered at the door, the cover's the blood
Bungalow Jungle that housed a thousand fistfights that humble my buds
Couple birds that make me wonder what was
Won't let the lawyers destroy us
The Pontius Pilates judge my bundle of joys
I know my bronze is gorgeous
Know who the birthday boy is
I'm on my 773 love
Weaponized free love, 7979 
Christmas, this Christmas, is a time for joy
When Jesus, was a little boy 
They tend to forget about love 
Let's get right back to joy 
JoyLook that way, nigga
Pussy  ass nigga
You watch out

You boys sure love to fight, all the time
All you do is fight, fight, fight
What you fighting over now? Money? 
Shut up, ain't nobody ask you nothin', fat boy
Goodness
These two are brothers, you family
This isn't what family looks like
Now, I came here to get a photo of my boys on their big day
Now, we could wait for this picture to develop and remember today looking like this
Or, we can go out and try this again
Go fix yourselves up
Fat boy, move in, somebody can try to put their arm around you
Come on... everyone...
Slide yo ass overYou are my fire 
The one desire 
Believe when I say
I want it that-that-that way
Ooh, hot stuff all over my nachos
Walkin' like a taco
Drivin' over potholes 
Hotter than a pot roast
Fingers on my hot chips
Red-handed, c'mon man, now I'ma need some chopsticks
Quiet, leave the house when I'ma need another outfit
Flyer than a maggot on a wall inside a cockpit
Speaking of desire, man you preachin' to the choir, man
My tongue is doin' fine, but the roof is on fire
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a heartache
Tell me why
Ain't nothing but a mistake
Tell me why
I never want to hear you say
I want it that way
The original, now it's hotThanks for filming this
I wrote this for you today
Chano A.K.A. Mr. Windy City
Remix!
I got the baddest chick on the planet
She ain't mixed but folks be askin' if she half Hispanic
She complain about the baby weight but I ain't panicked
Since she got pregnant she been showin' crack like bad mechanics
I rub her feet, I put in work like I was Robyn Fenty
The only chick that I hold as much is probably Kinsley
I sit with her and watch Black Ink and Being Mary
But never Love & Hip Hop, that shit get kinda scary
She stand about six feet, she used to hoop at 'Lane
I tried to stick her the other day and got my ankle sprained
I fell deep, tried to leave, but you know the way that you learn best
Is leavin' out the garage and get hit with that U-turn text
So if you got a girl and she sexy and she grown
Stay your ass at home 'fore you end up all alone
Leave the toilet seat down, always keep your phone
Ask my BM, she got her own ringtone, and she was singing...I've got a lady, a lady friend
I've got a lady friend
I've got a lady and that lady is my
I've got a lady, I've got, I've got a lady
And that lady is my friend
I've got, I've got a lady for a friend
I'm your buddy, I'm your little bro
I'm a stuffed animal
I'm a cuddle, not a dildo
I'm a love anecdote
Was I always taller than ya?
Will I always call ya back?
I'mma always wrongly answer
Always almost caught ya trap
Imaginary beneficiary been—
Away for so long, Ben & Jerry friend
Few compliments and a tear wipe
I'm the best man you're not marrying
And you know they ask about you
"What's up with your lady?"
I tell 'em, "You're just, you're just
You're just gorgeous"
You're just a lady friend, a lady friend
For a friend, for a friend
What would you do?
For for a friend
What would you do for a friend?Come on we gon' do it 
Come here
You know how we do it
Kick, kick, foot down 
Kick, kick, don't look down 
Take a step back, come back around
Who taught you how to step?
Go ahead, go ahead
Know this Christmas, baby
I can't let this song come between friends
If I'm part of your holiday plans
Let's roll down Lake Shore Drive
Let's dance, on down Michigan Ave and hold my hand
Take a red line from 95th to the End
Let it snow, let it snow now
Don't skip the Über, I'ma pick you up
Everywhere I'm going, anywhere witcha
I'm gonna get money till it brinks the truck
Will you be my honey in love, we get stuck
We've been through problems, we've been test enough
Drinks to the sky, we gettin' fucked up
'Tis ain't the season without the one you love
If I'm your Santa, just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney babe
Turn your fireplace off
Who got your hand?
Can I dedicate to this last dance?
When was the last time you got romanced?
Here's a present for you
Come on we gon' do this
Come on we got this
Come on, come on
It goes kick, kick, foot down
Kick, kick, don't look down
Take a step back, turn around
Who taught you how to step?

Take a little break, come back 'round
Who taught you how to step?
Who taught you how to step?
If I'm your Santa, just call me Santa
Slide down your chimney babe
Turn your fireplace off
The weather done got me in the spirit

But 'til then girl, you're all to me

Excuse me, excuse me, uh, uh
Garçon, yeah, boy I'm talkin' to you
Come  here, give me one of them things
You old enough to drink, ain't ya?
Now, you know I got to do this
I'd like to make a toast to this young man
Come on, give it up, ladies and gentlemen
Give it up, come on, hahahahaha
Look at him, this is the future
This is a guy who literally never ceases to surprise me
The decisions he makes
Are not necessarily the decisions I would have made
Or anybody with some sense
But what I can say is: the boy is fearless
He's ambitious and he's a honest man
Look, he's grown, really
Got his lady with him, makin' himself a lil' money, look like
We see the success, but what's next?
I mean, we're proud
But you can't just pack it all up and start all over
It works here 'cause you got us
The support here is what made ya
This boy's a prime example, hm
Of countin' your eggs before they hatch
Got a lil' lucky, now he up and ready to take over the whole globe
Look at him, the kid's got big, big plans
And I hope they all work out, I really do
But do you ever really think about how it's s'posed to all work out?
Do you have health insurance? A retirement plan?
And you need to start savin' money, right? Huh?
Uh, and he gon' need a car
And you need to pay me that money you owe me
And you need a wife
And you need Jesus
Oh, and you need to be a vegan
Don't forget about that veganism, that's that 2019, it's almost 2020
You need to stop doin' that Percy pillYou can look me in my face
I ain't got no worries  x3
See them shroomies keep me up
So I ain't got no worries  x3
You see money right there
Yeah that's  right there
Yeah that's  right there
And we ain't got no worries
You see pussy right there
Redbone mangos right there
See them shroomies right there
We ain't got no worries
D. Rose on that ass, that means back again
I hit my Zan so hard
Man, I've been practicing
I'm going straight to the league, and not by accident
Don't get your ass kicked in
I'll hoop in Shaqs and Timbs

Hello Hell and Heaven, you haven't heard the half of it
Have at it half-happy
30-something year old, broke graduate

L.A Reid like, "Who's that?
Jimmy Iovine like, "Who's that?
Whole world like, "Who's that?
Whole hood like ‘dude ass’

Unreluctant optimist, most poppingest
Got popular,try topping this, Triceratops
BJs from baby bopping bitches
Throat lozenges
Massaging it, no touching it
Okay, touch on it
But don’t rush on it
Ration it, passionate
While imagining me smashing it

They ain’t give my nigga no jury, so I don’t give no nigga no mercy
When my little fucking brother rap better than you

You rap veterans you, my nerdy brethren you

Waitin' on winter again
He needs help

Old man drinkin' by the corner
Tryna find somewhere warmer
Some place that he can get warmer tonight
Winter's coming
Winter's coming

When I was your craving and only this mattered
This jingle bell sanctified, sugared in batter
Our heathenous appetite, ever and after
Like Christmas will save us and bathe us in rapture
Mr. Happy, Mr. Matrimony
Mr. Half-A-Block-Away-From-Stony
I love you
There's something hauntin', dauntin' 'bout your presence
Casper essence, ghost of Christmas past
Phantom of unraveling his laugh
Opera, string quartet
Curtain's up, but the whole room darkened up
I know winter was callin' you
Me baby, my baby
He Chris with the Kringle in rooms filled with ladies
They lovin' his presence, a blessin' a blessin'

Christmas is here
Bring your lady, chill
Zero below
Only in the door
Pretty ring, I know
But she hit the phone
Just what she own
Salt on the streets
Timbs on my feet
Best time to give
Chi-Town it is
Fam all around
Trying to run the town
Love how it smells
Bucket full of wings
Trying to give about five golden rings
Balling for the chills
Drinks on, get your smoke on
Winter break, no school zone
Footwork, yeah, get your step on on
Merry, merry christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
Jeremih on the beat
Lighting up a tree
7 nominees
I cannot believe
Pray for '79th
Pray for '79th
Ford City all the way to over East
I've been going in
Snow inside my Timbs
Frozen all my limbs
Big salt truck
Now I'm flying in
Where you wanna land?
Million pair again
Big boss bucks, baby
Finna hit the plaza
Cop a couple plasmas
You don't want no asthma
Mild sauce my wings
Nights at the rink
These are a few of my favorite things
Merry, merry christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the Midwest
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is what we call a Chi-Town Christmas
This is Chi-Town, this is a Chi-Town christmas
This is how we do it in the MidwestLove is the life 'round here
We're never done
Part time love
Life ain't been 'round here in a minute
Here ain't been 'round my whole life
Mike ain't spin 'round in a minute
The sand just dropped for the last time
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
Light ain't been 'round here in a minute
Darkness been swallowed it up
Chaos been 'round for a minute
Marketed, bottled it up
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself first
I ain't been 'round here in a minute
But here ain't been round a whole lot
My flesh looked through the peephole
Seen his people, sealed the keyhole and kept the door locked
Life can't be here, indefinite
Not another minute 'round here
Why can't a minute be spent in a town that's nowhere round here?
But wear that fake smile like a cape
But wear that fake smile like a cape
Save yourself firstI've been looking for somethin' I'm gon' find
What should I do in the meantime?
Say you can't look for it, it'll find you
Do you feel the same too?
Something that I ain't said in a long time 
Front line, I was fighting for you
Angels sing in the choir for you
If you want it
Favorite poem, I wrote it for you
Know you know it
Turned it into a song for you
Days go by, I try
To bottle these tears inside
Here's one more cry, I cry
Single-handedly, I been taking real good care of me
That shit in my blood like liquor or Cherokee
You know black folk, we don't go to no therapy
Tell 'em keep they two cents, give it to charity
Go H.A.M. like Sara Lee
Watch it all go down the drain like merrily, merrily
Legally blind to my friends, I see 'em barely, barely
They say, "Let me holla at you," guess that's why they call 'em holidays
But Christmas feel like Simba on a Father's Day
I'm supposed to be the strongest, the oldest
The leader of our country-ass family
The POTUS, the podium come up to my shoulders
I'm short and I'm shook and I'm broken
My favorite voters can't show up to the polls
And you still don't want me to show emotion and I refuse
'Cause I love you, that's why, 'cause I want to, that's why
'Cause I miss you, that's why, 'cause I miss you, that's why
Know I said that was the last one last year
But we both know you deserve one last tear
Days go by, I try
To bottle these tears inside
There's one more cry, I cry
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Ooh, ooh, ah, ah, ah
Every time I feel the grace, it feel like God just said "Hello there"
Never been to Heaven but I know I wanna go there
Carry me through cancer when my auntie didn't have no hair
Shook me when she left us but my faith did not go nowhere
I've been banging on my chest when I cry, flex when I cry
Beat a nigga's ass when I cry, dance when I cry
Feel like I'm the man when I cry, I won't let it go
Don't hold it against me
My Auntie Kim told me punch you in your motherfucking mouth if you lie on me
Can't no pussy ass nigga ever never get down on me
079, they count on me
Tears raining down on me, to the ground on me
Me and God playing tips 'cause he never gonna bounce on me, won't bounce on me
Tryna find a button-up shirt for your funeral
Tryna find a bunch of answers only you would know
I'm just tryna play my part like a movie role
Need a bitch face-down like it's Yu-Gi-Oh!
I ain't tryna act hard, life's hard enough
God knows my heart when the cards is tucked
So I ain't never been scared of no groupie ho
Though I walk through the valley like Coolio
I've been up for days, I ain't cry for years, bitch, I'm fucking serious
Let 'em dress where I get my dress, are you okay, sis?
Yeah, I'm lit, had to let 'em live, had to let 'em live
See you at the crib, see you at the crib
Favorite poem, I wrote it for you
Know you know it
Turn it into a song for youWho keeping it real? Lil B, Chance the Rapper
West side, man, yeah man. West side out, west side, know what I'm saying
Shoutout to all the beautiful ladies man
What's up man
]
We rare, we rare, 
Rare, rare  feel me?
Out of thin air, I made it to a new thang 
Pull up in that Bruce Wayne
You should see me change, we rare 
 Call me so rare in this bitch, I'mma tell you about me and I'mma tell you 'bout this
Lil B for lil boss, they know my stilo
Coming through, man I swear I got a kilo

What's up Kanye West man, you the bro

On my Bulls and Sox and Bears game

I asked 'em "what's mooshoo?"
She said "you hungry?",  I'm ugly
That shit actually goes crazy
Cos I feel like muh'fuckers don't understand uh, the reason why we rare is cos everybody's beautiful
And that shit just makes me rare and so that's why I'mma just keep dancing in the studio
And I feel like, nigga, hear me dancing in the..
I like my shit uncooked, I like my shit just raw
Everything that you thought I wrote, I just thought
I be coming off the top, that is my talk
Top of my head at the end of my black afro
What I do, what I do when I step in the club
Everybody give me dap, bitches give me love
And the bartender, at the end he just give a hug
He say "thank you for dropping fifty million thousand dubs"
When I'm in the club, niggas love me so much
Chano, man I swear we fuckin' just so tough
So when I say I'm, I'm, I'm rare
I just mean I'm like Jordan when I'm catchin' some air, cos

Pull up in that Bruce Wayne

We need highlights for a nightlight, we need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks
Bombs bursting in air
Oh say
Can you see America's face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some more for us
Save the date
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bobs and Cousin Skeeters
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
You want to see a hero? You need a teammate
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go
We're right by your side
And now that we made it
Came in with an angel around us
Put it all in what we doing next
Ooo you know we can't go without it
Never go alone it never lasts
So we get to make what we want
Home has come at last
Yeaaa
People, people, we the people would like you to know that wherever you go

Wanna give all I have
I'm so grateful
I can fight through the pain
'Cause I fight in your name
You're my shelter
I'm so grateful for you
For my house, for my home
For my chair, for your throne
For your love, for your mercy and grace
For a job or a dub or a odd or a slug
Or a bone or whatever you say
Hop in the whip and turn the heat up
Turn that seat hotter than a teacup
Please tell the car to turn the beat up
Evergreen Plaza, had the black Santa
Coconuts across the street, get my CD's up
Shout out Meechy, Peanut, LaTiara
Used to buy my snow cones, pay ya back tomorrow
Every time I go home, hear a bunch of sorrows
Grass is always muddy at the other party
Drive down to Blue Island for that flavor
Where they ain't scared to say the name of the Savior
Oh, we got some healing, got some blessings, got some favors
We got some gifts, we on the list for good behavior
Give you whatever you want
Ain't that what the family for?
All I know, all I want
Be around the family more
Be there whenever you want
You know what the family for
All I want, all I want
Be around the family more
My cousins not soft, one skippin' frosh-soph
One finally grew up, cut the block off and cut his locks off
One of 'em passing all her classes, now pass the hot sauce
Never become one of those knockoffs that rather not talk
I know I look just look my auntie, 
I'ma keep it funky, talk too much like Donkey
On my back like monkey 
On my line like laundry, she keep it a hundred
I'm the biggest brother, biggest cousin, big ol' nigga, big folks
Just hit my jack like Peter Pan, that shit don't never get old
They introduce some evidence, my homie might never get home
That's why we screamin', "Fuck the president" like Marilyn Monroe
Give you whatever you want
Ain't that what the family for?
All I know, all I want
Be around the family more
Be there whenever you want
You know what the family for
All I want, all I want
Be around the family more
Wanna cry, wanna laugh

You got something that belongs to me
Your body language says it all
Despite the things you said to me
Who is this that got you all gassed up?
Changin' your opinions on me
I was only gone for the last two months
But you don't have the time to wait on me
I tried with you
There's more to life than sleeping in and getting high with you
I had to let go of us to show myself what I can do
But that just didn't sit right with you
And now you're tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Now you're throwing it back in my face, on purpose
Now you're throwing dirt on my name, on purpose
And you don't feel no way, you think I deserve it
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
I've stopped listenin' to things you say
Cause you don't mean them anyway
Feel a way, feel a way, feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things my way
Instead of the other way
We need to breathe
There's more to life than hearing stuff and being mean to me
We had to let go of us to show ourselves what we can be
But that just didn't sit well with me
Tryna make me feel a way, on purpose
Throwing dirt on my name, in public
You don't feel no way, on purpose
I'm messing up all of Drake's words, on purpose.. careful
Careful
Be careful
Be careful
You could never be too careful
Keep ya head away from windows
Keep your arms inside the ride
Trust me with ya body, trust me with ya life
Banging on the windows, baby come inside
Certainly in trouble, maybe you should hide
I'mma tell you like
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Don't you look up to me, don't trust a word I say
Don't you end up like me, if you learn one thing today
Feel a way, feel a way, young nigga feel a way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way
Feel a way, feel a way, young parents feel this way
Maybe we just should have did things this way
Instead of the other way
Instead of the other way

Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my christmas list
Copped a new toy, it can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing babe run a couple blocks with me
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my christmas list
Copped a new toy, it can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing babe run a couple blocks with me
Can't wait till I get home yeah 'tis the season
Greens and them hamhocks
Yeah where's the seasoning
Hope that aunty come wrap Santas gifts yeah
Hope that none her fam wasn't round to see that
I saw mummy kissing Santa Claus
They snuck in and out the halls
On my wrist my neck deck the halls
If I ain't say nun' no one else does
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy, it can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing babe run a couple blocks with me
Grown but I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy, it can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing babe run a couple blocks with me
Growing up we had it hard
Santa rarely at the door
Daddy worked to keep us warm
But you know we just wanted more
But look at how far we ran, look what I am
Daddy used to work that Streets & San
Put a black man in the White House damn!
Name me one teacher that was right about Chance
Right about Kim or right about Cam
Right about Jan. I write down plans
Put it on the drawing boards like y'all kids
And get it done if not right now when?
We was broke now we not now
Santa loud when he knock now
Getting bands like The Rock now
Shaking hands with Barack now
Smoking woods like a chimney
Green faces all grinchy
Tryna give her that Disney
Merry Christmas lil' Kensli
Grown But I feel like a big kid again
Got everything that I wanted on my Christmas list
Copped a new toy, it can't fit under the Christmas tree
If you ain't up to nothing babe run a couple blocks with me

Hey Genius family
Via Twitter, Chance expressed his desire to keep this song hidden from the public. Like he said, he has no labels, publishers or legal team to help him handle these situations. Let's honor his wish and not share the song until HE wants it to be sharedSun don't shine in the shade
Birds don't fly in a cage 
Even when somebody pass away
They don't ever really go away
That's just the waves
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay
Waves don't die
Ay Ay Ay
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
Ohh, yeah Ohh, yeah
Wanna see the bricks' right
Tired of getting swished like
They want me on the bench likeIt's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping
Later on downtown
Is you down with that? 
Is you down with that? 
Is you down with that?

Is you down with that? 
Is you down with that? 
Is you down with that?

I been saving all year to spend some M's
If you had a twinny twin, I spend again
She love it when I light the tree
It's that time of year
On her Insta taking pics now Michigan
Big wheelin' ferris wheel like Navy Pier
Don't you vibe with a nigga
Get that show you right
Take you round Chicago get that show you right
Hit up Chano get you finished with the 309
I must say that this time around
Feels better with you, yes it's true
It's better when you hug me
When it's snowing down
Ain't no fireplace burning
On this side of town
Don't throw salt on 'em
Angels on the ground
Do a little window shopping

Chatham ain't get no gifts, shit, Chatham ain't get no wish
So Chano gon' take that list, pssh, we ain't no bitch!
I am thumbing through a check for some kids from the south side
We don't get respect on the black or the brown side
Rats in the school, ain't no class in the pool

Haven't you heard?
New album alert
This shit loud as the purp
We out in the burbs  
Out of the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt, a mountain emerged
A willow was birthed
It's alright, I wept, I prayed on it, slept on it, wait on it 
Just flame up with Tunechi, you know that you Gucci
Just somethin' to say on it  
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney 
My pop's in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofie 
I ain't no goofie
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can't introduce me 
This ain't a movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement
And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nanananana
Man I ain't no lame 
I know the game
I know my daddy , you can tell when I speak I got his name 
I'm on my business 
I'm not in the business, I'm not a prisoner
I got my soul 
I flaunt, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hitters 
Reese and Justin a phone call away
They say no delay, and ándale! they on the way
Catch me in the city on the Divvy with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Need a little scratch but the tours itch
Proud to go where the pot of gold too rich
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with you 
Ye ain't know open mics open doors did you? 
I ain't no stain, I am for free
I am a promise, capital "P"
And they say nanananana nanananana
Nanananananananana nanananana nananananaYeah, welcome to this beautiful mixtape

I got my wings flyin', bitch I'm like a Red Bull 
I knock niggas out the game, bitch this shit is full
I'm not full, I'm still hungry and shit

You feel me? 
That's why we so serious
These mothafuckas gotta stop, bitch I'm like a period
Or a comma  'cause these mothafuckas
Gotta take a pause or somethin' 
I might hit 'em with the llama for frontin' 
These mothafuckas gotta stick with me
Cause I don't know nobody but I know Lil B
And I don't hate nobody but I love BasedGod
It's mothafuckin' Chance the Rapper, what's up my Chi?

Til I come in, hocus pocus, with the dopest
Shit, halitoshis, I spit the grossest
Now I gotta spit ashy then gross assist, oh
Grocery shoppin' for my mama and daughter
I'm feelin' like I shouldn't have involved her
But now I'm movin' too quickly
Believe it or not, I'm Mr. Ripley, talented too!
Comin' through like the afterwards school
Afterwards what they have at school
Nothin' leftover so I came back to the land
With my homie Lil B and half of my bands
We did it different than the Xans
No sleep, stayin' up real late with my mans
And out in Chicago droppin' shit off the top
They thought after Surf this shit would just stop
What's they problem? What-what's they problem?
I'm comin' through, I had to dissolve 'em
Like acid to bases
They want me to go back to Acid, the basic
Shit, that's just tasteless
Now I'm flippin' it up like the Taste did this year in Chicago when they started chargin' for tickets
Ayy, shout out to the hood
They ain't gon' keep chargin' for tickets
If they don't let us in then we're chargin' the bridges
They tried to charge like Tar with the bridges
Haha! I went to school with my sisters
And speakin' of my sisters
I got Fatimah Noname Gypsy comin' through with the spinners
What's up!?
Ayy it's Fatimah, Mrs. Noname Gypsy

On some Beyoncé shit, I'm hella equipped for...
Anything if you're ready, I'm heavy
Like Monique, that was a fat reference
Um... You can put me on the guest list
You can tell me that I'm next, bitch, and I'd be like, "Fasho I am!"
Sorry fam, I'm not a good freestyler
Ugh, I don't know what to say
I'm kinda crazy, kinda hazy, smokin' hazy
I'm off the top, I'm super lazy, hella Jay Z
But not Jay Z, I meant jaded, I'm faded
I be smokin' mad cigarettes
Uhh... I'm in a jet, I got a jetpack
I'm super Black like Obama

But it's... Chano, Mr. #1 Dubplate
All these niggas cupcakes, that's important update, yeah
But back to the matter at hand

Memories are fresh
Round my hometown
Ooh the people I've met
Are the wonders of my world 
Are the wonders of this world
Are the wonders of my world
She say she want to stay with the Bloods and Crips
Feel the front strips of inner-city cliques
Where free cunt strips and young blood drips
And kids fall through the holes of hollow gun tips
And you want to harm me, don't try to call me
You ain't gone calm me, you're slipping from my palm trees
Now baby please re-l-a-x
Together we 'bout as fly as LAX
And I don't want to have to call you my ex
Well babe, I don't want to have to call you collect
See, she say she got dreams to follow
How I'ma ever be her man, nigga, she wants to be a model
My sunshine in life got stole away
Once the Golden State took my gold away, Cali
You scold as you walk past her
No more truth lang, we only talk sarcasm
Truttin', outtin', need to be a model
Now you can catch me giving hickeys to beer bottles
Get it, cause I'm kissing the neck
Giving a heck for whether or not you give him respect
I know if you go, you just might glow
But if you leave, you could catch more than a cold
Bulimia, anorexia, you skip meals
You don't make the cut but that's how your wrist feel
Cause scripts rip slits in the hands of an actress
In the acting world, you'll find allies on the axis
You'll find actresses in alleys on their backs
With directors giving oral in return for a practice
Trees, trees, please don't leave
But trees will be changed when it rains, will they shout to you
We was kissing under a tree when I fell for you
I thought that you was real, I guess I couldn't tell the truth
Trees go knee-deep in the dirt
They reach for the sky but they're still down to earth
But you, you just leave like leaves in the autumn
Didn't think you would get on, get gone, and just out 'em
Doubt them and reroute them, not count 'em
I'd never leave you for the chance of an album
Your roots stay deeper, I can't de-weed ya
I can't walk away, away from this tree, uh
And as bad as I want to see you running back
I could never ever ever be your lumberjack, CaliNorth Face cold, let it snow
Rollie goals, let it snow
Say she cold, come on home
Let it go , let it snow
Where the hoes? Let's go sleigh
Door to door, not Mary Kay
Got some Js that's on the way
Tree lit up, Christmas Day 
Oh, I love this Christmas time again
Snowed in and we dining in
Plenty love, Valentine's and them
'Bout to make yo ass mines again
Ice you down, let me try again
Snowy winters, can we fly in them?
Sound like the wind chiming in
Love songs, check the time again
Play around, no skips
Mistletoe, your lips
I don't know St. Nick
But I got your gifts, don't trip, oh
We can't help the forecast
More love and more laughs
Tell your ex let it go
And let it snow, let it snow
North Face cold 
Let it snow 
Rollie goals 
Let it snow 
Say she cold 
Come on home 
Let it go , let it snow 
Where the hoes? 
Let's go sleigh 
Door to door

Got some Js that's on the way 
Tree lit up 
Christmas Day 
Canada Goose
Daddy threw Santa the oop
Land on the roof
Cut up some cantaloupe just for lil' Kensli, the world
Can't love you, I'm not a plant, I'm the root
The world love my fruit, had a cup of my juice
Nigga, I'm still free, tell me how much is you?
Black folk at the show, black car at the store
Black love ya if you love me, black heart if you don't
Black power, black privilege, my kids'll never go broke
Black party, black party, the kids just said they gonna vote
Black business, black Friday, they salty
Scared of going broke, scared it's gonna snow
North Face cold 
Let it snow 
Rollie goals 
Let it snow 
Say she cold 
Come on home 
Let it go , let it snow
Where the hoes? 
Let's go sleigh 
Door to door 
Not Mary Kay 
Got some Js that's on the way 
Tree lit up

Stealing lighters, taking chargers
Every painter ain't an artist
Every album ain't a target
I just had to supermark it
I just had to shoot the target
Put the flower in the pot
Put the pot in the bowl
Put the stove on the flame
Let it rock, let it roll
Get the water from the sink
Watch it grow, watch it grow
Watch it grow, watch it grow
Watch it grow, watch it grow

Lil' boys and girls wanna come and play?
Toy with the lights, Rudolph on the sleigh
Snow from the sky, midnight on the way
Santa down the chimney for the cookies on the plate
Joy and some cheers in the ghetto today
'Tis the season, give love away
Have yourself a very merry Christmas
Have yourself a very merry ChristmasI'm just a soul that borrowed the bod
I have no quarrel with God
Keep my eye on the sparrow until I'm sparrin' with Rod
I will not spoil when I'm hot
I'm just gon' boil this pot
Moistenin' soil and plant sequoias that's tall enough
That they foil your plot
I am not royalty or giant, just a boy with a rock
Employer of lawyers, boy oh boy, it ain't no boy in me, ma
The work is over, you should sit back and enjoy your seat, ma
I'm buyin' groceries and toys and baby toilet seats, ma
I'm s'posed to teach 'em and feed 'em and give 'em help when they're readin'
And give 'em hugs after beatings and give 'em love after love
I'm Hallmark and Walmart just for you
And if it fall apart or it's all dark, I'm a wall charger or a call card
Or a cab co, or a golf cart just for you
We a ballpark, just the two
You're a Gamestop, I'm a Paul Blart, just not two
Thinkin' back on my rap shit, my mini afro black shit
That na-na-na-na bo squad got my back shit
Nathan, Peter, Nico on my tracks shit]
Aiyo, what's up, what's up?
Let's keep it real, son, count this money
You know what I'm sayin'? 
Aiyo, put the Grants over there in the safe
You know what I'm sayin'?
‘Cause we spendin' these Jacksons
The Washingtons go to wifey, you know how that go
(I'm sayin' that's what this is all about right
Clothes, bankrolls and hoes)
You a bitch
And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch

And when I say bitch I don't mean a bitch
But speakin' of bitches I'm with your bitch
And you ain't on shit cause you'se a bitch

Focused on tying the knot

Who is you, is you the same?
You'se a lame
I'm you shit you'se a nuisance
Lose your life when I told you that you should hang

Raise a man
Thumbin' through like lasers when I laser beam
You'se a fuckin' loser and you chase it with some 
I need me some magic beans and a fuckin' stalker
So I could climb that bitch to the top of mount of lava
And the whole damn parkin' lot
But it be ridin', it be ridin' all my niggas just like Dennis
They be robbin', they be Rodman
I'm comin' through it pimpin'

A Ford car that I could ride through switch on the doors
Turn up the locks because niggas be trying to rob you

We need highlights for a night light
We need glory for a while
We want results, we want results
Hit our families, hit our folks, bombs bursting in air
Oh, say, can you see America face?
We share a pair of parents, took good care of the place
We just want narrators to pick up the narrative's pace
Put on a show for us, float for us
Make it easy, make some mo' for us
Save the day
We want a W, we tired of picking different sides
I got your jersey, just a different size
We all want you to be a buzzer beater
Find us a leader far from Silent Bob's and Cousin Skeeter's
Through the perilous fight, want you to be brave
We want us a hero, we need a teammate

It's not a joke, I gotta shout out everybody though real quick cause we gotta

Can I tell them something?
I wanted to let everybody know that as long as you understand God world, Man world could never hurt you, do you understand?
Like it could never hurt you, you could be in after curfew, you feel me?
You could have a growth spurt too, you could have, do you feel me?
You get older, but it's still gon' have to be a point where you reach a quota, that's you know, that desire at the end of every month
So while you sparkin' that blunt to this base tape, I want you to understand, we love you for real

Real political, real movin', you feel me? It's a real movement
Like I said we takin' a chance, it's our last chance
Lil B, Chance, let's get it
A Declaration of IndependenceAh, so I think by now you may be confused as to what we're doing
We're making an entire piece of content from scratch
Which is where the best things in life come, the best things in life come from nothing
And become something different, so, you know
This is an allegory to life, and life is an allegory to this shit, I guess
Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, what's next?
Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, Chano, what's next?
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon what's next?
Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon, Brandon what's next?
I tell them light, it's gonna shine on you
Tell 'em more, watch that shit shine on you
Woke up this morning, didn't know what's next
Then I read a text, asking me what's next
Sent back a text, said "mind your own"
When you find your home, go to sleep and dream your own
Dream, don't follow what it seems to me
Everything you see ain't what it seems to be
And I gotta hella dreams, hella dreams to speak
So I guess that that shit's meta, or just beta
And we spell it B-E-T-A, that means it's on trial
That means for a while, it won't be finished
But when that shit's finished, ah, just look at that finish
Ah, I'm still off that tone, but I still take care of business
Had to freak it up, had to mix it up, had to geek it up
Every week you know, you look online, hella leaks is up
Ain't no album coming out, ain't no shit coming, no, no soon
When I'm in the room and I'm lit and gone and I make the tunes
Go ahead B
I, I keep going and I'ma blast them
I'ma show these bitches that it's not all fashion
I don't wear these clothes for the fucking fashion
I wear clothes cause I'm fast and I'm hungry
I don't give a fuck about these niggas think I'm funny
I hold K's, A's and fucking dummies
I'm like in the fucking cut, I'm a fucking mummy
I got so much money I need a fucking mummy
I need help and shit because my health and shit is irrelevant
While I'm chasing this paper, I'm running so fast
I'm like chasing a laser, these niggas can't see me
I be chasing a waiter, these motherfuckers serve me
All looking for so many tips, these niggas just working me
You gotta understand this pain when you hear this beat
I'm like AK47, can't you hear the streets?
What's up keyboard kid? I got niggas underground that's doing four bids
They living twelve lives, felt like you was a soldier at the end of the night

And I'mma open my book, and y'all befinitely gonna read it
And I'll make sure y'all all about Lil B-zzy
It's Lil B, Chance I see ya

They don't know about them or me
Taking niggas, out the game for free
Keep it positives, you lames gonna see
That we not playing, chops in the air we gonna keep on spraying
Spraying for peace, man you know what I'm saying?
You know that's all we living for
Top of the window top of the elevator type shit
Looking through the window man, looking through the top of the roof you feel me?
We're just taking chances man

That's all we do every day man
It's your boy Lil B, all we do, you feel me?

All we're doing is free styling up
Real talk man, like I said man, it's your boy Lil B man, tell them to shut it down man

These motherfuckers look like history
I'm starting to feel like it's like them or me

We living, but it's misery
They can not picture me

Yeah we living, but in misery
Let's get it

Just soak it in man, cause everything real, everything authentic
You feel me?
None of that faking man, turn it to that next track, let's go inI still have keys that are of no use to me,
They used to though.
On the other side was a mansion on a hill,
Complete with LA pools and fireplaces,
And a rim made specifically for people who lie about being six feet to dunk on,
Where a piano was for decoration and an old record player was actually for the hoes,
I was never awakened by the twisting of a door knob,
Benzo’s kissed me goodnight,
The bars finally stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a presidential suite,
Complete with living rooms and empty beds and a rainfall showered fixture and the freedom to smoke big dope,
And smoking fees also,
And the possibility of making a beautiful girl I just met, map out in her mind just how many times her apartment could fit in this room,
If I could just get in.
The card stopped working,
They used to though.
On the other side was a family,
Complete with carpet stains and big loves and “its your turn’s" and toys all over the place
,
And responsibility and refrigerator magnets,
And days on the couch and nights on the couch,
And lines drawn in the sand and comebacks that cross the line,
And a horn line from my favourite make-up song plays,
And just like that, we've rehabbed a home,
DeBarge stopped working.
I still have all the keys that are of no use to me
They used to work though.Happy holidays Mr President
She can say in her voice, in her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile, with her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a feature so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's is handmade, pan fried, sun-dried

Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, saying to her
Something told me I should bring my butt to church
You gotta move slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for this whole week
I've been praying for you, you're my Sunday candy

Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget
I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like lights, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel choir got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I haven't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church

You better come on in this house
Cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain
Come on down in this house
It's gonna rain

Mama you know it's gon' rain
Father you know

But I made it alright
I've been waiting all week
I've been waiting all night
Baby, saving my life
Had to say something on Saturday
See you at church on Sunday
Open mic coming on Monday
I wonder what the Internet gon' say
When SNL end with the ending to the 3rd
Chance fly down the chimney
Me and Kiersten, Kensley, Lisa, Kenny, Taylor, Wendy all should win the Emmy
Momma should too!
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain

So crispy, is that a mixtape? Is that an album? Shutup
For your spot, for your top
I'm off of mine
I'm off the line, sometimes you thought I wrote it
I did, no that's bogus I'm lying but I'm focused like a ford
Can you afford? A verse from the man of the yord? Of the year?
Next it's New York next it's back to Cali, shouts to Dally Auston

Then I think it's some usual shit
Usually I'm too, too lit
Problems meet you in tune to it
I get fucked up and I intend to be

Historical problems, I think I know that

It's just us, just trust
It must, get better

A growth spurt from the toes
To the tip of the head
I got some longer legs
I been growing, my stride just get stronger
And when I walk into this shit
It's like God is my...on the side of my ear
And I watch him talk into this shit
I can't get into this shit
But understand that I'm blessed
Blessed, blessed, blessed
God just say, yes, yes, yes, yes, yes
Tell me what I need to
Me too, I got people I need to feed too
You feel me, I'm on my own

Feed too 
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I got people to feed too
Some people to lead through
How could I not see you?
I just gotta see it through
Like I'm the jacker
But I'm just backed up
With a lot of filled up space
I got no space on my hard drive
Sometimes my life flies
Sometimes I can't see at night
I just wanna see inside
I just wanna float away
I just wanna fly away
My name's Lil B
But what if I die today?
Would they remember me?
Would I be history?
Would I be everything?
And Everything that I wanted to see
And wanted to be
And wanted to throw out the window
The window, I live for, I see through
I see you, can't see those
I don't feel them
And no, I don't hear them
I can't smell them
And I'd rather not be around them because they're jealous
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, they're jealous
Jealous, Based freestyle
Based freestyle, and the melon
My melon, my melanin is melling
I'm like a melon
I'm like a watermelon
Because I just spit out the seeds
But sometimes they can not see me
So I gotta roll, gotta go
To the top of the space, and I gotta float
I gotta row like I'm on a rowboat
Going through the mountain, top of those
And I'm going through the water
And sometimes I'm going farther
And sometimes I'm doing short strokes
But I'm still on this boat
And bitch, where's my life vest?
I'm so stressed
And where's the top thing that I can breathe through
To resusc-itate-t-t-tate me
T-t-take me, I want to be free, fr-fr-free me
But with you Lil B, I am the history
I-i-i-i s-s-s-stutter
Because I'm s-s-s-scared of me
This is all August, all this, all of that, and
Shouts out to Chance the Rapping...he really raps that, raps that
Let's wrap it up, we gonna keep rapping up
It's your boy Lil B, I don't rap enough
Beautiful music, lifetime music,  epic proportions
Epic music, sometimes you can just see it and you feel it
Understand it, living life
Doing what's right
Every day, every night
Chance The Rapper what's up man?
Let's go
Uh, uh, cause I'm looking at the window
Outside view, I can see them
But I can't see through
But I gotta see it through, like the jacker said
Keep everything positive, it be in my head
All my chance, it's not on me it's in me
So, we don't want no frenemies
Just real friends, and a table of wines
Who we can sip away, and think about the shine
And the grace, the grace, the grace, the grace
The grace, the grace, the grace, the grace

When she need a break she just start toppin' me
I'm like, "Hold on, baby, let me put in work"
But she don't want no work, she start to pull my shirt
She let me bang...Hey, so I really wanted "Juice" to be on the mixtape but I couldn't uh, get it cleared in time. But, every time you play this track all the way through, all the streaming proceeds go directly to SocialWorks so, run this back and play it all the way through. Uh, again, I really appreciate you guys being here, since day one and uh, the album is coming real soon. Igh!No you don't wanna be by yourself
Girl who you want around
I know I'm not that nigga that you're just playing for now
You used to be my Juliet and I was Romeo
Where was you when there's strangers at the table?
Wishing it was you, I'ma tell you that
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
You could pick the phone up
We should be some grown ups
You won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together
That man next to you, playing with your heart
Now I'm decorating this tree all alone
Under the mistletoe, no
Only thing missing is my Xmas at home
Hey, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'm just a man, that's all I am
Last Christmas was a warzone
We should call it Wala Cam
At the crib with all the fam
Aunty Cam and all of them
And they act like Maury
They say "where's your shawty?"
Uh, I just wish I could be more in the mix
You are the star in the morning I miss
You are my Christmas tree ornament
Looking just like Lena Horne in “The Wiz”
Don't you know I love you, Sadie?
Don't you know I love you, lady?
Talkin' 'bout some "don't save me"
That's just how my daddy raised me
I know this sound crazy
But you're still my baby
You'll always be my baby
Yeah! Yeah!
You don't understand me
I can't go, I can't leave
I always had a family
Yeah, yeah, yeah
You could pick the phone up
We could be some grown ups
We won't be alone any longer
We'd be so much stronger
Come on, baby Jesus was a baby
Let's do it for the baby, the baby, the baby
Oh baby, give me one more chance
To get my shit together

Only thing missing is my Xmas at home
My Xmas at home...My Xmas at home...My Xmas at home...
My Xmas at homeNiggas try to come at me and shit like
On some like, I only write slow songs
And I only write...church and
How many of y'all are fucking with me with a pen, period?
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But what's writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on, but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm Bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me? Stay the fuck out my mouth
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud
A false poet get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap wrapped in cigarillo
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
But this is for the day that your dad dies
But for some reason all you hearing is sad sighs
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dad's like
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write nothing
This is for those who wrote suicide notes
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope
Nothing, life is but a supersized note
I open up my mind like suicide door
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote
I hopeAyo, this for Chicago man. Beautiful Chicago, amazing Chicago, shout out to everybody that's from here man, everybody that rep the Chi. Wassup man? Wassup ladies?

I rep the block but I rep the whole world

That shit's bad for you and I had to just go tell my fans
If you have a problem, problem once solved
It's me and Lil B, niggas can bust
But we just got a problem, problem with trust
And not the ones that hang lights like trust
That's a production joke
Comin' through, I don't fuck with you
Until we understand we untouchable
Then we can understand that it's a Lunchable
I mean it's sweet like for kids
No more beef, I forfeit
Fe Fi Fo I'm giant
Comin' through I'm client, I got a couple clients
And it keeps on rainin', the children keep on cuttin'
It's just me and Bassy, comin' through like Macy's
Came in after Martian fields and things been different lately
I got a different timing for everything that come in
I just gotta keep on waiting, I gotta take that, come in
Shit off the leash
On the leash, everything that I say

What's up brother?
Most mixtapes ever listened to in the world

Most positive, most you know what I'm sayin
Most loving, most caring
I really appreciate it
Most eclectic, most intellectual artist
Lil B!!
What's up Chance man?
I got big love for you, man, one of the best artists ever
Hottest artist out right now
I'ma tell you man, I appreciate everything you do
If you wasn't a legend I wouldn't even be rockin' with you
You already a legend
You already the god of the booth
It's Lil B, man, I swear to God I'm the truth
I be rockin' off top for real
Sittin' back in the field, my back be hurtin'
Workin' so hard my back was jerkin'
I have to get surgery cause my shit wasn't workin'
But now I'm back from the dead
Makin' this music, man it's all in my head
It's all for the love, it's all from above
Man I swear I love my thugs
I got love for the homies
I hug the homie
And I tell him that I love him
But I still fuck their bitches
Real talk, man you know man we comin' vicious
I got the word and I got some verbs
I might say some nouns but that's not the words
That I really care about, this is what I care about
People, love, get that shit out the house
Because we already know about it
All that drugs and shit, we already know about it
Broken families and shit, we already know about it
You just tryna hear the world but y'all don't know about it
We makin' this shit
Lil B, Chance, this is our shit
Everybody that was a part of this, I love y'all
Like Chance said, if you listen to this, you're already special right there
What this is is history and so in the world you can do whatever you wanna do, just be yourself
Keep that love in your heart
And follow your own heart
Respect people, respect everybody
But follow your own heart
You gon' make it
Follow your heart
You know what I'm sayin'?
Shoutout to everybody that do what they gotta do
We all learnin' what's the best route
Some eat meat, some are vegan
Some drink juice, some drink water
But at the end of the day we're all gonna go to the same place
Let's live this life the best that we can
Have the best of times
Give thanks to everybody
Give thanks to the highest
Cause we live within
You know what I'm sayin'
Nobody's perfect man, nobody's better than the next
But all we can do is be ourself, count these checks
And let that be last
When you're real the money just come
You don't even have to worry about it
Like I said man like Chance the Rapper
It's your boy Lil B, it's my last chance
It's our last chance

We can't wait no more
I can't wait no moreDoes it feel like an eternity since Acid Rap?
It feels way shorter. Every day is a workday. It's hard to explain. When you're working on shit every day and it comes back full circle three months later, it doesn't hit you the same way. Cause it's something I knew I was working on.
Can you gauge your increasing fame?
Definitely. I do recognize it all the time. But it's not like . . . I don't necessarily feed into the whole newfound-fame type shit, or feeling like a different person. If anything, it makes me realize how fleeting and unreal it all is. It's all just about perspective. I just feel like it's not real. It's real, but only in the way it affects those around you. Fame or perceived success – it all comes from groupthink.
...
Have you thought about signing with a label?
There's no reason to. It's a dead industry.
Is it also because you like maintaining direct control over your career?
I don't really have control over my direct impression on people anymore. I used to be the person putting my CD in people's hands. But I'm kind of a mainstream artist now. Not by choice. Not by what I make or anything. But just by that ripple-effect shit.
When will we get an Acid Rap follow-up?
The whole point of Acid Rap was just to ask people a question: does the music business side of this dictate what type of project this is? If it's all original music and it's got this much emotion around it and it connects this way with this many people, is it a mixtape? What's an album these days, anyways? Cause I didn't sell it, does that mean it's not an official release? So I might not ever drop a for-sale project. Maybe I'll just make my money touring.Quick links

Zane Lowe: So this is Conway Studios, off of Melrose, in Los Angeles. You've been here before.
Chance The Rapper: Yea this is where we did a lot of the Surf album and a lot of songs for Coloring Book.
ZL: That's right, Pharrell does some recording here as well as Beats 1 and this is a place with rich history and so we're here today to talk about music and it's the first time we've had a chance to properly sit down and meet and hang out. It feels good to finally meet you and especially now that you've dropped this amazing record and the reviews are coming in left, right and centre and I don't know if you pay much attention to those things, if anyone's even given you a headline I mean they're universally acclaimed.
CTR: That's dope, I mean I haven't read 'em all but I did see a bunch of them that were really nice and broke it down in a cool way.
ZL: You seem really well, very healthy obviously there was some concern and you had to come out and say look I've been under the weather, you were hospitalised at one point, I think you said it was pneumonia, like what was that about?
CTR: I don't know, I just get really sick I think I need to like, just take better care of myself, I just, I try and push it as far as I can
ZL: I wondered if it was a creative consumption, the stress
CTR: Yea you know that and also I get tonsillitis a lot, I don't know I just get sick very easily, I'm just like Mr. Glass, I don't know. I was sick and I'm getting better.
ZL: What's the pressure like when it came to finishing the record, like how close did it come to the moment when it was finally released on that Thursday evening American time and when did you actually hand it in?
CTR: We were to the limit, like we were able to still turn in the album to our friends over at Apple on time, or a little bit behind time actually cause
ZL: Well what is time actually these days anyways?
CTR: I know! It's a new idea to me also I think just turning in music for somebody to try and post it in a certain time and space. I've worked with end dates before like I had announced Acid Rap but we were in the studio until we posted it.
ZL: And it was self-imposed
CTR: Yea, so it was kinda the same thing with Coloring Book it was just a little more stressful because of, I think the environment that we created in that studio because there were so many different people working on it and everybody was sleeping at the studio, we had all the inflatable beds there. It was like twenty people all living out of the studio space, along with me and my girlfriend and my daughter and I think that, there was a lot of, you know, just fatigue and tension and you know, I think adrenaline of all of it like boiling down, minute by minute and, like the last time that we played it before we turned it in we were like it's perfect, it's cool.
ZL: Hahaha I just think lyrically like the way you opened up Acid Rap you talk about how rap's made you anxious and acid made you crazy. And then on this one you go straight in you're like talking about fatherhood and marriage and it's like wow, what a difference two or three years can make. Have you had enough perspective since you released Coloring Book to be able to realise the journey that you've been on? I know you threw it all into the album but now you've had a week or so to process that and you see how much life has changed.
CTR: Yea, I think that's the scariest part is not having the album to focus on as much because all of the real world problems aren't there you know. So me, you know, not paying attention to my health for months on months on end, you know, it's like all in your face or you know what I'm saying, your relationships, or
ZL: You've got real life to deal with now!
CTR: Yea! Real life is like
ZL: You had a great excuse before! You could go three days without answering a call now it's like, what's your excuse now Chance?
CTR: Exactly.
ZL: Haha, let's talk now about the themes of the record a bit, and the one that really jumps out to me, you know, is the relationship between art, music, faith and devotion right and the way that you brought church and religion to the record and we're gonna talk about that. But I want, you know, first of all on this record one of the first major statements that you make you know is that music's all we got. Now, this is something that we've all thrown around in various conversations because, either be in a lighthearted way like "music's all I know, it's all I'm passionate about" but this has more urgency to it and I wonder you know what the deeper meaning was, to you with that lyric that you and Kanye share on that opening track.
CTR: Well that, "music is all we got" is Kanye's lyric, right? So that record  is perfect because it wasn't the first record that we made for it but just like "Good Ass Intro" it ended up being kinda like the thesis of the project right. So, I had made a lot of records and I have a record called "Finish Line" that was gonna be the intro, and
ZL: That's crazy to think about that now
CTR: Yea it's, that was a weird sequencing, I'm glad that's not how it ended up being, but that record is so much of the record because it talks about faith, it talks about, you know, there's other blessings in the world and on the album but, you know, at the end of the day music is what we have, you know what I'm saying, and you know we're blessed at all times but you know, waiting on your blessing or thinking that your blessing is in an album is not what it is, you know what I'm saying? It's, there is no higher miracle in this project or in any of the material things in the world, but the materials do exist. So the music is what we have, and I remember I flew out to L.A., this was only like two months ago and I met up with Donnie Trumpet and Nate Fox who made most of the music that I make and they, actually I wanna play it for you. So I had, I dunno how it's gonna sound in the interview but we had, they had a record that they were working on with
ZL: We're gonna record this anyway so we can put the real audio through
CTR: Ok, perfect. So, I was working on, or they were working on this record with Grace Weber who I am in love with, both musically and otherwise she's the best, and she, they had written the song for her for her album and she, and they played it for me and it sounded like this at first
Chance plays demo version of "All We Got"
CTR: Actually I haven't heard this in a long time! Right? Crazy! So the kicks were so different and it was so dancey
ZL: Yea, totally! It's way more uptempo and way more dancey
CTR: And, I remember when it got to this part where it says "woah, woah, woah, uh, uh, uh, uhhhh, uhhhh" but I heard this and was like this is, this is it.
ZL: Just that moment
CTR: After that I was like that's exactly what I need. So I was out here because Kanye had called me when I was in Chicago and said "I wanna help you in whatever way I can" and
ZL: This was, what was the timeline of
CTR: This was two months ago
ZL: Whoa so your work on Pablo is done
CTR: My work on Pablo is done and I'm working on my project now. I put a lot of time and effort into that album and learned a lot and gained a lot outta that and, but I think that there was a lot that Kanye had to do on his front, the same place that I am right now, where he was like ok, all my personal life and all the other things that I need to do
ZL: I need to let it go, I wanna get back in the process
CTR: Exactly. So he hit me and he said "I got you, I want you to come out for four days." And so like I said I got in, I went straight over to Nico's spot and they played me that record and I was like yo, I know this is for Grace, I need this. I need you guys to help make this work for me. And I asked them if it was ok if I brought it by Kanye. They said cool. So we all went over to Kanye's spot and within a few hours of sitting around and having all these deep conversations, cause that's what Kanye does is he, he does lectures and shit and they're all, they're all like very insightful and important and helped me out a lot and, but after about two hours of being there
Chance's phone rings
CTR: Aw sorry, my baby mama's FaceTiming me, I'll take it later. Ok I will real quick
ZL: Go for it
CTR: Let's see, aw my baby's in it too. Hey, I'm in this interview right now can I call you back babe?  It's ok love, bye. Um, now I can't remember cause she's gorgeous.
ZL: Exactly, exactly! Haha and therein lies the perspective of life, and therein lies, "all of this is total bullshit"
CTR: At all times haha
ZL: So you're hanging out with Kanye, he's giving you the deepness
CTR: I almost forgot, so he basically asked us to pull up the track, we pull it up, he starts doing his Kanye dance to it and he's like "Ok, I fuck with it, take off all the drums." So I'm like "Ok, I don't really know what, what that means but we'll take off the drums." So now it's just horns, synth and Ye says uh, "pull out the MPC." So they bring out this MPC, almost like in like the gold suitcase, like from Pulp Fiction-
ZL: Ahhhh! Like Indiana Jones
CTR: like with just the . And they put it on the table and he records drums in a way that I've never seen before he does everything live off the MPC. So, all of his patterns that you know he's-
ZL: So he's recording it like an organic drum kit, 
CTR: Exactly, but that makes, you know. As it plays now, the drums aren't like mixed separately it's like, all the kicks, all the hi-hats everything are at the same level and shit. But he does it literally in one take, so from top to bottom he goes, you know, he just stands there and just plays through it and plays all the drums that you hear on the track as they are now. And then less than 5 seconds after he does that one take through he goes through and freestyles over it.
Part 2. 10:00 to 20:47
CTR: There's this guy named Francis Starlite, who's
ZL: Francis And The Lights
CTR: Francis And The Lights, my god
ZL: Who by the way, vocally on this record shines and adds a texture of emotion that is just out of control
CTR: That's the one perpetual thing through the album that's just, is him and, I've heard a lot of sounds with harmoniser right, so one of my favourite things that I see on the internet is people commenting on the album as, you know, whenever they talk about this vocal sound that he's created they call it auto-tune. Or they say this sounds a lot like Bon Iver. Justin , who Francis worked with and showed a lot of this musical styling to uses a very similar harmoniser effect. But there's a very special thing that Francis does that he called "prismiser," I love it, and it's gonna be on Kanye's album and it's on Frank's album but this prismiser thing that he does, he sings and takes a vocal and then very similar to a vocoder he, instead of being singular keys he builds chordal sounds around it, so it sounds like a choir. So when you first hear Ye's vocal come in it sounds like fifteen cyborgs all singing in auto-tune, but really it's one vocal with Francis saying, ok this is the third and the fifth and the seventh 
ZL: And he can play any note
CTR: Yea and he just builds a choir around it and it sounds like
ZL: Is that what happens at the end of "All We Got" as well so when it changes
CTR: That's him. So let me play you this freestyle that I got cause this is still crazy to me to this day
Chance plays second demo of "All We Got"
ZL: How long have you known Francis for?
CTR: So me and Francis met in, I wanna say 2013, maybe 2014, right after I dropped Acid Rap, I've always been a fran, a fan of Francis. These are those loud ass drums he put on here.
ZL: 
CTR: You know what I'm saying? This is just him, at the board, like this, like... So this vocal is solo right? And then... "music is all we got!"
ZL: Freestyling
CTR: Yea, like just off the top. "Bom bom BOMBOM." But this whole sound is like my favourite thing. Because it resembles the choir sound that I've been trying to get but it also makes it kinda futurist at the same time. You know? And, that's I think one of the encompassing ideas of the whole project cause that sound is on, Francis is credited on "Summer Friends" but he also did all of the Kanye vocals on it, he also does the end of "Same Drugs" there's a whole part that he does and even though it's not him playing on "How Great" my cousin Nicole came in and sang this lead vocal from "How Great Is Our God" and my homie Peter came in and did Francis' prismiser effect with his same harmoniser and preset that we learned from him and shit, and really makes it sound like a whole new thing
ZL: It's like new church hall almost, it sort brings a whole like you said modernises something which has been around for as long as
CTR: Exactly. I mean that's the whole process of this thing is like putting God back in, you know, God back in our hands
ZL: Let's talk about this real quick because what's interesting to me is when you think about artists, when you think about musicians in general, religion has always played a very strong part in peoples' lives. There's no mystery that faith in music and faith in God go hand-in-hand a lot of times. I can think of a lot of artists who are very religious but they guard it, they guard it privately for themselves probably cause they feel it should be a personal experience. And I'm sure that's the case in rap too, I'm positive of it. You know, you are, the devotion is on display on this record. That's really unique if you think about it, you're not hiding anything, it's very very open, you really are serving a purpose here.
CTR: Yea, I mean since I, I think, I mean all of this music that came from me moving to Los Angeles was a catalyst, I moved out here at the beginning of 2014 and stayed here only for about four of five months but in that time, I felt like I was kind of losing my God a little bit you know. And that separation got, I kind of got rid of the feeling by filling every morning, literally filling my whole neighbourhood with this Kirk Franklin sound we had the craziest speaker system, we used to have this giant house in L.A. called, uh, we would call it Coy Castle. It's this big dumb ass mansion that I should've never rented, we had the craziest speaker system in there and every morning starting at 6 am I'd wake up cause I'd be on Chicago time and we'd crank Kirk Franklin through the fucking whole neighbourhood and that I think, and from that, you know, that was the time I started making a lot of this music two years ago and it kind of carried through and led me to understand, to know that my next project was going to be founded in God and founded in my faith. But I never really set out to make anything that could pretend to be New Gospel or pretend to be The Gospel. It's just I think music from me as a Christian man. I think before I was making music as a Christian child and like, and in both cases I have imperfections but I think there was a declaration that could be made out of going through all of the shit that I went through in the past two years.
ZL: Having been a Christian child and having been a Christian young man, what do you think, and this could be taken as a question, I'm interested in your perspective even if it's just a short one. What do you think God means to kids these days from your experience?
CTR: That's a really good question. I still think that God means everything to everyone whether they understand it or not or can really see for themselves where they find God, you know. But I don't necessarily, I know for a fact that, you know, we're not pushed or promoted to speak about God with fervor. I don't think that there's anything that really allows us to do it. But I think the new generation in the forward is all about freedom and all about the ability to do what we want and, you know, we're not free unless we can talk about God.
ZL: No you're all in, you're all in. You're all in.
CTR: Like let's go!
ZL: And the thing is when Kanye came out and said that Pablo is more of a gospel record then it is anything else and I think he's, that assessment was correct in that there are definitely gospel feelings to that record. You know did you guys discuss it when you were talking about the importance of bringing back the community in that sense or at least audio-wise and sonically the community, did you talk of that together?
CTR: Yea. Well I think me and Kanye both in the experience of working on The Life of Pablo both were able to grow and take things from it. And when I first came in, like I was two years ago, I was blasting Kirk Franklin. You know what I'm saying, I was blasting Fred Hammond, I was blasting Byron Cage and in that space Kanye was working on his album but he was also allowing me to play my album in front of all these people. And we had conversations about faith and had conversations about God. And I think when Kanye said that he was making a gospel album he did not mean gospel the genre at all. He's talking about literally the gospel in terms of telling a story. And repeating a historic happening and documenting it. And I think a lot of people kind of got lost in the fact that he had said it was a gospel album and I also rapped a whole bunch of historically Christian bars on that, right. But I think that the making of my album and the making of his album were very separate but connected in that we had a lot of good conversations together you know.
ZL: You seemed very connected on that record. I mean would you, I mean it feels good to me. Would you guys work on something together in that ilk? Have you talked about working together on something that's even more gospel related and bringing that faith together on record?
CTR: I think that the main thing that we wanna connect on is this project called Good Ass Job. Like that's a thing that we talked about a long time ago and I think everything that we've been working on together has been sort of a piece of it, whether we were together in the room or not I think my intro for Acid Rap was called "Good Ass Intro" and there's a sample from his Get Well Soon mixtape and in a lot of ways "All We Got" is the same thing. It wasn't necessarily that we sat down and wrote together in a room or that we bounced ideas in a traditional way. I literally like sampled Ye. I literally took what he gave me in a session of freestyles and and sat with it and worked with it and worked with it and he had given me all the pieces that I needed to make what I wanted to make. And so, I think moreso than like making a traditional project or making a traditional faith-filled project or anything like I think he just wanted to help me make the dopest shit that I could make.
Part 3. 20:48 - 30:57
CTR: You wanna hear this original version of "Waves" I made for Ye?
ZL: Yea!
Chance plays original version of "Waves"
CTR: I had this big choir and this crazy arrangement for it, he took out all the choirs. He kept my verses but changed everything else.
ZL: That's crazy! That's crazy! Woooo! That's crazy
CTR: Ain't that funny?
ZL: So he came in and went "no, no, no"
CTR: "No no no no, yes." That was it. It was like "no no no no no. yes." Actually I also have a very funny verse from the "Nina Chop" song
Chance plays original version of "Famous/Nina Chop"
ZL: By the way, Swizz, this beat—unreal
CTR: Oh yea he went crazy! It was so funny cause I hated this beat when I first got it from him and then I was like, and then when we flipped it and I heard the final version I was like "he was right this is way hotter than what we were doing"
Chance plays his original verse from "Nina Chop"
ZL: I feel like you and Ye is like too good  it's like it has to be some truth that's told here. Cause it's great that there's a collaborative nature to your relationship but
CTR: It's unfair isn't it?
ZL: Let's talk about the way that you released this record and the way that you've released records in the past. Much has been made of this independent streak and I think because even though we're moving into a new world some of the old traditions have come with us. When did you as an artist, or in fact even just as individuals realise that "free for everybody" was the path that you wanted to take, that this was the point of difference for you?
CTR: That's a good question Zane, haha. Well I think that the "free" part of it is more of an attention-grabbing thing and something that people can use as a marker to kinda track what I'm doing. Right? I mean since day one, since I was you know, fifteen, sixteen passing out mixtapes outside of my highschool I always gave them away for free and I'd get in trouble with my pops cause he'd work to get this money and then I'd spend it to make these and literally give it away. I would always explain though that I wanted to get it to as many people as possible. I think after 10 Day when I decided to make Acid Rap a mixtape and really like a really free mixtape, and really went away from a lot of the deals I was being offered it was kind of to throw out a beacon and let everybody see what could come of a free artist. And I wanted people to associate those words and to see, you know, an independent artists independence
ZL: Truly independent
CTR: And just so you know it's, I don't, it was never, you know, I wanted to look like, I was very special doing these things or like I'm the only one that could do these things really. It's all about demonstrating the abilities of a person with, you know, a good team around them and an idea of where they want to go.
ZL: You're still on the outside looking in and having success on your own terms, what does it look like to you because you're one of the only people that really is, from your standpoint.
CTR: Yea. I mean, sometimes it looks like a sweatshop. And, and I hate a lot of parts of it. But one of the things, if I can shoutout Kanye one more time that he helped me with, was the understanding that you can't look at these companies as entities. You know? These are all individual people making decisions and when people make wrong decisions you put a pressure to get that person pushed out but you don't completely down a company or an organisation. So, with that being said I don't agree with the way that labels are set up. I don't agree that anybody should sign 360 deals or sign away their publishing or do, or take most of the infrastructure that's included in a formal deal. But I've learned to not be like, you know, fuck this company and fuck this company, even though a lot of those people tried to make it really hard for me to release my project.
ZL: How do they do that? How do they make it hard, when you're independent, take your business to the point where if one more label tries to stop me. That it becomes a hook.
CTR: Well here's the thing, most people are signed, right? So, say, say you make a project and there's twelve Universal artists on it. And then not only do they find out after the fact that you've recorded with these artists and that you plan on making videos with these artists, but they find out also on top of it that you plan to release it for free. So that's when you get phone calls where people are trying to tell you that they own your friends, or that you can't make any decisions without them being a part of it. And you, you know. I only use Universal as an example because those are my people and they helped me get the project done. But, you know, for the people that aren't named, you know, there is that kind of interference that happens when you're trying to push something out that people feel like they own. You know? Or trying to give something away that people feel
ZL: Yea it's a lot of investors coming in after the fact
CTR: It's a lot of suits and ties of people that don't know how the fuck to play notes telling you the value of what you're making or whatever you're doing.
ZL: Have you ever been tempted and I only raise it because there have been little hints along the way I mean even on the new record there's a couple of moments where you talk about you know "Kanye's best prodigy, he never signed me" and I wondered if that was ever on the table. And I think it's "Angels" where you say "Fuck it, maybe I should sign to OVO" was that that record where you said that?
CTR: Yea that is, that's, yea I mean I've had, everybody has had that conversation. We've had all the conversations. And what's funny is that some of those conversations still keep coming back. But with Kanye, it was cool because he did offer me a deal but still worked with me diligently, you know, after knowing that that wasn't what I wanted to do. And I used the word "prodigy" because I can't really, I wouldn't go as far to call myself Kanye's protégé because I didn't have that experience that some of my best friends got working right underneath him. I think that the word "prodigy" is cool cause like, I was just a kid that he knows, that, and I am still a kid and am still growing and don't you know, fully understand how everything works and my potential or what I'm going to do. But I'm, I had the insight of Ye being around me at the point where I've kind of already decided a path to be like "Yo, you should sign. No you're not gonna sign? Cool, let's get this money."
Part 4. 30:58 to 40:28
ZL: Yea. You could sell music independently, it's not like one goes without the other, there are a lot of independent artists who have sold their records and have sold them at a very competitive price in order to survive but also to not feel like you're causing anybody financial disservice as a fan. Why the decision not to sell this record still?
CTR: I think in part, a big part of it is that we are at such a crucial time in terms of music, I mean before, I know it's being highly publicised now, this, this, you know, the what is it the National Recording Arts and Sciences, I don't know what they're called, but those guys had been having a conversation I think up to at least a year ago about changing some of the verbage in their rules and how they're inclusive of, um
ZL: Awards, charts, all that kind of stuff. And there's been changes in streaming on the charts as well
CTR: Yea, so the charts are already changing, they're including streaming. I still don't necessarily agree with, how they, it's something like every 1,000 streams is a sale
ZL: Is like one purchase
CTR: Or something? I don't know, I don't really care about that. But at least they're making that move and I think the Grammys started making the move I think about a year ago they started voting on it, I don't know cause I don't really, I'm not on Grammy board anymore, but they uh
ZL: But you were!
CTR: Yea, back in the day! But they originally, or the wording is that they can't nominate a project unless it's released, unless it's a commercial release, right?
ZL: Right. And does it qualify now that you're on streaming?
CTR: No. But that's the thing, because of this timing I think it was important to have these mixtapes be trilogised and be a thing that existed. Regardless of how the revolution goes, you know, I know that I was not on the bus when everything was changing. You know what I'm saying? And I was like "fuck it, I'm still dropping mixtapes." Now whatever's next, I don't really know, I've kind of, am a little turned off from making music right this second cause I'm still sick and shit, and I just did a project. But like, you know, I know that I did the three projects exactly how I wanted to and that they were mixtapes and that's where I came from.
ZL: Trilogy's perfect. Does it feel like now that cap has signified the end of that particular era for you, in some respects?
CTR: I think for sure. Like I mean I wouldn't necessarily say that I'm not making anymore mixtapes cause I, I like making mixtapes I might make a tape with Jay Electronica soon, I might make a tape with anybody, let me stop doing that.
ZL: I'm excited.
CTR: That's cool, and it'll be awesome but I think for sure that mode of projects was its own thing.
ZL: Yea for sure.
CTR: And I had to make certain statements because I was in the climate that I was in but will, like we were just saying, when 10 Day came out they didn't count streams. And
ZL: Thing's changed so much even since then.
CTR: Yea and I think everything will continue to change but I think we do have to think about being inclusive in terms of artists that don't necessarily have a label attached to them or want to release music commercially cause that doesn't have anything to do with artistic excellence, which is what they celebrate you know and because it's you know where this is the shit moving forward, you know it's gotta move forward but let shit change, you know what I'm saying?
ZL: Let's talk about Jay Electronica for a second
CTR: Yea, let's do that for a minute.
ZL: For a few minutes!
CTR: For a few minutes!
ZL: We talk about about Jay Elec. I mean, a guy who's sorta opens the door, comes into the room for a hot second lays waste and then disappears again. So to have him on a song as powerful as "How Great" is it still your favourite song on your work, it's really unbelievable man, you know real emotional, powerful piece of music. What I really love about that as well is just talking from a total rap nerd's point of view for a second is that you almost chameleon-like adopt his flow for a minute in the beginning
CTR: Oh yea completely
ZL: Deliberately, you know to create a synergy. I love that. I was listening to it and was like "is that Jay Elec?" at first and you were like "da, ba-da, ba-da, ba-da" that sort of like tripping flow that he does.
CTR: What is it? I'm trying to remember like, oh "Candyman, Candyman, spit me a dream." What is it? "Blow a chunk of the levee out and spit me a stream." Yea so that's, yea, but no I'm probably - I mean, somebody could fight me for it - but I feel like I'm Jay Electronica's biggest fan.
ZL: Haha now we're all in that line!
CTR: But it's, I've always been, you know what I'm saying very, for as long as I can remember like back to high school, I was "Jay Elec, very tough." And he's a very well-read, well-educated dude and-
ZL: When he speaks it's totally believable. Cause he's at that point in his life where, what he's talking about he's lived. That's unique.
CTR: Definitely. I mean, there's a line in his verse on the project where he says, he says, "Jay Elec would've never made it, O' son of man, O' son of man. Who is the angel that stood on Earth with a foot on water and a foot on land? Who is the angel that rode a Harley from the projects to the parliament?" And then that line I'm like "who is that angel?" cause you know he's dropping mad, spiritual text references, these are joints that you really have to look up, you might need somebody you has a degree in that shit to really know what the fuck he's talking about. The last line about riding a Harley to the house of parliament, I mean that's not a reference that's his life he's talking about himself like that shit really happened. And I don't know when that happened or what that means but like that's Jay Electronica talking about some really, crazy spiritual shit that he's taking over and shit.
ZL: He's really one of the greats and I think in many respects as frustrating as it is for us while we sit around and wait around for more music it just adds to that, you know
CTR: Well I think this was The Prestige, if anybody knows what I'm talking about I think, or at least the beginning of the third Act, like he's in that space of like, you know, he had a song that I used to love where he has the sample, it's like Elijah Muhammad where he talks about, like a king has to, has to leave the people and go away and wait til he can come back and manifest, it's written, his time.
ZL: Let's talk about "Juke Jam" on the record, which is, which is one of those songs which, I've been reading a lot of press and reflections about the record and that one's bubbling up as people continue to analyse the album and pick their favourites, cause are going so deep on this on the thinking process or thought process. And "Juke Jam" is one of those songs that people are feeling.
CTR: Yea, and I love that. Isn't that weird though? Cause it's, well I guess it's, well that record is like very, very Chicago and like almost, you know, excluding, you know I was kind of worried that people wouldn't really connect to the record cause it's, you know, about a specific place that I think even certain Chicagoans don't know about I'm actually sure of certain Chicagoans don't know about.
ZL: Can you tell us more about it?
CTR: Yea, I mean when I was a shorty we used to go to this spot down the street from Avalon Park called The Rink and it was a roller rink but really it was a... Have you ever seen ATL? Probably not.
ZL: No.
CTR: So there's like a movie called ATL and they go to Cascade and it's like, it's the same thing in that movie it's just like a place where like I did actually get into my first fight and got my first juke and, like, I, there's obviously a giant roller rink on the floor but it's about what's happening out by the lockers. That's like, that's like the world that we was in.
ZL: I think it's cool that you've involved Justin Bieber in that song because you two have a friendship that goes back and there was a key moment, I remember, reading about when you know you guys were on the same stage at Coachella and that was like a defining moment for both of you because what it did was it opened up the parameters of what was actually the perception of the two of you. It was like "why is Chance fucking with Justin Bieber?" and then "why is Justin Bieber on stage with Chance?" and like how does it work? And like, it was kind of cool.
CTR: Yea that's my fucking boy, like he's the shit and he's just very dope at everything that he does, at writing, at singing, he's an amazing vocalist.
ZL: How did you guys even meet? Like how did that happen?
CTR: How did me and Justin meet... Me and Justin met actually after we made "Confident" so I won't say that me and Justin were friends when we made "Confident" but I was a fan.
ZL: Of course you were, you wouldn't have jumped on if it wasn't.
CTR: Exactly. And we met at Coachella and hung out all day that day before I went on stage and it wasn't til, like right before I went on stage that he was like
ZL: That was the day you met?
CTR: That was the day I met him, we sat backstage and sm- and chilled
ZL: Hahahaha
CTR: And, just chilled, and, then right before I went on stage he was like "you want me to come out for a song?" and I was like "yea let's have a dance battle." And we did
ZL: That's crazy
CTR: And he crushed me. But only cause I was so tired, I'd been performing the whole day
ZL: Real tired, like tired!
CTR: I'm cold, in real life! I probably just yelled on this microphone and shit
ZL: It's a cool record, I really dig it, I really like it. But you know what I also like is the fact that getting away from the famos for a second, and talking about, I wanna talk about some of the new people on the record too and you know the fact that you're always looking out for people that are gonna bring a different shade to what you do, a different vibe to what you do. You know Knox being a classic example.
Part 5. 40:29 to 50:01
CTR: Yea, so I mean, Knox Fortune is one of my favourite producers, he's like been in the background and produced on a lot of records that I worked on and a lot of records for my friends, and we you know, have a bunch of collaborations that didn't really see the light you know. But that one, that record  was so dope because I had it for like a week before he touched it, and it was just me talking on the record saying "All night, I been drinkin' all night, I been drinkin' all night." And he was like "yo let me touch that" and brought it back and it was, you know, I mean he's, he's Chicago, so
ZL: What is it about Chicago man? Like, I mean it's definitely one of the creative capitals in the world for music, you know you could put it right next to sort of a Manchester or a Liverpool, now of course people talk about Toronto having its moment, but you know there are places, Berlin, there are places where music lives. Why Chicago, why is it, having grown up in it?
CTR: I think, I mean one it's like just a very cultured place, like you know we have, you know Chicago's a big city but it's in the middle of Illinois. You know what I'm saying? And like, all of the suburban areas around us like kind of like create this wall of like, you know, inclusive sound and shit, and I think on top of that obviously it's just we've never had a music industry and I think because there was no industry or big labels posted there it gave everybody a lot of air to like make what the fuck they wanted to make. And bred a lot of you know, just awesome talent across all genres.
ZL: There's one really funny lyric in there that made me smile on that song where you were like, "you just wanna talk politics and Chicago shit"
CTR: Yea yea
ZL: And that was just funny to me because it's like, ok you just released this records that's like totally dedicated to Chicago, all anyone's gonna wanna talk about is Chicago and now, you've opened the flood gates, this is it, this is your time, Chicago's the new favourite, here you go and already it's like you're already over it! Hahaha
CTR: Yea! Well, like that song, to me, is the best song that I've ever written because it's such an awesome concept. The idea behind it is that I'm at this party and there's women all over me and, you know, there's professionals in suits all over me, and, haha, people that are telling me they're my cousin and shit, and in my mind all everybody wants from me is a ride home. And I think that's just such a funny, stupid, concept, but to build off of it and to kind of make it connect in a way that, you know, "Now, oh now you wanna chill, now you wanna build" you know what I'm saying? "Now you got the bill." It's, it's
ZL: Gas money, cash money
CTR: Exactly. All of that shit is a fun concept I think because I do get fucked up at parties and get paranoid and I think it's just really funny to bring it back to just everybody wanting a ride... "Oh you my cousin? No you wasn't" hahahaha
ZL: You made a record that is really a love letter for Chicago, it's a positive, uplifting, listen for a city that's been well documented either by the conventional media, front-face media which I call like the real kind of, how would I call it, like a modern media like Vice have gone out there and done a piece on it, you've got movies that have been made about it I mean, there's a story about it being told right now. You've done it in a way that's uplifting, which kind of contradicts everyone else's take on it. And I wondered what the challenges were in creating such an uplifting, positive-sounding record during such a tumultuous time.
CTR: Yea. Well I mean there's definitely a challenge to it because it goes against public perception but it's not a stretch. I mean, Chicago's beautiful, people there are beautiful, events happening all the time, like beautiful music being made and, you know, there are like very dark shadowy parts of it and I think rather than, you know, Vice documentary-style pointing at shit and being like isn't this weird, it's kind of like being, you know, just shedding light in all of those areas. Like, you know, we talk a lot about 79th on the record because I want people to walk down 79th and sing "79th" in a way that doesn't necessarily go with whatever Spike Lee made in Chiraq you know what I'm saying? And it's not a lie, you know what I'm saying, it's not like, you know, this this terrible, dystopic, place. I'm from there, you know what I'm saying, and I'm like the happiest, again, like I'm happy.
ZL: What was it like growing up there?
CTR: I mean, it's kind of hard because it was all I knew for so long, I didn't start travelling til I was like nineteen or twenty but like, it's super communal. Super small. Everybody's a person away from knowing someone. Everybody's cousin is somebody else's cousin. My mom graduated from Kenwood and I know like everybody in Hyde Park because of it. My dad graduated from  by my house because of it, was the block club president. So like I'm very intertwined in this city in terms of like, knowing people and knowing areas and shit.
ZL: Is there a movie to be made, I know like you were very vocal about you didn't like the way Chiraq presented the city, but is there a movie to be made and is it something you could see yourself being involved in, or in fact are involved in for all we know?
CTR: I mean, I'm not, hmm. That's a good question. I think that the media that I make now is dope for Chicago and I think there are amazing filmmakers in Chicago that could make some type of think-piece. I'm not, I wasn't critical of Chiraq for the simple fact that I thought I could make a better movie. I just didn't think that that was any type of representation of the city it felt like it was written about somewhere else, some fantastical place and then they just put it in my city. But, I think, my main goal right now is you now making music and I've kind of been getting into theatre a little bit like you know, I want to write some type of think-piece for the theatre but
ZL: Would you do that on script-level as well as musical? On multiple levels?
CTR: Yea, I mean like I really like screenwriting like that's not something that I'm foreign to at all.
ZL: And how many would you say that you've tried or attempted to write?
CTR: Two
ZL: So you've finished two?
CTR: Yea, there's one that's about a Hallowe'en party and then there's one that's like an existential, like I don't know it's like an up in the air thing where there's like this guy... I don't wanna talk about that one, I don' t know that I'm actually making that one but the first one
ZL: Halloween party stupid, so we can call that by name
CTR: We'll call it The Stupid Halloween Party
ZL That's so fire, that's the shit, what an awesome name!
CTR: Haha no if I would've named it that
ZL: Back on the table, cause of the name
CTR: Let's go!
ZL: So as we sort of go through, this has been fun by the way
CTR: This has been awesome. I'm chillin, I keep forgetting we're in an interview
ZL: I want to talk about family, because we're both family men. I've got kids, you have a newborn, how old now?
CTR: She just turned 8 months on Monday
ZL: Congratulations
CTR: Yea
ZL: So this is, you've documented this on the record which is again now, a lovely tone on the album, the honesty, and just the vulnerability and the heartfelt nature of it. And I read somewhere actually in an article that the cover artwork is a painting of you looking at your daughter as well. So, how has that experience been for you becoming a father?
CTR: I mean, it's the greatest happening of my life and, you know, feels a lot like the beginning of my life
ZL: Right? It's hard to think about what you did before! I have no idea
CTR: Yea it's crazy, tripping. But I mean it definitely comes with all, you know, a lot of hardships and shit you know and I think it's well documented on the album. One of my favourite records is a song I made with Future on it called "Smoke Break" and I think Future was perfect for it cause he's a father too and that record, I remember I started making it and my girlfriend came in and she didn't like it at first, now it's her favourite song. But the song talks about, you know, it's another song that uses drugs as a metaphor for relationships or sex or whatever but you know, there really is a whole turning point in terms of your priorities and your schedule and we really did lose for a second, you know, the respect of time for ourselves and the respect of time to just take a break, put the baby down for a second and like, enjoy each other's company.
ZL: Having been in and around, somewhat of a political environment, albeit local body politics, in that situation and your dad working with Barack Obama when he was a senator and being exposed to that and I think that it makes sense now listening to your music and the way that you talk about Chicago from the point of view of Chicago as it comes from a community-driven place. What does it mean to you, or what do you think it means to a generation right now because I mean in essence I think a lot of artists are saying things that people probably look to politicians and policy makers to say. You know, and then in some respects those things aren't really that forthcoming from a lot of political circles, it seems to be in particular chaos right now internationally, politically.
Part 6. 50:02 to 60:53
CTR: Yea, I think there was always... you know, I think the word "politics" you know, sounds dirty to me, when I even think about it. But I never really saw my dad as working in politics, like whenever he, whenever I went to his job or he talked about what he was working on, I always saw, you know, that same idea of being a good man and working on projects that will help people. So when my dad took any job it was always kind of a state director position, or a head of community outreach, it was always about building a bigger communal space, networking with all the, all the, the heads of religious organisations, of community initiatives, being in contact with and always on with people that are trying to make a difference and being, spearheading, really, a lot of initiatives.
ZL: You must be proud man, do you know what he thinks about the record you just made and the music you play?
CTR: I hope so, I'm proud of my dad like that's what, that's what's so funny is he says he's proud of me all the time and that's like, that's a dope thing coming from somebody that moves shit in the physical you know what I'm saying. Versus like, I mean I do try and do physical shit but like I, my shit is like a lot more
ZL: Well you have to get physical now, we have to talk about the road bro. Because the album is done. And it's been a minute, do you think about it? Are you in plans?
CTR: Definitely. So I mean like, touring the music is going to be so easy just in terms of like the sound and pure audio of it and the sequencing of the show.
ZL: It will be you and The Experiment?
CTR: Yea. It's always gonna be me and The Experiment. That just works. You can't, you can't say, if it ain't broke. Do you know what I'm saying.
ZL: Is it gonna be The Experiment and extended family?
CTR: Probably. Yea. The last two shows I got to play with Francis And The Lights. People won't know that unless you were at those two shows but like, you know. And I know Francis is about to drop his album so I probably shouldn't even say that cause he probably won't be with me but still, you know.
ZL: Put it out there.
CTR: You know like I've always wanted to bring a bigger theatre feeling to Chicago. And when I say theatre I mean specifically like a Broadway sense like New York's theatre scene strives, thrives because they have Broadway and they have like a row of theatres and a very uplifted theatre scene. And I think
ZL: Is this something that will permeate through your terrain do you think?
CTR: I think it's on the other end of it just because it's a stagnant thing. I want to build a building that people come in to like see, you know like an attraction? Like the world's biggest  that's on the road somewhere and people drive to go see that.
ZL: How hard are you gonna tour this record, fans are gonna want to know. I mean you've been to Europe, you've been around America, you haven't been to Australasia, you haven't been to probably Asia?
CTR: So we'll be in Asia, Australia, New Zealand - can I say New Zealand and Australia or is that the same thing?
ZL: No they're not the same thing
CTR: I knew they're not the same thing, I just wanted to check with you Zane
ZL: Yep! We categorically confirm we are not the same thing! But we're friends!
CTR: And so, so New Zealand as well as Australia. Definitely gotta go back to Europe. And I think a very important thing that we're trying to work out right now is being in Africa outside of being in South Africa.
ZL: Amazing.
CTR: And then maybe we'll do something in America too. Possibly.
ZL: I hope so! You imagine making this record...
CTR: Wouldn't that be sick though?
ZL: ... just to not...
CTR: Make everyone else travel for it? That's the new thing is, you gotta travel for music. That's why festivals are dope cause people go out of their way to go see a festival, but that's the same shit I was just talking about.
ZL: When's the touring gonna start? Do you know?
CTR: I do know. I guess when this comes out the tickets will probably already drop so September.
ZL: I got a couple quick fire things to get through before we get up and out of here then let's get some fresh air. So number one, you mentioned something the other day when you were doing your Reddit questionnaire you mentioned about the Childish Gambino mixtape, is that ever gonna see the light of day?
CTR: Yea, I know for a fact that it's gonna come out by fall, I think
ZL: He's all nervous now I put him on the spot
CTR: The thing is, I don't wanna say too much, Donald is like my older brother and like, I can say some shit that will get me in trouble. He's working on his TV show so I should say that first. And Atlanta's amazing, he's out there right now finishing up the TV show and the tape is not done, or close to being done. But it will come out.
ZL: You've got some skin in the game.
CTR: Yep.
ZL: "No Problem," we have to talk about "No Problem" because it is without a doubt one of the best songs of the year within the framework of the album.
CTR: Thank you.
ZL: I think I played it for like thirty minutes straight when we played it on Beats.
CTR: You did. And thank you for that.
ZL: Thank you.
CTR: I got a lot of tweets about it they said they liked that.
ZL: No the song's incredible obviously brining 2 Chainz and Lil Wayne into it and creating such a really great chemistry on that record. It isn't always easy when you've got you know guest bars coming in, sometimes it can feel as though it's been sent in my tape or whatever, or digitally. Tell us about that song, tell as what that song means to you and, people have never heard you talk about it.
CTR: Yea I mean that song is everything that it's supposed to sound like, it's supposed to sound like the smash record that came from "the other," you know what I'm saying? It's supposed to feel like what this year is supposed to feel like when we take a chance on "the other" and fuck with, you know what I'm saying, some dope shit that came organically. And it is banging on the doors of all of those labels and letting them know, like, literally and figuratively, like don't tweak. Stop trying to stop what I'm doing, you know, I'm over here, you're over there, do your thing. But like in both ways don't keep doing it.
ZL: But, I'm gonna say it over the biggest hit record of my career to date
CTR: Yea, well I mean that's the way that you say some shit, I mean I can't say it quietly in an email or like it's, I think that it meant the most to me to have, you know, to have Wayne come on there and speak what he spoke
ZL: Great, great verse too
CTR: Yea, I mean it still fucking scares me to this day to see that I have two records now with Lil Wayne. But, you know what I'm saying, I think to have him come in it and have him backing it up, cause there is a Chicago version of that record that will come out at some point and it does have, you know what I'm saying, the people I wanted to have on the record, but this version made sense for the album
ZL: Chicago people?
CTR: Yea, I don't need to say who it is, it'll come out. But it's huge. It's having them do it, I think people that are juggernauts in the game stand next to me and also say like don't tweak on him. You know what I'm saying? I think it was poignant and it made its way to everyones' ears that it was supposed to.
ZL: Who's Big Fella?
CTR: Oh, so you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is? Of course you don't know who Ha Ha Davis is. Ha Ha Davis is the fucking funniest of all time. And he's from Detroit and you know what I'm saying he's just like a comedian, a new age comedian so he's on Instagram, is where we all watch him from. But I've been a fan, everybody in Chicago says "big fella" cause its some Midwest shit at this point, it's some South shit now too like everyone says "big fella." But I was a fan and I hit him up, I think a week before we went to Atlanta, or actually like two days before we went to Atlanta to shoot the "No Problem" video. And I was like "yo, will you come with me just rock with me" and we went out and just hung out together and met people together and now he's one of my closest friends. After he was in the video, I was like "yo, will you narrate this whole project?" So he was on four out of like fifteen of the, well he was on "Grown Ass Kid," his main monologue is on "Grown Ass Kid" which, the labels, they stopped me. It didn't make it on the project.
ZL: Can you just get it out anyway? Just find a home for it?
CTR: I actually found out recently that the record leaked and it's online but its official release is gonna be on Cam O'bi's project who's one of my favourite producers and did, he did "Good Ass Outro," the outro from Acid Rap and "Blessings" on this new project, like the reprise. And he did three records on this project that all got stopped.
ZL: So much stopping
CTR: Yea
ZL: No more stopping.
CTR: Yea, don't try anything anymore.
ZL: No more.
CTR: Can I show you this Big Sean song that was supposed to be on the project that got stopped? You probably couldn't play it on the broadcast cause it wasn't a cleared single.
Broadcast paused while Chance plays song privately
ZL: It's interesting cause like, to me it's dope as hell like I love that but it's funny now listening to Coloring Book
CTR: You feel it wouldn't have fit?
ZL: It feels like
CTR: Everything happens for a reason.
ZL: Crazy right? Still man, hearing you and Sean together.
CTR: It would've been perfect. It's funny cause Sean, Jeremih and Cole all tour together and those are like my three best friends in music. And we had three songs altogether that were all collaborative songs and they all got stopped. Luckily, Jeremih still ended up on "Summer Friends" but Jeremih was on like three or four songs on Coloring Book.
ZL: Man, the more you tell it the more I realise like we're lucky we got anything at all.
CTR: Yea
ZL: Out of the guests at least, it'll sure
CTR: It'll never happen like that again though. All it takes is, is, I think the growth of the artists, plural, and the retraction of the control, and then... I don't think, I don't think there will ever be a release again from me that feels controlled.
ZL: You don't want zero problems.
CTR: They definitely don't want a single one.
ZL: Hahaha. Love you man.
CTR: Thank you
ZL: Thank you

I wanna take you out and maybe even party after
You can crash in, prolly catch the morning after
Got booked over paper, that's another chapter
I wanna move to the hills where the breeze right
Know I like it when your pencil start to write
We gotta get it on the dance floor tonight
Baby, I'm a smooth typer, baby, I'm a you type
Woke about my future, line up reality
Mind of a different galaxy
Mama said eat your vegetables, celery turns to salary
Selling souls while I'm only addicted to forms of casualty
Casualty is a tragedy
Young cause of catastrophe, drop boy moving galleries
Evil is just a half of me
Greatest grace, my anatomy
Adam and Eve's apple in me, probably screaming feel 'em
Dreamin' thank god for the trade I, for the way I
Roll up in a Beemer, hold up, slick nigga
Moving that weight, fit nigga, guap, guap
Rich nigga, doper than dope

And try to mix the cereal and burn the kitchen down
She be workin', she be twerkin' when she sittin' down
She like to purchase Venom Ranger with the Swiss accounts
Twenty-four golfin', 'bout to save the dolphins
When I die I'ma need the all-white coffin
Handshake the login, closet is a walk-in
Hit the silent auction, kick that jit for talkin'
Got a girl that work for NASA and she said I'm a star
Got a girlfriend that's a rapper and she set up this bar
Got a model, she don't say shit, she just sat on my car
I try to leave her but I didn't get far, a stupid joke
I know the pimpin' business like that nigga Bubba do the shrimpin' business
We doin' fitness, bitch, my bedroom sound like women's tennis
And it was necessary, that shit hereditary
If I ain't really your daddy, talk to my secretary
Big Chano, smokin' cigarettes inside a grocery store
I got the sauce, I got the clout, I master Roshi flow
I watch 'em closely, can't be turnin' my back
I make 'em line up, take three times like my hat
Ooh, girl, I love you so
Told myself not to love these hoes
Told myself not to fall for these bitches
But it's hard to stop fallin' when you trippin' though
I'm pimpin', though, and pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary
I could feed eyes to a vegetarian
My main bitch said she feelin' secondary
Love you, worry 'bout yourself and not the other bitch I'm tellin', girl
I really wake up in the mornin', look up in the mirror at Wayne
Told 'em, must've haven't met another Tunechi yet
Man, hoppin' off the private plane, lookin' for the doja
I could choose to be a lotta things, I chose to be the chosen
Ain't no simpin', not on this side
Try too hard or quit tryin'
She can't let me go, I'm like a zipline
I told that ho, "If you gon' be a ho, you better be a good ho
Be the best ho you could be, go get the bread 'fore it's toast"
Boy, I fucked all of your hoes, you be spiralin' your hoes
And if pimpin' is dead, I hope she ain't scared of ghosts
I said, "Pimpin' ain't easy, but it's necessary"
And bitch, if you gon' leave, you should've left already
Tunechi
When you was ridin' around your town with your ho, bad
I was puttin' diamonds on the sides of my Dolces
When you was ridin' 
When you was ridin' 
When you was ridin' around your town with your ho, bad 
I was puttin' diamonds on the sides of my Dolces
When you was ridin' 
When you was ridin'
Do that ragtag on my dick 
Got my shit imported to Dubai for a key 
Twenty rings on my muhfuckin' fist 
Put my thumb in her butt, so I guess she got ice on her shit, a-ha 
Twenty bitches out in that car like Big K.R.I.T. 
I told Chance the Rapper to put some threes on my motherfuckin' kids 
Fed 'em to the snake 'cause he was mothafuckin' snitchin' 
These is with long shoestrings, it's only time I'm trippin' 
This a historical moment
That was a wrapper, and whoever want it
I'm at the top, I'm all alone, Macaulay Culkin
I got a tall Brazilian bitch, I'm ridin' like ponies
I don't know 'bout you, but only police is my opponents
I'm 'bout to put it to his head like Stoney
You might as well put some colorful clothes on, yeah
'Cause the only thing we know you from is clonin'
If it got somethin' to do with sellin' pussy, we condone it
She gon' throw it back, ping-pong it
Sellin' bitches dreams, yeah, I'm ownin' it
Never keep it real with a ultimate
Only you know how far this could go
You knew
Stepped on a four leaf clover and I got paid like I was drunk and sober
But you knew
I need a baby that gon' eat and leave the dishes out
And try to mix the cereal and burn the kitchen down
She be workin', she be twerkin' when she sittin' down
She like to purchase Venom Ranger with the Swiss accountsYo, it's the return of the Gifted Gifter
The Secret Santa grab-bag sifter
The Grinch, sleigh hanging off the ledge deadlifter
The best thrifter, the tearjerker
The Santa's little help employee of the year worker
The smile bringer, the joy inside the child lingers
The boy inside the crowd proud, he's a loud singer
The whole choir, the bow tier
The snowplow and the snow tires, the coat buyer
The "Oh, you shouldn't haver," the Birkin bagger
The gifted rapper, they told me it's the thought that counts
But really it's the count that matters
Accounting hacker
Bank amount countin' backwards a thousand smackers
It's the return of Kris Kringle, the piss singles, that shit tingles
Sendin' checks twice 'cause the name's on the list wrinkled
My chips Pringles, my chips been gold
My green mean go, your green mean slow
It's the young born again, good hood ornament
With a little chicken like a Cornish hen, Amazon ordering
Cohiba importer of Evergreen water in
Rapping all night, will he ever bring the chorus in?
Fireplace bright like I threw ten menorahs in
Ten more kinaras and a whole fucking forest, then
I buy the doll in the mall that the store is in
I hide the presents in the dresser and the drawer it's in
My dawg doin' moves, he said this shit is on the floor again
Feds was on his trail but he got fifty names in Oregon
I bought cases bigger than the suits that you see Lori in
James still sittin' but I'm sendin' a DeLorean
Look, it's Mister Christmas Bonus
Mr. Made His Brothers Bands, Mr. Nich'las Jonas
Mr. Big Cojones but bigger heart
That's where the homeless home is
The Home Alone kid
It's the return of Kevin McCallister, the Swiss mister
The hot chocolate mixer that gets pictures
And big, big cousin misser, the quick fixer
The Wizard of Oz, big blizzard, the big gifter
Ooh-ooh-ooh, ooh
Ooh-ooh-ooh, oohNa nana na na na na nana

I know the words 
I know the words, haven't you heard?
New album alert, shit's loud as the purp
I'm out in the burghs
Out in the streets, we was out on the curb
From out of the dirt a mountain of merch
I woke up with 
It's alright
I wept, I prayed on it, I slept on it, wait on it
Just flame up the Tunechi and know that you Gucci
Just something to say on it
Smoke like a sailor, curse like a chimney
My pops in the mirror, Mufasa is in me
I ain't no goofy  I ain't no goofy
I am the re-up, I am the plug, you can introduce me
This ain't no movie, I don't need jewelry, I don't need groupies
I need my money, I need my money, I am the movement

I'm on my business 
Not in the business, I'm not a prisoner, I got my soul 
I flaunt it, I wear it, I'm still a Christian, I still got hittas 
Reesey and Justin a phone call away 
They say don't delay, and andale, they on the way 
Catch me in my city on the daily with the kiddies givin' tours to the tourists 
Givin' our city to the kids, like givin' flowers to the florist
Pay the little skirt with the torn stitch,  with a pot of gold tourist
Grab a couple bucks, take some more with ya

I made 35, JJ Watt
I made 35, JJ, what?Glory be to God. I claim this victory in the name of the Lord. I want to thank God for my mother and my father who've supported me since I was young. For Kiersten, for Kinsley, for all of Chicago. And I wanna thank God for putting amazing people in my life like Pete and Pat who have carried me since 2012. I know a lot of times I talk about my independence and people think it had something to do with... oh I'ma talk, y'all can play the music if you want. I wanna thank God for my team. I know people think that independence means you do it by yourself, but independence means freedom. I do it with these folks right here.  Glory be to God, I claim the victory in the name of the Lord, let's go!Watch cases are convenient hiding places
The value of drugs  is enormous
Recently, a huge supply of heroin was taken
It was concealed in a powdery, harmless shipment of 35 barrels of olive oil
The deadly drug was burned in an incinerator of the Bureau of Engraving and Printing
And more vicous, more deadly than these soul destroying drugs is the menace of marijuana
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear 
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air 
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here 
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels 
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral )
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial )
Caught you on the nine in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors )
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor )
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin anamorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf 
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones )
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung )
Sanyo and handheld and handgun )
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here rapping a lot
I know you think y'all on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks )
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan )
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now )

Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me )
There's no skipping, hit it vividly and pass me )
Don’t answer about your asthma, or your problems or your Ashleys
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's )
Feminine’s getting intimate, cinnamon tone women
And homies could get they dividends, all broads is frivolous
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistics
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit
Hold up, I need a roll up
Better yet, I need to roll up
Mama always glad Mary showed up
After the show, let's put a zone up
Zone out, smoke up, blunts, bongs and bozza

Down, down, down-downLook, guys, I know the world outside is getting crazy, but look at the bright side—television's never been better
Good point, Stephen, but I bet you can't sing it
Oh, really?
Mhmm
Dear friends, the next time the world's problems make you feel the blues
Turn on any channel, well, except the news
'Cause troubles aren't so troublin' when you see them in HD
The world's a little better on TV
So don't you worry about global warming or the Middle East
Walk on the bright side with the recently deceased
My HBO password is SEXBOT123
Everything is better on TV
When the world's so scary you close your door and hide
Open up, let Archer slip inside 
Watch This Is Us, you'll learn it feels so good to feel so sad
With Randall, Kev and Kate, she probably killed her dad 
And Stranger Things is much less strange than our reality
Everything is better on TV
I'd like to vote for  Selina Meyer
She's pretty foxy
Imagine if your president was not beloved by Nazis
The Americans has hotter spies than the Russian inquiry
Even treason's better on TV
You don't have to take it from my song and dance
It's time to give this thing a chance
Yo Stephon, what a beautiful segue
Let me take over, I can make us some headway
I love television, it's a pleasant distraction
But just imagine takin' action
I like Brooklyn Nine Nine, in fact, I'm addicted
But where's the cop show where one gets convicted?
I miss the classics, I still think M*A*S*H rocks
But if Hawkeye can be a soldier, why not Laverne Cox?
Bob's Burgers makes you smile, but please don't ignore
The decline of the independently family-run store
I get it, them finales, they got you focused
Just record the show and try to show up at the protest
The nightly news might feel you with fears and phobias
Calm yourself by watchin' this dystopia
Look on the brightside, Handmaids, at least your healthcare's free
But our future's always brighter on TV
Let's go!
So friends I know that the world may be the worst we've ever seen
But it's never been better on your TV screen
'Cause even though old Kimmy agrees we're up Schmidt's creek
You can just whip out your smartphone and stream shows while you pee
You can binge until your muscles start to atropy
'Til you can't tell the difference between fact and fantasy
Then everything is better on TV
Yes, everything is better on TVAll night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?!
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride!
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
Shut up! Start dancing, hoe!
Start dancing, hoe
Start dancing, hoe
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay...
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up! Start dancing, ho
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay...Screaming burn it down!
Too loud, too dank, for you to turn it down
Bad bitches running round like shirtless now
Shits just perfect now
When it's worth it why the fuck would I get nervous now
So shop with me on Mary
And fuck with me on Sherrif
Puttin' caramel On Garretts
Yellin' "Fuck the heat on Derrick"
I'm a city based N-word
27's, port's and spirit's
Been trying to share that dinner
Can't inherit from your parents
Igh
I was rollin' a blunt when I wrote this
I was smoking a blunt when I spoke this
Hocus Pocus
Hows that for a smoke trick
Couldn't pay attention
Now I can afford focus
Got a lil' Buzz and they got fuckin' bogus
Like how you swat a flying locust?
But it's actually dope...
Acid, adderol and adjectives
An adolescent I could fuck with?
Igh's his fuckin' Ad-lib?
Burn Burn
City we built
You already forgot the names
Of kids that we killed
Burn Burn
It's hot as all fuck
Cause everyone got burner
Cause it's always gettin' buck
IghWelcome Chance, you've got mail
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
Shots like Jordan, I'm sorry
I'm soarin, with these J's that I found
While in the net, surfin'
Those the same color of the last name of Gordon
But these likes that I'm scorin', are way more important
Dude I'm a Mac, what the fuck's your Dell?
Don't be mad at how my wardrobe excels
Word, lookin' for a deal how much I spend yo?
Trust me being fresh, it opens new windows
I'm always fresh and I'm always stuntin'
You're pissed cause I'm fresher than the F5 button
I'm dressed fresh, at the click of a start
After this song I'mma add a few Grammys to my cart
Woah
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer
Hey yo I'm straight off the Netscape
Head to the internet
Log on MySpace, ask the where the women at?
I guess I'm just that type of dude
When I'm at the rest you can catch me on the web like spider food
A pair a nike shoes, nice and new
I got it cuffin' and you other niggas feet bare, like blue
Pretty girls, I keep 'em in bed like the flu
You niggas following, instead we write the rules
Sayin' Mac's 90, and infrared like Sniper 2s
Inside the booth you're recyclin'
It's proof that you dudes can't handle, like unicycles
We fantasy ballin' I'm using Michael
And I can't even call it, but if I had to choose a title
I'd say don't do me I'm an internet explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer, Internet Explorer
Don't do me I'm an Internet ExplorerIgh

I told Def I need a couple mil
They ain't give me the Kanye treatment

I'm going off the top of them words, my nigga
We lost at sea
I'm... Did it really stop?
I'm sorryLove is the casualty of war
My little cousin thought that I ain't love him anymore
Nothin' could be farther from the truth
Here, take this liquor and this Swisher as a truce
I was just mad 'cause you stole
I was mad, but it's old
We gon' talk about it face to face
Forgiveness is the answer and auntie's is the place
Sunday, we goin' to the house
Someone got a problem, they gon' have to kick us out
But if you come, I hope you decide to stay
Just know your big cousin love ya either way
'Cause who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
I love you still, still
I lovе, love, love
Peoplе that they said to never trust
Even if we never stayed in touch
I love you
Love is forgiveness at its core
My cousin think her grandma doesn't love her anymore
Nothin' could be farther from the truth
Take the pictures of your daughter on her wall as the proof
I think she was just mad nobody told her
She thought that you was too young
But your daughter gettin' older
I think y'all should talk about it face to face
Forgiveness is the topic and her house is still the place
Sunday, we back up at the house
Someone got a issue, they gon' have to drag us out
I know they prolly feel some type of way, ah
Someone always got somethin' to say
But who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
She loves you still , still
She loves, loves you
People that we knew was quick to judge
People that would always do to much
We love you still, still
Love is not the sanitized, romanticized soliloquy
That smiles and tries to reconcile without accountability
'Cause justice is the motive, and that's the thing that's missin'
That's the sickness of the culture
The system that was keepin' us from lovin' how we supposed to
The secrets that we keep that keep us comfortable and closer
The silence in the church, when it was violence they would know of
It made us feel like Christ, he didn't like us, didn't know us
But this is the biggest lie the enemy done ever told us
I know he was the shoulder I could hold on like a toga
When others did me vulgar
I'm just lookin' for closure, I know that love is righteous
Love is what is happenin' when someone apologizes
Love is the day that the Grinch's heart grew three sizes
Love is priceless, love is passion
God is loving on you, God is good and God is happenin'
God still love ya, don't believe me? Ask him
'Cause who's to say? Who's to say?
Who's to say? Who's to say?
He loves you still, you still, He loves
You still, He loves you still, you still, you still
People that may think they not enough 
People that may think they are in luck 
He loves, loves you 
Merry ChristmasCome turn up, it's time for all that
Here we go for all that
All that , all that
For thirty minutes, don't touch that dial
Don't interrupt right now 
Tell Mama, "Fall back," 'cause another "All That"
Comin' up right now
Tee hee I like to laugh
Hide the remote right under the cat
Hide my homework inside the dog
 way better than math
Oh, all
All, all that , all that
This is all that
Let me see you, ooh, woo, ooh, let me see you
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, let me see you, ooh, ooh, ooh
All that, all that
Go, Kenan, go, Kel
Go, Chance, Mr_Hotspot
Go, Kenan, go, Kel
Go, Chance, Mr_HotspotNa-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, IGH!
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Okie dokie, alkie, keep it lowkey like Thor lil bro
Or he'll go blow the loudy, saudy of sour Saudi
Wiley up off peyote, wilding like that coyote
If I sip any Henny, my belly just might be outie
Pull up inside a huggy, Starsky & Hutch a dougie
I just opened up the pack in an hour I'll ash my lucky
Tonight she just yelling "fuck me"
Two weeks she'll be yelling fuck me
Used to like orange cassette tapes with Timmy, Tommy, and Chuckie
And Chuck E. Cheese's pizzas, Jesus pieces, sing Jesus love me
Put Visine inside my eyes so my grandma would fucking hug me
Oh generation above me, I know you still remember me
My afro look just like daddy's, y'all taught me how to go hunting 
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank 
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses 
I will smoke a little something but I don't inhale
Everywhere that I go, everywhere they be asking how's it going
Say the going's well, go figure, Victor's light skinned
Jesus got me feeling like Colin Powell, all praise to the God
God knows he's a pro, he's a pro like COINTEL
Check, checkmate, check me take me to the bedroom
Like she know me well, I mean normally
You see Norma Jean wouldn't kick it with Farmer Phil
But these kids these days, they get so high
Burn trees, smoke chlorophyll, 'til they can't feel shit
Shit-faced, faced it, 15 hits on this L
Elevated, train, and the craziest thing
Got me feeling like Lauryn Hill, miseducated, my dick delegated
Rap Bill Bellamy, they said I shoulda never made it
Probably shoulda been dead or in jail
Deadbeat dad, enough of that jazz
Asshole, absinthe, thumpin' that glass
Are we there yet? Ice cubes in a bong
Rip, brain dead, take a tug and then pass
I think we all addicted
Yeah, I think we all addicted
Really though, I think we all addicted
I think we all addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I could make a flow, pitter patter with a patter pitter - juicy
Used to be in a jalabiya and a kufi
Trying hard not to be addicted to a groupie
I ended up on an album cover in a Coogi
You see, I be still a God but a goofy
You be flowing about drugs and a Uzi
That's the dual principle, sometimes I'ma be about some hoes
Sometimes I'ma wanna make a movie
And when it come to rapping fast, I'm the Higgs Boson
And though my style freakish
I could still break your body down to five pieces like I did Voltron
'Cause I'm addicted to the craft and I be off a OG
Know me, I'm the Obi-Wan Kenobi of the dope see
Never scared of mean spirits, methamphetamine lyrics
Cooler like I'm offa codeine, low key
Don't be so judgmental, even though I'm reminiscing
If I don't know what I miss is
I'ma end up figuring out that it's home
And my mother and my grandmother cocoa butter kisses
This is just a testament to the ones that raised me
The ones that I praise and I'm thanking
I need 'em but the chronic all up in my clothes
And I wanna get a hug, and I can't 'cause I'm stanking
Never too old for a spanking, IGH!
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my momma think I stank
I got burn holes in my memories, my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I think we all addicted

I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
Cigarettes on cigarettes, my mama think I stank
I got burn holes in my hoodies, all my homies think it's dank
I miss my cocoa butter kisses
I miss my cocoa butter kissesThey say keep going
He said he came from Hawaii
Then everybody done tried me, I can't go by me
I bypass, look I buy paths
 
I bypass, I've been wrecking mics
I bypass, I've been, I've been wrecking mics since Dreamcast
Dreamcast, I dream fast
That's a disconap, I got a disco gap
This is a real small one
I'm a tall one
I don't follow 'em, but I might fall 'em
In the fall but
You don't wanna fall boy
You don't wanna tall boy
You sippin' on them little cans
Legendary hemwork, check my hot tub pants
The way I stance, I got Jody Husky sing you into a trance
Two of us cost 750 plus a ticket
One point seven, I shoulda got a Prevost
We ball the most
Who gone ball from coast to coast
Who gone sip the playa potion
Who would ride tour bus three motion
I three wheeled a tour bus
I came through just the ten of us, Bentley Bus
Who done did that?
I used to drive a Honda, now I got a Benz backLyrics from Snippet
I can't believe you thought that I was Mr. Perfect
I can't believe you thought that I was even worth it
I swear I look at you sometimes and I get nervous
Conspiracy theories wrapped around your kisses like Hershey's
Our story's so choreographed, it feels like you rehearsed it
I admit I threw my hat in the ring, I'm Michael Jackson
But I figured that your reaction would be allergic
I shot my shot thinkin' before they hang up my number
They'll probably burn my jersey
Call up the pastor clergy
Call up the plastic surgeon
Call 'em the brand new version
Call me whatever you want, just call me back like it's urgent
I learned the art of forgiveness from the son of a virgin
I made so many clean slates that I could sell you detergent
I'm from a city full of finesses and janky merchants
Fragrance in pagan churches
Debt collectors that settle vendetta better in person
I wasn't warned last week, yesterday I was nursing
Can't believe that you thought that I was perfect
My hidden blisters turn to pimples on the surface
I should've known from the beginning I was nervous
You pulled the wool over my eyes just like my shirt 
First day but the next day
Don't have me out here thinking that I'm Neo
Don't have me out here oracle Miss Cleo
Don't have me out here thinking that I'm Superman of Steel
When you know the cap is real like you're familiar with Leo
Ay dios mios while I be a monkey's tio
Standing ovations when I reinve-: We got a special guest with us in the building, Chance the Rapper! Who you got with you Chance?
: This is Donnie Trumpet
: Wassup everybody
: I saw you tweet that out you said "Breakfast Club with Donnie" I said who the hell on this show is named Donnie
: Donnie Trumpet whats up everybody
: Lets start back who is chance because im familiar with you but ive never really heard a song, never heard a verse, so for someone like me who's not up on chance the rapper who are you?
: Alright im the rapper, i'm from chicago. I'm 21
: You're a rapper? I would've never guessed
: Yeah yeah i'm the rapper, but im an artist of sorts and im from chicago, im for the people and i got 2 mixtapes
: Acid Rap is one, that came out a couple years ago
: That would be the one that you know
: Right, the one before that..
: 10 Day: You might know it you might not know it
: Now explain the concept of 10 day
: 10 day was recorded while i was on 10 day suspension from high school
: What'd you do? why you get suspended?
: I had marijuanna, i don't know what the rules are for FM radio. I'm just saying, I had weed, not really a lot of weed,but like on school property i guess
: What like a half a zip, a zip?
: Nah like maybe a quarter, maybe a quarter
: ok were you selling or smoking?
: I was smoking but they were tryna say i had intent to sell, but i didn't i had it in one bag it was for me. It doesn't matter
: Did you tell them you were a user?
: I wasn't really tryna say nothing to em. I didn't know what was incriminating and what was not, so i was chilling but they gave me the suspenion
: Did somebody tell on you, because let me tell you something. When i was in high school, and I probably shouldn't say this-
: That was a long time ago
: -We used to get money when we used to tell on people for having weed
: What? What kinda snitch-
: Paid informant? Damn
: So there were these like lame dudes I know, like what is he doing with weed? I would go tell on them id go to the principal and be like he got weed in his shoe
: So you've always been like this
: Because the lame dudes were tryna act cool and be like "yo look i got weed i got a gun" so we'd tell on them and get money
: wow so you got gun charges for people and everything
: that's messed up
: So did somebody tell on you?
: I hope not that would be crazy if i found out somebody told me that i think it was just the school was into what i was on and stuff so they kinda followed me around.The police officer that was issued to the school kinda randomly checked my lcoker and all types of stuff. And he was actually the one who found me. I was a little bit actually a couple blocks away from school cuz i went to school downtown. So i was in an alley somewhere and the dude just walked up on me grabbed me took me back to the school, made sure the kicked me outta school, then took me the station
: So it was 10 days, and you did a mixtape in the library. There was studio equipment in the library?Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh

Do you like threesomes? Are you into foreplay? 
Prince and MJ, your favorite karaoke
She can make doves cry, Annie, are you okay? 
I just wanna hear you scream 
We be laughin' at the memes
Her mama sixty and still fine
So her genes tight since I hit it
So her genes tight, her ass fat
I might screenshot but she trust me, you know 
We got a love that's custom, you know
They gon' try and get to us like customs, you know
Us is U-S, you just lay down low

'Cause it's all love when we lay down slow
Nah, baby, I got it, got it
Take your feet from the dirt to the sand, you know
First time out in France you know 
Ooh, ooh, ooh-ooh
Postcards and Goyard
When I go in, I go hard

Say bombs away, bombs awayI say my prayers on private planes
I thank God for the drip before he dried the drain
I think twice about the pilot with my hybrid brain
It's like I super-see survival, I'm alive and well
Give to the streets so I can hear them for spider fell
When they were tearin' down my projects like the idol wealth
And I was out here feelin' lower than the height of Hell
I grab the book, and book the trip, I had to look at God
I mean the verse is pretty decent, but the hook is hard
Skim through, skim my need
Skim through, skim my need
Read all the instructions for the brand new construction
The map to the function is just a path to destruction
Exercise your right to be a dyin' breed, and re-reader
All the free thinkers must be readers or retweeters
Our last name heroes and brief leaders were more than just repeaters
All these so-called see so-ers will need reaper
Everyday we tryin' not to be what we've been through
Look at every page, promise never to skim through
Skim through , skim my need
Skim through , skim my need 
Amen, amen
Let it shine
Amen, amen
Amen, amenHey, here in Chicago, it's Chance The Rapper and I'm hanging out with Social Experiment right now. We just want you to have a very safe yet spooky Halloween. You done scared the shit outta me

It's Halloween, let's goWe used to roll at the Rink, we used to roll at the Rink
I used to talk way too much, you used to know everything
You couldn't stand me, I couldn't stand you
You said I'm steady playin', but you steady playin' too
Your big brother foot work
Your play sister Juke
The Rink was the place
But in that space and time I was too young for you
As you were for me, too worried 'bout Frooties and Chews
'Til I found out all the shawdy's with cooties was cute
And realized what booties could do
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Came up with for the weekend
Rolling with your parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
We never rolled at the Rink
We would just go to the Rink
You ain't buy tokens no more
You just hip roll at the Rink
You had a nigga, I couldn't stand him
But when they play "Take You Down", Chris Brown
I am his stand-in
I mean it's just dancing
It's harmless as fuck
Then I put my waist through your hips
And your legs and my arms just to harness you up
Then we hit the floor
All the kiddies stop skating
To see grown folks do, what grown folks do
When they grown and they dating
We've got so much history baby, maybe
Maybe you and I were meant to be
Maybe I'm crazy
Crazy about you
We gon' get it poppin'
We gon' get it Jukin'
We gon' throw a party
We ain't gotta do shit
You came with your best friend
Who came up for the weekend
Rollin with the parties
So tell me what you thinkin'
So we gon' have a juke jam
So we gon' have a juke jam
We can have a party, just listening to music
Like we used to do
I'll get close to you
I remember you
You used to "I remember you"
We've got so much history baby 
Maybe Lyrics from Snippet
I got money everybody gettin' jobs for
Good job, good job
Good ass, good ass jobBack home you get cash, you pistachio
They crack shells while you get gas
You get too flashy, get a camera roll
Come to your potluck with a casserole
Name new strains that make your casket roll
Turn your city into your Grassy Knoll
Nobody drive around with their top back
Every time they shootout on the highway, niggas shot back
Every séance and tribute never brought Pac back
I sometimes have dreams about a city where the cops black
But then I gotta stop that
I remember how few niggas in Atlanta jails is not black
I probably catch a co--Bartending is heart-wrenching, ain't it?
The art in it is hard, can you paint it?
I mean, I got a small idea of what it'd be like
To be out in the streets longer than the streetlights
To overhear what people say when over the limit
I bet they overstepped their boundaries like you opened a clinic
Leave it all on the table like they over for dinner
And you just listen, you probably give them tips, should be the other way around
I seem to know my way around, though I'm in from out of town
I don't need to use an Uber, in Cuba we boat 'round
Both sound funny usin' somebody else's language
Maybe that's why this such a comfortable conversation
Maybe that's why I feel like me and you isn't strangers, shit, maybe you dangerous
I mean, you name-less, but you seem familiar
Me sippin' or pills, or smokin' down to the filter
I hope it's on the house like a sold sign from a realtor
Real talk, I know that you been here for some time
Don't wanna end up around some spirits and wine
I know patrons always cryin' every time that they dine
I'll be out your head soon, get it? I'm just playin'
Cheers, everybody knows your name
I ain't here to talk your ear off, I just need a little game
It's just me against the world, I know some things will never change
Oh man, I just need to know how it works
Oh man, I just need to know why it hurts
Oh man, I used to rock a nose ring
Oh man, I just need to know the whole thing
Oh man, I just need to keep your head up
Oh man, I know that this thing is sped up
Oh man, you can tell I had a bad night
I just need a little advice
Ambitions of a hider, I got an invisibility cloak on my rider
Tour got more legs that a spider

I pack up every single thing in a suitcase
Your papa goin' trippin', he forgot to tie his shoelace
Don't worry baby, it won't be no case, I need a new face

Don't believe a thing said on Twitter or the news
You know that the people that do anything for views
You know that your daddy is a good man
If your father had to gun 'em, then them niggas had it coming
I just wanna barbecue a blunt inside my habitat
I just wanna sit back reminiscing over Acid Rap
I just want a big suburban house and a little Cadillac
Laugh at how I turned into an aristocrat from alley cat
Allocatin' funds over alligator ponds
And my kids spitting image like a salivating tongue
Had to calibrate my mind, spend some time with my daughter
Got a lawyer that could turn a murder on a manslaughter, that's the truth
I pack up every single thing in a suitcase
Your papa goin' trippin', he forgot to tie his shoelace
Don't worry baby, it won't be no case, I need a new face
I promise I'll be back by Wednesday, if not by then Tuesday

Vodka in my Redbull can, very formal
Shot a porno on a red bull can
Don't be jealous that's the shit that got the devil Dan
Yeah, you got one bigger nigga I got cero hairs
Cheers and dash and dash and Detroit at your rescue, man
But you love the way I treat you extra, and

And I ate Cheerios for dinner
I broke like 40 balls I'm a cereal bowl killa
Manilla
Fear in an animal
They like "Channo, you're an animal!"
Here's a bunch mushrooms run in the woods and go find ya spirit animal
Um
Hard to devour
Our hearts turnin' sour
I wanna put my twins in a tower so I can hoop my basement and swim in my shower
Choke hold in my wine glass
Propose a toast to the noggin'
I got holes in my socks and coal in my stockin'
Channo was on dirt with all the  kids that shot him
So I rode to the North Pole with a poll and I shot him
Batman, Gotham, Autumn
I oughta start selling em'
But I didn't earn that

But you already know I'm a hundred grand, and I wanted to extend this prayer, extend this love, extend this love, all the way from Britain. We might come back early to come and see this man. Happy Thanksgiving.Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Lazy male
Complainin' 'bout how high school he could
But his ACL
Aye, 
You're my daddy, how
You just a uncle from ATL
You better take out that trash
Boy, get your big
Grown ass on
Old ass on
Broke ass drinkin' up all the milk
But can't do no laundry
EHarmony romance on
Watch your tone, folk
Talkin' to grown folk
Yeah, get that bass out your voice
You was soundin' like Tone Loc
Now watch how I move
Different chapters
Decision's mission
Visit pastors
Everybody finally can say it out loud
Your favorite rapper a Christian rapper
And I got faith in my fate
In my soul, in my tape
In the cape, in the drape
From out West to the lake
Then cover his face like a Bape
And I hate when I wait
Never come late
Tobacco back Rolls
To bus seat back rows
To black boy black Rolls
Black Rolls
Men grow just as surely as mountain's peak
And plateaus plateau, you know what I mean?
You just a grown ass kid
Who the fuck you think you is
The sun is only halfway up
You still ain't come out your crib
You just a grown ass boy
Get up out o' here with all that noise
You still ain't come out your crib*Lyrics from Snippet*
Oh no
No, baby I won't
No, baby I don't know
Who they are
No baby I won't
No baby I won't
So no way hm
Oh, everybody owe me favors
Everybody should be on their best behaviors
My security say, "Shit, we have to wave her"
I say, "Shit, I done forgave her"
Make sure she signed a waiver
Just in case we use your taser
It ain't much that I can't pay for
It ain't shit that I don't pray for
And my coupon is a savior
Yeah, that faction made me paper
Yeah that ass done made me crazy
But that baptist made me safer
I don't need to be the mayor
I just need to raise the next one off...Everybody outside, everybody outside
When I pull up outside, all night, no
Everybody high five, everybody wanna smile
Everybody wanna lie, that's nice, no
Oh, now you wanna chill, oh, now you wanna build
Oh, now you got the bill, that's cool though
Oh, now you got the gas, oh, now you wanna laugh
Oh, now you need a cab, that's true though
All you do is talk, I ain't got shit to say
Can't no one get in my car, I don't even valet
Long discussions, oh, you my cousin?
No you wasn't, you just wanna ride
You just wanna talk about politics, Chicago shit and rocket ships
Shut up! Start dancing, ho
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, hey
All night, I been drinking all night
I been drinking all night, I been drinking, ay ay
You just went and spilt fries in the seat
It's fried on the seat, come ride on the seat, ay
Last girl, she'll lie on the seat, she'll fart on the seat
Now she jog in the streets, say
I don't trust no one faking like a fan, asking for a pic
You should use your phone, call a Uber
You a goofy if you think I don't know you need a lyft
Is you is or is you ain't got gas money
No IOU's or debit cards, I need cash money
So back up, back up, I need space
Now, I need you to slow down, it's not a race
Now I can't really hear what you gotta say now
Shut up!

I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh
Uh, here’s a tab of acid for your ear
You’re the plastic, I’m the passion and the magic in the air
The flabbergasted avalanche of ambulances near
The labyrinth of Pan’s Lab is adamantly here
No assignments, book of rhyming and I’m drawing doodles
I should rhyme rhyme with Ramen Noodles
Ramadan, I’m the don of the diamond jewels
Fond of finding a way to kindly tell these toddlers toodles
I’m a kamikaze and I’m kinda cuckoo
I could write a fucking book, non-Kamasutral
You niggas goofies, it's a conflict that is kinda crucial
Caught you on the 9 in all blue yelling, "I’m a neutral"
But I’ma let the bull pass like matadors
Versus a Minotaur, verse is a metaphor
Metamorphoses and I’m a fuckin animorph
I used to go to school with Anna Fedele and Danny Whorf
Remember I used to bang with the bad ones
'Til my grandmama told on her grandson
Mama said that I was way too handsome
To be throwing the hand’s son, breaking walls like Samson
But I’ma throw a tantrum 'til I’m on every Samsung
Sanyo and handheld and handgun
Please put ya lighter’s up 'til life is up, then light it up
And slice a cut, the night is young, it’s nice enough
The nicest blunt, the nicest stuff
My niggas out here trapping a lot
I know you think you on, hiding Reggie sacks in your socks
I hang with niggas, whole jab in the jock
.4’s for 15, yeah my niggas, we be taxing a lot
Only the goofies, though, choking on a doobie, though
My eyes do be low, two be rolled, remember days of the Rufio
Remember the Days of Chan-Man and the Skeeter Man
Brrang dang to Lil' B and bang a-rang to Peter Pan
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down, uh
Light a joint, or spliff it if you classy
Split a swisha witcha nigga if you ask me
Ain't no questions, hit it vividly and pass me
Don’t answer about your problems
Or your issues or your athletes
It’s a quarter to imminent, ten minutes to infinite
Rims, Henny, and reminisce, nostalgia and M&M's
Cinnamon tone women and feminine’s getting intimate
All broads is frivolous and homies could get they dividends
Damn, is he illiterate, literal syndicate
Illegitimate, idiot, gangbanger-affiliate
Sick twisted prick, dick sadistic
Son of a biscuit, man fuck this shit, uh
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now, oh no
I burned too many brain cells down
To be worried 'bout my brain cells now
I burned too many brain cells down
Down, down, down-down
Oh no, no, no
Oh no, no
Oh no, no, no, no
And this is my 10 Day
This is my 10 Day, oh no
Welcome 10 Day

        People try to come at me and like
On some like, I only write slow songs
And I only write...church and
How many of y'all are messing with me with a pen, period?
I'm a writer, probably as good as Elton John
But whats writing good for if it ain't helping moms?
I'm tryna feed Japan while seeing sights of Lebanon
And wiping away tears of girls that's getting felted on
I'm tryna get my felt pen on but the block is hot
My hands is questioning if I'm bach or not
If I'm 2Pac or nonexistent to these juggernauts
But I'm a architect an astronaut an argonaut
So hey, you, get off my couch
You don't know me sta out my mouth
But I'm a writer you can quote it out loud
A false poet get my dough and I'm out
But here's an eighth of shrooms for your earlobe
A little rap
A little bit of Wu-Tang, mixed with some Henry David Thoreau
A little ponder theory you can ponder on your pillow
But this is for the day that your dad dies
But for some reason all you hearing is sad sighs
You searchin' for nostalgia but sad and you can't cry
So you check your iPod in search for some bad vibes
From that rap guy, who raps over sad vibes
I wrote it in an hour dawg, don't know what your dad's like
He probably was a great dad, he's probably in paradise
You want deeply in heartbreak and sadly I can't write, nothing
This is for those who wrote suicide notes
And all the hipster girls that was super fly dope
You looking at her nose what you do besides coke
You looking at her palms what you do besides dope
Nothing, life is but a supersized note
I open up my mind like suicide door
And grab a pimp cane and a superfly coat
Have they bobbing they heads to something stupid I wrote
I hope4 or 5 hours on the road
I was doin' doughs, I was gettin' golds
I was in Africa, I was gettin' gold
I was with Nate, Nate said wait
Put it on a steak, put it on a plate
Call up my homies in another state
Gettin' hella great
Gettin' hella cheese, put it on a grate
That's shredded cheese
FWOOSH!!!Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'
I need ya, woman
You should know I don't play about 
You should know I don't play about 
You should know I don't play about 
 don't go changing up your plans
Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'
I need ya, woman
Then show me what you got
Don't think too much, just let it rock
You got one night, let's make the most of
Drinkin' more than we supposed to
Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'
I need ya, woman
Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'
I need ya, woman
Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'
I need ya, woman
Just light it up
I'm burnin' for ya
Give me your lovin'

Please may you hurry up on eating your ice-cream sundé?

Slingshot, is it in my hight? 
You know?

Sí, I said I won't ever dare worrying about it, heyy

*Decline*-moody when the dope freeze
They be sayin’ “Bino, this is your season!”
Y’all got’ to put up to shut up
I got the shit out the gutter
Watch out, my freestyle come up
Y’all know shit ain’t been fair
Y’all got Venalot skincare
Y’all make a good nigga feel embarrassed
Talk good like a nigga had ten parents
It’s all good like Rugrats in Paris
I just really like Rugrats in Paris
Me and my baby momma, we shoulda been married
Instead of tryna play God like I was Jim Carrey
Wasted all of my time inside a zoo just to end up vegan
All these farm animals prolly miss me tweakin’
All my kids gon’ be legends Chrissy Teigen’sYou got the right idea, girl
You got the right plan
You got the right kid, girl
You got the right man
I want an IKEA
Wanna get those nightstands
Turn to one night stands
To a fucking life plan
Thank God for you
And if you forget
I'll thank God for you
For you
Tell me whats the thread count
I want so many kids
They need a buddy system
And a head count
It'd be some dead clowns
I'm from the wishing nigga was
I want the kind of smoke that make the swisher switch to wood
Papa don't preach
I acquire niggas that got carpets
Plastered in bleach
I'm a mobster but I still pronounce
The salad Caprese
I take most of the water out the ramen
So it's kinda like a pasta Capisce?
I'm a dolphin that breached
You a dolphin that's beached
You a coffin that breathes
You be coughing and bleed
You a foster kid
I offer help to orphans in need
I would never send you off
You better off
I Thank God for you
And if you forget
I'll thank God for you
For you:
Bartending is heart wrenching ain’t it?
The art in it is hard, can you paint it?
I mean I got a small idea of what it be like
To be out in the streets longer than the street lights
To overhear what people say when over the limit
I bet they overstep their boundaries like you opened a clinic
Leave it all on the table like they over for dinner
And you just listen you probably give em tips, should be the other way around
I seem to know my way around
Though I’m in from out of town
I don’t need to use a Uber
In Cuba we boat ‘round
Both sound funny using somebody else’s language
Maybe that’s why this such a comfortable conversation
Maybe that’s why I feel like me and you isn’t strangers
Shit, maybe you dangerous
I mean you nameless but seem familiar
Beats up in the pills and smoking down to the filter
I hope it’s on the house like a sold sign from a realtor
Real talk I know that you’ve been here for sometime
Don’t want to end up stuck around some spirits and wine
I know patience always crying every time that they dying
I’ll be out your hair soon, get it? I’m just playing
Cheers, everybody knows your name
I ain’t here to talk your ear off i just need a little game
It’s just me against the world I know somethings will
Never change
:
Old man, I just need to know how it works
Old man, I just need to know why it hurts
Old man, I used to rock a nose ring
Old man, I just need to know the whole thing
Old man, I just need to keep your head up
Old man, I know that this thing sped up
Old man, you can tell I had a bad night
I just need a little advice
:
Ambitions of a hider
I got invisibility cloak on my rider
Tua got... more legs than a spiderShe could say in her voice
In her way that she love me
With her eyes, with her smile
With her belt, with her hands, with her money
I am the thesis of her prayers
Her nieces and her nephews are just pieces of the layers
Only ones she love as much as me is Jesus Christ and Taylor
I got a future so I'm singing for my grandma
You singing too, but your grandma ain't my grandma
Mine's hand made, pan fried, sun dried
Southside, and beat the devil by a landslide
Praying with her hands tied, president of my fan club, Santa
Something told me I should bring my butt to church
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
Come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house, cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion, it's gonna rain
I come to church for the candy, your peppermints is the truth
I'm pessimistic on Monday if I had tweaked and missed you
You look so good with that hat on, had to match with the shoes
Came and dressed in the satin, I came and sat in your pew
I come to Christmas for dinner, fifty rolls on my plate
Hella holes in my stocking holding your pockets in place
I like my love with a budget, I like my hugs with a scent
You smell like light, gas, water, electricity, rent
You sound like why the gospel got so tired
Singin' his praises daily basis so I gotta try it
You're my dreamcatcher, dream team, team captain
Matter fact, I ain't seen you in a minute let me take my butt to church
]
You better come on in this house
Cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion
Cause it's gonna rain
You better come on in this house
Cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain

You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
You gotta move it slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
Slowly
Take and eat my body like it's holy
I've been waiting for you for the whole week
I've been praying for you you're my Sunday Candy
You better come on in this house

Rain down Zion
It's gonna rain
You better come on in this house
Cause it's gonna rain
Rain down Zion
It's gonna rainSomeone said we just a buncha insignificant slobs
Scattered blips without a intricate plot
Untethered, independent from effect or a cause
When you finna get robbed, would you rather have a gun or have God?
Everybody got two knees to drop to, few D's in high school
Two eyes to watch you, impeach you
My children sneeze, like, "Achoo," say cheese
They gotchu teen mad, they not you
Bench press, they spot you
Difference in the have and have nots
The timin' of havin' was not lifetime to have jobs
When you lookin' at the bills and you can't afford all your bills
Tell me, really, would you rather have a gun or have God?
I done tip-toed up and down the shadowed path
Seen the type of fights that make you tear up like a battled past
Backpackin', battle, uphill in a avalanche
Reached out the olive branch, turned down the apple branch
Poured up some apple cran', turned up the apple store
Turned it into apple core 'till they didn't have no more
But I didn't have none of that when my auntie had died
Would you rather have a gun or have God?
You wanna pray to the universe, end up leavin' like Juniper
I heard men that fall in love with world are usually from Jupiter
Conversations are super current, the truth is the super sermon
The Ubers are two Suburbans, the bills is on Uma Thurman
And life is a breeze, and your lungs is on breathe
And your heat is on beat, and it's shit on your fleas
And its shoes on your feet, and its love in your heart
Tell me, really, would you rather have a gun or have God?
Would you rather have a gun or have God?I got a friend and her name is Kaya
Real real weird but she is quite the styler
She just won't stop Airpodding and vibing
Cuz she ain't a patient she's the CEO of simping
I meant to say Peppa, got the wrong idea
Cruising in your heelies , proof you're a trendsetter
Balenciagas, fake but your the best actor
You look like your T-Bone, oops, the bagels staler
Ooh, ooh, stale, stale
But the boys are still biting
Tessier on Halloween?
Bout to flex creativity-ty-ty
Craft, I want to see you win
But instead you got second, I’ma kill the first full send
Hot friend, hot Kaya, Happy Birthday
So happy, to have met, you at the SAE
Both Polish, yeah, I call you pierogi
And I know we gonna have, lots of fun in times a coming
I got muscles like Superman's trainer, ayy 
Real real rare like Super Saiyan manga
I jump stomp-stomp on Lucifer, Satan 
Now I got a few rings on, Jupiter skating 
I meant to say Saturn, switched up the pattern 
Smoking on some shatter 
Got me higher than a ladder 
Thanks, I'm flattered, my baby mama badder 
You look like Mick Jagger, oops, the grease splattered 
Hot, hot 
Jumping out the grease
It's a whole lotta degrees
'Bout to come up out the fleece, fleece, fleece

Tryna catch some sleep , tryna count some sheep 
Hot damn, hot water, hot shower 
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower 
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour 
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour
Dude, I just called the plug and his phone was unplugged
I was lookin' at Doug like 
Dude, that shit don't even make no fucking sense
Like having fuckin' arguments for payin' fifty extra cents for barbecue
Saucing on the workers at McDonald's
I don't wanna sit and argue, Good Burger shoulda taught you
We all dudes
And I'm all professional and proper
But my baby mama stopped me in a meeting 
Just to AirDrop me some nudes
Hot damn, hot water, hot shower 
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower

This the second round, I'm tryna speed more 
Going stupid, going crazy 
Big gas in that Mercedes 
Pull up lit, uh, going 30 
Pull up Vic, uh, in a hurry 
Shoot your shot, uh, flex a lot 
Big cheese, uh, hella knots 
Chopped and screwed, Michael Watts 
Point 'em out, air 'em out 
Get me right, sippin' Sprite 
180, halfpipe 
Ooh
Hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour
Goddamn
Think I got a new lawsuit, I need to come see you 
I got a new whip, you know what a car do
Turn your bitch to a eater 
She say we don't got enough room to get freaky in here
'Cause it's just a two-seater 
Am I still considered a trick if I get her a hoopty
And buy me a Bimmer? 
I had a new case but the judge had to throw it out
My lawyer beat it like Tina
I always find a way to get ahead with my intelligence
When they critique my demeanor 
Today I'll dress up a Republican 
And go get some head from a white man's daughter
Her lips aren't big but I'm loving it 
I get in, fake ID, I'm McLovin it 
BDB ENT like the government 
Except for the cops , mission impossible
Strapped with the Glock, Danny Gloverin'
Tip a hundred if you let my cousin in
You know everybody my cousin 
Oh yeah, and I gotta be thuggin' it
'Cause my hair can get nappy as fuck
I wear jewelry and I got that chocolate coloring
Well at least, like you know, that's what they make me feel like
Why they make you feel like that?
I don't know, I mean it's America, right?
Ooh, hot damn, hot water, hot shower
Hotlanta, smoking green, cauliflower 
Tangerine, yeah, I call her sweet and sour
And my lawyer say it's urgent, I'ma call him in a hour
