Am I more than you bargained for yet?
I've been dying to tell you anything you want to hear
'Cause that's just who I am this week
Lie in the grass next to the mausoleum
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Is this more than you bargained for yet?
Oh, don't mind me, I'm watching you two from the closet
Wishing to be the friction in your jeans
Isn't it messed up how I'm just dying to be him?
I'm just a notch in your bedpost but you're just a line in a song
Drop a heart, break a name
We're always sleeping in and sleeping for the wrong team
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
Down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're going down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round 
And sugar, we're going down swinging 
I'll be your number one with a bullet 
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down 
Down, down 
We're going down, down 
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull it
We're going down, down in an earlier round 
And sugar, we're going down swinging 
I'll be your number one with a bullet 
A loaded God complex, cock it and pull itDu du du du-du du du
Du du du du du-du du du
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
We’ve been here forever
And here’s the frozen proof
I could scream forever
We are the poisoned youth
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries
And just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuriesI can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench of summer sex
And CK Eternity - oh Hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh, I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
You'll find your way
And may death find you alive
Take me down the line
In Gem City we turn the tide
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Ooh, oh, oh I'll keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apartI'm going to make it bend and break
 Say a prayer, but let the
Good times roll, in case God doesn't show
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?" If that's the worst you've got
Better put your fingers back to the keys...
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal
Ball...
It's always cloudy except for 
When you look into the past 
One night stand...
One night stand off!
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms, collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter," whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you
Only sweeter"
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
 "See, he tastes like you
Only sweeter," whoa...Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
B-B-Be careful making wishes in the dark, dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean-meantime, I'm just
Dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the de-details with the devil
So now, the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out the cage, I'm a young lover's rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
But my songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
The writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just died 
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides, my childhood
Spat back out the monster that you see
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
So light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
Light 'em up, up, up
I'm on fire!
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohh
In the dark, dark
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oohohhI was just an only child of the universe
And then I found you, and then I found you
You are the sun and I am just the planets
Spinning around you, spinning around you
You were too good to be true, gold plated
But what's inside you? But what's inside you?
I know this whole damn city thinks it needs you
But not as much as I do, as much as I do, yeah
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
I am a collapsing star with tunnel vision
But only for you, but only for you
My head is stripped, just like a screw that's been tightened too many times
When I think of you, when I think of you
I will shield you from the waves if they find you
I will protect you, I will protect you
Just tell me, tell me, tell me I, I am the only one
Even if it's not true, even if it's not true, yeah
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of...
I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm here, at the beginning of the end
Oh, the end of infinity with you
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
Oh, you drain all the fear from me
I'm done with having dreams, the thing that I believe
You drain the fear from me
'Cause you're the last of a dying breed
Write our names in the wet concrete
I wonder if your therapist knows
Everything about me
I'm here in search of your glory
There's been a million before me
That ultra-kind of love
You never walk away from
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real ones
You're just the last of the real onesI think I got too many memories getting in the way of me
I'm 'bout to go Tonya Harding on the whole world's knee
And I'm stuck, night vision, so stuck, night vision
But I come to life, come to life
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Seems like the whole damn world went and lost its mind
And all my childhood heroes have fallen off or died
Fake tears, real living, fake tears
But the alcohol never lies, never lies
Some princes don't become kings
Even at the best of times I'm out of my mind
You only get what you grieve, are you smelling that shit?
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistance
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
The only thing that's ever stopping me is me, hey!
I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah

I testify if I die in my sleep
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Then know that my life was just a killer dream, yeah
Are you smelling that shit? Eau de résistanceShe says she's no good
With words, but I'm worse
Barely stuttered out
A joke of a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too
Overdramatic
Tonight, it's "it can't get much worse"
Versus "No one should ever feel like..."
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by 
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
You always fold just
Before you're found out
Drink up, it's last call, last resort
But only the first mistake, and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't want to forget how your voice sounds
These words are all I have so I write them
So you need them just to get by
Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me the little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress 
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love 
Dance, this is the way they'd love 
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...
Dance, dance, dance, dance
Dance, dance, dance, danceI was, I was, I was, I was
Gonna say something that would solve all our problems
But then I got drunk and I forgot what I was talking about
I forgot what I was talking about
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody
There's nothing more cruel than to be loved by everybody but you
Than to be loved by everybody but you, but you
If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Woke up on the wrong side of p-p-paradise
And when I say I'm sorry I'm late
I wasn't showing up at all
I really mean I didn't plan on showing up at all
Don't you, don't you, don't you know
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended
I hate all my friends, I miss the days when I pretended with you
I miss the days when I pretended with you, with you
If I can get my shit together, I'm gonna run away and never see
Any of you again, never see any of you again
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number, but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
If we hadn't done this thing
I think I'd be a medicine man
So I could get high on our own
Supply whenever I can
And I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape from trying to fit in
I became such a strange shape
Such a strange shape
I hope the roof flies off and we get blown out into space
I always make such expensive mistakes
I know it's just a number but you're the 8th wonder
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
When they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker color
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black, I'll stop wearing black
Whoa, whoa, whoa
I'll stop wearing black when they make a darker colorPut on your war paint
You are a brick tied to me that's dragging me down
Strike a match and I'll burn you to the ground
We are the jack-o-lanterns in July
Setting fire to the sky
Here, here comes this rising tide so come on
Cross walks and crossed hearts and hope to die
Silver clouds with grey linings
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Bring home the boys in scraps, scrap metal the tanks
Get hitched make a career out of robbing banks
Because the world is just a teller and we are wearing black masks
"You broke our spirit," says the note we pass
So we can take the world back from the heart-attacked
One maniac at a time we will take it back
You know time crawls on when you're waiting for the song to start
So dance alone to the beat of your heart
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No, I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paint
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
The war is won before it's begun
Release the doves, surrender love
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Wearing our vintage misery
No I think it looked a little better on me
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Hey, young blood, doesn't it feel
Like our time is running out?
I'm going to change you like a remix
Then I'll raise you like a phoenix
Put on your war paintOh na na na na na na na na na na
I never really feel a thing, I'm just kinda too froze
You were the only one, that even kinda came close
I just pinch myself, no longer comatose
I woke up, no luck, I woke up, no luck
And when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
I got too high again, realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend, I love you to death, but I just can't
I just can't pretend, we were lovers first
Confidants but never friends, were we ever friends?
But when your stitch comes loose, I wanna sleep on
Every piece of fuzz and stuffing that comes out of you
You, I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no, this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don't
Cause I'm past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife
Past the limits
The distance between us, it sharpens me like a knife
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
I'm pretty sure that this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight, hold me tight, hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na naWe've gone way too fast for way too long
And we were never supposed to make it half this far
And I lived so much life, lived so much life
I think that God is gonna have to kill me twice
Kill me twice like my name was Nikki Sixx
I woke up in my shoes again but somewhere you exist singing
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace
]
Young and a menace
Woke up on the wrong side of reality
And there's a madness that's just coursing right through me
And as far as the time, far as the time
Not sure I'm there yet but I'm certain I've arrived
Oops I, did it again, I forgot what I was losing my mind about
Oh, I only wrote this down to make you press rewind
And send a message: I was young and a menace
]
Young and a menace
I’m just here flying off the deep end
I'm just here to become the best yet
I'm just here for the psych assessment
I'm just here for the... For the...
Fall!
]
Young and a menace
We've gone way too fast for way too longComing in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'til the end
This one might be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it, baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-four letter name
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey, I don't know
What you're doing to me,  mon chéri
But the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war
And I still love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, oh yeah
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way , I love the way 
I love the way you hurt me, babyChampion, champion
I'm calling you from the future
To let you know we've made a mistake
And there's a fog from the past that's giving me, giving me
Such a headache
And I'm back with a madness, I'm a champion
Of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside
I got nothing but dreams
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in, yeah
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
Champion, champion
Champion, champion
I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill the time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light
I'm trying to blow out the light
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
Champion, champion, I can do anything
Champion, champion, and I can do anything
Champion, champion, and I can do anything
Champion, champion, I can do anything!
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I can do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this, I could do anything
If I can live through this, if I can live through this
If I can live through this
Champion, championStuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alrightThey say we are what we are, but we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher  of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t
'Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals
Immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again every day
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures
Oh, I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass, glass, glass
Oh, I try to picture me without you, but I can’t
Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortals
And live with me forever now
Pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor—immortals, immor—immortals
Immor—immortals, immor—immortals, immortalsIf you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
Take the pain, make it billboard
Big and swallow it for me
Time capsule for the future
Trust me, that's what I will be
Oh, the things that you do in the
Name of what you love
You are doomed but just enough
You are doomed but just enough
If you were church, whoo, I'd get on my knees, yeah
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
I love the world, but I just don't love the
Way it makes me feel
Got a few more fake friends and
It's getting hard to know what's real
And if death is the last appointment
Then we're all just sitting in the waiting room 
I am just a human trying to
Avoid my certain doom
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, yeah, oh
I'd get on my knees, ah ah ah

If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees, yeahChampion
Champion
Champion
Yo, should I be a star? Baby, I think I already are
Not a saint, not that great, feel like I was born a car
In '94, the world started me and I've been driving
Sometimes a man just can't open his car, and
Ain't gotta be somebody, be anybody
Rather be anybody than live in a dead body
If you can't see me then find a helicopter
In the night sky, shine like a star
And I'm back with a madness
I'm a champion of the people who don't believe in champions
I got nothing but dreams inside
I got nothing but dreams
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe in
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
If I can live through this
I can do anything
Champion, champion
I can do anything
Champion, champion
I got rage every day, on the inside
The only thing I do is sit around and kill time
I'm trying to blow out the pilot light
I'm trying to blow out the light
I'm just young enough to still believe, still believe
But young enough not to know what to believe in
Young enough not to know what to believe
If I can live through this

Have you ever felt how hard it is to be an anybody
To be living, to be breathing, not choosing a dead body
Remember, the man told me that this life is a party
Yeah, all the glory's so short you should put away the garbages
Normal ain't normal, ordinary is a luxury
People say "Woo, pessimism" what the other mean?
If you wanna understand, you stand under
This shit is vital, respect to the mothers and fathers
What's wrong with the life of a passenger
If somebody gotta be, then I'mma be the messenger
I'm just too young, don't know what to believe in
But too young, you know, not to be living
I will stay, I will wait and I'll fight like a king
Even though I can forever ever be a king
I will marry this goddamn world, by my own
And put myself on a goddamn ring
If I can live through this
If I can live through this

I can do anything I can
Do anything, anything, yeah

Champion, championI don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the end
Say, yeah,  let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lungs

Cut me off, I lost my track, it's not my fault, I'm a maniac
It's not funny anymore, no it's not
My heart is like a stallion, they love it more when it's broken
Do you wanna feel beautiful, do you wanna, yeah
I'm outside the door, invite me in
So we can go back and play pretend
I'm on deck, I'm up next
Tonight I'm high as a private jet, cause
I don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going

I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow if I don't wake up dead"
This is the road to ruin and we're starting at the endHave you ever wanted to disappear?
And join a monastery, go out and preach on Manic Street?
Who will I be when I wake up next to a stranger
On a passenger plane? 
Oh, permanent jet lag, please take me back 
Please take me back, oh ohh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in , the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine 
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in
It feels like fourteen carats, but no clarity, when I look at the
Man who would be king, the man who would be king
Goes to the desert, the same war his dad rehearsed
Came back with flags on coffins and said, "We won, oh, we won"
Permanent jet lag, please take me back 
Please take me back, oh ooh, I'm a stray dog
Sick, please let me in , the mad key's
Tripping, singing vows before we exchange smoke rings
Give me a pen, call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I wanna blow off steam
And call me Mr. Benzedrine 
But don't let the doctor , don't let the doctor in 
Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh
Ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, bla bla bla Benzedrine
Ba ba ba ba ba Benzedrine, ahh
Only one book really matters, the rest
Of the proof is on the television, on the
Woo! Call me Mr. Benzedrine
But don't let the doctor in, I want to blow off steam
Call me Mr. Benzedrine 
But don't let the doctor, don't let the doctor in, oh, uh huh, ooh...
Have you ever wanted to disappear?
It's not me, it's you
Actually, it's the taxidermy of you and me
Untie the balloons from around my neck
And ground me
I'm just a racehorse on the track
Send me back to the glue factory
Always thought I'd float away
And never come back
But I've got enough miles on my card
To fly the boys home on my own
But you know me, I like being all alone
And keeping you all alone
And the charts are boring, and the kids are snoring
And my ego's in a sling
You say you're not listening and I said I'm wishing
And I said... I said!I thought of angels choking on their halos
Get them drunk on rose water 
See how dirty I can get them pulling out their fragile teeth
And clip their tiny wings 
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
Letting people down is my thing, baby, find yourself a new gig
This town ain’t big enough for two of us
I don’t have the right name or the right looks 
But I have twice the heart
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name, it will be held against you
Anything you say can and will be held against you
So only say my name 
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
If I spilled my guts
The world would never look at you the same way
And now I’m here to give you all of my love 
So I can watch your face as I take it all away 
If heaven’s grief brings hell’s rain
Then I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
I want to teach you a lesson in the worst kind of way
Still I’d trade all my tomorrows for just one yesterday
For just one yesterday
For just one yesterday

Whoa-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohOne look from you and I'm on that faded love
Out of my body and flying above
If there were any more left of me, I'd give it to you
And I'll tell you that I am fine, but I'm a missile that's guided to you
Go out in the world to start over again and again
As many times as ya can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Would you give me, give me, give me
Give me a boost, a boost over heaven's gate, yeah
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate
I got dreams of my own, but I want to make yours come true
So please come through, honey please, please come through
Oh, go out in the world, start over again and again
As many times as you can
And in the end, if I don't make it on the list
Would you sneak me a wristband?
Give me a boost, a boost over heaven's gate, yeah

You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one habit I just can't kick
You're the one, you're the one, you're the one, you're the one

Give me a boost over heaven's gate, I'm gonna need a boost
'Cause everything else is a substitute for your love
Give me a boost over heaven's gate, give me a boost...I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch, whoa...
You'll never catch us, so just let me be
Said, "I'll be fine 'til the hospital or American embassy"
Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you, oh, whoa...
They say the captain goes down with the ship
So when the world ends, will God go down with it?
Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
Yeah, Miss Flack said, "I still want you back"
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you...
What a catch, what a catch, what a catch, what a catch, whoa...
I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar, this way you will
Always know
I said, I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch
And all I can think of is the way I'm the one who charmed the one
Who gave up on you, who gave up on you
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town...
We're going down, down in an earlier round
And sugar, we're goin' down swinging
I'll be your number one with a bullet
A loaded god complex, cock it and pull it...
Dance, dance, we're falling apart to halftime
Dance, dance, and these are the lives you'd love to lead
Dance, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me...
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race...
One night, yeah and one more time
Thanks for the memories, even though they weren't so great
He tastes like you
Only sweeter...
Growing up
Growing up...
I got troubled thoughts and the self-esteem to match
What a catch, what a catch...I'm coming apart at the seams
Pitching myself for leads in other people's dreams
Now buzz, buzz, buzz
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Doc, there's a hole where something was
Fell out of bed, butterfly bandage, but don't worry
You'll never remember, your head is far too blurry
Put him in the back of a squad car, restrain that man
He needs his head put through a CAT scan
Hey editor, I'm undeniable
Hey Doctor, I'm certifiable
Oh, I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet
So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Little girl, got me staring odd
Or was that just a telescopic camera nod
P-p-painted dolls in the highway, truck stop stalls
Lot lizards scales cool my nightlife moods
All the rookies, leave your badge and your gun on the desk
When you leave the room
I'm a loose bolt of a complete machine
What a match, I'm half-doomed, and you're semi-sweet
Boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
So boycott love, boycott love...
Boycott love, boycott love...
So boycott love, detox just to retox
And I'd promise you anything for another shot at life
And perfect boys with their perfect lives
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy
Nobody wants to hear you sing about tragedy, whoa...I am an arms dealer fitting you with
Weapons in the form of words
And don't really care which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing, that's just the business I'm in
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I wrote the gospel on giving up
But the real bombshells have already sunk
At night, we're painting your trash gold while you sleep
Crashing not like hips or cars, no, more like p-p-p-parties
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
Bandwagon's full, please catch another
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
Whoa, oh oh oh
Whoo!
All the boys who
The dance floor didn't love
And all the girls whose lips couldn't move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race 
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race!
I'm a leading man and the lies I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricate
I'm a leading man and the lines I weave are
Oh, so intricate, oh, so intricateUntil your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever
I need more dreams and less life
I need that dark in a little more light
I cried tears you'll never see
So fuck you, you can go cry me an ocean, and leave me be
You are what you love, not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes', I'm here to scream
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll 
No, no , wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll 
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your breathing stops, stops, stops
Until your-your-your-your-your
Forever, forever
Blood brothers in desperation
An oath of silence for the voice of a generation
Whoa! How'd it get to be only me?
Like I'm the last damn kid still kicking that still believes
I will defend the faith going down swinging
I will save the songs, the songs that we can't stop singing
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll 
No, no , wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll 
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh oh
Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know how to quit, no, no
You are what you love, not who loves you
In a world full of the word 'yes', I'm here to scream...
No, no 
Wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
I only plugged in to save rock and roll 
No, no , wherever I go, go 
Trouble seems to follow
Only plugged in to save rock and roll

Oh no, we won't go
'Cause we don't know when to quit, oh ohDon't panic, no, not yet
I know I'm the one you want to forget
Cue all the love to leave my heart
It's time for me to fall apart
Now you're gone, but I'll be okay
Your hot whiskey eyes have fanned the flame
Maybe I'll burn a little brighter tonight
Let the fire breathe me back to life
Baby, you were my picket fence, I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin, I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better, the darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, we're fading fast, I miss missing you now and then
Making eyes at this husk around my heart
I see through you when we're sitting in the dark
So give me your filth, make it rough
Let me, let me trash your love
I will sing to you every day
If it will take away the pain
Oh, and I've heard you got it, got it so bad
'Cause I am the best you'll never have
Baby, you were my picket fence, I miss missing you now and then
Chlorine kissed summer skin, I miss missing you now and then
Sometimes before it gets better, the darkness gets bigger
The person that you'd take a bullet for is behind the trigger
Oh, we’re fading fast, I miss missing you now and then
Now and then, now and then, now and then
Baby, you were my picket fence
I miss missing you now and then...Oh!
Oh!
Say my name and his in the same breath
I dare you to say they taste the same
Let the leaves fall off in the summer
And let December glow in flames , oh!
Erase myself and let go
Start it over again in Mexico
These friends, they don't love you
They just love the hotel suites now!
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
Oh!
Oh!
Oh, take a chance, let your body get a tolerance
I'm not a chance, but a heat wave in your pants
Pull a breath like another cigarette
Pawn shop heart, trading up, said no... 
I'm the oracle in my chest
Let the guitar scream like a fascist
Sweat it out, shut your mouth, free love on the streets, but
In the alley, it ain't that cheap now
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery
Oh! Oh!
Mmm, said-a, I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, you said-a
I don't care just a-what you think
As long as it's about me, I said-a
I don't care 
You said, I don't care 
Said I  don't  care , oh!
I  don't  care , oh!
I don't care! 
I said-a, I  don't  care... 
I don't care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery...
I said-a I  don't  care what you think
As long as it's about me
The best of us can find happiness
In misery...
Oh!I don't even have my own attention
You say, "Please don't ever change," but you
Don't like me the way I am, the sign says "Don't you tap the
Glass," but I read it in reverse: "eht pat uoy t'nod syas ngis ehT"
The world tried to burn all the mercy out of me, but you know I
Wouldn't let it, it tried to teach me the hard way, I can't forget it
Driving down the coast again
The pills are kicking in, the pills are kicking in
She said, "I love you 'til I don't"
I am just playing house, no idea what I'm doing now
There are no atheists in foxholes
The pressure's getting to me, it's time to throw in the towel
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright, the sunshine
Call me Oluwaburna, I fell in love, but I didn't fall down
Them say me nah normal, drink Hennessy, me nah drink water
Make me stumble pon me Air Jordan
Ain't no slowing down, know I keep it rolling now
Smoking in my fuckin' brain, passing through my fuckin' mind
Feel like I'm bulletproof, bulletproof, baby
With the sun shining through, got the blunt and the juice, cruise
Ridin' through the...
The sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide
You came back like a wave when I was feeling alright
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun 
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun
You are my truest feeling yet
I love you so much, it's just like oxygen
And it's going to my head
A public meltdown, petulant, but irreverent
Take all your possibilities then take away the limits
Take your ideas and throw away all the gimmicks
I do the best with what I have
The pills are kicking in, the pills are kicking in
'Cause I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide 
You came back like a wave when I was feeling al- 
I'm stuck in the sunshine riptide
Dancing all alone in the morning light
The sunshine riptide 
You came back like a wave when I was feeling al- 
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun, sun 
Sun, sun, sun
Sun, sun I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy, the kind that makes June
Feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 Did you ever love her? Do you know?
 Or did you never want to be alone?
 And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight
And just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our heads were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 Did you ever love her? Do you know?
 Or did you never want to be alone?
 And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"
 Did you ever love her? Do you know?
 Or did you never want to be alone?
 And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
 "Baby, come home"You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
I'll be as honest as you'll let me
I miss your early morning company
If you get me
You are my favorite what if
You are my best I'll never know
And I'm starting to forget
Just what summer ever meant to you
What did it ever mean to you?
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh, honey, you don't have to lie
Oh, I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
I wish I'd known how much you loved me
I wish I cared enough to know
I'm sorry every song's about you
The torture of small talk with someone you used to love
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know
May the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of JulyWhen Rome's in ruins
We are the lions, free of the Colosseums
In poison places, we are anti venom
We're the beginning of the end
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica, do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?
C'mon, make it easy, say I never mattered
Run it up the flag pole
We will teach you how to make boys next door
Out of assholes 
Tonight, the foxes hunt the hounds
It's all over now
Before it has begun
We've already won
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica, do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?
We are wild
We are like young volcanoes
We are wild
Americana, exotica, do you wanna feel a little beautiful, baby?Oh god!

Di-di-did you trip down 12 steps into Malibu, ooh, ooh, ooh
So why the hell is there a light that's keeping us forever
Bel Air baby, did you get dressed up, pretty pout, pout
I can't stop it when there's chemicals keeping us together
Uh, uh, uh, I'm singing
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love
Your crooked love is just a pyramid scheme and I'm dizzy on dreams
But if you ask me two's a whole lot lonelier than one
Baby, we should have left our love in the gutter where we found it
Cause you think, you think your only crime is that you got caught
I'm singing
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in love
It's getting clear, you're never coming clean
So lock you up inside and swallow, swallow the key
Hello? Yeah, I know you said not to call unless I'm dying
Well, I'm driving and I can't stop staring at my eyelids
But, even though my eyes closed, I still see you
I just hope that when you see me, I'm not see-through, you know how we do 
Sometimes I swear, I need a day just for me to lay
With some T and A, but the way we, the way we do is 
Deeper, baby, straight-up chemistry, DNA
Make me wanna give you every dollar out my B of A 
Like, I let her climb on top
I'm either fuckin' or workin', so the grind don't stop 
They say I got screws missing, well hell, only when I'm missing you
And hell yeah I'm a dick, girl, addicted to you
Whoa, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
They fall in love, how the mighty fall, the mighty fall, the mighty fall
Oh, how the mighty fall in loveI'm pedal to the metal, make no mistake
This is my pity party, pity party
And I'm living out of time, eternal heatstroke

Looking for pieces of broken hourglass
Trying to get it all back, put it back together
As if the time had never passed
I know I should walk away, know I should walk away
But I just want to let you break my brain
And I can't seem to get a grip
No matter how I live with it
These are the last blues...
Yeah...
The glow of the cities below lead us back
To the places that we never should have left
The last blues we're ever gonna have

Take my advice 'cause we are bad news
We will leave you high and dry
It's not worth the hearing you'll lose
It's just past eight and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas"
We're only liars but we're the best 
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
Brothers and sisters, yeah, put these words down
Into your notebook 
We're friends when you're on your knees
Make them dance like we were shooting their feet
It's just past eight and I'm feeling young and reckless
The ribbon on my wrist says, "Do not open before Christmas"
We're only liars but we're the best 
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion sense
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only liars but we're the best
We're only good for the latest trends
We're only good 'cause you can have almost famous friends
Besides, we've got such good fashion senseIt’s summer of 2001; Joe meets Patrick and he’s like “Yo, I know about music.”
And Patrick’s like “Yo, I know more about music.”
"That’s impossible! Do you wanna start a band?”
And Patrick’s like, “…Yeah… That’s cool.”
And then he’s like “Yo, this is a book store, it's not a music store!”
And then they met at Patrick’s house. And Patrick’s wearing shorts and socks and a hat. Patrick is playin’ drums for some fuckin’ reason! And Pete’s there for some reason! They start playin’ music together. And they're like “Oh, let’s play some fuckin’ covers from some other bands!” It was like, Green Day and fuckin’ Misfits and fuckin’ Ramones!
Pete said to Joe, “Yo, we gotta change this shit up! Yo, we’ve played all these bands; let’s play shit from Fall Out Boy.”
And so Pete and Patrick are like “Yo, that’s dope. But we need a fuckin’ drummer!” Because Patrick’s playin’ drums and he’s a singer!
Patrick's like “Yo! I got a soul voice!”
And they're like “Wait, how do you have a soul voice?”
And he’s like “Yo, watch this: Yeah!”
And they’re like “Oh my god! That sounds like soul!” So they put it in the song and it was like “WHERE IS YOUR BOY TONIGHT!”
And then they’re like: “Yo, that's fuckin’ perfect. This is Fall Out Boy.” And they made records like, Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend. Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend, everybody loves it.
It's called Evening Out With Your Girlfriend.
With Your Ex-Girlfriend! It's called Evening Out With Your Ex-Girlfriend!
It's called Eating Out Your Girlfriend, and it's real and it doesn't matter.
And Pete talked to Patrick and Joe and he was like “Yo, what the FUCK! Yo, this is gonna be fuckin’ DOPE!”
So they made a record, and it was called: Take This To Your Grave.
They made it without a drummer! And they had like three, four drummers come in.
The four drummers they had come in were like: Josh Freese, Neil Peart, the dude from Toto… The fourth one was like the guy from Papa Roach or something.
And they were like, “Yo, we need Andy Hurley. Andy Hurley. Take This To Your Grave. Fuckin' record it.” And he did it, and he killed it.
He was like, Bigadigadigalalululapssshhhh!
Killing the skins! Tapping the skins! Tapping the rims! Playing the shit! Killing these bitches! Wrapping it out!
“We should get signed, to Fueled by Ramen. 'Cause these guys know what the fuck is going on.”
And they were like “Yo, if you can make our scene any bigger than it is, which is not fuckin' hard, we will sign you guys."
Pete was like ”Yo! We got this record that’s fuckin’ dope, dude! It's called Take This To Your Grave.“
Hey, it's gonna be called From Under The Cork Tree, it's gonna be fuckin' huge.
And then Patrick’s like "I gotta keep it real, I gotta keep it artistic. These are three songs that are gonna make the album and it's called , this is called: 'Thnks fr th Mmrs,' '20 Dollar Nose Bleed,' and 'Sugar, We're Goin' Down.'
And they made this record that was fucking dope and it fucking hit on the charts.
Like: one, two, three! Three, two one! Three, four, five, six, seven, eight, nine, ten! TEN TO ONE!
From Under The Cork Tree sold like, four million records!
Ten million records!
Fifteen million records!
And Brendon Urie had nothing to do with the entire record. And Patrick was like “That's good!”
Pete was like “Yo, fuck you! I can do whatever I want!”
Joe was like “Yeah, it's cool man, whatever… I don’t give a shit.” And then Andy was like “Eh… Cool!”
And Pete was like "Makeup is fuckin’ great for a guy. Because it makes a guy look beautiful. Which a lot of times, a guy is not beautiful. And I wanna change that. I wanna make sure everybody thinks that guys are beautiful."
(-I'm good so far.
-You wanna spit one more time?
-Yeah, I do.
...Shut the fuck!..)
Pete was like “Oh my god, I’m so embarrassed about this dick pic!”
And then I saw the dick pic, and I was like “Eh, it's not bad. It's not a bad dick. Let’s be real.”
We made Rolling Stone one issue before Fall Out Boy. And Fall Out Boy made the issue right after us and they were so pissed!
They were like “Yo, fuck you guys!”
They were like “Yo! Panic has the fucking cover of Rolling Stone? Yo, fuck these dudes! We're gonna fucking go miles above! We're gonna hit every fucking continent there is known to man!”
But they didn’t! Because they missed a second of time.
Apparently, they were like: “Oh, shit we got every continent.” And they didn’t actually hit it.
Dude, Pete was like "What the FUCK?”
Oh, you didn’t fuckin’ make the continent. It's like, fuck you!
So From Under the Cork Tree happens, we fuckin' have three, four years of awesomeness!
Like people are cumming on themselves, 'cause it's so big!
So Fall Out Boy was like, so Patrick’s like “Yo, we're gonna name this record From Under The Cork Tree and From Infinity On High.”
Pete was like “Yo, Folie à Deux means the Theatric of Two.”
Fall Out Boy was like “Yo, we gotta take a break” meaning, Pete was like “Yo, we gotta take a break bro”
And Patrick’s like, “I need time for my music! Uhhh!”
And Joe's like “Yo, I need time to find the fuckin’ art dude I gotta find some fuckin’ meau-metal.”
And Andy’s like “I’m just gonna play with some fuckin' metal bands.”
And they were like, “Alright, this breaks been like three years long. Two years long.
Three years long.
Three and a half?
We gotta fuckin’ come back man. We gotta come back strong!
(-You took my beer away, what the fuck?!
-No, you poured it all over yourself!
-Yeah, you poured it on yourself, man.)
We gotta make this shit legit. It's gonna be fuckin' dope. It's gonna go fuckin' sky high. We're gonna make a fuckin' record that sails the skies.
We're gonna call this record: Save Rock and Roll.
So they made "Alone Together", "Light 'Em Up", "Alone Together", "Phoenix".
And everyone’s like “What the fuck? You’re working with this guy who fuckin' recorded Avril Lavigne and P!nk!”
(-What the fuck is this on my shirt, did I puke on my shirt?
-No, you poured beer all over yourself.
-Oh god...)
Pete was like: “Yo, we're gonna end up on the tour with Panic! At The Disco and Twenty Pilots.”
And that’s all. And that’s all that matters. And that is how the fucking story goes.Mr. Sandman showing his beam
When he walks into the room, the walls lean in to listen
Surfed-out brain waves flick back and forth like old headlights
Sniffing bottled glue again
Head like a steel trap, wish I didn't, I didn't
I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't, I didn't
I don't just want to be a footnote
In someone else's happiness
Does your husband know the way that
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling, aww
Tempest in a teacup, get unique
Peroxide princess, shine like shark teeth
It's a sign , it's a sign 
It's a sign, what if you peaked early?
Does your husband know the way that
The sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
Does he know the way, does he know the way
Of the crickets that would convince me to call it a night?
Does he, does he know the way
I worship our love?
Does your husband know the way
That the sunshine gleams from your wedding band?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, oh darling, oh darling
Does your husband know? Does your husband know?
Does your husband know?
Does he know? Does he know?
Does he know?
But I will never end up like him
Behind my back, I already am
Keep a calendar
This way you will always know
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through
The last time you came through
Oh darling, I know what you're going through...Last year's wishes are this year's apologies
Every last time I come home
I take my last chance to burn a bridge or two, I only keep myself
This sick in the head 'cause I know how the words get you off
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger, but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Collect the bad habits that you couldn't bear to keep
Out of the woods but I love
The tree I used to lay beneath, kissed teeth stained red
From a sour bottle baby girl with eyes the size of baby worlds
We're the new face of failure
Prettier and younger, but not any better off
Bulletproof loneliness
At best, at best
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
The best way to make it through with hearts and wrists intact
Is to realize two out of three ain't bad, ain't bad
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, honeymoon
Setting in a honeymoon
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, if I woke up next to you
Me and you, setting in a honeymoon
If I woke up next to you, honeymoon...Baby, seasons change, but people don't, and
I'll always be waiting in the back room

Headlines and flash, flash, flash photography

Don't pretend you ever forgot about me
Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?
Style your wake for fashion magazines
Widow or a divorcee?
Don't pretend, d-d-d-don't pretend
We don't fight fair, we don't fight fair
They say your head can be a prison
Then these are just conjugal visits
People will dissect us till
This doesn't mean a thing anymore

Wouldn't you rather be a widow than a divorcee?

Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
No thesis existed for burning cities down at such a rampant rate
No graphics and no fucking PowerPoint presentation
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
So they just DIY'd that shit and they built their own bombs
She's his suicide blonde, she's number than gold
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
Are you ready for another bad poem?
One more off key anthem
Let your teeth sink in
Remember me as I was, not as I am
And I said, "I'll check in tomorrow
If I don't wake up dead"
I kept wishing she had blonde ambition
And she'd let it go to my head
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If love is a weapon, there's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my heart is a grenade, you pull the pin and say
We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old
In the  hopes of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never getting any better than this
We are professional ashes of roses, this kerosene's live
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
You settled your score, this is where you come to beg
'Cause it's never getting any better than this
Unborn and unshaven, killing fields of fire to a congress of ravens
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
This is what we do, baby, we nightmare you
I'm about to make the sweat roll backwards
And your heart beat in reverse
Our guts can't be reworked
As alone as a little white church in the middle of the desert getting burned
But I'll take your heart served up two ways
I sing a bitter song
I'm the lonelier version of you
I just don't know where it went wrong
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If love is a weapon, there's no second guessing when I say
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey!
If my heart is a grenade, you pull the pin and say
We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old

It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
Rat-a-tat-tat, rat-a-tat-tat-tat, hey
It's never getting any better than this
She's sick and she's wrong, she's your dirty blonde
And you sink inside her like a suicide bomb
He says, "I've seen bigger," she says, "I've lived better"
And they throw the matches down into the glitter
Not a dry eye left in the house
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
Go boy, go boy, run for your life
We're all fighting, growing old, we're all fighting, growing old
In the  hopes of a few minutes more
To get-get on St. Peter's list
But you need to lower your standards
'Cause it's never getting any better than this

It's never getting any better than this
Are you ready for another bad poem?This is a black, black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the bluebirds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop 'till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
I’m just a problem that doesn't want to be solved
So could you please hold your applause
Take this sideshow and all its freaks
And turn it into the silver screen dream
Singing I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
I am your worst, I am your worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You would never sing along
Cast them out 'cause this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
Ooooh, I say one day the valley's gonna swallow me whole
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled it up with novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
Don’t mind me, I’m just the son of a gun
So don’t stop, don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for youI confess, I messed up
Dropping "I'm sorry" like you're still around
And I know you dressed up
"Hey, kid, you'll never live this down"
And you're just the girl all the boys want to dance with
And I'm just the boy who's had too many chances
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for, kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
Write me off, give up on me
'Cause darling, what did you expect?
I'm just off, a lost cause
A long shot, don't even take this bet
You can make all the moves, you can aim all the spotlights
Get all the sighs and the moans just right
I'm sleeping on your folks' porch again, dreaming
She said, she said, she said, "Why don't you just drop dead?"
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for, kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
Always on,  you said you'd keep me honest
Always on,  but I won't call you on it
Always on, 
I don't blame you for being you
But you can't blame me for hating it
So, say, what are you waiting for, kiss her, kiss her
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late
I set my clocks early 'cause I know I'm always late...She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
I think I fell in love again
Maybe I just took too much cough medicine
I'm the best worst thing that hasn't happened to you yet
The best worst thing
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And you can kill me, kill me or let God sort ‘em out
And you can kill me, kill me or...whoa
She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho
She's an American beauty
I'm an American
I'm an American
American Psycho
I'm an American
I'm an American
I'm, I'm, I'm an American psycho
I wish I dreamt in the shape of your mouth
But it's your thread count I really care about
Stay up 'til the lights go out
Stay up, Stay up
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
You take the full, full truth, then you pour some out
And as we're drifting off to sleep
All those dirty thoughts of me
They were never yours to keep, keep, whoa
Altar boys, altered boys
We’re the things that love destroys
You, me, us, them
We’re just resurrection men
Us, we were only meant, to make you live again
Us, we were pity sex, nothing more and nothing less
She's an American beauty
I'm an American psycho

Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
I'm here to collect your hearts
It's the only reason that I sing
I don't believe a word you say
But I can't stop listening
This is the story of how they met
Her picture was on the back of a pack of cigarettes
And when she touched him he turned ruby red
A story that they'll never forget, never forget
And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, yeah
I know I expect too much
And not enough all at once
You know I only wanted fun
And you got me all fucked up on love
I looked for your name on the ouija board
And your naked magic, oh dear lord
You and me are the difference between real love
And the love on TV, love on TV
And all the boys are smoking Menthols, girls are getting back rubs
I will drift to you if you make yourself shake fast enough
My old aches become new again
My old friends become exes again, yeah
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone
Woah, where did the party go?
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
We were the kids who screamed, "we weren't the same," in sweaty rooms
Now we're doomed to organizing walk-in closets like tombs
Silent film stars stuck in talking cinema life
So let's fade away together one dream at a time
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Woah, where did the party go?
We're ending it on the phone
I'm not gonna go home alone

Cool. It's all a game of this or that, now versus then
Better off against worse for wear
And you're someone who knows someone who knows someone
I once knew, and I just want to be a part of this
The road outside my house is paved with good intentions
Hired a construction crew 'cause it's hell on the engine
And you are the dreamer and we are the dream
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum "Hallelujah" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
My words are my faith, to hell with our good name
A remix of your guts, your insides x-rayed
And one day we'll get nostalgic for disaster
We're a bull, your ears are just a china shop
I love you in the same way, there's a chapel in a hospital
One foot in your bedroom and one foot out the door
Sometimes we take chances, sometimes we take pills
I could write it better than you ever felt it
So hum "Hallelujah" just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
Hallelujah, hallelujah
Hallelujah, hallelu...
Hallelujah, hallelujah 
Hallelujah, hallelu... 
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too
So hum hallelujah, just off the key of reason
I thought I loved you, but it was just how you looked in the light
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
Vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
A teenage vow in a parking lot, 'til tonight do us part
I sing the blues and swallow them too...I've loved everything about you that hurt
So let me see your moves, let me see your moves
Lips pressed close to mine
True blue
But the prince of any failing empire knows that
Everybody wants, everybody wants
To drive on through the night if it's a
Drive back home
Things aren't the same anymore, some nights, they get so bad
You almost pick up the phone
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you
I've already given up on myself twice
Third time is the charm, third time is the charm
Threw caution to the wind, but I've got a
Lousy arm
And I've traced your shadows on the wall, now I kiss them
Whenever I'm down, whenever I'm down
Figured on not figuring
Myself out
Things aren't the same anymore, some nights, they get so bad
I almost pick up the phone
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you
Born under a bad sign, you saved my life
That night on the roof of your hotel
"Cross my heart and hope to die
Splintered from the headboard in my eye"
Photo-proofed kisses I remembered so well
Trade baby blues for wide eyed browns, I sleep with your old
Shirts and walk through this house in your shoes, you know, it's
Strange, it's a strange way of saying that I know I'm supposed to
Love you, I'm supposed to love you
Now press repeatIf home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked
I can't remember
I can't remember
And I want it so bad
I'd shoot the sunshine into my veins
I can't remember
The good old days
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you
The m-m-milligrams in my head
Burning tobacco in the wind
Chasing the direction
Chasing the direction you went
You're a bottled star
The planets align, you're just like Mars
You shine in the sky
You shine in the sky
Are all the good times getting gone?
They come, and go, and go, and come, and go, oh yeah
I've got a lot of friends who are stars
But some are just black holes
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you, oh
And it's kind of funny
The way we're wearing anchors on our shirts
When being anchored aboard
Just feels like a curse
My mind is a safe
And if I keep it, then we all get rich
My body is an orphanage
We take everyone in
Doing lines of dust and sweat
Off last night's stage
Just to feel like you...
If home is where the heart is, then we're all just fucked...Yeah, what you critics said would never happen
We dedicate this album to anybody people said couldn't make it
To the fans that held us down 'til everybody came around
Welcome, it's here!
Last summer, we took threes across the board
But by fall, we were a cover story, "Now in stores!"
Make us poster boys for your scene
But we are not making an acceptance speech
I found the safest place to keep all our old mistakes
Every dot com's refreshing for a journal update
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
I can take your problems away with a nod and a wave
Of my hand, 'cause that's just the kind of boy that I am
The only thing I haven't done yet is die
And it's me and my plus one at the afterlife
Crowds are won and lost and won again
But our hearts beat for the diehards
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five
Long live the car crash hearts
Long live the car crash hearts
So long live the car crash hearts, cry on the couch and
All the poets come to life, fix me in forty-five, hehe, woo!
Young! FOB!
Let's go...Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh ohh
Life's just a pace-car on death, only less diligent
And when the two collide, it's no coincidence
The lights are on and everybody's home
Uh, uh, uh uh
The only thing suicidal here is the doors
We had a good run, even I have to admit
Life's just a pace-car on death
Only less diligent
Hell or glory, I don't want
Anything in between, then came a
Baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said, "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh oh ooh ooh ooh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh ohh
Oh oh oh oh, oh oh oh oh, whoa oh oh ohh
We didn't come to compete, this is a demonstration
Even the young ones become irrelevant
They always bring up how you've changed
Oh, oh
Never the same person when I go to sleep
As when I wake up, as when I wake up
Bop bop ba dop, ba dop op ba dop
Ba dop op ba dop, ba dop op ba dop, yeah!
Hell or glory, I don't want
Anything in between, then came a
Baby boy with long eyelashes
And daddy said, "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Whoa oh oh, the thunder

And daddy said, "you gotta show the world the thunder"
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh ohh, he said "bring the thunder!"
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh, the thunder
Whoa oh oh oh oh...Drink down that gin and kerosene
Come spit on bridges with me
Just to keep us warm
Light a match to leave me be
Light a match to leave me be
I keep my jealousy close
Cause it's all mine
And if you say this makes you happy
Then I'm not the only one lying
Keep quiet, nothing comes as easy as you
Can I lay in your bed all day?
I'll be your best kept secret and your biggest mistake
Hand behind this pen relives a failure everyday

Hand behind this pen relives a failure everydayI'm sleeping my way out of this one
With anyone who will lie down
I'll be stuck fixated on one star
When the world is crashing down
I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own
The only thing worse than not knowing
Is you thinking that I don't know
I'm having another episode
I just need a stronger dose
I keep telling myself, I keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
But you've got me looking in through blinds
I keep telling myself, keep telling myself
I'm not the desperate type
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well
Sitting out dances on the wall
Trying to forget everything that isn't you
I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my own

I'm not going home alone
'Cause I don't do too well on my ownI'm a young one stuck in the thoughts of an
Old one's head
When all the others were just stirring awake, I'm trying to
Trick myself to fall asleep again, whoa
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry, you put my head in such a
Flurry, flurry, oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?
What makes you so special?
I'm going to leave you, I'm going to teach you
How we're all alone, whoa, whoa
Guild me, build me, it's your club, so
Let me in 
Knowing how heartwarming it is inside
Your skin
My head's in heaven, my soles are in hell
Let's meet in the purgatory of my hips and get well
Hurry, hurry, you put my head in such a
Flurry, flurry, oh freckle, freckle
What makes you so special?

Mama, if we don't take the medication
We won't sleep for days, we won't sleep for days
Mama, if we pray to the lord, oh
Does he sing on a stage? Does he sing on a stage?
We waste it all in the back of a long dark car
And I'm a sunshine machine
Uh, I want to get stuck, I want to get stuck
And be golden in your memory, mmm, mmm, oh, oh...There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night 'till we're twins again
'Til we're stripped down to our skeletons again
'Til we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble 'til you find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you, you shrug that
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
A birth and a death on the same day
And, honey, I only appeared so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it, never quit it, I have been through the wreck
But I can string enough to show my face in the light again
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold onOh, oh, oh, oh oh ohh oh

I'm not a crybaby
I'm the crybaby
A caterpillar that got stuck
Mr. Moth, come quick with any luck
A long walk to a dark house
A Roman candle heart keep us far apart
I'm cocktail party doing alright, hate me baby
Maybe I'm a piece of art
Oh, my friends all lie and say
They only want the best wishes for me
Oh, three, two, one, we go live!
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess
Little hot mess, whoa, whoa
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon
Stuck on a little hot mess
Little hot mess, whoa, whoa, whoa
I can make your heart slow
I can feel the weather in my bones
Wish hard enough, I can turn it to what I like
Your pupils  big , they're rolling like dice
They say they only want the best wishes for me
Oh, three, two, one, we go live!
Oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
You're a faded moon
Stuck on a little hot mess
Little hot mess, whoa, whoa
And oh baby, you're a classic
Like a little black dress
But you'll be faded soon

Not the boy I was, the boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
Not the boy I was, the boy I am is just venting, venting
Dear gravity, you held me down in this starless city
They say they only want the best wishes for me

Little hot mess, whoa, whoa, whoa...This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
But we never stood a chance and I'm not sure if it matters
If you are the shores, I am the waves begging for big moons
I'm mailing letters to addresses in a ghost town, no
Your secret's out...
I know this hurts, it was meant to 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
But it must be said again that all us boys are just screaming
Into microphones for attention because we're just so bored
We never knew that you would pick it apart, oh
I'm falling apart to songs about hips and hearts
Your secret's out...
I know this hurts, it was meant to 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't matter
I used to obsess over living
Now I only obsess over you
Tell me you'd like boys like me better
In the dark lying on top of you
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
This has been said so many times that I'm not sure if it matters
I know this hurts, it was meant to 
Your secret's out and the best part is it isn't even a good one
And it's mind over you don't, don't, don't, don't matter...
From day one, I talked about getting out
But not forgetting about how all my worst fears are letting out
He said, "Why put a new address
On the same old loneliness?"
When breathing just passes the time
Until we all just get old and die
Now talking's just a waste of breath
And living's just a waste of death
And why put a new address
On the same old loneliness?
And this is you and me, and me and you
Until we've got nothing leftWhere is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
When I wake up, I'm willing to take
My chances on the hope I'd forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you 
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident
But I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you, the meantime, I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on at
Four in the afternoon
You need him, I could be him
I could be an accident
But I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him, one, two, three, four!
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
 He won't find out
 He won't find out
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of town
Where is your boy tonight?
I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know
You were the last good thing about this part of townI found the cure to growing older
And you're the only place that feels like home
Just so you know, you'll never know, and some secrets weren't meant to be told
But I found the cure to growing older
I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends
And I am sorry my conscience called in sick again
And I've got arrogance down to a science
Oh, and I'm the first kid to write of hearts, lies, and friends now

I know you've heard this all before, but we're just Hell's neighbors
Why, why, why won't the world revolve around me?
In my dreams, trees grow all over the streets
But I don't know much about classic cars 
But I've got a lot of friends stuck on classic coke 
Down, set, one, hut, hut, hike, media blitz
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins
Let's hear it for America's suitehearts, but I must confess
I'm in love with my own sins

You don't, don't know you're a legend
Time, time, time hasn't told anyone else yet
Sorry, I just let my love loose again
But I don't know much about classic cars

 Suitehearts...The D.A. is dressed to the nines
In the mirror, he practices all his lines
To his closing argument, twelve hearts beat in favor
I'm guessing that he read the morning paper
The headline reads "The man hangs"
But the jury doesn't
And everyone's looking for relief
United States versus disbelief
Mothers cast tears on
Both sides of the aisle
Clear your throat and face the world
The verdict falls like bachelors for bad luck girls
Only breathing with the
Aid of denial
Case open, case shut, but you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head, isn't it tragic?
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh...
He glances at his peers sitting seven to twelve stacked
On one to six, the gallery is hushed...
Boys in three pieces dream of grandstanding and bravado
The city sleeps in a cell, notwithstanding what we all know
Hang on a rope or bated breath
Whichever you prefer
And everyone's looking for relief
A bidding war for an old flame's grief
The cause, the kid, the course
The charm, and the curse
Not a word that could make you comprehend
Too well dressed for the witness stand
The press prays for whichever
Headline's worse
Case open, case shut, but you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head, isn't it tragic?
Fresh pressed suit and tie, unimpressed birds sing and die
Can talk my way out of anything
The foreman reads the verdict, "In the above entitled actions
We find the defendant guilty, guilty, guilty, guilty..."
Case open, case shut, but you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head, isn't it tragic?
Case open, case shut, but you could pay to close it like a casket
Baby boy can't lift his headache head, isn't it tragic?
Ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh, ohhh...Sometimes I want to quit this all and become an accountant now
But I'm no good at math and besides, the dollar is down
Plant palm trees on Lake Michigan before it gets cold
I gotta feel the wind chill again before I get old
I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out now
All the yes-men said "no comment," my mouth got going
The wrong way and all the calls started snowi-i-ing
The time my dad caught me a horseshoe crab
And I asked him if throwing it back into the sea would bring our luck back
I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town
And get new passports, get out now
Tell that boy I'll leave you alone now
Like a stove, I'll turn my love down
Supra and the prophet are both
In the business of souls, ee-ooh
I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me, whoa
I want to scream "I love you" from the top of my lungs
But I'm afraid that someone else will hear me
You can only blame your problems on the world for so long
Before it all becomes the same old song
As soon as we hit the hospital, I know we're gonna leave this town 
And get new passports and get, get, get, get, get out
Get, get, get, get, get out now!Sometimes, when I'm in Heaven
I get forgetful of the Earth, whoa
Until I hear you bickering like bugs and birds
The heat is off, gate's open, the shade is down
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Oh, I got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night time
Summer love on a gurney with a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive comes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark my crazy head to keep you warm at night
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother, forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in 
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
Back to the city I grew up in
Again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head
To the city I grew up in 
Again and again and again and again
Forever a lake effect kid
Again and again and again
And again and againHow cruel is the golden rule
When the lives we lived are only golden-plated?
And I knew that the lights of the city
Were too heavy for me
Though I carried carats
For everyone to see
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies
And all the lovers with no time for me
And all of the mothers raise their babies
To stay away from me
Tongues on the sockets of electric dreams
Where the sewage of youth drowned the spark of my teens
And I knew that the lights of the city
Were too heavy for me 
Though I carried carats
For everyone to see 
And I saw God cry in the reflection of my enemies
And all the lovers with no time for me
And all of the mothers raise their babies
To stay away from me
And pray they don't grow up to be...Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We're the therapists pumping through your speakers
Delivering just what you need
We're well-read and poised
We're the best boys
We're the chemists who've found the formula
To make your heart swell and burst
No matter what they say
Don't believe a word
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie if you'll keep believing it
I'll keep singing this lie, I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
We're traveled like gypsies, only
With worse luck and far less gold
We're the kids you used to love
But then we grew old
We're the lifers here till the bitter end
Condemned from the start
Ashamed of the way the songs and the
Words own  the beating of our hearts
'Cause I'll keep singing this lie, I'll keep singing this lie
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the light
And there's a drug in the thermostat to warm the room up
And there's another around to help us bend your trust
Got a sunset in my veins
And I need to take a pill to make this town feel okay
The best part of "believe" is the "lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up
The best part of "believe" is the "lie"
I hope you sing along and you steal a line
I need to keep you like this in my mind
So give in or just give up
Are we growing up or just going down?
Are we growing up or just going down?
It's just a matter of time until we're all found out
Take our tears, put them on ice
'Cause I swear I'd burn this city down to show you the lightI want to see your animal side
Let it all out
I wanna see the dirt under your skin
I need your broken promises
I want the guts and glory, baby, baby
This town is wasted and alone
But we are alive, here in death valley
But don't take love off the table yet
'Cause tonight, it's just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot, so we only lose a little
But we are alive, we are alive, we are alive
I want to see your animal side
Let it all out
Oh, there you go, undress to impress
You can wear the crown but you're no princess
So put the "D" in dirt now, baby, baby
Let's get you wasted and alone
'Cause we are alive, here in death valley
But don't take love off the table yet
'Cause tonight, it's just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot, so we only lose a little
But we are alive, we are alive, we are alive
We're going to die, it's just a matter of time
Hard times come, good times go
I'm either gone in an instant
Or here 'till the bitter end, I never know
What I've got will make you feel more alive
I'll be your favorite drug, I will get you high, I will get you high
We're still, we are alive, here in death valley
But don't take love off the table yet
'Cause tonight, it's just fire alarms and losing you
We love a lot, so we only lose a little
But we are alive, we are alive, we are aliveJoke me something awful just like kisses on the necks of "best friends"
We're the kids who feel like dead ends
And I want to be known for my hits, not just my misses
I took a shot and didn't even come close
At trust and love and hope
And the poets are just kids who didn't make it
And never had it, at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides, my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
Please put the doctor on the phone, 'cause I'm not making any sense
Blame everyone but me for this mess
And my back has been breaking from this heavy heart
We never seemed so far
I'm hopelessly hopeful
You're just hopeless enough
But we never had it, at all
And the record won't stop skipping
And the lies just won't stop slipping
And besides, my reputation's on the line
We can fake it for the airwaves
Force our smiles, baby, half dead
From comparing myself to everyone else around me
To everyone else around me, everyone else around me
Everyone else around meI-I-I-I can't
Explain a thing, oh
I-I-I-I want
Everything
To change and stay the same, oh
Time doesn't care about anyone or anything, oh
Come together, come apart
Only get lonely when you read the charts
And oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand, oh
I, I'm a mascot for what
You've become
And I, I, I love the mayhem
More than the love
And oh baby, when they made me
They broke the mold
Girls used to follow me around
Then I got cold
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them like you just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Though change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care
Throw your cameras in the air
And wave them 'cause I just don't care
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh, though change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again
I will never believe in anything again
Oh, change will come, oh, change will come
I will never believe in anything again
We will never believe again
Kick drum beating in my chest again
No, we will never believe again
Preach electric to a microphone stand
We will never believe again 
Kick drum beating in my chest again
We will never believe again 
Preach electric to a microphone stand
We will never believe again! I wrote a goodbye note in lipstick on your arm
When you passed out
I couldn't bring myself to call
Except to call it quits
Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
This city says, "come hell or high water"
Well, I'm feeling hot and wet
I can't commit to a thing
Be it heart or hospital
Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
The tombstones were waiting, they were half-engraved
They knew it was over, they just didn't know the date...
And I cast a spell over the west to make you think of me
The same way I think of you
This is a love song in my own way
Happily ever after below the waist
Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers
Racing through the city, windows down
In the back of yellow checkered cars
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Yo-ho-ho, whoa
Oh, yo-ho-ho, whoa
Best friends, ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as lovers and not the other way around
Ex-friends 'til the end
Better off as yo-ho-ho-ohWe take sour sips from life's lush lips
And we shake, shake, shake the hips in relationships, stomp out
This disaster town,  you'll put your eyes to the sun and say, "I know
You're only blinding to keep back what the clouds are hiding"
And we might have started singing just a little soon
We're throwing stones at a glass moon
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa oh
We keep the beat with your blistered feet, we bullet the words
At the mockingbirds singing, slept through the weekend
And dreaming of sinking with the melody of the cliffs of eternity
Got postcards from my former selves saying, "How you been?"
We might have said goodbyes just a little soon, stomp out
This disaster town, robbing lips, kissing banks under this moon
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa oh
It was ice cream headaches and sweet avalanche
When the pearls in our shells got up to dance
You call me a bad tipper of the cradle
Tired yawns for fawns on hunter's lawns
We're the has-beens of husbands
Sharpening the knives of young wives
Take two years and call me when you're better
Take teardrops of mine, find yourself wetter
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning
Whoa oh, we're so miserable and stunning
Whoa oh, love songs for the genuinely cunning, whoa oh...Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
Sometimes I just want to know what it's like
To be you
We're making out inside crashed cars
We're sleeping through all our memories
I used to waste my time dreaming of being alive
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same
You only hold me up like this
'Cause you don't know who I really am
I used to waste my time on
Waste my time on
Waste my time dreaming of being alive
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains my pillowcase
Like I'll never be the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
I've got headaches and bad luck, but they couldn't touch you, no
I've got headaches and bad luck, but they couldn't touch you, no
I'm not trying, you only hold me up like this
Turn off the lights and turn off the shyness
'Cause all of our moves make up for the silence
And oh, the way your makeup stains
Like I'll never be the same
Oh, oh, oh, oh, ohI'm good to go, and I'm going nowhere fast, it could be worse
I could be taking you there with me
I'm good to go, but it looks like
I'm still on my own
I'm good to go for something golden
Though the motions I've been going through have failed
And I'm coasting on potential towards a wall at a
Hundred miles an hour
When I say two more weeks, my foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep, in the wake of Saturday 
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Pete and I attacked the laws of Astoria
With promise and precision and mess of youthful innocence
And I read about the afterlife
But I never really lived more than an hour 
When I say two more weeks, my foot is in the door, yeah
I can't sleep, in the wake of Saturday 
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
And I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived
And I read about the afterlife, but I never really lived
Two more weeks, my foot is in the door
Me and Pete, in the wake of Saturday
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, when these open doors were open-ended
Saturday, Saturday...Wishes bounce me weightless
The infrared scope on pointlessness
The bulls are sedated
And this fight's fixed
Don't feel bad for the suicidal cats
Gotta kill themselves nine times before they get it right
The P.A. system keeps my heart, heart
Beating tonight, yeah...
Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Come on in, the water's warm, come on like a sugar cube, but with A kick in the head like putting wings on lead
And your eyes are blocking my starlight
I'm the last of my kind and that's all that should matter t-t-to you
Follow the disorganized religion of my head and we'll
Never get through customs, let's just take off again instead
Got my degree in the gutter my heart broken in
The dorms of the Ivy League
Oh hell yes, I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Knock once for the father, twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
I'm a nervous wreck, I'm a nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck, huh!
I'm a n-n-nervous wreck
I'm a nervous wreck,  I'm a nervous wreck
Oh hell yes, the drugs just make me reset
Knock once for the father , twice for the son
Three times for the holy ghost
Three times, three times for the holy ghost
Three times, three times for the holy ghost!Light that smoke, that one for giving up on me
And one just 'cause they’ll kill you sooner than my expectations
To my favorite liar, to my favorite scar 
I could have died with you
I hope you choke on those words that kiss that bottle
Confess 
Now ask yourself, yeah, out on the insides
Said I loved you but I lied
Let’s play this game, called “when you catch fire
I wouldn’t piss to put you out"
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you
So bury me in memory, his smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
On the drive home joke about the kid
You used to see and his jealousy, breaking hearts has never
Looked so cool as when you wrap your car around a tree
Your makeup looks so great next to his teeth 
Let’s play this game, called “when you catch fire
I wouldn’t piss to put you out", no
Stop burning bridges and drive off of them
So I can forget about you
So bury me in memory, his smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory, his smile’s your rope
So wrap it tight around your throat
So bury me in memory around your throat...Oh-oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh, oh-oh
Penny for your thoughts, but a dollar for your insights
Or a fortune for your disaster
I'm just a painter
And I'm drawing a blank
We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa-oh
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get me just right
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
Oh-oh, oh-oh
I could learn to pity fools as I'm the worst of all
And I can't stop feeling sorry
For myself
Whoa oh
We only want to sing you to sleep
In your bedroom speakers, whoa-oh
We need umbrellas on the inside
Get us right
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
We only want to sing you to sleep in your bedroom speakers
Whoa oh, we only want to sing you to sleep
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank on a sinking ship
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
They say quitters never win
But we walk the plank and we walk the plank
There's a world outside of my front door
That gets off on being down
We're broken down on memory lane, alone together, we're alone
We're broken down on memory lane, alone together, we're alone
Oh-oh, oh-oh...I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
And the full moon pills got me out on the street at night
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Oh, put love on hold, young Hollywood
Is on the other line
Her nose runs ruby red, Death's in a double bed
Singing songs that could only catch the ear of the desperate
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose...
I'm a stitch away from making it
And a scar away from falling apart, apart
Blood cells pixelate and eyes dilate
Kiss away young thrills and kills on the mouths of all my friends
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Loose, watch you work the room
Cut it loose, watch you work the room
Ohhhh, whoa
I'm a stitch away, I'm a stitch away...Do you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
And I can’t, I can’t
I can’t remember just how to forget
Forget the way that we danced
We danced to Danzig
And we danced, we danced
And when you ask, you ask me how I’m doing
Like you know, you know how much better off I am
And when we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again and again and again
And you can get what you want but it's never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
Oh, oooh, oh oh ooohh
I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin
For you, for you, for you, for you, for yoooooou-oooh-oh
(Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to
Spin for you like your favorite records used to, used to, to, to)I comb the crowd and pick you out
My mouth moves too fast for you to figure it out
It starts eyes closed to fingers crossed
To "I swear, I say"
To "I swear, I say"
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car, to hotel stairs
To the emergency exit door
To the "love," I left my conscience
Pressed between the pages of
The Bible in the drawer, "What did it ever do for me"
I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me, but I took it, anyway
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy
But never both, love never wanted me
"I hoped you choked and crashed your car"
Hey "tear catcher," that's all that you are
And ever were from the start
I swear, I say
I swear, I say
To hands between legs, to "whatever it takes"
To drinks at the club, to the bar
To the keys to your car, to hotel stairs
To the emergency exit door
To the "love," I left my conscience
Pressed between the pages of
The Bible in the drawer, "What did it ever do for me"
I say
It never calls me when I'm down
Love never wanted me, but I took it, anyway
Put your ear to the speaker and choose love or sympathy
But never both, no
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Through the keyhole as I watched you dress
Kiss and tell
Loose lips sink ships
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
To the "love," I left my conscience pressed
Between the pages of the Bible in the drawer
"What did it ever do for me," I say...You're a canary, I'm a coal mine
'Cause sorrow is just all the rage
Take one for the team
You all know what I mean
And I'm so sorry but not really
Tell the boys where to find my body
New York eyes, Chicago thighs
Pushed up the window to kiss you off
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
Do you remember the way I held your hand
Under the lamp post and ran
Home this way, so many times
I could close my eyes?
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth hurts worse
Than anything I could bring myself to do to you
The truth
The truth
Now, press repeatYou are a getaway car
A rush of blood to the head
But me, I'm just the covers
On top of your bed
You steer away in a rear view mirror
Make my head swim
I keep you warm and won't ask you
Where you've been
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame
The sounds of this small town
Make my ears hurt 
"Oh yeah, you caught me!"
But I caught you one worse
They say, "You want a war? You've got a war!"
But who are you fighting for?
The tide's out, the ship's run aground
We drown traitors in shallow water
With your backless black dress soaked to the skin
When it's said and done, they're all scrambling
And we're friends, we're friends
Just because we move units
Strike us like matches 'cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame
Everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shame, such a shame
Strike us like matches cause everyone deserves the flames
We only do it for the scars and stories, not the fame
At least everyone is trying, everyone is shining
Everyone deserves the flames but it's such a shameI'm a preacher sweating in the pew
For the salvation I'm bringing you
I'm a salesman, I'm selling you hooks and plans
And myself making demands
When I'm home alone, I just dance by myself
And you pull my head so close, volume goes with the truth
Signing off, "I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen"
The kid was alright, but it went to his head
I am God's gift, but why would he bless me with
Such wit without a conscience equipped
I'm addicted to the way I feel when I think of you, whoa
There's too much green to feel blue
When I’m home alone, I just can’t stop myself
And you pull my head so close, volume goes with the truth
Signing off, "I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen"
The kid was alright, but it went to his head
When I'm home alone, I just can't stop myself
And you pull my head so close, volume goes with the truth
Signing off, "I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
I'm alright in bed, but I'm better with a pen
The kid was alright, but it went to his headMy heart is on my sleeve, wear it like a bruise or black eye
My badge, my witness
Means that I believed
Every single lie you said
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home, all the colors
Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
She took me down and said
"Boys like you are overrated, so save your breath"
Loaded words and loaded friends
Are loaded guns to our heads
'Cause every pane of glass that your pebbles tap
Negates the pains I went through to avoid you
And every little pat on the shoulder for attention
Fails to mention I still hate you
But there's a light on in Chicago
And I know I should be home, all the colors
Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbor's house
You want apologies, girl, you might hold your breath
Until your breathing stops forever, forever
The only thing you'll get is this curse on your lips
I hope they taste of me forever
 There's a light on in Chicago
 And I know I should be home, all the colors
 Of the street signs, they remind me of the
Pickup truck out in front of your neighbors
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body will be broken again, again
With every breath, I wish your body would be broken again, againTake me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you, Chicago
You make me feel so summer fling
You know that I know that I owe you everything
I love you, Chicago
Feel the sorrow, hit the bottle
Feel the rush of having no tomorrow, yeah
She said, "You gotta find yourself
Something worth holding onto" 
Onto 
You charged me up
Charged, charged me up
I was something they forgot to label "fragile"
Now I'm stuck
And you know too much
Know, know too much
You're the one true thing
You're the one
Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home
I love you, Chicago
You make me feel so summer fling
You know that I know 
That I owe you everything
I love you, Chicago
And I'm just living out a suitcase
Watch me now, watch me as I drive away
I'm supposed to leave you at the end of the season
But I'll stay 
I'll stay 
You charged me up
Charged, charged me up
I was something they forgot to label "fragile"
Now I'm stuck
And you know too much
Know, know too much
You're the one true thing
You're the one
Take me home
Take me home
And the streetlights light, light up
To take me home

Something make my chest stir
Something make my head blur
Oh, oh, I'm not ready for a handshake with death, no
Oh, oh, I'm just such a happy mess, whoa
The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more
I'm the invisible man who can't stop staring
At the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh
It's three drinks too late to
Talk to anyone but myself
Oh, oh, it's a three-and-two pitch to walk to anywhere
Oh, oh, else, no
The drums are four on the floor
She's back to the bathroom for one more
I'm the invisible man who can't stop staring
At the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now
Oh, oh, oh oh, oh, oh, oh oh

At the mirror, at the mirror
I want to make you as lonely as me, so you can get
Get addicted to this, you can get, get addicted to this, now
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man, I'm the invisible
I want to make you as lonely as me
Cause I'm the invisible man
I'm the invisible man...Call it a night when the booze hits 
That'll never happen again 'til tonight 
That'll never happen again 'til tonight 
My love isn't lost, it's all I got
Hole inside of me, the shape of you 
There's a hole inside of me, the shape of you 
There's a hole inside of me, the shape of you 
My love isn't lost, it's all I got
And I feel too much
I feel too much unless I'm riding the super fade
Riding the super fade
I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've tried to sing about anything but you
I should've tried to sing about anything but you
I should've tried to go to sleep thinking 'bout
Anything else in the world but you
Anything else in the world but you
Anything else in the world but you, but you
You know the world can get my bones
But Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul, yeah
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my, gets my, gets my soul
You know I got a hole that I try to fill 
Hole that I try to fill with trophies and lights 
A hole that I try to fill with trophies and lights 
My love isn't lost, it's all I got
I, I-I'm surfing on the dopamine high 
I'm someone you gotta institutionalize 
I'm someone you gotta institutionalize 
Oh, my love isn't lost, it's all I got
I should've known better
I should've known better
I should've tried to sing about anything
Anything else in the world but you, but you
You know the world can get my bones
But Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my, gets my, gets my soul
Soul, yeah
Chicago gets my soul
Soul, yeah, yeah, yeah
Chicago gets my soul
But Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets my soul
Chicago gets myI speak fast and I'm not gonna repeat myself, no
So listen carefully to every word I say
I'm the only one who's gonna get away
With making excuses today
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
Blackmailed myself 
'Cause I ain't got anyone else
This is a stick up, give us all your inspiration
I've got the red carpet blues, baby
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you, we're gonna shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes, no
We're gonna shoot you, we're gonna shoot you, whoa
When I said that I'd return to you, I meant more like a relapse
Now and again, I think, "His and hers, for better or worse"
But the only ring I want buried with me
Are the ones around my eyes
You're appealing to emotions that I simply do not have
I've got the red carpet blues, baby
So put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you, we're gonna shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes
And everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
Put your hands in the air and don't make a sound
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you, we're gonna shoot you
And there's nothing in your head or pocket, throat or wallet
That could change just how this goes
Everyone shakes to the beat with a barrel down their throat
But don't get the wrong idea
We're gonna shoot you, we're gonna shoot you
Now press repeatClap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or  boos
Wa-wa-watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset
Tell rock 'n' roll I'm alone again
I wanna put the Midwest home again
Your time has passed, they say never means never
Solar flare stares won't last, but never means forever
Never means forever
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-megalo 
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
We must have the best coats
Tell the best jokes
We must make it hard to look so easy
Doing something so hard
But you must see my wink
They squint when they look at me
I'm a, I'm a star, I'm a, I'm a star
I'm a star
Oh, I'm a star
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-megalo 
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand, "I'm just fine"
You're not the first or the last
But you're possibly the prettiest, whoa
He's a fighter past his prime
He's in the gutter waving his hand
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac 
Alpha dog and oh, Omega-megalo 
Welcome to the new déjà vu
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Whoa, oh, whoa
Whoa, oh, whoaHope this is the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's been dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
This conversation's been dead on
A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse
No, it's not the last time, 'cause I'd never say no to you
This conversation's still dead on arrival
And there's no way to talk to you
When you're dead on
A rivalry goes so deep between me
And this loss of sleep over you
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your, whoo!
This is side one, flip me over, I know I'm not your favorite record
So, this is side one, flip me over
This is side one, flip me over
I know I'm not your favorite record
The songs you grow to like never stick at first
So, I'm writing you a chorus, and here is your verse
Here is your...
Dead on!Travie!
Pete, thought I told you
What up, Hemmy? I see you!
I've had the world at arm's length from the get-go
This ain't an arms race, it's Apocalypto
The industry's a target, I suggest these labels get low
On top of that, this track is cracked like burnt Brillo 
Consider me the beast of East Eleventh
VIP, all day, AK47
If words is weapons, then get to steppin'
My arsenal's enough to send Hell's Angels to Heaven
I'm cool as the Fonz, and deadly as Charles Bronson
I'm Gonzo, you can call me Travie S. Thompson
Go 'head, and you can choose a similar path
But don't gas yourself up like Sylvia Plath, jeez
Watch Travie take the title with ease
You want a verse, please, I wouldn't bless you if you sneezed
 Pardon me, I'm allergic to bullshit
Got a God complex with a full clip, pow!
The leader, man; Tyga-man make you leave your man
Ladies man take your mate
Literally, this song got me checking out my range
With no piff involved, my swag flyer than a plane
With the unruly attitude; ignorant, arrogant dude
Excuse me, I'm only seventeen 
"You're excused, I like your honesty, honestly
You're more mature than the average teen" 
"And uh, your label family? You must have a team" 
Decaydance, preferably, that'll be next for me 
The rest'll be history, plat-i-um until they stop listening
Then your baby's back like ribs 
I know you've been missing me, I almost forgot to mention it
Ever heard a sound like this? 
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
This ain't a scene, it's god-damn arms race!
I'm not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
Now I don't know what the hell this song is talkin' bout
Do you?
She said "Yeah, I been spendin' all day tryna figure that out"
You too?
The arms race made 'em raise they arm
And race straight to the top; Who knew? 
Right now they got that number one spot
Do you want that?  Me too
One thing I gotta call out, boy, take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain't black, when they get money they don't ball out, boy
They just buy tight jeans till their nuts hang all out, boy
They figure 'Ye dress tight so we gonna dress tighter
He dress white so we gone dress whiter
So in spite of anything you might've
Seen or heard, this scene occurred, word
I’m a leading man 
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
Ha, come on, expensive taste, we up in a arms race
Big money, big crib, big Cadillac 
Big daddy, boy, I cop big dro sacks 
Paper stack, big ring, big bling-bling 
Try to take big chain, big bang-bang 
I'm going , I'm going , I'm motherfucking gone
Ain't no signs that I'm slowing though I'm knowing that I'm wrong
Bring it on, out to get it, I need cash by the stacks
I need a new pair of Stacys and a dash for the 'Lac, jack
Ha, hear that? Top back  grill 
Coming down on the spiderweb chrome wheels 
First place in the stunting race, top notch 
Paint drip-drop, flip-flop, strapped with a Glock
Live every day like it's my last one; maybe it is
And ain't no morrows in my world of sorrow; maybe in his
I break ribs, break laws, break jaws at most
I still stick to the coast, hold up and reload
OH!
There's an arms race, like I'm runnin' on my hands
A dance marathon on my napalms, and
Drop mine's first so that they bombs can't
And Glocks, lasers, missiles, beat rocks, paper, scissors
I built mine's big, better build yours bigger
Built mine's quick so I could kill yours quicker
The number one supplier, the world's largest equipper
The second smallest dier, best non-coexister
I pledge allegiance to gasoline and bulletproof limousines
And leans on the property of the poor
And every night, I pray to the Lords Of War
Every man and mac eleven
That all good child rebel soldiers go to AK-47 heaven
And a landmine in every playground that they step in
And you took the footage from the camera on the tips
Of our bullets, and record like former Darfur 
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, Oh-so intricate
Yeah, it's Weezy, baby!
I am your arms dealer, I'm more like an armed dealer
Liter-rally, really, I don't get this song neither
But I'mma figure it out like a palm reader
And, since I be on TV, I turn it on to see me!
Hey, I'm so cool, even I wanna be me
That was totally off the subject
But for me, every song is like pussy so fuck it
Like Fresh, you dug it "I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine"
"I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine"
A downward spiral, just a pirouette
G-getting worse till there's n-n-nothing left
What good comes of something
When I'm just the ghost of nothing, nothing?
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
Lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till, till they can't stand it
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
Heralded as a king before I had a birthday
With double  digits 
Fit the crown to my head, but I was only a kid
Yeah, I was only a kid, hey
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice, rejoice and fall to your knees
Oh, a lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till, till they can't stand it
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"
"To be better than your
Your head's only medicine"
"I just want to be better than your
Your head's only medicine" 
Said, I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice , rejoice  and fall to your knees
I'm just the man on the balcony
Singing, "Nobody will ever remember me"
Rejoice , rejoice  and fall to your knees
A lunatic of a God or a God of a lunatic?
Oh, their faces are dancing
They're dancing till, till they can't stand it
A composer, but never composed
Singing the symphonies of the overdosed
A composer, but never composed
Singing, "I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't have"
"I only want what I can't, I can't have"When they say, "You and what army?"
I guess they're talking about you and me
Baby, nobody will love you, nobody will love you like
Like I do, I guess that's half true
Come down, come down, come down from your holy mountain
I'm down, I'm down, to put your shame on a billboard for a
Second, sometimes, sometimes, the only way out is
Through, through
'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?
I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah
So what fates do we share?
Windows down, wind in your hair
Baby, no one ever thinks of you, no one ever thinks of you
As much as I do, not, not even you
Come down, come down, come down from your holy mountain
I'm down, I'm down, to put your shame on a billboard for a
Second, sometimes, sometimes, the only way out is
Through, through
'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?
I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? Yeah
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
Woah, oh, oh, oh, oh
'Cause everyone loves Bob Dylan
I just want you to love me like that, yeah
Would you bury me next to Johnny Cash?
I'm obsessed, do you love me like that? YeahHoney is for bees, silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep
It doesn't matter how you feel
Life is just a ferris wheel
It's always up and down
Don't make a sound
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
It's just the sweet weather and the peacock feathers
In the morning it will all be better
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleep
When you wake up the world will come around
When you wake up the world will come around
Honey is for bees, silly bear
And besides there's jellybeans everywhere
It's not what it seems in the land of dreams
Don't worry your head, just go to sleepBury me standing under your window
With this cinder block in hand
Yeah 'cause no one will ever feel
Like this again
And if I could move, I'm sure it would
Only be to crawl back to you
I must have dragged my guts a block
They were gone by the time we 
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing
I hate the way you say my name
Like it's something secret
My pen is the barrel of the gun
Remind me which side you should be on
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voice
Stood on my roof and tried to see you forgetting about me
Hide the details, I don't want to know a thing
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
I wish that I was as invisible as you make me feel
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate my
One, two, three, four!
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
But know that I could crush you with my voice
Woah, I want to hate you half as much as I hate myself
You know that I could crush you with my voiceI got my stitches stitched, I got my fixes fixed
In my aching head, I got my kisses slit
Our gossip lips stuttered every word
I said, I said
I got your love letters, corrected the grammar
And sent them back
It's true, romance is dead
I shot it in the chest, then in the head
And if you wanna go down in history
Then I'm your prince
Because they've got me in a bad way
I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs
It was competition
Make the biggest scene
Make the biggest...
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
I'm casually obsessed and I've forgiven death
I am indifferent yet, I am a total wreck
I'm every cliche
But I simply do it best
And if you wanna go down in history
Then I'm your prince
Because they've got me in a bad way
I've never seen a heart I couldn't break
It was never about the songs
It was competition
Make the biggest scene
Make the biggest...
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Go!
I went to sleep a poet and I woke up a fraud
To calm your nerves, I'm feeling for my clothes in the dark
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chances
Which came first, the music or the misery?
We're high-fashion, we're last chancesThese are your good years
Don't take my advice
You never wanted the nice boys, anyway
And I'm of good cheer
'Cause I've been checking my list
The gifts you're receiving from me will be
One awkward silence
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep
Staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year's
For you to dedicate your last breath to me
Before you bury yourself alive
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Happy New Years, baby
You owe me the best gift I will ever ask for
Don't call me up when the snow comes down
It's the only thing I want this year
One awkward silence
And two hopes you cry yourself to sleep
Staying up, waiting by the phone
And all I want this year
For you to dedicate your last breath to me
Before you bury yourself alive
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree 
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Don't come home for Christmas
You're the last thing I wanna see
Underneath the tree 
Merry Christmas, I could care less
Dude, sweet! They've recorded a Christmas song!
They must've spent a lot of money on this...
But this one time, this one Christmas I got this-I spent most of last night dragging this lake
For the corpses of all my past mistakes
Sell me out, the joke's on you, we are salt and you are
The wound
Empty another bottle and let me tear you to pieces
This is me wishing you into the worst situations
I'm the kind of kid that can't let anything go, but you
Wouldn't know a good thing if it came up and slit your throat
Whoa, whoa, ooh
Whoa, whoa
Your remorse hasn't fallen on deaf ears, rather ones that just don't care
Cause I know that you're in between arms, somewhere
Next to heartbeats where you shouldn't dare sleep
Now, I'll teach you a lesson for keeping secrets from me
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
And did you hear the news? I could dissect you and
Gut you on this stage not as eloquent as I may have imagined
But it will get the job done, and you're
Done...
Every line is plotted and designed to leave you
Standing on your bedroom window's ledge
And everyone else that it hits, that it gets to
Is nothing more than collateral damage
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a while
Take your taste back
Peel back your skin
And try to forget how it feels inside
You should try saying "No" once in a while, "No" once in a whileI sat outside my front window, this story's going somewhere
He's well hung and I am hanging up
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started," so let's get this party started
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world had folded, like legs and fingers holding
Onto what escapes me, what he has, a better kiss that never lasts
You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over," dead and gone, dead and gone, yeah
The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too
This is me standing in the arch of the door
Hating that look that's on your face
That says there's another fool like me
There's one born every minute, there's one born every minute
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, inflated, then demoted all my
Oxygen to product gas, and suffocated my last chance
To say between your smiles and regrets:
"Don't say it's over," dead and gone, dead and gone
The calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out too
Calm before the storm 
Whoa!
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out tonight
Reception less than warm set it off!
And the sun burnt out tonight! Whoa, yeah!
Sun burnt out tonight, the sun burnt out tonightComing in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight 'till the ending
And this will not be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I'm gonna get you to burst just like you were a bubble
Frame me up on your wall just to keep me out of trouble
Like a moth getting trapped in the light by fixation
Truly free, love it baby, I'm talking no inflation
Too many war wounds and not enough wars
Too few rounds in the ring and not enough settled scores
Too many sharks, not enough blood in the waves
You know I give my love a f-f-f-four letter name
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri but the truth catches up with us eventually
Try to say live, live and let live
But I'm no good, good at lip service
Except when they're yours, mi amor
I'm coming for you and I'm making war
And I still love the way I hurt you
It's irresistible, yeah
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, baby
I love the way, I love the way
I love the way you hurt me, babyShow me, show me, show me a starry-eyed kid
I, I, I will break his jaw
I won't, I won't, I won't let him get his hopes up
No-oh, oh, oh
And I will save him from himself
Here's a picture with a note, "No, don't turn out like me"
It's only for your own good
No-oh, oh, oh
And haven't you heard, the word on the street is
"I lost it, called it quits," get out into the sun
Out from behind the gossip
Oh, oh, oh
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Keep, k-keep talking, keep this alive
This story's getting old
The home wrecker with the heart of gold
Keep you locked up in the trunk of my mind
Now-ow-ow
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Hey! Hey!
Even when there's n-n-n-n-nothing worth living for
You're still, you're still, still worth lying for
No-no one has to

Now-ow-ow, n-now-ow-ow, n-now-ow-ow, n-now-ow-ow, stop!I'm holding out and I'm holding on
To every letter and every song
I wrote myself out of the day we ever had to meet
Are you through with me?
So, and when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face 
I'm all ears and I'm all scars
To hear you tell me "Boys like you, you try too hard
To look not quite as desperate," I'm hanging on
But I still know the way to make your makeup run
So, and when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me sorry with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
Will you be able to tell me "sorry" with a straight face
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes to hell
And when it all goes...Yeah!
My heart ticks in beat with these kids that I grew up with
Living like life's going out of style, and you came to watch us
Play like a "Big shot talent," but at the end of the day you know
Whoa, where we come from and where we call home, whoa
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
They'll say it's not worth it, so we'll leave this town in ruin
Living like life's going out of style, and you came to watch us
Play like a "Big shot talent", but at the end of the day you know
Those busted lips we take back home
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
So, hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back, yeah!
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back
I know you would be there either way
I'm so glad it seems like these times will never fade
Hey, Chris, you were our only friend
And I know this is belated, but we love you back!Landing on a runway in Chicago, and I'm grounding all my dreams
Of ever really seeing California, 'cause I know what's in between
Is something sensual in such non-conventional ways
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't 
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you,"  "We miss you"
 Tonight is all about "We miss you"
And I can't forget your style or your cynicism
Somehow it was like you were the first to listen
To everything we said
My smile's an open wound without you
And my hands are tied to pages inked to bring you back
Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
Tonight I'm writing you a million miles away
Tonight is all about "We miss you,"  "We miss you"
 Tonight is all about "We miss you" now
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are golden
These friends are, new friends are

Tonight the headphones will deliver you the words that I can't say
These friends are, new friends are goldenI am such a sucker, and I'm always the last to know
My insides are copper, I'd kill to make them gold
Conversation got me here, another night alone in the city
So make my bed the grave and shovel dirt onto my sheets
Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true
When you go, I will forget everything about you
When you go, I will forget everything about you
I have seen sinking ships go
Down with more grace than you
Turn this up, I'll tune you out, another night alone in the city, yeah
Fake it like you matter, that's a lie we can both keep, oh
Every friend we ever had in common
I will sever the tie, sever the tie with you
You can thank your lucky stars
Everything I wish for will never come true
When you go, I will forget everything about you

Ghostbusters, who you gon' call?
They roll up to my house, the knocking on my door
They come busting in, killing all the ghosts
It's so strange in my neighborhood
Look out the window and it ain't too good

Whoa
Be careful making wishes in the dark
Can't be sure when they've hit their mark
And besides in the mean meantime I'm just dreaming of tearing you apart
I'm in the details with the devil
So now the world can never get me on my level
I just got to get you out of the cage
I'm a young lovers rage
Gonna need a spark to ignite
My songs know what you did in the dark
So light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
Light em up, up, up
I'm on fire 
Whoa
In the dark-dark
Whoa
In The dark-dark
All the writers keep writing what they write
Somewhere another pretty vein just dies
I've got the scars from tomorrow and I wish you could see
That you're the antidote to everything except for me
A constellation of tears on your lashes
Burn everything you love
Then burn the ashes
In the end everything collides
My childhood spat back out the monster that you see
Yeah
2 Chainz!
Light it up
I'm so hot, I'm getting head in a fire truck
She like when I buy her stuff
No strings attached, she want me to tie her up
She ask how much money I got
I told her "Not enough"
"Do Not Disturb" sign on my hotel
So many girls on my, on my coattails
I told them it's a new day, a new way to get it
I told them "Turn over, I got a new way to hit it"
You know I gotta get it, I ain't lying to ya
Stand close to me, I'll put fire to ya
Self-medication, I take one to the head
And I ain't chasing nothing
Chorus
Whoa
Chorus
WhoaZaytoven
M-M-M-M-Migos!
Coming in unannounced, drag my nails on the tile
I just follow your scent, you can just follow my smile
All of your flaws are aligned with this mood of mine
Cutting me to the bone, nothing left to leave behind
You ought to keep me concealed just like I was a weapon
I didn't come for a fight but I will fight til the ending
This will not be a battle, might not turn out okay
You know you look so Seattle but you feel so LA
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah

M-M-M-M-Migos!
You hurt me one time then I love it, one time
You hurt me two times then fuck it
When my pockets was low, you was ready to go
Now my pockets on swole you got relationship goals
When you laid your eyes on me, you was excited
And I was the fuel to your flame, I ignited
Then you stole my heart, that's the heart of a lion
So fuck all this shit, let's just start up a riot
This world is so cold that's why I bought a fur coat
My house is on a island, you gonna need a, need a boat
And I swim with the sharks til the other side
And I feed on the  outside
I came from the bottom, are you from the bottom?
If you ever had problems and you started from the bottom, holler
And I love the way you hurt me
It's irresistible, yeah

And took you places a basic bitch, she'll never go
Now you running around showing off your camel toe
Got you singing a sad song, call you Satchmo
Then go home and tell your momma about us and we fuss
She called my phone and question me like we love her, she bugging
I think it's better that we end our days and split our ways
Know you like them red bottoms, put you right back in them Js
When we go shopping we cop it right then and never wait
When we depart, go put that merchandise on layaway
I tried to show you expensive shit and luxury living 
Breaking news, break your heart when you see me on television
Takeoff
You're second hand smoke, second hand smoke
I breathe you in, but honey I don't know what you're doing to me
Mon chéri but the truth catches up with us eventually

Sometimes when I'm in heaven
I get forgetful of the earth, whoa
Until I hear you bickering like boys and birds
The heat is on, gate's open, the shade is down
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun
Boomerang my head back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Get familiar! Clinton Sparks!
I've got the skyline in my veins
Forget your night times
Summer love on a gurney
With a squeaky wheel
And joke us, joke us
'Til Lakeshore Drive goes back into focus
I just wanna come back to life
Spark until you hit or give your woman love
I got a pocket full of deadliness
Opium den mother forget my head
At the dead-end called unsteadiness
Boxed blondes have less fun, fun
Boomerang my head back to the city I grew up in
Again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head back to the city I grew up in
Again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Boomerang my head back to the city I grew up in
Again and again and again and again, forever a lake effect kid
Woo!I could walk this fine line between elation and success, but we all
Know which way I'm going to strike the stake between my chest
So, "You have to prove yourself!"
You'll have to prove it to me
So now you're waiting up for him
You're wasting time, yeah, every time
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself
Whoa, can't do it by myself

So now you're waiting up for him
Still wasting time, yeah, every time, yeah

Whoa, can't do it by myself
"You have to prove!"I chime in with a, "Haven't you people ever
Heard of closing the goddamn door"
No, it's much better to face these
Kinds of things with a sense of poise and rationality...
But this ain't that song, and this ain't that band
This ain't a scene, it's a goddamn arms race...They told him, "Don't you ever come around here
Don't wanna see your face, you better disappear"
The fire's in their eyes and their words are really clear
So beat it, just beat it
You better run, you better do what you can
Don't wanna see no blood, don't be a macho man
You wanna be tough, better do what you can
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it , beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it 
Just beat it , just beat it 
They're out to get you, better leave while you can
Don't wanna be a boy, you wanna be a man
You wanna stay alive, better do what you can
So beat it , just beat it 
You have to show them that you're really not scared
You're playin' with your life, this ain't no truth or dare
They'll kick you, then they'll beat you, then they'll tell you it's fair
So beat it, but you wanna be bad
Just beat it , beat it
No one wants to be defeated
Showin' how funky and strong is your fight
It doesn't matter who's wrong or right
Just beat it , just beat it

Let's go
With all this bread, I need a bigger stomach
My name ring bells, so you can here me comin'
Made it all on my own, they ain't give me nothin'
And, I'm still standin' like a set of crutches
Ain't no way they gon' forget my name, uh-uh
I'm a legend puttin' in work ever since I came
This is your umbrella, naw it can't stop my reign
You in the car pool, I'm in a different lane
I just wake up every mornin' and go get the change
Do my own dirty work, and I won't get a stain
I'm too heavy in this game and you better know it
Hustle speaks for itself, I don't even gotta show it

Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold
But you will remember me
Remember me, for centuries 
Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history
Remember me for centuries 
Hey, hey,  hey
Remember me for centuries
Mummified my teenage dreams
No, it’s nothing wrong with me
The kids are all wrong, the story’s all off
Heavy metal broke my heart
Come on, come on, and let me in
Bruises on your thighs like my fingerprints
And this is supposed to match
The darkness that you felt
I never meant for you to fix yourself

Just one mistake
Is all it will take
We'll go down in history 
Remember me for centuries 
Hey, hey, hey
Remember me for centuries
And I can't stop 'til the whole world knows my name
Cause I was only born inside my dreams
Until you die for me, as long as there's a light, my shadow's over you
Cause I am the opposite of amnesia
And you're a cherry blossom
You're about to bloom
You look so pretty, but you're gone so soon
Some legends are told
Some turn to dust or to gold

The clock strikes upon the hour, and the sun begins to fade
Still enough time to figure out how to chase my blues away
I've done alright up 'til now
It's the light of day that shows me how
And when the night falls
Loneliness calls
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
I've been in love and lost my senses, spinning through the town
Sooner or later, the fever ends, and I wind up feeling down
I need someone who'll take a chance
On a love that burns hot enough to last
So when the night falls
My lonely heart calls
Oh! I want to dance with somebody
I want to feel the heat with somebody
Yeah! I want to dance with somebody
With somebody who loves me
Oh! I want to dance with somebody

I just want to fill you all with such dread
Let you suck it out, let you suck it out 'til I'm dry and dead
Now, I've got love flowing in my nightmare girl
Caffeine cold, caffeine cold and I can't see shit
Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again
Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again
Now, I smell like cigarettes 'cause I love to breathe your smoke
I smell like alcohol 'cause I drink to believe in more

Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again
Don't breathe life into a monster, then
Complain when he destroys it all, again

But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
They've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
If I was still around, walk me through
I am your savior now and I'm your secret, too
Carry them alive, fall off the case again
You're just a black widow who fell in love with herself
They've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
If it's never been broken, can't believe in it
Now you're just a problem for someone else to fix
If I was still around, if I'm near you
I am your savior, yeah, I am your secret, too
They've got us surrounded, we're in their sights
But they're not taking us alive
Hot to the touch, cold on the inside
But they're not taking us alive
Bull shitty crap shit...I am an arms dealer
Fitting you with weapons in the form of words
And don’t really care, which side wins
Long as the room keeps singing
That’s just the business I’m in
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
I’m not a shoulder to cry on, but I digress
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
Now, I don’t know what the hell this song is talking ‘bout
Do you?
She said, "Yeah, I’ve been spending all day trying to figure that out
You too?"
The arms race made 'em raise they arms and race straight to the top
Who knew?
Right now, they got the number one spot; do you want that?
Me too
One thing I gotta call out boy
Take a look at Fall Out Boy
Since they ain’t black
When they get money they don’t ball out boy
They just buy tight jeans till they nuts hang all out boy
They figure Ye' dress tight
So we gon' dress tighter
He dress white, so we gon' dress whiter
So in spite of anything you might of
Seen or heard, this scene occurred
Word
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
All the boys who the dance floor didn’t love
And all the girls whose lips couldn’t move fast enough
Sing until your lungs give out
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
This ain’t a scene; it’s a goddamned arms race
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricate
I’m a leading man
And the lies I weave are oh-so intricate, oh-so intricateBecause they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb
Now I’m just numb
I don’t feel a thing for you
This is a black black ski mask song
So put all of your anger on
In the truly gruesome do we trust
I will always land on you like a sucker punch
Singing I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare
I am the worst, I am the worst nightmare
If you knew, knew what the blue birds sang at you
You, would never sing along
Cast them out because this is our culture
These new flocks are nothing but vultures
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb 
Now I’m just numb 
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you
Uzi, Fall Out Boy
Lately I've been cooking up the blue flame
And I'm hanging with a model cause it do 'caine
Yeah, be out tweaking on the D'usse, uh
I showed up to the party with the bling-bling, got a new chain
Every single time the news change
I can never do same or it's too strange
Judging how things turned out, I'm guessing things do change
I been with the burnout boys, stackin' loose change
Niggas acting brand new off the new fame
Swear this shit is lame 
I've been getting twisted off the liquor and the champagne
Pyrex, shawty wear, wear the Balmain
All they do is ball, all you niggas small, small change
I stay with a brand new new
And a brand new moon, new room, and I'm ready to blaze
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb 
Now I’m just numb 
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for you
Ooooh, I say one day the valley is gonna swallow me whole
I feel like a photo that’s been overexposed
Because they took our love and they filled it up
Filled me up with Novocaine and now I’m just numb 
Now I’m just numb 
I don't feel a thing for you
Don’t' mind me I’m just a son of a gun
Don’t stop don't stop till your heart goes numb
Now I’m just stuck
I don’t feel a thing for youI know you heard that I got nominated
Won't you walk the red carpet with it
With a dress I bought you, it's awful when I've been gone too long
And I call like it ain't been a while
That promise that I hold you down seem like a lyric from your favorite song
I'm not surprised if you step aside and get another
Way too hard to reach like a boy in a bubble
Always on a shuttle to another planet
It's crazy how my crash landed only leave you damaged
I just keep up all the pieces that I left you in
Hoping praying when I'm home I see you again
And you understand I'm being the man I need to be
To provide for the lives of you and me
Cause you know that
I got those jet pack blues
Just like Judy
The kind that makes June feel like September
I'm the last one that you'll ever remember
And I'm trying to find my peace of mind
Behind these two white highway lines
When the city goes silent
The ringing in my ears gets violent
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"
I'm talking about another green room, another hotel
Doing what I'm doing a lot, doing it well
Maybe we should kick it next time, go out all the time
Bone appetite it's so bittersweet when I come around
Always on the phone texting and scrolling talking bout business
Swiping my card could never fix it when I visit
And that's the realest drop you whispered in my ear
The last time you cried on the phone, I felt the tear, believe it or not
When I vamp, I give you all that I got
I do this for us so don't ask me to stop
The lights and glamour ain't the reason why I put in this work
I'm seconds from the stage but I'm putting you first
Despite my absence, words and closed captions
Read me like a simple I love you wrote on a napkin
This is more than just a fly by night action
You're the fuel everlasting to keep my jet packing
I've got those jet pack blues
Fight off the light tonight and just stay with me
Honey, don't you leave
Don't you remember how we used to split a drink
It never mattered what it was, I think
Our hands were just that close
The sweetness never lasts, you know
She's in a long black coat tonight
Waiting for me in the downpour outside
She's singing, "Baby, come home" in a melody of tears
While the rhythm of the rain keeps time
And I remember
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Baby, come home
Did you ever love her, do you know?
Or did you never want to be alone?
And she was singing, "Baby, come home"
"Baby, come home"Now I'm the king of the swingers, oh the jungle VIP
I've reached the top and had to stop and that's what botherin' me
I wanna be a man, mancub and stroll right into town
And be just like those other men, I'm tired of monkeyin' around
Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too
Now don't try to kid me, mancub, I made a deal with you
What I desire is man's red fire to make my dream come true
So give me the secret, mancub, hey clue me what to do
Give me the power of man's red flower so I can be like you
Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too, yeah
Now here's your part of the deal, cuz
Lay the secret on me of man's red fire
You, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk like you, talk like you too
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human too
Oh, oobee doo, I wanna be like you
I wanna walk, I wanna walk, I wanna walk and talk like you
You'll see it's true
An ape like me
Can learn to be human tooWhat's this? What's this?
There's color everywhere
What's this?
There's white things in the air
What's this?
I can't believe my eyes
I must be dreaming
Wake up, Jack, this isn't fair
What's this?
What's this? What's this?
There's something very wrong
What's this?
There's people singing songs
What's this?
The streets are lined with
Little creatures laughing
Everybody seems so happy
Have I possibly gone daffy
What is this?
What's this?
There's children throwing snowballs
Instead of throwing heads
They're busy building toys
And absolutely no one's dead
There's frost on every window
Oh, I can't believe my eyes
And in my bones I feel the warmth
That's coming from inside
Oh, look
What's this?
They're hanging mistletoe, they kiss
Why that looks so unique, inspired
They're gathering around to hear a story
Roasting chestnuts on a fire
What's this?
What's this?
In here they've got a little tree, how queer
And who would ever think
And why?
They're covering it with tiny little things
They've got electric lights on strings
And there's a smile on everyone
So, now, correct me if I'm wrong
This looks like fun
This looks like fun
Oh, could it be I got my wish
What's this?
Oh my, what now?
The children are asleep
But look, there's nothing underneath
No ghouls, no witches here to scream and scare them
Or ensnare them, only little cozy things
Secure them in their dreamland
What's this?
The monsters are all missing
And the nightmares can't be found
And in their place there seems to be
Good feeling all around
Instead of screams, I swear
I can hear music in the air
The smell of cakes and pies
Are absolutely everywhere
The sights, the sounds
They're everywhere and all around
I've never felt this good before
This empty place inside of me has been filling up
I simply cannot get enough
I want it, oh, I want it
Oh, I want it for my own
I've got to know
I've got to know
What is this place that I have found?
What is this?If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I’d know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
I’d get on my knees, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees, I'd get on my knees, knees, kne–
Take the pain
Make it billboard big and swallow it for me
Time capsule for the future
Trust me, that's what I will be
Oh, the things that you do in the name of what you love
You are doomed but just enough
You are doomed but just enough
If you were church, whoo
I'd get on my knees, yeah
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I’d get on my knees
I love the world but I just don’t love the way it makes me feel
Got a few more fake friends
And it's getting hard to know what’s real
And if death is the last appointment
Then we're all just sitting in the waiting room 
I am just a human trying to avoid my certain doom
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you’re holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
Yeah, uh
I need love like anybody else
'Cause Lord knows that I don't love myself
And I'm tired of living in this hell
But I'm scared of seeing you with someone else
Why you gotta do me like that, though?
I've been on the road, then I'm back home
Never knew I could feel that low
Stuck inside looking out the window
And it's too much, feeling too much
Feeling used up, thinking I'ma lose touch
Every time I wake up in the morning, wish I didn't
I've been on my knees praying
And I mean it when I say it
If you were church, I'd get on my knees
Confess my love, I'd know where to be
My sanctuary, you're holy to me
If you were church, yeah, I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my –
Knees
I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my knees
I'd get on my kneesI dried my eyes, now I'll crust them with sleep
I'll crust them over
She begged me, "Don't hate me"
She spun me a story
Where winning looks like losing
And I'm winning every time
So thread spools, sweetie, get ready
Until my silk is sold
Growing up
Growing up
Growing up
Yeah! I'll find myself anew
Yeah! I'll find myself anew
I've dried my eyes, now it's "Rushmore"
I'm deep with futures like Chicago
No, Glenview never meant a thing to me
She never meant a thing to me
Except for putting idealists in a body bag
Forget it
I'll go out tonight and piss on her doorstep
And listen to The Misfits "Where Eagles Dare"
To swallow whole
Up
Growing up
Growing up
Go!
Whoa, I guess I'm my own better half
Whoa, I guess I'm my own better half
Whoa, yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, I guess I'm on my own
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I guess I'm on my ownHere we go again
Welcome to the demolition derby that is my heart
I'm only here to crash a life it was never alright from the start
Sometimes I feel like the whole world is after me
I'm just the best looking pony in the glue factory
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all time favorite
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
Nothing left!
Uh!
But out of every pretty pretty miscalculation
You have got to be my all time favorite
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's nothing left
LOVE! SEX! DEATH!
Till there's n-n-nothing left
Nothing left!
Uh!I saw you dance in the corner
I call your name in conversation
Playing hard to get
Well, I can't understand
When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
Talk 'til dawn, my heart is racing
I took you home in the driving rain
Had my mind made up
I wanna feel your touch
When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine 
The night begins to shine 
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine 
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
When I look at you
I see the story in your eyes
When we're dancing
The night begins to shine
Night begins to shine 
The night begins to shine
The night begins to shine 
When we're dancing
The night begins to shineThere's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...
Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes
I just need enough of you to dull the pain
Just to get me through the night until we're twins again
Until we're stripped down to our skeletons again
Until we're saints just swimming in our sins again
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Keep making trouble till find what you love
I need a new partner in crime and you shrug
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...
Woke up inside a casket after thought that I missed her
Funny it's always an after thought whenever I kissed her
Skeleton in my closet don't want to see me alive
But somehow I get blinded when I look into your eyes
A birth and a death on the same day
And honey I only appear so I can fade away
I wanna throw my hands in the air and scream
And I can just die laughing on your spiral of shame
And there's a jet black crow droning on and on and on
Up above our heads droning on and on and on
Hit it never quit it I have been through the wreck
But I can scream enough to show my face in the light of day
Innie-minnie decisions who I choose to be with
Victim of superstition, won't see me in the pic booth
I'm under supervision would be damned if I slipped up
You knew my true intention but you want to keep pretending
Look I can't keep pretensin', can't even be present
Now you tryna  
Let the story fucking 
Fuck it, go to Heaven
I'm the room 407
There's a room in a hotel in New York City
That shares our fate and deserves our pity
I don't want to remember it all
The promises I made if you just hold on
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...
Hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on, hold on...Break down
Let me tell you how I get it up
Uh, run the town with my number one
Together we the deuce
Numbers in pursuit for the loot
His best friend was Banks
Now we cashing out at Drew's
On a way from my new
New thing, new thing
Oh yeah, hooray
When I'm calling out to you
When I'm falling out the coupe
Hold me down like a crown
You a king, it's supreme on the soup
I'mma come clean, I'm addicted to you
The kitty get chills when you rolling up
Rolling down the highway in new
Let me tell truth, I like me some you
And if you alright with me, then a bride got a groom
Stuck in the jet wash
A bad trip I couldn't get off
Maybe I bit off more than I could chew
Overhead of the aqua blue
Fall to your knees bring on the rapture
Blessed be the boys time can't capture
On film or between the sheets
I always fall from your window to the pitch black street
And with the black banners raised
As the crooked smiles fade
Former heroes who quit too late
Who just wanna fill up the trophy case again
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'm not passive but aggressive
Take note, it's not impressive
Empty your sadness like you're dumping your purse
On my bedroom floor
We put your curse in reverse
And it's our time now if you want it to be
Maul the world like the carnival bear set free
And your love is anemic and I can't believe
That you couldn't see it coming from me
And I still feel that rush in my veins
It twists my head just a bit to think
All those people in those old photographs I've seen are dead
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
Sometimes I just want to sit around and gaze at my shoes, yeah
And let your dirty sadness fill me up just like a balloon
And in the end
I'd do it all again
I think you're my best friend
Don't you know that the kids aren't al-, kids aren't alright
I'll be yours
When it rains it pours
Stay thirsty like before

I'm trying to kick the habit
But when you're not around, I just can't stand it
Oh yeah, I think I woke up on the wrong side of paradise
 The wrong side of paradise
 The wrong side of paradise
 I think I woke up on
 The wrong side of paradise
 The wrong side of paradise

 I think I woke up on
The wrong side of paradiseThey say we are what we are
But we don’t have to be
I’m bad behavior but I do it in the best way
I’ll be the watcher of the eternal flame
I’ll be the guard dog of all your fever dreams
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass...
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t
Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals, immortals, immortals
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again everyday
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound, but they’re my sutures
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass...
I’ll try to picture me without you but I can’t
Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
Live with me forever now, pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals

They tryna keep heaven's gates open late for me
I see the way the wolves salivate for me
If I don't make it home, baby don't wait for me
Shit, there was a murder up in Harlem
I heard there was a riot down Georgia
Out in Michigan to Watts, California
God Bless Ferguson, Baltimore
Chaos and less order, we could be immortal
It's already gon' be another martyr
It's already gon' be another murder
The nature of the monster we're a part of
Say a little prayer for your son, for your daughter
Do a Hail Mary then run for the border
Where I come from, my whole life span shorter
I got stress disorder, be immortal
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immortals
Immortals, immortals, immortalsYou and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fire
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
From this last since talking got me feeling defeated
Since the last time we talked your shit almost got deleted
It's nothin' personal, personally, just thoughts of you hurting me
I purchased all this shit in the bias of misery
I purchased all these furnishings I still got bitched
Let go of my white women and I still got lynched
The sex was on fire, shit, we still look singed
Them hoes was one too many, how they still your friends?
I'd explode from the pressure
Yeah, the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
My 9 to 5 is cutting open old scars
Again and again till I'm stuck in your head
Had my doubts but I let them out
You are the drought
And I'm the holy water you have been without
And all my thoughts of you
They could heat or cool the room
And no, don't tell me you cried
Oh Honey, you don't have to lie
Oh I'm sorry I didn't mean any of it
I just got too lonely, lonely, whoa
In between being young and being right
You were my Versailles at night
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of July
We were fireworks
On the fourth of July
Shining bright in the sky
We went off too soon, yeah
We were playing with fire
In the middle of June
It can explode from the pressure
Yeah the bombs go off, watch the bombs go off
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
That went off too soon
And I miss you in the June gloom too
It was the fourth of July
You and I were, you and I were fire, fire, fireworks
I said I'd never miss you
But I guess you never know may the bridges I have burned
Light my way back home on the fourth of JulyWhy can you read me like no one else?
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out
I wish I kept them behind my tongue
I hide behind these words
But I'm coming out
Put your hand between
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them hate us
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them so jealous
All the ways you make my stomach turn
And all the long drives
With my friends blur
And I wish I kept them inside my mind
I hide behind these words
And think of all the places
Where you've been lost
And then found...out
In between my sheets
In between the rights and the wrongs
Put your hand between
An aching head and an aching world
We'll make them so jealous
We'll make them hate us
Aching head and an aching world
Think of all the places
Where you've been lost and found...outIf I'm going to hell, I'm going out kicking
It's my soul to sell, but my heart's sinking
As the whole world is watching me
Pushing me down on my knees
They never hear my shouting "please"
So I rhyme 'till I'm free
Say yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
Feel my pulse beat a thousand times a minute
Don't wake me up just let me dream
As I watch the world go crashing down
Oh my God it's giving me the shivers
This must be real I can't escape
Can we start the countdown 'till the end?
Say yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah 
Let's be alone together 
We could stay young forever 
Scream it from the top of your lung, lung, lungs
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
We could stay young forever
Say yeah
Say yeah, say yeah, say yeah, say yeahWoo! Get familiar! Fall Out Boy featuring Travis from Gym Class Heroes! Let's go!
Get familiar!
White sand, swollen glands, Paris, Tokyo, New
New New York, M-M-M-M-Mexico
Get plastic 
Stay tragic 
Proclamation of emancipation, oh dear Lord
Please let me into heaven for just an afternoon
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can , catch me if you can
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can , catch me if you can
Hahahaha! Yeah, you know what it is!  Get familiar! You ready?
Let's talk about the scene for a minute
I know we ain't been seen in a minute
We left before a minute now we all up in it
Baby boy, if you got the big dreams, go and get it
Never been the type in tight jeans I won't fit in
When I see them scene girls that they all gonna get in
And I'm living clean now while y'all walk in it
No, it's me, but I don't give a damn if you all don't get it
So fresh and so clean, in my Eugene fitted
While I'm laughing at the baby, y'all crying at the clinic
I read a couple blogs and they had my ass livid
But now I got my own, the world gotta live with it
Never played basketball, but I could show you how to pivot
Making moves in that black hatchback Honda Civic
Like I did in high school, wish that I could relive it
But I can't, so let's go on and get the hook a revisit
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can , catch me if you can
No, Sam I am
I can't go to sleep without an ambien
Seen so high they call me mister goodbye
Saying catch me if you can , catch me if you can
Clinton Sparks!
Get familiar!

Now I know they'll never last
And I just want my childhood back
I just want my childhood dead
I- I just wanna take it back
Cargo and despair
All American made
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame
Cargo and despair

I- I just wanna take it back
Cargo and despair
All American made
Let's see who burns the truest in the flame
Whoo! Fuckin' flamesYou already know what it is 
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The stench, the stench, of summer sex
And CK Eternity, oh hell yes
Divide me down to the smallest I can be
Put your, put your v-v-v-venom in me
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I can move mountains
I can work a mira- I can move mountains
Work a miracle
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
Bury me 'til I confess
She wants to dance like Uma Thurman
And I can't get you out of my head
The blood, the blood, the blood of the lamb
Is worth two lions, but here I am
And I slept in last night's clothes and tomorrow's dreams
But they're not quite what they seem
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains 
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
I can move mountains
I can work a mira- I can move mountains
Work a miracle
Ahaha, Young Khalifa, man, yeah
I can move mountains
Joint in my hand rocking Jewels
My job I do it too well
I take care of my crew well
I just cancelled that old show so I'm bout to get a new girl
My new girl is too dull
I'm Brad Pitt in the "Cool World"
Ain't nothing left to do but call your friends and bring 'em through
You feeling me, I'm feeling you
You be the teacher, I'm the student
And I can beat it up but just don't think that I'm abusive
I'm nothin' like her ex, I'm more exclusive
Than the flesh it's no illusion
Young Khalifa
Uh, yup yup
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracle
Oh, oh, keep you like an oath
May nothing but death do us apart
I can move mountains

I can work a miracle, work a miracle (I can move mountains
I can work a miracle)
I can move mountains
I can work a miracle, work a miracleWhen routine bites hard
And ambitions are low
And resentment rides high
But emotions won't grow
And we're changing our ways
Taking different roads
Love, love will tear us apart again
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Why is this bedroom so cold?
Turned away on your side
Is my timing that flawed
Our respect runs so dry?
Yet there's still this appeal
That we've kept through our lives
When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Do you cry out in your sleep?
All my feelings exposed
Get a taste in my mouth
As desperation takes hold
Is it something so good
Just can't function no more?
When love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
And love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart again
Love, love will tear us apart againI got that midnight tennis elbow
Got the solitaire rugburn
Took a turn
An ace up my sleeve 
I want to choke
And get sick off of you
Like secondhand smoke
You got me sweating like Calcutta nights
Just heat and epiphany
I am a wing 
I'm a prayer 
A thimble and an acorn
A promise from a poor apothecary
To an understudy in love forlorn
I'll give you heatstroke
I'm getting you and I'm losing me
We'd get legendary
Tonight little darlin'
Uh huh, little darlin'
But I've got a nomadic head
I love you but I've caught the doom and the dread
We'd get legendary
Tonight little darlin'
Uh huh, little darlin'
But I've got a nomadic head
I love you but I've caught the doom and the dreadWe sold our souls in dark hotel rooms
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"'s
Two explorers in the dark
Making maps and drawing shots
Put the world on notice, I'm ruined and I know it
We threw the game from the start
I'm desperate and devoted, the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark
We sold our souls in dark hotel rooms
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"'s
Two explorers in the dark
Making maps and drawing shots
Put the world on notice, I'm ruined and I know it
We threw the game from the start
I'm desperate and devoted, the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark
We sold our souls in dark hotel rooms
We slip tongues and lie like "I will see you soon"'s
Put the world on notice, I'm ruined and I know it

I'm desperate and devoted, the secret no one told us
My songs know what you did in the dark
Woah
My songs know what you did in the dark
Woah
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the dark
My songs know what you did in the darkI've seen you 'cause you're a double A-side
The crush of the world, got me adrenalized, -drenalized
Fish hook with an open eye
I was Elvis's dead twin in a past life, past life
Whoo, in a past life
Whoo, in a past life
Whoo, in a past life
Whoo, in a past lifeI can't do this, again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal Summer
I can't do this, again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal Summer
When you're watching this
I'll be in the desert just wishing on every star
Scuba diving in the wishing well
Just trying to save myself
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
But I'll save the middle finger for you
You get scared when you look at me
'Cause I, I'm so fine
Miss me? Me, love?
Mr. Superstar
Hands in the air! Hands in the air!
But I'll save the middle finger for you
I can't do this, again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal Summer
I can't do this, again
I need more oxygen
Our days were never numbered
This is eternal Summer
OhFresh footprints in the snow
I never thought, thought that I'd get this cold
I guess you never know
I never thought, thought that I'd get this cold
I know that they say that He died for us
But spirit is something I could use more of
I know that they say that He died for us
But spirit is something I could use more of
And this sadness in our hearts, it's kinda killing me
Oh whoa, it kinda sets me free
Sadness in our hearts, it's kinda killing me
Oh whoa, it kinda sets me freeHey, darling
Know any bands for my... play my party?
Um, I don't know
How 'bout Fall Out Boy?
The king is dead! 
The king is dead! 
The king is dead! 
The king is dead!
Yeah, I said lord be my savior
Please don't, we've been doomed from the start
Now, we're so dismissive
So the king cannot play the part
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" 
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" 
Yeah, I said yeah
They may never think
And wonder why, dear Christ
Every time I see you
I just want to paint the walls white
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" 
Yeah, I said, "The king is dead!" 
Yeah, I said yeah

Hard working turn a home into a mansion

From the young ones to the OG's
From the Bob Loves to the Rozay's
And from the MJ's to the Joakim's

And that white when we at home, that red when away
Got my jersey, my Jordans, I'm ready to play
I've bring the horns in, representin' for the city I was born in
From the Go, so you know that we be going in
Swear to God, I think we about to score again
And we got that ring
We got that foul and we got that free
They got that style but we got that steez
So we shut that down because we got that D fence
Never let my city down, man I put that on Red Kerr
Every dunk should make the cover of a magazine
Feeling flyer than Benny on a trampoline

Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or  boos 
Wa-wa-watch us until we blur
Walk off into the sunset 
Tell rock n' roll I'm alone again
I wanna put the Midwest home again
Your time has passed, they say never means never
Solar flare stares won't last-
Hold on! Hold on! Get familiar! New Fall Out Boy album dropping November 4th! You are there rocking with the Welcome To The New Administration Mixtape! Get familiar! Oh!
Clap until your hands hurt
Standing ovations or  boos

Welcome to the new administration
I can almost see the wizard through the curtains
Alpha dog and oh, oh, Omegalomaniac
Woo! Sorry, you're gonna have to wait for the rest of that!
Welcome to the administration!I served out my detention
And in the end I got an honorable mention
In the movie of my life
Starring you instead of me
When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes, I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like "I'll never leave your side"
Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
I burnt out my defensive
Now, everything I say is taken as offensive
In the movie of my life
Starring you instead of me
When the moonlight
Hits your bright eyes, I go blind
And maybe next time
I'll remember not to tell you something stupid
Like "I'll never leave your side"
Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
Like the oldest movie I ever saw
Was the one we wrote together
I said I hate you, but I'd never change a thing
I can be your John Cusack
I can be your John CusackDo you, do-do you remember
When we drove, we drove, drove through the night
And we danced, we danced to Rancid
And we danced, we danced
And I confessed, confessed
To you riding shot-gun
Underneath the purple skies
And we danced, we danced
With windows down
And we danced, we danced
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again, and again, and again
And you can get what you want but it is never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
You used to, used to every night
But you played me every time
How could I be so dumb
You said I was your favorite one
And now it's true
You don't really want me the way you used to
When I was always the one there for you
Like for your favorite records, I will spin for you
Oh, spin for you
You were the song stuck in my head
Every song that I've ever loved
Play it again, and again, and again
And you can get what you want but it is never enough
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
And I spin for you like your favorite records used to
I spin, I spin, I spin, I spin

Bob DylanShe said she's no good
With words but I'm worse
Barely stutter out a joke
And a romantic stuck to my tongue
Weighed down with words too overdramatic
Tonight it's "it can't much worse"
Vs "no one should ever feel like..."
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't wanna forget how your voice sounds
And these words are all I have so I'll write them
So you need then just to get by
We will own your thoughts
We'll own the song stuck in your head
We'll leave you kicking and screaming
So you can thank us in the end
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
This, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
I only want sympathy in the form of you
Crawling into bed with me, crawling into bed with me
You always fold just before you're found out
Drink up it's last call, last resort
But only my first mistake and I
I'm two quarters and a heart down
And I don't wanna forget how your voice sounds
And these words are all i have so ill write them
So you need then just to get by
Why don't you show me just a little bit of spine?
You've been saving for his mattress, love
Dance, dance
We're falling apart to half time
Dance, dance
And these are the lives you'd love to lead
This, this is the way they'd love
If they knew how misery loved me
Why don't you show me little bit of spine
You've been saving for his mattress
I only want sympathy in the form of you crawling into bed with me
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, dance
Dance, danceGotta change my answering machine
Now that I'm alone
'Cause right now it says that we
Can't come to the phone
And I know it makes no sense
'Cause you walked out the door
But it's the only way I hear your voice anymore
It's ridiculous
It's been months
And for some reason I just
Can't get over us
And I'm stronger then this
Ain't no faith in her
Always walkin' 'round
With my head down
I'm so over being blue
Cryin over you
And I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Gotta fix that calender I have
That's marked July 15th
Because since there's no more you
There's no more anniversary
I'm so fed up with my thoughts of you
And your memory
And how every song reminds me
Of what used to be
That's the reason I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing you were still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Leave me alone
Stupid love songs
Don't make me think about her smile
Or having my first child
Let it go
I'm turning off the radio
'Cause I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so sick of love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Yes, I'm so sick of love songs
So tired of tears
So done with wishing she was still here
Said I'm so done with love songs so sad and slow
So why can't I turn off the radio?
Why can't I turn off the radio?You laughed off my affections
While I passed by your direction
I should have known from your walk, yeah
It was the end of you
It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah
I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose
Taking back every step towards you
Still failing at everything I do
In the meantime just talking with my shoes
Converse with my Converse
At least they hear a word I say
And scrutinize it
Just as far as they can tell what I'm getting at
Tied my tongue around my neck
For the last time
It's not like I don't respect your opinion
Your quick wit lips, just rip me apart
Sometimes, it's times like this, yeah
I got a big mouth
And maybe you could handle shutting it up
A simple contradiction
Could shake my whole foundation
Parker Lewis can't lose
This is the last song about you
This is the last song that I waste on youThat's what I want
Here we go! One...
I am the living that haunts the ghost
The lion paws his own teeth out
So you can love him, now
I am believing
What if it were all a dream?
What if we were demigods?
They'd take to our knees
Raging at the half of our sins
I am the living that haunts the ghost
The lion paws his own teeth out
So you can love him, now
I am the living that haunts the ghost
So go on, pick your poison
Before I pick it for you
What if we grow like a weed?
Feed us trash and moonlight
What if we grow like a weed?
Feed us trash and moonlight, yeahRoxanne

I won't share you with another boy

Hey...Do you have the time to listen to me whine
About nothing and everything all at once?
I am one of those melodramatic fools
Neurotic to the bone no doubt about it
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
I went to a shrink to analyze my dreams
She said it's lack of sex that's bringing me down
I went to a whore, he said my life's a bore
So quit whining because it's bringing her down
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?
Gasping to control, so I better hold on
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Sometimes I give myself the creeps
Sometimes my mind plays tricks on me
It all keeps adding up, I think I'm cracking up
Am I just paranoid or am I just stoned?The art of keeping up disappearances
This is the art, the art of keeping up disappearances
Erase the conclusion, erase the conclusion
But never meant to clear up any of the confusion

Never, never

This is the art, the art of keeping up disappearances
YeahWalking off that stage tonight
I know what you're thinking
"He stands alone because he's high on himself"
But if you only knew
I was terrified and would you mind if I
Sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
And I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
The only girl who ever gave me the time
Was the one who only wanted five minutes of mine
Knocking boots in the back
How degrading is that?
I decline
I was terrified and would you mind if I
Sat next to you and watched you smile
So many kids but I only see you
And I don't think you notice me
Well I've seen your boyfriend
And I don't think he treats you right
But that's none of my business is it?
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, no
I'm not the way you think I am, noWhen I wake up
I'm willing to take my chances on
The hope I forget
That you hate him more than you notice
I wrote this for you
You need him. I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
Someday I'll appreciate in value
Get off my ass and call you
In the meantime I'll sport my
Brand new fashion of waking up with pants on
At 4:00 in the afternoon
You need him. I could be him
I could be an accident but I'm still trying
That's more than I can say for him
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
 He won't find out
 He won't find out
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of town
Where is your boy tonight? I hope he is a gentleman
Maybe he won't find out what I know: you were the last good thing about this part of townBeen gone more days this year than I have been home
Trading friends for trips to the coast
This hotel room feels more like a tomb
It's not gossip if it's the truth
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to
So which is it the boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing fiction?
Hand over my heart, gun to my head
I swear to God I'm through with this
I am the worst liar I know
It's not gossip if it's the truth
I'm sick of always writing songs for you to slit your wrists to
So which is it: the boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing fiction?
Which is it: the boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing fiction?
 So which is it? Which is it?
So which is it the boy who writes the songs or the boy who's in them?
Who's the girl? Is this truth or is he writing fiction?I sat outside my front window
This story's going somewhere
"He's well hung", and I am hanging up
There's a song on the radio that says
"Let's get this party started"
Let's get this party started!
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted
All my oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance
You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone, dead and gone
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
The next time the phone can wring my neck
It gets no answer
And the time that I've spent telling in my roots
I'm shaking in my boots
But still it looks at me
Like an old friend I've betrayed
The dark side of the doormat
Is the one your shoes have frayed
What you do on your own time's just fine
My imagination's much worse, I just never want to know
What meant the world imploded, faded and demoted
All my oxygen to product gas
And suffocated my last chance
You said, between your smiles and regrets
"Don't say it's over"
Dead and gone, dead and gone
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
A reception less than warm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
Calm before the storm set it off
And the sun burnt out, tonight
Reception less than warm
And the sun burnt out, tonight
Tonight
The sun burnt out
The sun burnt out, tonight
The sun burnt out, tonightJust another one champion sound
We about to get down
Who the hottest in the world right now
Just touched down in London town
Bet they give me a pound
Tell them put the money in my hand right now
Tell the promoter we need more seats
We just sold out all the floor seats
Take me on a trip, I'd like to go some day
Take me to New York, I'd love to see LA
I really want to come kick it with you
You'll be my American BoyWalking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah
Last night, I saw my world explode
Well, I'm looking out at you
Obscured by the stand up arcade
And the sound of the descendants
Your smile reminds me of switchblades and infidelity
Walking out on the show is walking out on you
And walking out on you's still the best thing that I ever did
Last night, I saw my world explode, yeah

But my hopes are not quite as high
Can't spot her faults but she spotted mine
She left me for herself
Considering I would too
Go figure, I'm bigger than that
Go figure, I'm bigger than that
The battles only halfway done
I might look young
But I'm no less defeated
How's the weather up there?
She left me for herself
Considering I would too
Good God I wish I was tall
Good God I wish This might just be a waste of time
There's no one I'd rather waste
My time with than all my best friends
So start the car up
We'll all take turns not for the worst
We're all "hasbeens" and "never-were's"
And we're all in the back singing "Roxanne"
Just watching life pass us by
Pass us by
As if we cared
Enough to try to catch up
Enough to make up for lost time
Enough to make up for lost time, yeah
We've been down
We've been out
We've been hanging round
Tip our glasses to no direction, yeah
Start the van
Get me out of this one horse town

You know, I met Fall Out Boy maybe, seven years ago when they were playing, ah, in between , and I remember being, ah, a little unimpressed with their style but, yeah they just had, a funk , that's all I was really feeling. But I gave them $25 in tips, and that was enough to get their speakers out of  ever since. I never much cared for their music, but they're really good for yardwork, and are always there when I need to get to the airport. Like I said,  as I can say. Thanks guys, thanks a lot!Maybe we
Could've talked this over

And I'll have this phone to my head
Fall asleep
Phone in hand

Star 6 7Last night I saw a movie
And I thought about many movies I've seen at your house
Excuse me if I'm rude
But I'd rather that we just strike from the record ones I'd see again without you
Leaning on my shoulder
Distracting me from the plot line
Where can I go when I want you around
But I can't stand to be around you
"Go home"
I'll walk myself to you
I'll walk myself away from here
"Go to hell" is all I thought for seven weeks
But I grew out of that phase looking at these broken photographs of people
Looking glossed just like the way I still remember a summer ago
"Call me back"
I'm pleading with a bottle cork in my head
It wouldn't be the first time
My pillow has been mistaken
Can't stand to be around you
Around you, around you
Can't stand to be around you
I can't stand, can't stand
To be around you
Around youComing out of my cage
And I've been doing just fine
Gotta gotta be down
Because I want it all
It started out with a kiss
How did it end up like this
It was only a kiss
It was only a kiss
Now I'm falling asleep
And she's calling a cab
While he's having a smoke
And she's taking a drag
Now they're going to bed
And my stomach is sick
And it's all in my head
But she's touching his chest now
He takes off her dress now
Let me go
I just can't look
It's killing me
And taking control
Jealousy
Turning saints into the sea
Swimming through sick lullabies
Choking on your alibis
But it's just the price I paid
Destiny is calling me
Open up my eager eyes
'Cause I'm Mr. Brightside

You can bow and pretend that
You don't, don't know you're a legendI don't know where you're going
But do you got room for one more troubled soul?
I don't know where I'm going
But I don't think I'm coming home

For secret girls
Who never stood a ch-ch-ch-ch-chance in the world
I'm not ready for sincerity
I'd tell any lie to keep you listen-listen-listen-listening
I gave you pretentious
I gave you indifference, but you only wanted undressed and defenseless
With all your cheap words about hearts and accidents
Who are you kidding? 
So listen-listen-listen
Sincerity's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
Everyone loves an underdog
That's why you're singing along
With all your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who are you kidding?
Sincerity's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
Everyone loves an underdog
That's why you're singing along
With all your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who are you kidding?
When the hook sets in
And this all ends
I'll wish it never began
Oh I will die without the attention
When the hook sets in
And this all ends
I'll wish it never began
Oh I will die without the attention
Sincerity's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year no one will even care
If it's in
So don't you sound like you mean it
Hold back your breath
In a year
Everyone loves an underdog
That's why you're singing along
With all your cheap words
Who are you kidding?
We're pretty boys
For secret girls
Who are you kidding?We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you
You kept a smile though I would always walk the wire
You gave it all
I gave you reason to have doubt
I had to get out of there
I took the stairs
I don't wanna fight with you if I can't be the one to have you
You sat that chair like a queen in the kitchen
I memorized the lines your eyes made at every squint you shot my way
We would drag ourselves to bed
And sleep took everything I had
I kept it up till he would call
You made me feel like a criminal
And then there's you
You kept a smile though I would always walk the wire
But you're miserable and I'm useless
Always making up excuses
I made you cry too many times
So I'm hanging up that line
I'm throwing rocks at your floor
I'm knocking down your front door
I'm desperate tonight and I just wanna fight
It's my confusion that lets me act so cold
So now I'll go, go, go
And you wanna be just left alone
Put down that phone, cause if you want me just call out "hey boy"I have a present
It is a present
You'll have to learn to find it within you
If you could learn
To love it you just might like it
You can't live without it
There's a million open windows
Passing these opened windows
Whaoh, Whaoh, Whaoh 
There is plenty
To criticize
It gets so easy to narrow these eyes
But these eyes will stay wide
I will stay young
Young and dumb inside
I had just begun
To forget my lines
You're not punk and I'm telling everyone
You could save yourself
You could save us all
Go on living, prove us wrong
Your leap of faith
Could be a well - timed smile
Survival never goes out of style
I have a message: save your generation
We're killing each other by sleeping in
Finnegan, begin again
This one can be won
One can become two
Two can pick and choose
You could be the first
You have to learn to learn from your mistakes
You can afford to lose a little face
The things you break
Some can't be replaced
A simple rule: every day be sure you wake
You could save yourself
You could save us all
Go on living, prove us wrong
Your leap of faith
Could be a well - timed smile
Survival never goes out of
Survival never goes out of styleYesterday you were on my back just to get my time
I guess it's not as precious as it seems
Because I found the time for hanging out and talking on the phone
What should I expect, now that my time is free
And you're nowhere to be found
Next time I'll try
For the first time in my life
It won't pass me by
Procrastinate it can wait, I put it off
Let's start today
Let's start today
My room's a mess and I can't get dressed
I gotta be out by eight o'clock
Deep inside I know the answer 
Well there's no time like the present
And I'd like to hang out but who doesn't
I've made enough mistakes for this lifetime
Now I'm here to make amends
Next time I'll try
For the first time in my life
It won't pass me by
Procrastinate it can wait, I put it off
Let's start today
Let's start today
Next time I'll try
For the first time in my life
It won't pass me by
Procrastinate it can wait, I put it off
Let's start today
Let's start todayAnd you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out
I won't, no
I'm sorry because you're old news
And my life is holding our heads to this gun
You and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off, but you're wrong
I find myself on the street out in front of your house, you can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
I'm coming up to break your heart
You're sleeping with the light on like you're dying to be found out
And you lock the house to keep your secret from coming out
I won't, No. I'm sorry because you're old news
And my life is holding our heads to this gun
You and your new boy think you can come in and keep me off, but you're wrong
I find myself on the street out in front of your house, you can kiss safe thoughts goodbye
I'm coming up to break your heart
You're sleeping with the light on like you're dying to be found out
And you lock the house
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh
And you lock the house
Oh,oh,oh,oh,oh,ohI'm gonna make you bend and break
Say a prayer but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you got
Better put your fingers back to the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter, "
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
Is always cloudy except for 
When you look into the past 
One night stand 
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
One night,  yeah,  and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
One night and one more time 
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"he tastes like you only sweeter." 
One night, yeah, and one more time 
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories 
"see, he tastes like you only sweeter." ANDY: So, the first song on the record is called "The Phoenix".
PATRICK: Uh, it's a song that, um- it kinda happened very quickly and then very slowly. We started with, um, this initial burst of inspiration, um, and then it kinda took us a while to figure it out how to finish off the rest of the song. Um, but, it was one of the most exciting songs for us, I think.
PETE: Yeah, it's awesome. I feel like, um, definitely reminds me of, y'know, a teenager in the summer when they're around in the fireworks and skateboards.
ANDY: The song to me kinda encapsulates the rebirth, I guess. And y'know, kinda the idea behind the record. To-for me, y'know, that way.
PATRICK: There was a time up to getting this song written where I was- I wasn't- it was like "everything was good" but, I didn't feel like my like- like I was in all of it yet. And when I heard this song back the first time, I was like, "it just changed the entire record for me". So the whole, the whole thing, y'know, that's one of the reasons why it's a great first track for us.
JOE: I like to think, like the music, the music in the chorus is so cool, there's like, kinda like a couple different counter-melodies going on that I think all, like, they all like have totally different vibes on there, but when they come together, it can make something incredibly epic.I broke the legs of these pedestals that I once built
And now I've left that part behind
It doesn't matter what anyone else thinks anymore
That bridge was made for us
I have found the right round to settle on for now
But still I grow
We must loosen our grips on fear of solitude
We shouldn't rely on how people react to what we do
Do what feels right to you and only you
 and push on through
Why can everyone not see what this establishment can do
Make you relieve that fashion will elevate you
So many plastic dolls walking through these halls
They drown in water one foot deep
We must loosen our grips on fear of solitude
We shouldn't rely on how people react to what we do
Do what feels right to you and only youWe can’t stop time, although I wish we could
We can’t stop going, although I wish we would
Time is a legacy and the clock is ticking way to fast
Use it wisely or that bump in your heart will be your last
Broken dreams so don’t stop, don’t be afraid to live
Even the future shuts off our minds halfway through, but I feel it’s my time
A boy that wants to live it up won’t win the lottery so give it up
There’s a flame of the fire on the way to your brain
 childish pain
Now we’re all grown up and it’s time to move on
The old days seem new
Tomorrow comes too fast
But, when your life looks dim
Live each day like it’s your last
I’d like to worry you with 
Only sorrow is brought by the undone
Broken dreams so don’t stop, don’t be afraid to live
Even the filter shut from our minds halfway through, but i feel it’s my timeI never really feel a thing
I'm just kinda too frozen
You were the only one
That even kinda came close
I just pinch myself
No longer comatose
I woke up, no luck
I woke up, no luck
And when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
I got too high again
Realized I can't not be with you
Or be just your friend
I love you to death
But I just can't, I just can't pretend
We weren't lovers first
Confidants but never friends
Were we ever friends?
But when your stitch comes loose
I wanna sleep on every piece of fuzz
And stuffing that comes out of you, you
I took too many hits off this memory
I need to come down
An-n-n-n-n-n-n-n-nother day goes by
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh n-n-no, no this isn't how our story ends
So hold me tight
Hold me tight, or don't
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na
Oh na na na na na na na na na na na
Hold me tight, or don'tI'm gonna make you bend and break

Say a prayer but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you got
Better put your fingers back to the keys

Ma tell me when the boys get here
It's seven o'clock and I want to rock
Want to get a belly full of beer
My old man's drunker than a barrel full of monkeys
And my old lady she don't care
My sister looks cute in her braces and boots
A handful of grease in her hair
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline
Saturday night's alright for fighting
Get a little action in
Get about as oiled as a diesel train
Gonna set this dance alight
'Cause Saturday night's the night I like
Saturday night's alright, alright, alright
Well, they're packed pretty tight in here tonight
I'm looking for a dolly who'll see me right
I may use a little muscle to get what I need
I may sink a little drink and shout out, "She's with me"
A couple of the sound that I really like
Are the sounds of a switchblade and a motorbike
I'm a juvenile product of the working class
Whose best friend floats in the bottom of a glass
Don't give us none of your aggravation
We had it with your discipline

SATURDAYRooms of a hotel case, whoa
They lead to death and faith
Well, I'm the one for you 
I got nothing, but you're just fine
You'll just stay as small, stay as big
As a little picture calling the hook
What's the next raindrop gonna sound like?
Everyone's just so possessed
No one's gonna fight for real
But I'm just so innocent
The crowd's the next place to fire a bomb
As I look up, the sky just talks
To me as one that got nothing
Just stay as small, just see the floor
No one's entering me, yeah
And if that's one of one
Then get a headache, oh yeah
Dreams are dead
So try to get more possessed
Over if you're gonna say it's OK
If you're gonna say it's OK
Well, try this then
You collect a fence
That protects you possessed
As one with dreams
The time has come
And if you come
To ride the stage
I come with you
Wow, I'm said
Well, no get dead
Hide again
From the night and the soul fights
It's no clear condition, so get worth
It's just the first ride, whoa
And I'm just so possessed
As what I'm gonna do next
The sky is shouting
A message to leave
And when the sky says
Well, you're gonna stay
I'm uniting
Allowing me to dive
Into the depth of the water
To insane depths
Time, time, time
Here I am
Two, two times
No team two flies
No one, it's the end
Says no one who's dead
Deeds are evil, yeah
I got nothing, but you got something, yeahAnd now, a public service announcement for all of you Fall Out Boy fans:

This, uh... to me this song was I think, once we got- When I heard Patrick do the verses in this song, I kind of was like 'oh we can build a body of work around this'. I think this was the flagship of what Save Rock and Roll was gonna be. There are songs that are more aggressive, and there are songs that are less aggressive that they all kinda fit around this
PATRICK: I think up to this point in the recording we had been kinda- Butch Walker produced and the band were kinda feeling each other out in terms of kinda figuring out what direction we were gonna go with and all those other things. And I think once this song kinda fell into place the whole record was easy after that.
ANDY: It was like dominoes.
PATRICK: It was like dominoes because I think it gave us like a blueprint.
JOE: It did definitely set up a sonic blueprint for the record for sure
ANDY: Sonic boom

No, it’s nothing wrong with me

I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass 
I try to picture me without you but I can’t

Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
You pull the blackout curtains down

We could be immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immortals
Sometimes the only payoff for having any faith
Is when it’s tested again and again every day
I’m still comparing your past to my future
It might be your wound but they’re my sutures
I am the sand in the bottom half of the hourglass 
I try to picture me without you but I can’t
Cause we could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
And live with me forever now
You pull the blackout curtains down
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immortals
And live with me forever now
You pull the blackout curtains down
We could be immortals, immortals
Just not for long, for long
We could be immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
Immor—immortals
ImmortalsI'm gonna make you bend and break
Say a prayer but let the good times roll
In case God doesn't show
And I want these words to make things right
But it's the wrongs that make the words come to life
"Who does he think he is?"
If that's the worst you got
Better put your fingers back to the keys
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter, "
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
Been looking forward to the future
But my eyesight is going bad
And this crystal ball
Is always cloudy except for 
When you look into the past 
One night stand 
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
One night, yeah, and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
They say I only think in the form of crunching numbers
In hotel rooms collecting page six lovers
Get me out of my mind and get you out of those clothes
I'm a liner away from getting you into the mood, whoa
One night and one more time
Thanks for the memories
Even though they weren't so great
"He tastes like you only sweeter."
One night,  yeah,  and one more time
Thanks for the memories, thanks for the memories
"See, he tastes like you only sweeter."
One night and one more time
