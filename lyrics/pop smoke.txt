If I tell you once, won't tell you twice
I'm real discreet, like a thief in the night 
If I call you bae, you bae for the day
Or a bae for the night, you not my wife
She want a killer to fuck all night
I wanna fuck on a thot, gimme head all night

Baby OG, I been runnin' these streets
Got the game from Lashawn, I'm my mama's son
Learned 'bout the triple cross when I was young
And I know I ain't goin' so I keep a gun
I flew to Paris just to buy some Dior
She beggin' for attention, I don't see her
C.I.P Pop, I wish that you could see us

I'm livin' like "Thriller", I only come out at the night time
She don't fuck with liquor, don't like bein' tipsy
She don't do the Henny, just white wine 
Pop the cork on some new Pinot Grigio 
I pull up in the Porsche wit' a freaky ho 
Park the Porsche and pull up in a Lambo
I hop out, Major Payne, rockin' camo 
Think she cute, make her fuck, let her man go 
Like to shoot, light you up, bitch, I'm Rambo

Rest in peace to the Pop, make me smoke ya

Walk in the spot, All I see is mad thots
Opps talk, we spin the block 
Nigga's talk shit, they won't get to the top 
Gettin caught at the shop 
I'm moving non-stop
Nigga's dickride till' they drop
All these bitches be chopped
Moving with the opps
Same way Pop Smoke in the stores
He drillin' nigga's with a tank top 
I'm moving too fast, and I'm chasing the bag
Making sure New York don't stay in the back 
Fuck the police they all killing blacks 
You wanna be racist, you ain't getting no racks
Nigga's run up they gon' get attacked
Got a visionary, nigga's getting whacked
I see dickriders in class
Nigga's talk shit
Leave em in the past, Wait 
I gotta chase that bag keep it tight 
Black's killing black's every night 
Government ain't doing shit, it's Zoo York, full of fights (Glltt
Boww)
This world is ice cold, never feel like it's daylight. 
Bitch, I'm from Zoo York, Zoo York

Going outside, flexin' fake guns
Shoot in your face now there's smoke in your lungs
Nigga's is small they could be my son 
Working hard I'm still young 
Moving too fast and I still ain't done 
Rapping hard and I just begun 
Just begun and I already won 
Don't talk shit if you don't got cash
Moving fast and I already got stacks
R.I.P. Pop Smoke, He be spitting facts
Walk around the block he always in tact 
Nigga's is trash they cannot rap
Talking about shit, they talkin' cap 
All I'm doing is spitting some facts
I live in Zoo York, Ion need no map, Hollon Wait 
Working hard, I'm getting the stacks 
Chasing the bag, and I'm moving too fast 
R.I.P. Pop Smoke, always in tact 
Ion give a fuck what nigga's say
I look at them and say you a piece of crap 
Zoo York, Zoo York

Unreleased Music↗Baby, welcome to the party
I'm off the Molly, the Xan, the lean
That's why I'm movin' retarded
Baby, welcome to the party, uh
I hit the boy up and then I go skate in a 'Rari
Baby, welcome to the party
Baby, welcome to the party 
I got the ecs, the shrooms, the acid, yes, you can see I’m a savage 
Baby, welcome to the party 
She pulled up in a Benz, she came with her friend
I told her meet my nigga Bari 
I'm a villain, I'm feelin' like Carti
Yeah, you see the 'fit, I'ma die lit
I beat it, I buss and I dip
I told a witch stop following me
She stalkin' me, she tryna ruin my drip
These niggas run around, screamin' "Gang, gang"
I ain't never seen you on the strip
Never ever had the pebs in your mouth
Never ever had a tool in the whip
Had heavy metal like a bench press
It's a waste of time sendin' death threats
I got love letters I ain't read yet 
The club close, we ain't left yet
Fuck a dress code, we're the best dressed 
Double Rs in my headrest
Asked her if she's coming and she said yes 
That's shopping sprees and the best sex
You're just a silly nigga with your silly raps
Snitchin' on yourself in your verses
I was drivin' home, saw the light was on
Pull up on your girl for a service 
And when it's showtime, they be takin' money out their purses 
It's a hundred racks when I touch a stage, how could I ever get nervous?
A-A-All of them talk 
None of them walk 
They say they are shooters, gunmen
Big dogs, let me see them bark 
A-A-All of them talk 
None of them walk 
They say they are shooters, gunmen
Big dogs, let me see them bark
You never see me, up here, it's so lonely 
Sitting on clouds, bash si taxi mu ka kthy dhe avioni 
Jom ai dibroni , sa doni mohoni 
Prej ditës që erdha dhe deri kësaj dite ju lashë krejt te stoli
Erdhi gogoli, kurora simboli 
Arsyeja pse eci me çanta me vete se nuk mi nxe lekët më portofoli
Too sick, too fine
Too real, too shine 
Shoku erdh dita e jona
Pare tu gjujt me miliona
Too sick, too fine
Too real, too shine
Shoku erdh dita e jona

They say they are shooters, gunmen

Nigga, but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes
Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm raising hell
Don't try and dap me up, lil' nigga, you are not my bro
Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low
They know we bend blocks, welcome to the party
Dot on the head of his only daughter
Then I dunk her head in that holy water
Niggas shootin', we gon' shoot back
Sittin' at the table like Tha Carter 5
They know I'ma do you, aimin' for medulla
Cooler than a cooler, shooter with a shooter
AK on my shoulder like I'm Malcolm X
'Causе I ain't goin' out like I'm Martin Luther
Nigga open up thе door, nigga, I know you home
It's a hundred Crip niggas standing on your lawn
Give up that cheese, give that Provolone
And I ain't talkin' on the phone 'cause I ain't playin' with 'em
I got a K for the cuz if he hit you
If I call Nappy Blue, he come and get you
Call Dread, that's the new Tom Brady
'Cause he be sendin' shots like it's missile
My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high
Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low
I ain't no city boy 'cause I love my bitch
Nigga, but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes
Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm raising hell
Don't try and dap me up, lil' nigga, you are not my bro
Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low
They know we bend blocks, welcome to the party
Niggas always talkin' hot and runnin' they mouth
Until I kick down they door and run in they house
Have they mother on the floor with the gun in her mouth
Like what's that shit up on the 'net your son was talkin' 'bout?
I put that on my son that I'ma take it there
'Cause when you come from where I come from, I ain't playin fair
My lil' homie die and I ain't drop a tear
I just rolled a spliff and put it in the air
I'm big 092, niggas know I'm Woo
I look a nigga in his face like "Who you talkin' to?"
I need 25K or I ain't walkin' through
I need 25K or I ain't walkin' through
I spent twenty on my wrist and twenty on a chain
I be spoiling myself so I can ease the pain
Digital dash, I be switching lanes
I was sitting on the bench, but now I'm in the game
My PTSD startin' to kick in so I gotta get high
Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low
I ain't no city boy 'cause I love my bitch
Nigga, but that don't mean that I don't love my hoes
Niggas tried to smack me up so now I'm raising hell
Don't try and dap me up, lil' nigga, you are not my bro
Trey shot that nigga out my car so now I gotta get low
