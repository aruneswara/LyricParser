I remember we was juugin' off eBay
This no cap, nigga, keep big K's 
Lotta money, boy, a nigga need a big safe 
Fast car, no drag race 
You broke, that's a sad face 
Pockets swole, them big faces 
Big .38, no case 
Fast lifestyle, road rage 
Big iced out Rollie 
My 'em scatter like roaches 
With Guap, the choker chain the coldest 
Get head in the treetop
Let the money tumble in 'til my knees lock
And I'm tryna get some bad bitch back back
Big burner make his ass do a four flat 
Biscotti got me high, sippin' Cognac
Pop a perky then I beat the pussy longer
Hood Baby from the bottom, livin' humble
Now we got the racks hidden in the bunker
Hood Baby make the block hot 
'Member late nights, comin' off a hotbox
Pyrex, used to cook it in the crockpot 
He talkin' too much, cut his lips off 
Hellcat can't curve, doin' drift-offs 
Big slime, Maybach, cut the top off 
If they talkin' 'bout debt, brings the racks out 
Beat her back out, nigga, not Pacquiao
High life, I'm livin' wrong
High life, I'm livin' large
Don't get caught after dark 
Leave the nine, we make it spark 
Four-four gon' make it bark 
Plus we ridin' in expensive cars 
Long way from ridin' MARTA 
Get geeked out my mind, you know 
Blood in the envelope 
Your diamonds small, need a telescope 
Hang your body by the yellow rope 
Pack the building with a lot of hoes 
Put 'em all on payroll 
Bust the bag down with gang
Tell a fuckboy stay in his lane 
Keed and Lil Gotit keep on stain 
Fast car, no drag race 
You broke, that's a sad face 
Pockets swole, them big faces 
Big .38, no case 
Fast lifestyle, road rage 
Big iced out Rollie 
My 'em scatter like roaches 
With Guap, the choker chain the coldest 
Get head in the treetop
Let the money tumble in 'til my knees lock
And I'm tryna get some bad bitch back back
Big burner make his ass do a four flat 
Biscotti got me high, sippin' Cognac
Pop a perky then I beat the pussy longer 
Hood Baby from the bottom, livin' humble 
Now we got the racks hidden in the bunkerBless you, Andy

Girls go cray-cray when they meet the baby

I'ma go ahead put bodies in the lakes
I'ma treat the pussy good, stretch it out like a stretcher
Get it back in, count up on the daily
Spoiled lil' bastard that's the reason I'm the baby
I ain't even Muslim, as-salamu alaykum
I'ma put a rose gold Presi'  diamonds
Diggin' it deep, I ain't need no shovel
Twenty seven thousand got spent on the bezel
Yeah this drip I take it up levels
When I wok, I don't drank yellow
On the track, just came from London
Havin' karats, where the bunnies?
Get the bank, step out with hunnids
Drop the track and it do numbers
Draco just want a encore
Been ready for the drama
Clean 'em up just like a plunger
What the hell, you thought I was a sucker?
VVs hit hard on my knuckles
I got double C styles on my buckle
It's kinda hard to trust 'em
But I'ma fuck around and bust 'em
Who realer, me or you?

I can go anywhere 
Pulled up on Bleveland, freeze 'em through
We spin your block right, just give me a reason to
My slimes out the snake pit, you wanna play, I'ma feed 'em food
I live the hot life, took a prescription I'm up like a pelican
I want all the smoke, I shoot that Kill Tec like a veteran
My time now, yeah you niggas expired
You tired, you just took another xan
Tried to rob and got his head shot down 
He gon' need another plan
The pressure applied
I'm not gonna court him, but I feel like catchin' a body inside 
Lil Gotit send the hit to hood babies willin' to slide 
You ain't took a soul, only thing you kill is the vibe 
Green, red, or blue, I got mob ties nigga
Who realer, me or you?
Whatcha bang, green, red, or blue?

I worked the , but you knew that son
Up up and away 
I'm up up and away 
Up up and away 
I'm up up and away 
I had to get a way
I had to get a way
Had to dream 'bout that shit went and win now
Then that money came upwards like a count now
When them streetlights came on I couldn't stay out
We was trapped  with no way out
I could never leave my boys down hell nah
Did my rounds, I ain't make it to the cap and gowns
But I made it off the fuckin' ground
I built that shit up, I'ma make her feel us
Let me know who big as us
We ain't Malcolm in the Middle
All this sneakin', be low
I'm 'bout my bread like a loaf
I got the strats to go
I got  scrap  vultures
They ain't let us in
Beat down the door we got in
They know we want in
'Cause we know they got in
Clutch on my Glock 
They know I stood on my tippies
I don't need no friends
They Glock could take my twin
Heavy metal, switchin' 
Giving you halo, then I gon' lay low
Enhance the bag, got my mind on another one
New Jag got my mind for another one
I can't fall off, the golden one
I worked the , but you knew that son
Up up and away 
I'm up up and away 
Up up and away 
I'm up up and away 
I had to get a way
Don't put my trust in that
I got mo' on my back
I got hoes on the 
And some more to my 
Politicking and chit chat
Yeah your soul, I'll lift that
Shove this dick on the kit kat
That's a tit for tat
I'm 'bout to go bonkers
I started tourin' numbers
Trap  drummer
They came to see the 
Same clothes re-wore
These boys are getting restort
Rocking Versaces like Leeroy
Enhance the bag, got my mind on another one
New Jag got my mind for another one

Woah, Kenny
I'm not from the earth, I'm a astro
She suck on that dick 'til my mind blown
I flooded the AP, got rhinestones
My pockets so cheaper than nachos
Sending shots at them targets, we lock on
Everybody at war, but we in different zones
They dressin' like me, they became a clone
Did this shit by myself, they ain't put me on
Not police, she tryna arrest
If she slime, she gon' learn from the best
You hatin', you tryna disguise
You need to go key you a prize
I'm back at the spot with the vibes
We come in that war like a tribe
Cashin' out on them sticks for them guys
'Cause we rich, I done changed our lives
I keep whips on the jet
Monkey nuts on the jet
Put the monkey nuts in TEC's
Then I take it on the jet
I keep whips on the jet
I keep Act' on the jet
I keep racks on the jet
Bad bitch suck me on the jet

They thought I wasn't getting it, you thought wrong
These pockets richie, see the cash on me

Cop different drip just to style on 'em
Ain't no love in this shit, you is my opponent
Put my dick in her gut, yeah, I put the donkey
That big ol' booty, yeah, it broke the condom
The way I fuck her, she gon' start some drama
Can't talk about it, promised to my momma
Supercharged truck got them Forgi's on 'em

We kick them hoes out the spot if they cap that

If I'm  with no money 
Soon as they see me, thеy come out  
Pour me a drank
Let mе take one hit of that dank
I can't wait 'til you go to the bank
Pour a deuce now he wanted an eight
Fuck out my face, what you talking 'bout?
My shooters, we came with the knock 'em out
Bankrolls and therefore I pop a lot
We trap out my whole house and trap a lot

Boy, I'm with the shits and that's on my mama
Claimin' that you real, but you ain't really doin' the real nigga shit
I'm overly ready to shoot out that motherfuckin' stick at your clique
Step on a brick and it look like a brick, but this what it is
Step on shit, I drip on shit
Yeah, my niggas gon'  my wrist
Thickish, that's my type of bitch
Matching Chanel  kicks
I'ma bow down, I ain't Kaеpernick
Savage, two-twenty-onе my whip
Open up, extendo on my clip
Rotel, the whole block gettin' dipped
If it's up there with the whole gang, then it's stuck there
Any outbursts or disrespect, you get left there
Damn, my ex bitch, she gon' need more than health care
I'm QB and I see everything, I been there
YSL member , ice cold, December 
Beat the walls down like timber
One of the realest, remember
I was born 
Real, real, real big tipper 
Don Julio my liquor 
My hand on the trigger
Penthouse vibes
And every single vibe or thot
I'm player Chanel, I can't lie
She zooted, she roll with my ties
My wrist make a crushed up ice
For me she leave pussy tight
In the  whippin' 
I'm mastermind, not a child
I just see Pluto in a rush, G-O-T-I-T
Boy, I'm with the shits and that's on my mama
Claimin' that you real, but you ain't really doin' the real nigga shit

I'm getting twenty for a verse, ain't going for nothing cheaper
Bitch, I'm hot like Curry, I'm scoring least a thirty
These niggas is my sons, no need to see Maury
I don't talk about it, doctor, these pills been hurting my body
My dawg just caught a body on a molly, the lawyer calling
The way I put it on you dead gon' drip it out the coffin
I'm here forever, ain't going nowhere, so the opps gon' put 
YSL the mob
 at the top
Putting your body on ice when I'm pouring this lean on the rocks

        Lyrics from snippet
Bitch, wanna see me like a Maybach truck
High-top speed, rockin' Maybach truck 
Drink twice and I double my cup
Do it, no man, yeah, I'm tryna love 
Nigga, can't talk, talk us
Sellin' a shirt, yeah, Glock, Glock us 
Nigga, rockin' Chrome Hearts stuff
Bitch, wanna see me like a Maybach truck 
She made the first cut, the lunch
I be gettin' diamond just to match my cut 
Speak on my name in vain
Nigga, just mad, they livin' like us 
I don't wanna ruin this pain
That don't mean that I ain't have a heart, call me numb 
I'm just stay in my lane
'Fore I turned to a shoot, growin' up, fuck the police 
Put a bitch like A-1 ...Lyrics from Snippets
Frankie, you a fool for this one, man
Pulled up on your bitch, I got weed, where the leaves?
Bitch, no Halloween, I got tricks up my sleeve
I was outta pocket when I hit it, she like jeans
No, we not no rats, but we gon' trap and get that cheese
Bitch, I came in the game with chain chokers and Amiri jeans
Yeah, my bullets Actavis, pour up and make you lean
I'm having vibes in the booth that be sucking and fucking on me
Nigga, how about you?
Runnin' that motherfuckin' Porsche and the engine got horses
I pulled up like howdy-doo
I'm a lil' slimy motherfucker, YSL all in my bones
I'm drippin' some too
I got so many hundreds in my pockets
But these niggas know this ain't that new
My label say that I'm an addict, they tryna rehab me
Well bitch, worry 'bout you
Spot 'em, I got 'em, I cop me a bag
Karlae gonna drip some 
No, we don't pay for the pistols but keep a pistol
 I'm not a wrestler, but I flex on 'em
Givenchy actress in the mansion 'cause I'm Dior spoiled
Double G cover my ankles, yeah, I'm 
Fuck your shooters, we know goblins, nigga, we some martians
Dirty K with a drum on it, it hit him, he spike
I'm rocking cocaine 
Serve the dirty and them bitches gon' 
I'm a party favor, party saver
And them Percs got the meds just like a doctor
Free Milwaukee Bucks, and yeah, I got bucks
I never rode the bus, bitch, I was a walker
So much ice, bitch, it freeze up the faucetLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released

        It's crazy bout a drug
You know it
Hood baby
He ain't talkin' bout nothin', my shooters they here, all ready all that
He screamin' slatt, but he know he don't live like that
He still like designer, boy, you know you don't roll like that
Two different ways, niggas know I took my own wave
Everybody thuggin'
Everybody muggin'
Backwood, we smokin' that Russian
We some hardbodies, screamin' fuck it
They look like twelve we gon' double it
Drop the Xan' in the drank, it start bubblin'
Slime ave on the way
Slime ave don't play
Magnolia, I'm boolin' wit' Lotto
Stick clan, rollie do wit' auto
I'm a slimeball
Pull out guns, come in line, yeah
Who big as us? Nevermind 'em
And that's a fact
 the stick, he gon' lay 'em back
When we slidin' on the block we gon' hit him or jack
Expensive drugs, I copped a bar
Pop pills like ah
Margiela, cut tag off
Oh hell yeah, he barred out
One in the chamber
Two fifty block dangerous
Triple cock, coat hang him
He left that side, can't blame him
You a little bitty boy
I take all your joy
You ain't really makin' noise
I did not say that out of anger
I take all the checks to the banker
That Draco a bitch, she a singer
Hold that boy up for ransom
I brought out my jewelry, the dancers
He ain't talkin' bout nothin', my shooters they here, all ready all that
He screamin' slatt, but he know he don't live like that
He still like designer, boy, you know you don't roll like that

Slime ave on the way
Slime ave don't play
We lit like the baby
That powder, they make it
I can go big on big wit' the lettuce
I can turn this shit to Armageddon
When I signed told the nigga mail it
I been in the gang, nigga, not Belly
I like my cheese hard, nigga, not shredded
I'm not stuck on these hoes, I'ma go get it
That's a NASCAR
Bad bitch wit' no flaws
A lot of cash, dawg
Gon' get her out her drawers
Catch a flight, in the air
I'm headed to the north
All that tough talk
Bring your cash out
Ex-bitches lookin' sad now
Broke niggas lookin' mad now
All these racks they stand around
Bring the vibes to the loud house
Stack them racks in the hideout
Don't want no bitch wit' a loudmouth
This drip is on me, I'm stylin' out
I'm ridin' out
He ain't talkin' bout nothin', my shooters they here, all ready all that
He screamin' slatt, but he know he don't live like that
He still like designer, boy, you know you don't roll like that
