He a opp, I smash his sister
Delete then erase and forget her
Why you only focused on me but the whole damn hood done hit her
Enemies nothing new to me, woodgrain giving out free splinters

If I could have one wish, I'd wish I'd never been born
Make sure my mama don't have me just to guarantee she happy
Would've hurt a lot less, more people, no tears, my eyes just bleed blue
In a white man world, it's tragic, better hope my friends don't pat me
Leave me with my thoughts, worst thing that you could do
Ain't no mental weakling, keep together, no glue
Guess I'm a troubled youth, self conflicted man
Nigga, I had to shoot, ball on my court like gun in hand
Never been scared to die and I already did it like twice
Give me something to live for other than survive
If I had a wish, it'd be get all y'all love
Make sure the whole hood get a hug
Destroy all weapons and drugs
Ain't I so naive? Foolish lil' geek
Sorry I'm out here venting to you, I just had to speak
Baby, crying don't make you weak, she a whole lot stronger than me
Ain't no role model, don't want kids tryna be like me
"When you grow up Fauni, what you wanna be?"

Hop in that shower, get fresh, they done cut off the gas
Candle lights on and all we got to drink is tap
There's gotta be more than life then running away, at least give me that
Relieving myself of anything that I feel holds me back
Watching the days pass
Hid the HiTech in a flask
Hear the law come and go on the flash
Got too much money to match
You ain't even burning no gas
I was just tryna show we going up, don't make it look like I'm bragging
Guess the cat's out the bag
Anybody get toe tagged
Get popped like shopping at Saks
Free my young niggas 'til it's past
Erase my files from the folder
Play blackjack, chess, and poker
Every day get a lil' older, heart gon' grow a lil' colder
Can't even put lil' mama on game 'cause she'll forget who even told her
My buddy like winter soldier, do dirt, dig dirt, all in that order

Ayy, hold on, hold on, hold on, on foe nem, I'm finna goddamn, I'm finna add some more shit on, on the phone and shit, I'ma call you right back
Used to have boil cold water so I could take a bath
Hop in that shower, get fresh, they done cut off the gas
Candle lights on and all we got to drink is tap
There's gotta be more than life then running away, at least give me that
The caller has hung upNiggas ain't fucking with me, I am too cool, baby I came with the heat
Niggas and bitches gon' drool, I can't help it lil' baby we came with a fleet
Lets get money x4
I just want the money fuck the fame x4

Louie in here wit' me doin' this shit too
I know Eiffel's probably out there laughin'
Cause you know Eiffel despites everything I fuckin' do
All my nightmares penitentiary but I'm as golden as the children that's in elementary
Show biz won't reference but they will re-fence me
If actions speak louder than words then, Dad say something
Since 93' I know that my Moms been prayin' for somethin'
Or someone to bring all these blessin's over her stressin'
I'm flawless, as it's seen I reached absolute imperfection gettin' conceded seats when they ask me questions
Selection, I am so kick it wit' me in the section
If you get employed go to school people see you as respectful
Doing good I am, but all this depression only leads to me being neglectful
But fuck it, cause luck is anything that a cluck is waking up in the morning from passing out, I gotta say I love it
Who'd expect such vengeance from dyin'

Coughing from the, transaction, from Austin
Niggas still jocking me, flossin 
I don't let them catch me slippin, not even in poverty
Even in broad daylight, it's a robbing me robbery

Cannot get much higher chasing beautifully dark dreams

I don't wanna be the nigga that tell you what to do
I just wanna the nigga that help you make the proper moves
Money grow on trees, I just picked up from the root
And I planted a seed, watch it grow, seen it grew
You stabbed me in my back and that's something I shoulda known
You betrayed me and that's something I shoulda knew
Of course you did exactly everything you swear you'd never do
Of course you did exactly everything you swear you'd never do
Bitches call me weird, then admit they was tryna fuck
Niggas say I'm pussy  head bust
Society deemed me a threat, hate that I'm getting up
They tolerate a nigga only cuz I'm getting bucks
What's the point of getting money, you can't feed yo family
Life a dice game, all I know is gambling
Was running from the law, had to duck off up in Chamblee
 excuses, more responsibilities I handled it
Whole lotta straps in the back, ooh
Ride with a baseball bat, ooh
Fitted on my hoe, snapback, ooh
Blow a nigga head way back, ooh

Walking with a whole lotta racks, ooh
Baby I keep a stash, ohh

Pull up in this hoe like vroom, vroom
Pull up in this hoe like vroom, vroom
Give her the molly, she consume

I don't wanna be the nigga that tell you what to do
I just wanna the nigga that help you make the proper moves
Money grow on trees, I just picked up from the root
And I planted a seed, watch it grow, seen it grew
You ain't even fuck with me from the beginning, that's something I shoulda knew
Tryna get me mad and tryna control me with words, I'm gon play it cool
All these Benjamins up in my pocket, young nigga count the blues
If I leave a bitch right now, she useless, she'll probably catch the blues
All of these niggas think the so cold, I'll pull up with the heat and you flu
All of these bullets they fly and flew
All of my hollow tips they fly and flew
Please don't try to butter me up thinking you slick or thinking you smooth
You know this shit right here is chess not checkers, don't think they ain't peeping yo moves
All of thee bitches like what I do, all of these hoes be watching my moves
And they niggas be hating on me, so they niggas be watching my moves
I'm gonna keep the drill on me, Bob The Builder I'm keeping that tool
Handy Mandy I'm keeping that tool, and I know you be watching that too
Plotting on everything that I do
But what you think a nigga gon do, I'm so unpredictable, it's frustrating to watch me move
All these bitches be wanting my loot
Lindsay Lohan bitch get a clue
She get smashed then get ran through
She get smashed then get ran through
Whole lotta straps in the back, ooh

        Indigo
Okay, Embasin
I need to know two things, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need to know two things
Bands, bands, bands, yeah
I need to know two things, who is a freak and who is for me
Y'all gang, that ain't even no gang, that pussy lil' shit a clique to me
Why I got a lil' lavish? 'Cause lil' bitch, it's meant for me
Hard work gon' be telling any given day of the week
Her pH too off-balance, she probably belong to the street
Y'all annoying and distracting, I don't fuck with no one on my feed
I'm testing out all my pints and freshing up all my trees
Can't be buddy boy right there bowing down to another man's feet
I be joking, but don't be joking
I be playing, but don't be playing
I be caring, but don't be caring
Say 
But, bitch, I'm a dog, lil' ho, I'm a lion
All up in my business, nigga, what the hell you on?
Y'all be texting calling my phone asking mе what the hell I'm doing
That's why your ho choosing, that's why your ho choosing, yeah
That's why your ho choosing, that's why your ho choosing, yеah
Yeah, that's why your ho choosing
That's why your ho choosing, that's why your ho choosing
I'm big 34, who the hell is you?
Whole TTB lit and quick-draw shoot
You fucked that bitch, I could too, yeah, yeah
Don't kiss and tell, nothing like these dudes who don't even do what they claim they do
I don't give a damn 'bout him 
Yeah, yeah, all  that bang-bang shit, get banged with the force
 with a bad redbone but I swear on my word
Like, baby, don't worry
Baby, don't worry
Something like baby, don't worry, yeah, yeah
Kel-Tec Hellcat  V8 'Vette, I'm out in a hurry
Yeah, that scat pack out, it's scary, ooh
I need to know two things, who is a freak and who is for me
Y'all gang, that ain't even no gang, that pussy lil' shit a clique to me
Why I got a lil' lavish? 'Cause lil' bitch, it's meant for me
Hard work gon' be telling any given day of the week
Her pH too off-balance, she probably belong to the street
Y'all annoying and distracting, I don't fuck with no one on my feed
I'm testing out all my pints and freshing up all my trees
Can't be buddy boy right there bowing down to another man's feet

I like fat lips, pretty feet and thick thighs
Still smash a slim bitch, don't be surprised
Niggas want beef with me, that shit come with fries
Best believe I start singing in this bitch I feel fly
Sitting down to quick on my seat shoot your leg off

And if a opp try to pull up on me, I ain't lacking, tummy tuck

Stick, stick, stick, stick, I walk around wit' a stick
Blick, blick, blick, blick, I shoot that bitch 'til it click

Never goin' out sad, no, not 'bout that bitch
It was me and Scumbag doin' hits out the whip
These niggas is some fags, man, these niggas is trip

My niggas, they shoot at your whip
These bullets hit you in your ribs
These bullets hit you in your whip
Uh, damn, bullets, they sing you a song
Damn, these bullets, you won't make it home
Huh, this chopper, it sing you a song
You pussy, you won't make it home
These bullets, I send 'em along
Big boots stomp you down
Big stick shoot you down
Chopper shoot you down
Axe man chop you down
Whole lot of doves wit' me, walk around wit' my hounds
She wanna fuck in the mansion, then leave her in the pound
RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, watch it get ripped
RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, watch it get ripped
RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, watch it get ripped
RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, RIP, watch it get ripped
