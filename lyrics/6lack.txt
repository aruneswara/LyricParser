I'm loving your light, vulnerable
Letting your guard down, it's honorable
'Specially when the past ain't been that
Friendly to you, but there’s magic in that
You the flower that I gotta protect
And keep alive in the winter time, ayy, don't you die yet
You been way more than a friend of mine, we more like fam
I raise you, you raise me, let's turn this whole life 'round
You can confide in me
I could take the weight up off your shoulderblades
And try to store the pain inside of me
Ayy, why the world do you like that?
Like they don't know you God-sent, but me, I view you like that
I'm sneaking glances, thanking God that he drew you like that
Beautiful Black child, come and shed your black cloud
For your vibe and your smile, I don't mind a lil' rain
I'm your dog, ears perk up at the sound of your name
Count on your main, wildfire, can't handle your flame
Download your shame, wild high, come drown in your fragrance
You that red pill that a nigga found in the Matrix
Before I had you, this shit was fantasy
You plant a seed to grow some roots, a branch and leaves
Becomes a tree of life until our nights are filled
With peace from stress and strife
And that's the blessing that I get from wifing you
'Cause you entrusted me with the key to your heart
Beating you smart, 'cause even though I need a new start
Due to my past transgressions, you believed in me
I guess the light I see in you is what you see in me, Lord
Say she from the west side, mmm
And she see my best side, mmm
Mmm
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you want
Now, could you tell me like it is?

This henny  got me thinkin' 'bout the things that you said
It was real
For real
Up for three weeks
Feeling half past dead
Sitting here reflecting
On what's in my head
And how I feel
For real
I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind
I don't wanna lose myself loving you 
Loving you
I don't wanna lose myself loving you 
Loving you
You know everything 'cause I put it in my songs
If I tell you that I'm working, I ain't out doing you wrong
I got too much on my plate to add some shit that I don't need
I ain't asking you for space just some room to fucking breathe
But I can't stress myself by tryna prove my fucking love
I stand up, say "I had enough"
She stand up "Boy you think you tough"
Take my phone, search what you want
"Who's this bitch?" "Girl that's my mom"
"Who's this woman?" "Girl that's my aunt"
I could be a lame nigga, that's what you want
See you want me to be a pretty liar so bad
But I can't fuck with karma cause she always comes back
So call me every name you can find in the book
But don't try to discredit every chance that I took
I'm running low so don't play with my time
I'm searching but it's nothing left to find
Send out a call but no one's on the line
So if you want it please make up your mind
Please make up your mind

Go straight for the wind and grind
She wanna cum, I can make it happen, fuck trying
Sometimes, I get messy, you can be my biggest secret
I ain't sliding if you're wit' him
Baby, you gon' have to leave him
I got morals on Sundays, sometimes on Wednesdays
Really, it depends, but
You, you’re in love with somebody else
Maybe I could offer some help
Get over them by gettin' under me
But you might O.D. if you get too much of me
Might O.D. if you get too much of me
O.D. if you get too much of me, uh, yeah
Hi, my name is not important

I drink liquor like it's water
Hope my liver can afford it
I've been lyin' here with...
I've been lyin' here, I'll be lyin' here
I'm under the covers like
What happened here ain't nothing sacred
Shit that got me fucked up is
I know that dude just saw me naked
Nursing a broken heart
But who'd've thought it'd take me ages?
I ended up here 'cause my girl said, "Fake it 'til you make it"
You, you're in love with somebody else
Maybe I could offer some help
Get over them by gettin' under me, uh
Hi, my name is, fuck it 'cause my name is not important

Oh-oh-oh
Yeah, haha
I know a lot of people but I don't fuck with a lot
Got me standing here when I just wanna leave the spot
Thinking 'bout a whip and man I might just cop the drop
Just so they could think I'm friendly when I'm not
Arm out the window like yessir 
Right good, working on my left bruh
Man I got my shit together then I stepped up
I got tired of niggas telling me I'm next up
Old label wasn't talking 'bout nothing
Meanwhile, I'm getting ready for a run
I ain't sitting, I ain't talking, I ain't hustling with you niggas
Fuck around and y'all gon' make me push a button on you niggas, ay
I got a baby on the way 
I think about it every day 
They think that paper gon' change me
I do this shit for my baby
I do this shit for my niggas
And we go way back just like crack in the muhfuckin' 80's
This flow is crazy, yeah-yeah-yeah
Yeah, nigga this flow is crazy
I don't fear no man or no object
Bullfighter, I've been working on my sidestep
I know preparation gets you through the process
Look at all the progress
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go 
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know 
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go 
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know, ay
I would never know
Worked on this shit till I was a pro
Ran through these streets, ran through these beats
Ran through these thoughts, ran through these hearts
I was in the dark till I caught a spark
Feel like I'm on fire, get too close, make a nigga die
They cannot be I, it's too hard, they could probably try
They could try, I'm on I-20 tryna get to 85
My girl mad but she don't want another guy
I wonder why?
Wait, no I don't
Work real hard and I get what I want
This is for them days we ain't eat
This is for them nights we ain't sleep
Going through beat after beat now
I could probably make 100 songs in my sleep
Yeah-yeah
I ain't have nobody there, so I had to tell myself when to go 
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know 
I ain't have nobody there so I had to tell myself when to go 
If I was waiting on you to tell me then I would never know 
I would never, I would never, I would never, I would never, never know
Yeah-yeah, I would never know
Oh-oh-oh, haaa
Oh-oh-ohWatch your mouth when you lettin' shit slide
Don't you know I got way too much pride?
Sneak dissin' way on the other side
I turn your fucking wave to a tide
I'm so fucking tired, somehow I still find the time
To care a little more about my rhymes
To care a little more about my peers
To think a little less about my fears
To care a little more about your ears
I give a piece of me to everybody I meet
Not because they want it, it's because it's prolly a need
Claim they woke but they probably asleep, in a cage
Thinking if they make a mill they be free like Meek, nah
I turned a nightmare right into a dream, yeah
I keep my sanity, 'cause I ain't on the scene, yeah
I know I gotta be a rock like Dwayne
So, I'm tryna be a rock like Dwayne, Carter Rebirth
Put that line in reverse, add a little reverb, yeah
We work, so my niggas ain't gotta be on T-Shirts
Watch me get my hands dirty with the rework
Damn, do I even have the fans for this shit?
To be rapping like these people understanding this shit
It's demanding and shit, but I stand for these kids
Like they stan for the kid, understand, how we clear
Crack a beer when I'm feelin' pissed, hmm, yeah
But I ain’t got nobody hand up my back, you ventriloquist
Ever since my songs went platinum like Sisqó
Life done found a filter like VSCO, ay
But it's okay, 'cause
If you down and you need a lil' help, it's a way
If you hatin' and you feelin' insecure, Issa Rae
I'm somewhere between humble and hell nah
These niggas drop their second album then fell off
My nonchalant flow will never end right
It be at they necks if it's in sight
Squeezing until they crack a windpipe
Loosen the grip, have a lil' remorse
You dial 9-1-1 I pull up in a Porsche
Word is I'm carrying the torch and I ain't wanna share
So beware if you reach you get scorched
Ever since I jumped off the porch
I knew that I would grow to be the boy
The boy then grew to be the man
Learned how to kill a hook, Peter Pan
I'm tryna make the end stand out
But I'm so fucking outstanding
I'm so fucking outlandish and a opp can't win
Man's not hot
I been on ten, landslide wins, yeahI'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha 
I'm thinking 'bout a Yamaha
To get away from all the cameras
I'm over it, don't wanna fantasize
Fate is 'round the corner, right 
It hit me right between the eyes 
It's funny when they switch and pick a side
Ain't nobody gotta go through what I'm going through, no
But it seems like they all know what I'm supposed to do so
Let's switch bodies for a day
You could me be and I could be you
Juggle the pile of shit that's bound to come through
You can have it since it's automatic
Now switch 
Tell me how it feels 
To be somebody else 
Now switch 
It wasn't what you thought it was 
Another story to tell
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
“So tell me lies, tell me lies, tell me lies
You and I ride or die, you and I
Entertain these other bitches and I will not
Entertain these other niggas, you know that
If I give you my heart, would you hold that?
Would you put it up safe or would you fold that?
If I find out you cheating me, just know that
I'ma kill you and that ho, ain't no going back”
That's what she told me, and how could I blame her?
A small town girl, now she all famous 
Maybe it's my fault now, ain't like I've been livin' in the dark nah
I told you everything from the start
And you the one that had a change of heart
Girl, you can have it after all the damage
Now switch 
Tell me how it feels 
To be somebody else 
Now switch 
It wasn't what you thought it was 
Another story to tell
Well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
Well, well, well
Well, well, well, well
Well, well
I'm thinking I should speed it up
To get away from all the media
I'm human, don't you think I had enough?
My woman claiming that I switched on her
Only 'cause I hit a switch on her
She wasn't really good at keeping upYou tell me get away
But you don’t mean that
You tell me leave you alone
But you don’t need that
On my own too
“Honey I don’t need you
Look at how I’ve grown
I'm a big girl
I can do it by myself
All on my own”
So why you wanna love me so bad?
Why you wanna love me so bad?
Haven’t you heard about my miserable past
Critical past, pitiful past?

'Cause if I could, I'd spill my blood
Down to give you my last breath
The old me is on his last stretch
I guess a new season's next 
Ooo, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Ooo, summer's calling
A beautiful summer's calling
Miscommunication leads to complication and...
Here we are staring at each other as strangers, sleepin' in the same bed
'Cause it's like, you were never taught how to use your words like that
You were never taught how to say loving things and caring things
You were just taught how to say what had to be said
So, I want the words that you don't have and I'm stuck trying to figure out what you feel
Just think about it, like, what might this life be like if we put our pride to the side and let love lead the wayNah, but, listen, I'm following my dreams, I'm chasing my, my, my, my dreams, uhm, accomplishing all my goals. I'm doing what I'm supposed to do. And that's, you know, niggas, they always gonna be there
Really hate saying sorry
Gotta be another way
I know you hurt regardless
Tryna take away the pain
I know I've done some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
Checking myself, 'cause I just can't ignore, oh, oh
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson
We over the same shit
Swinging for the fence, but somehow I can't hit
You wonder why I came here
Despite a couple kinks, don't no shame hang here
I know I've said some foolish things before
I know that I've been swerving on this course
A lot of shit that you just can't ignore, oh, oh, oh
Can find me somewhere writing when I’m wrong
Girl, I'm just tryna see if I belong
Mistakes feel like a fracture in my bones
Do all this work only to fuck it up
But I'm not down for quitting on your love
It's twisted but I just can't get enough
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, 'cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson
So I'ma write, when I'm wrong
Haven't I already shown
What it's like to love someone so much
You treat their heart like it was your own
Sitting here, patching myself up
Crying over what's left, cause
Without you I ain't shit, but no pressure
Guess I gotta learn my lesson
Rights, wrongs
I'm just tryna s–, oh
Feels like a fracture, bones, oh, ohPart I: Alone
I know that but being around, in that atmosphere and seeing how people move, you know, seeing how, how they make records, you know, what kind of record they make... I'm just like... I don't want this shit for myself and I don't ever want niggas to try to pull me into that. 'Cause I've been told a couple times like, "Hey, do this shit man, do that..." And I'm like man, I don't want, I don't want that for me man.
And if I keep tellin' y'all I don't want that shit for me and y'all keep, you know, tryna nudge and push... I understand y'all got your vision and y'all got your formula but that shit don't work for me, man. I'm not gonna conform, I'm not settling for that shit. 'Cause if I do it once and it pop, I'ma have to keep doing that shit over and over again. You can't build no fanbase like that. You...you become, you become, you become a fuckin' song instead of a person. That shit...I'm not...I'm not tryna be that man
Ummmm...migraines from overthinking
I'm tryna let go, I'm tryna let go
Let go of the past, man that shit been tryna creep up, up
Contemplatin' on if I'm really as strong as I thought, bitch I might be
Quick to pull me down but as much as I've seen, I can't fall, it's unlikely
Shit get a little twisted up
I put my troubles in the dirty then I mix it up
I’m bouta change my number
Like I haven’t switched enough
This is home
And you ain't Zone 6 enough
Gone
I’m from East Atlanta Zone
If you ain't from it
Take your ass home
I let my heart talk, keep my mental strong
Speak the whole truth 'til my money long
Half of them don't even know your name. I don't want that, I want people to know who the fuck I am. I want people to know what I stand for. I want people to be personal and know, "This is 6LACK, this is what he believe in...."
What we need to talk about
Get gone, get gone, yea yea
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong?
I got troubles, and they won't leave me alone
It seems like everybody got something to say
Everybody got a look they tryna get off of their face
Everybody got an opinion
And I don’t want one
Trying to tell me a better way to do some shit
That you ain't ever done
Sips drink in the booth
Black down to my shoes
Kick shit with my troops
Kicking shit, Ryu
You not with the shit why you
Front for those who don’t matter
When they not thinking about you
If I learned anything
It would probably be to listen more than I talk
And don’t brag about what I got
Just multiply what I brought
I never dwell on a loss
Never give a nigga sauce
He might run off with it all, he might run off with it all
He might run off with it all, he might run off with it all
Get gone get gone Yea yea
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong?
I got troubles, and they won’t leave me alone
Get gone get gone
Got the past whispering in my ear
He flaw, she flaw, what’s wrong
I got troubles, and they won’t leave me alone
Part II: EA6
Like I’m more of myself than I’ve ever been
Which is something that you really gotta come to face with sometimes
'cus, I thought I was, you know, fully myself 24/7
But nope, like right now is how I’m supposed to feel all the time
It's how I’m supposed to be all the time
It's how I’m supposed to think all the time
Now I know going out of this, I know leaving this
That will follow me
It doesn’t, you know, end with this, you know
I gotta take it and I, live with it every day
I see the people around me and
I feel so much
I wanna put it in words
Try and figure where to go with it
But I just feel so much
I know they don’t even feel as much as I feel
That’s alright
That’s alright
We have two different purposes
Clearly my purpose is some shit that’s way fucking bigger than me
Then it gets completely quiet when I'm at the beach
I know I’m one person but I kinda feel like this ripple effect is gonna impact a lot of people
I feel God talking and when he talks everything else is silent
Summer 2011
Almost lost my faith in God
Same time I never prayed so hard
Took control of my life so I wouldn’t have to take no job
Press play I couldn’t take no pause
I’m from east Atlanta 6 they don’t play that shit
In East Atlanta six you better make that lit
Or they be at your front door with that gun doe
Know them niggas Nick Cannon with the fucking drum roll
East side 'till a nigga die
Beast mode 'till a nigga cry
Sensei make a nigga fly
Shit hard but you gotta try
If I can do it, you can do it too
Time to be a better guy
I found the answer ridin' down Candler
I'm late for court 'cause traffic on Moreland
I’m trying to preach to y'all what’s important
So hard for me to ignore ignorance
I don’t know why I feel it’s my place
I know you see the pain in my face
I call the shots and move at my pace
But I understand it's all a big race
I understand you want that big face
They offer and hey
It's hard for me to say
I wouldn’t bite the bait they threw me
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play
It’s darkness in the A
A-Town stomp on the old me
Used to ride through the hood with the slow creep
People gon' love what they don't need
I remember what the OG's told me
You better shine bright when the lights down
Less talk, more show, nigga pipe down
'Cause words ain't shit but your thoughts out loud
And thoughts are the opposite of showin' nigga's how
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the A
Be cautious where you play, there's darkness in the AHope my mistakes don't make me less of a man
'Cause lately it feel like them shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
It's hard to say it, so I write a song
But that ain't equal to me righting wrongs
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on the best terms
Maybe we should love and we should learn
I don't wanna fight or be at war
With you, but you
Gotta want the same things
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no
With you, but you
Gotta want the same things
So if you ever fall
You know that I'll be there
I know how to put my ego aside, yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But know I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfairUmm-umm-ummm
Uh, you still got a lot to learn
I ain't saying I'm the best
I'm saying that I got a lot to work with ya
Fuck talking, we capped enough
I ain't trying to make it look like I just wanna fuck
I'm just trying to show this ain't no temporary love
I think you need to let me learn ya something
How you gonna get better with a nigga
Who don't even measure up
Shame, shame, shame
You’ve been fucking regulars
I think ya need to let me learn ya something, yeah
No need to tell you not to sleep
I let my hands speak
Now learn a couple things about me
Girl, when you go 
Don't try to act like your last one hit it the same way
Girl, when you go 
Don't try to act like your last one did ya the same way
Your last one did ya the same way
Your last one hit it the same way, girl 
We still got a lot to do
If you need a quick fix for your day
I be on the way
Got a couple things that I gots to prove
You lack and it hurts to know
I tell you 'cause I'm really trying to help ya
But you take it personal
I think I really need to learn you something
Yeah, I met you in the past life
I know everything
Oh, you’re that type
Bad, bad girl
Won't you act right?
I need to learn you something, yeah
Don't gotta ask
I can see
I let my hands speak
Just learn a couple things about me
Girl, when you go 
Don't try to act like your last one hit it the same way
Girl, when you go
Don't try to act like your last one did ya the same way
Your last one did ya the same way
Your last one hit it the same way, girl Hands 'round my neck
You know I got a lot left
Can't have nobody else getting away
You should get your confirmation today
Usually I don't do no flying out
But I been going through some things on the road yeah
Thinking 'bout that old thing
We still haven't even been to each other's house
But baby that could wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
Though I might fuck up your life
Take one breath, take two 
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
I shoulda copped the one way
Girl, I know you wanna stay, stay, stay
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time 
Don't feel no way 
'Less it's from foreplay 
You know you wetter than most
Brought you in on first class, that's better than most
Now usually, I don't do no flying out
But to keep it G, it's been a long week and I'm feeling lonely
We still haven't even fucked on each other's couch
Maybe that should wait for another time
I never been one to fuck up the vibe
But I will fuck up your life
Take one step, take two 
The other side of you is on the loose
Ain't got much to say
Shoulda copped the one way
And I know you wanna stay, stay, stay
You might have to catch a plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time 
Just getting off stage now 
Cause FaceTime ain't enough face time
Tell your boss you ain't working tomorrow
And ask 'em why they got my girl working so hard
Now, you gon' make me use up all my miles
Famous niggas get so lonely
And I know you gon' come and put it on me
And I can't wait to put this in your mouth
I should probably go and take care of mine-uh
Text me when you land in South Carolina
Tell the Uber she can take one left, take two
Oh, I don't really know what I'ma do when I see you
I don't really have not much to say
That's why I got the one way
That shit is expensive babe
So I had to put you on the plane for this
You gon' have to say my name for this
'Cause usually, I don't do no flying out
But something feel different this time 
Something feel different this time Ayy
Are you?
Are you tryna get back at me?
You can't let ’em win, all they really wanna do is distract me
She like, "Who you foolin'? You been out here tryna make a move, ayy"
She like, "Boy, it's a two way, groupies only followin’ what you say" 
It's a shame 'cause they all know who I am 
Overlooked, now they think they understand 
Lotta bands, that'll put 'em in a trance 
I can't let my baby slip up out my hands, damn
Yeah, if I let her go 
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's somethin' I don’t know 
It’s somethin' I don’t know 
If I let her go 
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it’s somethin' I don't know 
It's somethin' I don't know 
You know, you the main attraction 
I can't hit nobody else for the love, I need you for that action
And she like, "Who you tryin'? I ain't the only one that you been eyein'"
I'm like, "Woah, money two sides" 
She love me, she love me not, it's time to choose sides 
It's a shame, how could I be runnin' games? 
After all the trials, after everythin' 
Wedding ring, I can change your last name 
But I can't let 'em get my baby outta pain, ayy
Yeah, if I let her go 
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's somethin' I don't know 
It's somethin' I don't know 
If I let her go 
Will I regret it? Will I forget it?
Well, it's somethin' I don't know 
It's somethin' I don't know 
Let her, let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go, let her go
Yeah, yeah, go
People look at me like I'm crazy
I just think dick is a distraction, you know, like
Niggas ain't shit, and bitches ain't shit either
Me personally, I just, I can't afford distraction
Uhm, so, that's what I feel like niggas areMy fault, no
I got women calling my phone like I owe them somethin'
It's kinda my fault, I guess I showed them somethin'
No shit, I treat my dick like it's a loaded gun
Point that shit away, these hoes gon' blow what comes
No disrespect when I say, if you love me better fuck me
Like you 'bout to lose your place to the girl next door
And hell no, I don't want her, I'm just giving you incentive
Inspiration before I go on these sold out tours
Got this pretty brown-brown, watch her go wild
Found her confidence, so she a pro now
Your man a clone, quick, come down to zone 6
Treat you to hot wings like it's some fancy shit
Hot lemon pepper whip, that mean it's wet as shit
Don't question what I earn, I put that on my wrist 
Wait until a nigga get home, listen, nigga got the shit on
But I'm going for they spouses
I can pull 'em with the flip phone 
Time, all I’m ever asking for is time
I just needed time to clear my mind
What I want is already mine
Needed a little time
All I’m ever asking for is time
I just needed time to clear my mind
What I want is already mine
I got people I don't know expecting something from me
Could let it throw me off but, man, it's nothin' to me
"More money, more problems," that ain't no lie, I swear
Say I'ma take a break, but that's the only lie I tell
We made it past ten-thousand hours, lot of power
Now I'm fully loaded, fresh off Moreland Ave
Now I'm in my bag, ain't no cap
Eastside on my back, daughter on my back
She a Kirkwood baby, puttin' in work little baby, uh
This is a message for y'all 
Making my way through the fall 
Loaded, we came for it all 
You only came here to ball 
Don't shit happen by chance over here
I pray to God and then I conquer my fears
Since then I done took care of my fam'
Took care of myself, took care of my health
And that ain't no 360, that's a 180
I got one baby, that's one lady I'ma answer to
She be the reason I'm righting my wrongs and shit
Love is the reason I'm writing these songs and shit
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeahYou think I don't know when to call it quits
How could I not know after all this here?
I spent so much time tryna find a signal but
It’s safe to say it's no good
A nigga need to roll up
No, I don't wanna piss you off
No, I ain’t tryna make you yell
Girl, why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
No, I don't wanna piss you off
I ain't tryna make you yell
Now why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect 
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect, hey
Love is not looking over shoulders
Love is you should trust what I told you
Lately it's like you been speaking fantasy and I'm speaking reality
'Cause we got problems we ain’t getting over
I think we breaking up
And not just on some boyfriend-girlfriend shit
I think we had enough
Like, I can’t hear you
I'm falling out of love
I’m tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect
I'm tryna work it out
But we got a disconnect, hey
Love is not struggling to tell you "I love you"
Or you saying music's above you
I do this shit here 'cause I need
I need you, but you couldn’t see, so
I'm out here, listening to Monster
Heartbreak sponsor, smoking on the ganja, yeah
No, I don't have no time left to care, spare, or share
You done made Cupid aim away
A bow and arrow could take the pain away
You done made Cupid aim away
A bow and arrow could take the pain away
But I don't wanna piss you off
I ain't tryna make you yell
Girl, why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
Girl, I don't wanna piss you off
No, I ain't tryna make you yell
Why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
I'm tryna work it out
Niggas be so motherfucking quick to talk about, "Oh, I want a bitch that's loyal, I want a bitch that's loyal."
And it's like, damn, nigga, what the fuck you think these bitches want from y'all niggas, period? The fuck?
Y'all be the first ones to talk about loyalty, but be the first ones to fold on a bitch in a motherfucking hot second
Like, damn, nigga, you can't hold it down for two seconds? Hold your dick down, nigga
I'm holding my pussy down, I'm keeping my pussy to myself - keep your dick to yourself, nigga. That's mine! The fuck? I don't like to share, period!I'ma write you my best song
It’s gon' take me all night long

I ain't never need no help
I will love you when you're old
And you lose the words you spoke
Time will never wait on us
But it never can age our love
Aw, yeah
Say you'll always be my greatest fan
Sing your favorite words just like a band
Only if you'll love me like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man

Baby, I'ma love you like a stan, stan, stan, aw, man
All that I
All that I wanna do
Is put it on, put it on, put it on, put it on the line
Hoping we go out at the same time
'Cause life without my love is a slant rhyme
That mean it works out but it ain't quite

Seems like I was always behind you
I ain't worried 'bout no Alzheimer's
No, I don't need no fuckin' reminder
Aw, yeah

Sing your favorite words just like a band

I say it humbly, but they don't wear the crown like me
It's all in your eyes, locked, loaded, we were rolling
You make the whole room feel slow-motion

Closed off, tryna get a little open

Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin
I know I more than fucked up
Now I feel stupid
Why would I do this
She ain't know no better but I did
Poor decision making for the kid
And all because you left us for a second
Now I’m tryna figure out the lesson
Of all the people I fucked up on you
What the fuck was I supposed to do
This shit is sticky
Its tricky
And kinda hard to explain
Wanna refrain but being human is strange
Apologizing in advance for the pain
Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin
I know I more than fucked up
Now I feel stupid
Why would I do this
Trying to tell you what it is
She came to the crib
Whispered in my ear some shit I wanna hear
Then told me y'all ain't cool
Were finished, y'all were through
So then I took her word, ain't run that shit by you
I made myself believe everything was okay
Meanwhile she at your house
She smiling in your face
She smiling in your face
But you don’t even know
So I can’t even say
Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin

Your friend was prayin
On our downfall baby
Swear she was waitin
I know I more than fucked up
Now I feel stupid
Why would I do thisStop trippin' over me, yeah
Gave each other something to believe, yeah
Instead of sellin' me a dream, yeah
Just tell me what I need, yeah
Friends claim they wanting what we got
But little do they know, it ain't sweeter
Forgetting all the friction when we high
A little smoke will make you a believer
I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm livin' in-between
Already tried to leave
Ask me for space
I told you "no"
You said to leave
I said "fine, I'll just go"
You told me "wait, why would you leave?"
You used to fight for me
And I just wanted all your attention
Already got me sayin'
Baby, I got no patience
Give me one conversation
I can be soft, you can behave
Already got me sayin'
Baby, I got no patience
Give me one conversation
I can be soft, you can behave
I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm livin' in-between
Already tried to leave
And I've always tried to say
That every something fades
I'm living in-between
Already tried to leave

No picking up, it's time to finish
Think you wanna be replenished
You hanging on to every sentence
Yeah, you was all good
Until you misunderstood, yeah
Make that ass float
Oh, yeah, oh, yeahThank God for the weekend
I'ma go out with my friends, I'd rather let the liquor sink in
Than the thoughts of you that I should not be thinking
When I'm with someone else, it's feeling like I’m cheating
I just might go off the deep end
When I’ve had too much, can’t shut me up, now when you start to creep in
Know that everyone is sick of all my reasons, I-
I let you come and go like seasons
First I blame you, then I want you
Fucking hate you, then I love you
I can't help myself, no
When I have you, wanna leave you
If you go, that's when I need you
I can't help myself, no
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, yeah
I keep on going through the motions
But we ended long ago, I should be numb to these emotions
But you flood my memory just like an ocean, and
And I was drowning in devotion
First I blame you, then I want you
Fucking hate you, then I love you
I can't help myself, no
When I have you, wanna leave you
If you go, that's when I need you
I can't help myself, no
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour every day, day, day
You come in waves, yeah 
I come with ups and downs, yeah, I know
If you tryna ride, ride slow
Deep breath for the tide
Hold tight for the stride, I can see it in your eyes
I come with monsoons
Made love on the full moon, yeah
Wave like water, not a trend
If we start it up then this'll be the end 
First I love you, then I hate you
I won't dare try to replace you
I ain't crazy, no 
I'm ecstatic, then I'm sad
On a high then I crashed
'Cause you made me so 
You come in waves, waves, waves 
Every hour, every day, day, day
I hate so bad that you come in waves
You come in waves, waves, waves
You come in waves, you come in waves
Every hour, every day, day, day 
You do, you do, you come in waves
You come in waves, yeah, yeah, oh
You do, you do, you come in wavesAre you who I be in this weekend
If so, let's get lost in the deep end
Exhale my name, then you absorb my soul every time that you breathe in
Take off that dress, lay your heart on my chest
I think I wanna keep it
You fall asleep, no worries, I be right here when you finish dreaming
I see something in you, I know that it's crazy 'cause girl I just met you
But we joining forces 'cause that would be gorgeous
No girl, I won't let up
I just rolled the dice so no more thinkin' twice
Destiny she won't fail us
If you feel what I feel can you just keep it real
Baby, it ain't no pressure
No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart
I know you looking for real love
I got my hand on my Glock, posted on the block
I might just let off a shot, at anyone tryin' to kill love
If we do this right, we'll be Bonnie and Clyde for the rest of our lives
Hit up a bank, then hide out in the woods for the rest of the night
Make love on the cash that we took from the vault just a while ago
Said you can't describe this new feeling, you feeling, well I'll move slow
I saw something in you that you didn't see, I made you a believer
I taught you the rules, now you good at the game
Baby, I was your teacher
Yeah, you made me fall like the Autumn, but chin up 'cause I'll never leave ya
I no longer front, girl, you're more than a want
Now I know that I need ya
No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart
I know you looking for real love

No need to state the obvi', I be close to your heart

I know I said I'm psychic, but tell me what's on your mind
If there ever was another, I'd tell you before you find
Out and start crying, saying how I'm such a savage, and
How you can't manage, and how we could've had it, I
Know I'm gonna be fine, that's the way this shit goes
Really hope you find your relationship goals

Imagine if I never went through what I went through
Yeah
Came, up, uh
Ayy, I want more
Until I get it, I won't slow
I'm on tour
Opening some brand new doors
On top, but we came from the floor
Do you believe in foresight?
Look, I wrote this in a hotel the size of a closet
Just to show you that I could do it
Just to show you that it ain't much to it
If you got your hand out, don't be surprised when I look at you stupid
Where were you when it was me and the music?
Don't compare me to no nigga that I'm better than
Still new, but my attitude veteran
And ain't nothing wrong with it
Since six I knew I was gon' get it
I ain't working 'til my palms start itchin'
Ever since a nigga put a gun to my face
That shit do really make you think, yeah
I was thinking 'bout my kid, yeah
Sixteen, didn't even have a kid, yeah
Them bullets really have you thinking about your unborn
Imagine if my whole life was untorn
Imagine when that car flip
Don’t call it defeating odds it's-
A blessing that I ain't gone yet
I've been getting closer to God 
Not a scripture, we been talking direct 
Send for me and I send you closer to God 
Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm on pace
I figured out this shit ain't a race
Up the stakes
Got hungry, then I scrape the plate
It ain't hard for me to change my ways
Do you believe in foresight?
Look, the playing field ain't never been even
I ain't 'bout to make that shit either
See em' tryna copy my aura, they some readers
Study all you want, but I came up out that freezer
Getting bread across the Mediterranean like a pita
You a heat seeker, speak up
Niggas telling me to speed up
You can fit your talent in a B cup
Leaders of the new school, I think they need us
But first, let me light my weed up
My intuition ain't never led me astray
With all this shit on my plate
You'd think I'd be running in place
But I step to that mirror, look myself in the face
Can nobody take my place, said they got me then they flake
You can try, you can test, you get sent to the gods
I'm a R&B nigga with a hip-hop core
Haha, said I'm a R&B nigga with a hip-hop core, yeah
We just had to do that, if I don't rap anywhere on this, people are gon' hate meHope my mistakes don't make me less of a man
'Cause lately, it feel like them shits really can
I'm prayin' I don't wake up all alone
It's hard to say it, so I write a song
But that ain't equal to me righting wrongs
I'm stuck between a rock and a hard place
And I might have to figure this out the hard way
We may not end on the best terms
But maybe we should love and we should learn
I don't wanna fight or be at war with you
But you gotta want the same things
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no, with you
But you gotta want the same things
So if you ever fall
You know that I'll be there
I know how to put my ego aside, yeah
Correct me if I'm wrong
You said you never wanna share
But now I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfair, yeah
I know it's unfair, yeah
Do I got blessings or karma in my future?
Broke her heart, now that bitch listen to Future
At one point, I could say she was my shooter
Lately, I'm the one that's doing the shooting
Ruger fire the tooly, wasn't tryna use it
I told her I love her, she told me prove it
Summer 2011, it's like I looped it
Now I see her in you and that ain't even you
It's so stupid
I don't wanna fight or be at war 
With you , but you 
Gotta want the same things 
I don't wanna fight or be at war, no, no, with you
But you gotta want the same things 
So if you ever fall 
You know that I'll be there

You said you never wanna share 
But now I'm stuck between
What I love and who I love and
I know it's unfair

When it's good, it's good, but the question is
Are you down to fuck with the other side? 
Lately, I been bumping trap music
Don't wanna listen if I can’t dab to it 
'Cause all that other shit makes me think about
All the things I don't wanna think about
But I'm a hypocrite, 'cause here I am with another slow song
I'm a hypocrite, singing, like a nigga doing no wrong

Why you gotta ask, won’t you just take it?
You want someone that won't fake it, want someone that's down to get you naked
I know I'm a problem, I know that I'm something you should ponder

You using sex to try to distract
Me from the fact you don't deserve to be where you at
It's sad to say I had to leave my girl back home
She tripping, I don't think that I could love her no more
She popping up at parties tryna look the other way
Girl you can't ignore me if your friends say "Hey"

'Cause honestly 
It's not you, it's me 
I'm the only one I need 
I'm sure someone's gonna love you, not me
And love all the things that you do
Took a minute but it hit me finally
That I'm not the person for you
And I wanna lay under the stars
And hear the ocean while I'm talking bullshit
High with the people that are real
Don't make me feel like an idiot
It's not you, it's me 
I'm the only one I need 
It's not you, baby

Wanna talk? Better run your funds up
I’m from the five, middle finger like I'm Nudy
It's mister turn-the-Tabernacle-to-a-movie
Ooh-wee, keep it movin', nothin' to see
I grew up eatin' hot wings and bumpin' Gucci
On the block, ain't have no OG to school me
We just yellin’, "Wassup" like Skooly
We hit the mall and we ball all day
I really know a drought, so it’s blue hundreds in the safe
My nigga ain't a J, but he be runnin’ with that K
And you might take a L just for runnin' out your face

My life is VVS, I practice clarity
I practice what I preach, I'm livin’ what I teach

Clearly got me fucked up
Takin' out the trash on yo' ass
I get rid of bad friends like a dump truck
Everything I been through is everything I am

Six o' clock, time for Greg Street to rock
Hmm, mmm, yeah, okay
I used to walk around that corner, right in Kirkwood
Ann's Snack Bar where the food real good

Smack that ass three times fuck sheeping
And we take intermission
And we have interventions
And she ask questions like
"What if all the seeds went missing from their mom and pops And they listened to the wind
And lambs that called them around the clock
And left home with their box of rocks
And met up on their sacred plot"
Wedged between your highest self and everything you got
I pledge to be my highest self with everything I'm not
Anymore of you to give to me before I go to sleep
Fuck you right away and tuck you right away
Hopefully
Same thing in the morning
Got the pussy on repeat
Let me know something right quick I could see you
With the fat blunt and some thot juice, Lime-a-rita
You ain't really that bougie
That's why I'm choosing
Them freckles on your booty
I too have came to a conclusion
And 9 o'clock I be all alone
You can ride my pony show
Gon' bring a trophy home
Call the line ring ring

Speakin' 'bout me and you
Since they got me off the porch, I been beaten black and blue
Story of my life, tell me something about you
Where you from? Did you stay or did you run?
You ever thought about a daughter or a son? No?
You lookin' for a Jason Lyric or a Love Jones?
I know you probably sick of love songs, but
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down 'em if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love
I still remember when we used to all pretend
Afraid to be in love, afraid to just be friends
I still remember when you used to call me up
Was broken-hearted, young, that nigga dogged you, huh?
Baby, don't hold no grudge, you know I hold you down
And if they ever try, I got a hundred rounds
Until the day we die, and then we in the sky
Forever loyal in the moment or immortal
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down 'em if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your love
She my forever thing, baby, you more than great
I never say a word, it's First 48
Look I remember when we started poppin', yeah
You stole my eye, I stole your heart down at the county fair
Now if worst come to worst, I left a note in your purse
Remember me from this verse, I'm turnin' myself in
I can't pretend we both goin' down the road
I need you to have my seed, set the legacy in stone
I'd do life for your love
I would probably swing a knife for your love
Go against everything right for your love
And I would probably man down 'em if they ever tried to stifle your love
Cross the line, I just might for your loveSay you wanna roll, huh

Tell her you love her when next week you just want your space
Why you do, why you do that?
Tell her you want her but next week you do your own thing
Why you do, why you do that?
I can't explain it but just know it working for me
She text me "I hate you, I hate you, I hate you, I hate you"
But how the fuck can you hate me?
When I ain't did shit, but be the real thang
She know I'm the real, that'll never change

Allow me to state that I am Jace
A nigga real
You can recognize it or despise it, but..

Serve her like a customer, I'm 21 bustin', no
Ain't too many flexin' like this, get your muscle up
Pull up at The Twelve, hop out it's a bunch of us
Just in case little mama really think I'm stuntin' her
Girls on your line all the time when you coming up

It's a blunt, lit shit, what you gon' do?
Tell your girl to roll through, ask if they can roll too

You've been the realest and you didn't even notice sometimes I feel like ya 
Don't give yourself all the credit, you deserve the world and I might just 
Wrap it up, sit it right inside your hands, say damn, its just like dust 
I never doubt ya  ooooo
I know too much about ya 
Its approaching the hour 
Hope you remember your powers 
Once you move onto your next stage it'll be unlocked girl 
And everything that you thought you couldn't do, you'll try girl 
And you'll be able to shape things how you see them in your eye 
And now you're sitting up high in the ocean looking down at the sky 
Need some assistance I'm your guardian forgot to mention I'll be at the door yeah, 
But every fall I'll be there to break them all you don't have to meet the floor yeah
Once you arise, you gon' blind them with the light, baby you put on the show yeah 
They all the same we've been waiting for the change I know you can crack the code yeah 
Love me or leave, don't leave me in limbo
I'm a bit in DC cuz' my feelings change with the seasons
I still crackle the leaves, I float away with the breeze
Seen the heaven in from the high end in sight of an eagle
Its kinda left left and I ride for the people, I rifle the people
Put my life in the line, and I'll die when it's time
A thousand beyond, the earth agrees with mostly everything that I demand
I set myself as down and I know that its kinda new to you 
The false and true is up to you but lie that in the manual, um
I was trembling with my demons, caught in between lawyers and schemes
Weight of the world heavy, I can't handle it, um
I just let that wick burn till the candle was done
Heart banging on my chest, don't bang with a drum, um
If I'm sick as I need that thermometer
As I try and kill, I'ma save my Andromeda, save my Andromeda
Need some assistance I'm your guardian forgot to mention I'll be at the door yeah, 
But every fall I'll be there to break them all you don't have to meet the floor yeah
Once you arise, you gon' blind them with the light, baby you put on the show yeah 
They all the same we've been waiting for the change I know you can crack the code yeah Overlook me, underrate me
Probably hate me
Really you should thank me
Get up every time I fall on my face
Like I was plankin’
Tell me what they thinkin’
Don’t want the accolade
This is the 6LACK parade
Smart people follow after me
Is that why y’all attackin’ me?
I want the love child
I am the love child
Do you want the love child?
Here comes the love child
It’s crazy ‘cause even when they aim with hate
I deflect it and aim away
Had the chance to change ya fate
But I change my ways
You know, you niggas can’t relate
So I wanna know
Where is the love child?
White man said I’d never be loved, child
That I was here to go to jail and be a thug child
Run a, run a hood ’til I catch a slug child
She was from the motherfuckin’ corner
Ain’t she sweet magnolia
Niggas pack heat like furnaces
The bitch got flipped like pancakes
Bitches hate on ya when ya menstruate
She want posta’
‘member what she composed of
She is the love child
Was she the love child?
No you’re the love child
For sure you the love child
We came up from the dirt
The depths of the Earth
The blessed and the cursed
Where less is the mores
Where niggas the most
We lost what we most
So self remorsed
And I am a love child
So you ain’t finna see no fear in my eyes
Sent from above child
‘Cause we never feel no fear in this side
Peaceful but still keep a piece
I pray when I’m hoping to see
I know that it glows around me
I’m not what they hoped I would be
Eat, pray, slay, say, show, go give love everyday
Make your way, make wave
Love child, love hurts, love pain
Love fiend, love slave, love me and you gay
Lovingly the normal way
Smack my face and walk away, damn
Uh, I thought this was love child
Playing little games acting like a little child
We break up and you saying I’m a scrub now
Wow damn, pow scram, loud downstairs
And it’s looking like y’all want the bear
I’m hoping there’s more dope in here than you showed me
I’m hoping you don’t show me
But meanwhile, right now I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
I could be
I could be
I could be your love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child
It always feel right when it go right through
You the only one I get a whole night to
You could see the passion in the way I move
Same shit different clearance, deja vu
From the Earth with a curse with the seance crew
I flow through the sky with a radar too
Got will too strong to let J.R. shoot
I’ve been living in the middle with the chaos too
Blunts power, gun powder, run miles just to get away to the moon
Sun’s power, lungs dying just to inflate from the doom, gravitate to you
Nightmares to dreams, whispers to screams, dark nights I’ve seen brighten some things
By any means, God bless the Queen, God bless the King, the love child is me
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child, love child, love child, love child, love
Love child
Love child
Love child
Love child
A tip from the child
A drift from you now
Come plummet on down
Slowly coat my tongue
To where you run from
Can’t escape the shadows
Afraid to become
Afraid to be loved
How could I be loved?
Why should I be loved?
My mouth always full with my foot with my love
‘Cause I ain’t ever really satisfied
And I don’t really want but everything
Put out could see the side of mine
And that’s a recipe for my demise
‘Cause I never had a missing piece
Swear I never ever really need a thing
But that is the love child
Showers the tears
To baptize my peers
Now bring me the mud child
No can’t stop the rain
No can’t stop the pain this sent from above
You’ve got to have love
You’ve got to have love child
But lust is the flood
The trust is the words swept under the rug
Until we are loved
Until we all learnNever kiss and tell 'bout you
Never say the things you do
She said, "Can she keep it?"
My love is the deepest
Take some time to decompress
Hop on top, relieve some stress
Ride until the wheels fall off
Show them hoes that you the best
Take advantage of me, I'm never in town, yeah
I need every minute and second, I count yeah
You look fine as hell when you're touchin' your crown, yеah
Make you lose your mind, it'll nevеr be found, yeah
Ah, yay, what we do? We never drive safe
Paintings I'm creatin' on your face
I want peace but she come from 'round the way
 Yeah, yeah, yeah
Never kiss and tell 'bout you 
Never say the things you do 
She said, "Can she keep it?" 
My love is the deepest 
Take some time to decompress 
Hop on top, relieve some stress
Ride until the wheels fall off
Show them hoes that you the best
Knockin' on your door, promise I just pulled up for conversation
If we take it further, that's a bonus
I be outta space, you keep me grounded, I appreciate it
I just hope you never leave me hopeless
People talkin' gossip, slander, tryna hurt your reputation
What they say don't matter, they don't know us
What we have is special, fuck whoever say whatever
See forever in each other when we focus
Never kiss and tell 'bout you 
Never say the things you do 
She said, "Can she keep it?" 
My love is the deepest 
Take some time to decompress 
Hop on top, relieve some stress
Ride until the wheels fall off
Show them hoes that you the best
Needed a break for a breather, needed a break just bleed this
Nothin' is easy, I run the map just like GTA, lookin' for pieces
You overthinkin' it, I'm over everything, we in a state where it look like that everyday
We should not live this way, ayy
Girl, lay down
Come while you can, I'm reachin' out, lay your head
Lay your head down, bring your waist down, close to me
This how it s'posed to be, I think my soul agree
She make my soul eclipse
Never kiss and tell 'bout you
Never say the things you do
She said, "Can she keep it?"
My love is the deepest
Take some time to decompress
I won't talk, relieve some stress
Ride until the wheels fall off
Show them hoes that you the bestWelcome to the 2017 BET Hip-Hop Awards Cypher
I go by the name of 6LACK and I came with  Little Simz, Mysonne, Axel Leone and the homie Tee Grizzley
Yo, DJ Premier, let's get it
Hey, posed at the north side of that London
Where fed there's always a pagan teeth
Look quiet, don't trust 'em
Where if you walk around with a chip on your shoulders
Tryna get lemon, couldn't get battered
You know it, where I come from
73 will get me from home to college and back
Winter will make me go from my home to college and back
Why? Ain't tryna be out in the cold like that
Boujee still, when this city grow like that?
Cute in hills, then a trackie for the road like that
All details, yeah, I can do both like that
I push my own set of wheels on the road like that
Shit, I'm actually a G, my friends, you know like that
Trust me, I'ma free up, I'm been moving and weaving
Now the gate in my ways, through the system, I seen museum
Everyone's got a purpose, everybody's a being
Being the only alien, y'all around me, I'm seeing
More than you can imagine, who'd of thought this would happen?
Teachers looked at me funny when I said I'd make it from rapping
Still got love for Miss Rosen, still got love for Miss Wilton
I don't fuck with Miss Chambers, she didn't do me no favours
Calling out all the agents, can't see beyond they nose
I kill shit then I kill shit, when shit's killed, I'm ghost
Don't wanna talk depressed, get them cameras out my face
I'm anti-social as fuck, lord, just need a smaller space, space
Yo, I wanted them to say something for having but I'm pissed off
That I ain't take it serious then, and it took me this long
I pissed on everything I ain't doing number two long
What is you on? I'm heroine, I traveled here in a brick form
They turned on me, all ego, man
I had to start again from scratch like Preemo hands
Did more, Halle Berry in a Coogi, I'm a big storm
I rip y'all, you wack, off rip but it rip off
I almost quit sniff, quarter drip then I gripped on
We lit mom, I'm at the awards without a hit song
Think I said "kill it on BET"
Like don't be human, be an alien, be E.T
EBT? That's a TBT
Turn BET to Boriqua y TTV, juice
Leon, rappers don't got enough fire to show me
Young Jugo, y'all could call me five fire emojis
Put rappers in a pot, come and check if it's boiling
You put him feet first and push him 'til his neck in and boil it
Thirst 'til everything in your saving and checking is voided
Couldn't stone but he collect unemployment
Heard him almost threw up, sewer, doo doo like he grew up next to the toilet
I don't even put in effort, I spoil it
For everybody trying Leon on line they can't effin' avoid it
I ain't stop, already effin' destroyed it
We run rap from the jump, I'm KRS One to Capital Pun
That's when I promised Pun I would bring rap back to the Bronx
We catch him, let him go, put him back in the trunk
After the pump blast to the lung, they task in the trunk, mhm
Wrist said I'm big with it like a half a key
My neck chilly like I've never been to Applebee's
I'm the best, no offense to anyone that back with me
Bruh, they set you up before they put you after me, Jugo
Welcome to reality
I'm a fake rapper's rivalry, the leader of the cavalry
Young Huey P. with Big Meech mentality
The rap Kapernick with 2Pac's anatomy
I got 'em mad at me
'Cause I freed kids from the trap and put morals over salary
But they would rather me lie the way they lied to me
Have them in these streets dying, becoming casualties
But nah, I'm a whole different breed
Everybody following, I was sent to lead
I'm a soldier, when I bleed, I just lick the wound
No, you not a G, you got it misconstrued
You all on IG, lying to get views
You got these little kids dying, trying to listen to you
Or they sitting in prison instead of sitting in school
Because you told them play the game, didn't give them the rules
Won't you tell them to fix their plan just to lose
To all my young kings: don't ever listen to fools
Nah, I'm not hatin', just a little confused
How show 'em all the diamonds, never give 'em no jewels?
And if you're tired of the buffoonery
Follow me, I'll show you how to shine without jewelry
Show you how to grind and bought back to community
Bring black on black crime, back to black unity
If you a G, I know you see you and me
Gangster, but wow, ain't nothin' nigga can do with me
One man army, imagine if it was two of me
I swear next year Oprah gon' try to cougar me, huh
'Cause I did it on my own
I'm putting work, now I'm sitting on his throne
Crown me the same way that you do any king
I rather nail for something than just stand for anything
At the cypher, I ain't write this, let it come from head
One rule amongst my gang, let's keep one in the head
They hatin' but they ain't gonna touch one of my dreads
After I gun at your head, boy I'm 'gon come for your mans
I'm from Detroit, where we run up through bandz
Cut up them grams and go dumb with them scams
You owe me some money, better run my bread
When mark jump out with that pump, you can't run it's sprayin'
They throw their beef over the gram, they feds
Can't even speak about my beef, they dead
Only time rappers start to act like my friend
Is when they in my city looking for protection, they scared
I can't eat without my dawgs, they fed
I can't really tell if they opps or they fans
I think that prison did somethin' to my head
I was locked up with somethin' this long strapped to my leg
I heard the trenches got a hero, it's about time
Hundred on my neck, I came a long way from Compton
Fifty on my wrist, I came a long way from child time
If I stacked up hundreds, it would stand about 5'9"
Ballin' on these boys like I'm Bron-Bron
Dunked that green side and that white side, Hassan
Everywhere I go I'm strapped down like I rock climb
I would keep goin' but I ain't got time, hah
Around the time when Lil Wayne was on every hook
I was on my worm-tip, I was in every book
And T-Pain was killin' every remix he could smell
Them my homie did some shit and had to sit in the cell
So I focused on my music, chose my sentences well
Now my sentences sell, I don't censor them well
Connected to a higher power like I sit in a cell
Tower, this ain't rappin' while I'm splitting a cell
Okay, all my favourite rappers are washed up
And write the same song ten times, leave me star-struck
My president on crack, my exes is black like my name is
I ain't even 'posed to be famous
I heard 'em saying "Who they sayin', who be they?"
But they ain't never put the work in
Internet surfing, Instagram lurking, been waitin' on this moment since Tigger was in the basement
106 was poppin', Free looked amazing
Damn, that boy got a flow of a hunnid guns
She say "Baby, you a savage," I say "21, 21"
When I finish this verse, download my album
Take a chance on a rapper, you don't want no problems
Watched enough cyphers to know I need a gun bar
Somethin' 'bout an AR and how that thing is dumb tall
I'ma take it, I'ma swing it like a pendulum, dog
And your toupée ain't safe, so you better run, dog
It's a DMX flow, it's a we up next flow
They can't really handle bars, it's a BMX flow
I'm skippin' through this thing like I'm Snoop, what it do?
Atlanta got a star, boy, I'm the proof
Hip-hopped over the beat, hopscotched over the street
Top-notch, mispronounce my name and get pop-rocked
I come from the east, we hustle for a ten piece and split it with the game
It's FREE 6LACK and I'll be here until you know the nameDo better, who better? You better?
Been around, like hella propellers
Wanna know who you with, don't tell 'em
Come on, fellas, that ain't none of your biz'
Got on your bodysuit, you know I'm on your ass today
Would you let me hit it thrice if I asked today?
She know my stick nothing but magic, babe
I be swinging it back and forth, 'til you in your casket, bae, mm
Girl, you want my best side, mm
Bet she from the west side, mm, mm
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you won't
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Okay, say it loud, say it proud, you want it more
We open door, hit the couch, then the floor
I cut it up, like a scissor, love galore
She never bored, there's so much shit we can do
You free to say whatever, baby, if you askin' me
No limit when I'm in it, got a Master P
I'm hoping I don't have a fast release
Got me focused like I'm out here tryna get my master's see, mm
Throwin' up the peace sign, mm
Girl, I'm from the east side, mmm, mmm
Girl, you on my best side, mm
Say she from the west side, mm, mm
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you won't
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Now, I just wanna know
Don't you sugarcoat
I'll say it all if you won't
Now, could you tell me like it is?
Pretty little fears
Music to my ears
Summer came, and it left, but love stayed, and it’s stuck
And now, I carry my weight like a truck
I don’t make music for critics to critique
But because the people need
They need me to lead the way, and so I speak
It's 6LACK, pronounced blacker than my skin
Ever since I was a boy, the world told me I should never, ever cry
And If I was to ever shed a tear, out of fear, show emotions
I could kiss my credibility goodbye
We were taught to be strong, not knowing the only way to be that
Was to feel like it was safe to open up
Now, women suffer from this gap that we created everyday
I’ma learn, and I just wanna say it's tough
This here is a PSA for every young black man watching
I am not here to talk about my album dropping
Conditioning and influence exist for a reason
But it's all bound to change like the seasons, seasons, yeah
You got pretty little fears, I got pretty little fears too
I’m just hoping I could share
With you
You got pretty little fears, I got pretty little fears too
I’m just hoping I could share
With youLyrics from Snippet
Money callin', we all in
I don't do fake shit, that's borin'
It's all been in God's plan
I don't do lame shit, that's borin'
It was all love, wasn't always that way
Face card on "Welcome back"
Face card on "How you been?"
Face card on "Everybody gotta pay, except for you"
I need like 21 cards, she ask, okay it's the crew
I need security and shit
I make investments to live
I need that ice on my wrist
But I just might, lil' bitch
I need security and shit
I make investments to live
I need that ice on my wrist
But I just might, lil' bitch
Just might, lil' bitch
This life I live
Runnin' late to the lab
Be there 'bout 6
Still plans, move slow
Just like my flow
Got a verse from 2 Chainz but ain't bought one
But just might, lil' ho
It was all love, wasn't always that way
Face card on "Welcome back"
Face card on "How you been?"
Face card on "Everybody gotta pay, except for you"
I push a button and move, she ask, I'm like it's a ruleYou just wanna sex and party all these bitches up
But, baby, I done had enough
Ain't care for diamonds or the club, just wanted all your love
See, the more I piece up stories, ain't no addin' up
Guess you fooled me, thought you wouldn't be on cruel shit
Had to check myself for puttin' up with bullshit
Had to finally keep it Q and keep it pushing
Had to drop you now you see me on that new shit
And my new nigga, he got big racks
Big dick, big bag, uh-huh, big stacks, peep that, like, yeah
I can't be stressin' on no old hoes, no-no
I might just flex up on my ex and let it go-go, go-go
I let you act up, get your shit together
I let you rock, had me convinced that you ain't know no better
Using trauma as excuses for your lack of effort
Would give advice on mental health like you're the fuckin' expert
But you might need one, shit, if you see one
Fill me in on tips, an explanation, what's the reason?
On causing bruising to my heart, you left me bleeding
You kicked me down while being down, you barely left me breathing
My new nigga, he got big racks
Big dick, big bag, uh-huh, big stacks, peep that, like, yeah
I can't be stressin' on no old hoes, no-no
I might just flex up on my ex and let it go-go, go-go
I might just pull up just to stunt on you 
'Cause you deserve it
I might just pull up just to front on you
But you ain't worth it
Outta everything on my list of things that's worth it 
I did not find you 
You must think I'm blind, no, I didn't see what you pulled
You gotta be lyin' if you think I'll put up with more
Know she want that big dick energy, don't belong to industry
That shit what is it could be, like it like a simile
Hit me on the flip, this ain't bounce back dick
This shit real, long term, we take real long time
Okay, now, big racks, big stacks, big— what's that?
How to make her climax, one thing 6 don't lack
Like it from the back 'cause I need someone I could lean in
I held her down while she went down, I left her barely breathin' 
My new nigga, he got big racks 
Big dick, big bag, uh-huh , big stacks, peep that, like, yeah 
I can't be stressin' on no old hoes, no-no
I might just flex up on my ex and let it go-go, go-go
I might just pull up just to stunt on you
'Cause you deserve it
I might just pull up just to front on you
But you ain't worth it
I might just pull up just to stunt on you 
'Cause you deserve it 
I might just pull up just to front on you 
But you ain't worth itDub

Fuck her face off, fuck the day, night, it was way off, it was way right

And I know that she know I can hear what she saying, she staring and layin' and layin' to wrestle me

Spread yo' ass and nothing else gets between us

She say "you're lying", I say "dang, baby, "
Try not to let the condom slip 'cause that's too raw
And I'm not tryna move you 'cross the country with that U-Haul
With all that shit that you areIn July 2011, I signed to an independent record label owned by a popular artist at the time. The deal came with an advance that was little to nothing but at the time it was my only way out and the artist who I was signed to was very popular so I took the chance. After spending a year in college chasing love and studying shit I could care less about I finally had the opportunity to do what I loved so I seized it. I didn’t even withdraw from VSU, I just dropped everything and left. Initially it wasn’t that bad, but it never is in the beginning. In the years to follow I found myself at my absolute lowest. After the little advance money ran out I was unable to eat most nights, had no stable place to stay, and found myself living out of a ripped up backpack. They had me making hundreds of songs I hated to meet their criteria of what they viewed as “hit records”. All I ever heard in that place was hit record hit record hit record hit record. I watched so many people go in and out of that studio, they always used to tell me that I was special, that I was next up. All I felt was jailed. Instead of doing their whole two-step and dancing in the shackles they set out for me, I chose to sit in that cage and not release any of the music they forced me to make. They wanted me to just be a hit song and I wanted to show them I was more than that.
For the next three years I had to make moves in secrecy. I put music out on my Soundcloud even though my contract didn’t allow me to release any music on my own. With the few songs I put out I grew enough of a following and established my brand. When the label found out I thought they would start taking me seriously but they didn’t and that’s when I knew I had to get the fuck out of there. I needed to work with people who understood my vision and would get behind it. People who understood what was going on in popular culture and not just popular radio. I eventually found that team in LVRN. I remember sitting down for our first meeting, thinking about how much I was over the industry and hated the people in it, but I listened and all of my doubt quickly disappeared. They understood that music is so much more than just making hit records and they understood everything I wanted to establish with my brand. I believed in them and they believed in me. When I met them I had recently gotten out of the contract I was trapped in for so long. It’s amazing how something so small as a piece of paper can control you for life. For five years I felt owned. There were so many times I wanted to upload my entire hard drive of songs to Soundcloud and just put it out, but I couldn’t sell myself short so I waited. It was painful at times, like I just wanted to quit and never make music again, but when you have a vision it’s kinda hard to call it quits.
I’ve always known what I wanted to do but I couldn’t do it alone. The one thing that has gotten me through all of these years of living in captivity was love. Love from friends, family, fans and even strangers. So much of it that I often look at the little I’ve done so far and wonder what the hell people see in me. I’ve had the opportunity to meet some amazing people in my life and the fact that most of them remain regardless if I ever released another song is a blessing I’ll never take for granted. After five years I’m free from my first contract, I now have an amazing team in LVRN and I’m finally able to do shit the way it should’ve been from the jump.
Here’s to being free.This is Deko
No, they are not ready , not deadly 
Defang quora, quote me, it’s all goodie, they mistook me
Thought he was a one-trick pony, fuck ‘em
Bitch, “U Guessed It” still got me road-running
First of my kind, and I ain’t reach my prime
Priming bombs tip-toeing ’til your toe touch land mine
No legs, no spine, how they walkin’ ‘round with they back to us
Young lord, Bible, rap genius, dodgin’ Judas
Jumpin’ on 12 ‘cause they might shoot us
Take us out our shit and call us looters
Droppin’ knowledge, lines paratrooper
I got five to come type Cooper
It’s my time when I want like a lupa
Talkin’ shit until your words loose ya
Face hotter than a damn Ruger, real ruler
Most niggas this real done had funerals, so feral, so thorough
OGG in the city fuckin’ up the borough
When that clock strikes one , you’re done
When that clock strikes two, nigga, who you?
When that clock strikes three , you’ll see
And when that clock hits four , oh Lord
Yeah, I’ve been that nigga, nigga
Been that nigga, boy
I been a killa, I’m hopin’ rappin’ can fill a void
Sleep on a nigga, you got your covers 'n' pillows, boy

I heard what they said ’bout me, ’twas nothin’ they said to me
Prada and Fendi, Bencialaga, a nigga Gucci
Mother Mary, Marcialago, can give me pussy
Keep the sticky inside of that Stüssy and keep it movin’
When they fed up, leave the whole scene wet up
I swear to God, a nigga brains were just oatmeal and ketchup
Or some red stuff, they silenced all the hecklers
Chucklin’ Chuck-E-Cheese ass nigga, go get your bread up
You are not fuckin’ ready
For the young, black, dumb-strapped, in the favor of Allah
All of the gods y’all pray to probably my gualas
I am more than a man, dumb hungry, more than a man
More morphine to endorse my poor rigor mortis
Swing dick, swordfish, nigga weak, porpoise
Q can pour souls, prayin’ to the god of porcelain
I don't need your approval, my guy, I never force shit
Forfeit, never, I'm a oracle, I'll probably or–bit 
When that clock strikes one, you’re done
When that clock strikes two, nigga, who you?
When that clock strikes three, you’ll see
And when that clock hits four , oh Lord
I’m juxtaposed to God
Across from a black queen, on top a white woman
That's her privileged throne, eating sal-a-mon
Top of yellow rice by a right woman
I'm the stones thrown at Christ
Sea, Moses parted, young paying homage
To a pair of parents who made apparent
Reign of a panther, black heir apparent, none of y'all comparin'
So fuck is you sayin', fuck is you reppin'
Don't give a fuck what you talkin' 'bout, so fuck who you sexin'
I'm the fuckin' answer, you niggas fucked up the question
Fuck is you questionin', do you know who the fuck you addressin'?
I'm Stokely Carmichael, y'all niggas Susie, followin' Angelica
Angelic nastiness she possess is one of a kind, no replica
Replicate bar nine, I'm Stokely Carmichael, yeah
Not looking for Makeba, know where she at, she right there
She love my contra-dick, she get nasty like edamame
Call my queen a bitch, make her cum, then she say, "Ashe"
Dick mightier than pen and sword, I turn good girl to whore
God's juxtaposed to me, "Alkebulan, teach us some more"
Okay, please hold the reverie that you're peddling to the youth
Or the kufi thoughts when you're only raisin' that right fist in the booth
Tryna relay conscious lines, but all you sayin' is, "I spit the truth"
Followed by, "Yeah, I am the shit"
Yep, yeah, nigga, we know, you poo
Y'all need some lovin' in your life
A little Giovanni by your side
A little of Assata's all I need
A little bit of Angela Davis and Ruby Dee, ha
Now when that clock hits four, uh, yeah, there's war
And when that clock hits three, yeah, nigga, you’ll see
By the time the clock hits two, you'll know, who you?
'Cause I am not the only one, we're all Alkebulan
When that clock strikes one, you’re done
When that clock strikes two, nigga, who you?
When that clock strikes three, you’ll see
And when that clock hits four, oh LordOh, oh
Oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Oh, oh, oh

Tom Brady timin', young Clipse, Grindin'
Niggas think that I'm a singer till I really hit that switch
My mental dictionary is a fully loaded clip
I'm wit’ Sway in the AM, sip gin like, Asian rapper, back from battle rapper days
I got accolades, Grammy nominated from my first shit
Put your best verse against my worst shit, perfect
Ain't it funny how that shit goes
I ain't viral, but I bet this shit goes
I know they love it when a nigga put them words together
Spit, rip, and dip, put them verbs together
Shit's strange, long way from where I came
Evil blockin' my vision just like a bang
But I’m Geppetto to a puppet
Writer for a muppet
Eye on the prize, you got pride? Better tuck it
I ain't pop but I got carbonated verses
Them shits burn like soda when you first sip
I can't kick no bullshit when people out here suicidal
So love to my idols, love for my rivals
Love to my bible, love for my rifle
Love like Eiffel Tower, over any nigga thinkin' that he wit’ me
Listen to your CD, put em in a , shoulda been a frisbee
This is for my nigga’s back home, Zone
This is for the ones who led me on, gone
This is for them girls thinkin' wrong,  it's long
And this is for my girl when I get home, bone
Strong, wish a nigga clone
Wish a nigga pluck a hair just for a strand of DNA
Take it to the lab, hold it to the light
And give it to the specimen, but not quite right
I'm flexed up lyrical tech up, TEC’d up
Complex nigga Nadeska, blessed up
I could do this shit wit’ no hands and no eyes
Could probably kick this shit with no foot, I'm that fire
I am not to be compared, don't be foolish
Southern rapper wit’ a twist, like a Rubik’s
I am Skywalker smokin', don't get too high, bitch
I did not come here to play, I'm on some Kawhi shit
I'm on some Dubai Shit, I'm on some "save up and be wise" shit
It sounds lame when them singles stop streamin'
And your labels stop callin’, and you stressed out tryin’
I'll be somewhere on an island
Chillin' with my tribe, and
I don't know who these nigga’s think they are
Put holes in the beat my flow is an AR
I am a God like R-A
They don’t want beef so lay low, get hit wit’ A-Rod like J-Lo
Wet flow, y’all nigga’s slippin’
Russell Westbrook, boys y’all nigga’s trippin’
Russell Westbrook, boys y’all nigga’s trippin’Baby, you don't know what you do to me
Between me and you I feel a chemistry
I won't let no one come and take your place
'Cause the love you give, it can't be replaced
I just might go off the deep end
When I've had too much, you shut me up
Now when you start to creep in
Know that everyone is sick of all my reasons
I, I let you come and go like seasons
Don't you wanna stay?
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, babe 
Turn me inside out, make my heart speed
Need no one else, you're all I need
Personality in everything you do
Makes me love everything about you
First I blame you, then I want you
Fucking hate you, then I love you
I can't help myself, no
When I have you, wanna leave you
If you go, that's when I need you
I can't help myself, no
You make me believe
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, babe 
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want, anything you need
Anything your soul desires
I'll give you anything you want from me
Anything you want anything you need
Anything your soul desires
Anything 'cause
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, waves, waves
Every hour, every day, day, day
You come in waves, yeah
You do, you do, you come in waves
Your love is a one in a million
It goes on and on and on
You give me a really good feelin', all day long
Your love is a one in a million

Love it babe, love it babe, love it babe
You come in waves, hey, yeah 
You do, you do, you come in waves Look
Can't we both agree there's nobody like us 
I try to look into your eyes but that's a bit much 
I need you when you tell me you love, things change 
I need you so much I don't know my own name 
Can you wip my mind clear
I don't wanna bring all that over here
Make me forget 
Amnesia

Know we just met today, will you stay for the night? 
We don't gotta fall in love if it don't feel right 
I'm not afraid of falling deep in your life
It's getting cold out here, can I come inside? 
I know you got a lot to do so I won't stay long 
I got nothing left to lose if I'm feeling it wrong
Lately I've been lucky, oh I guess the bet still on
It's getting kinda late, can you show me your room?
Oh-oh
Amnesia 
Amnesia

Now it don't come around much but I know that you got my best interest, in your heart
Now I ain't trying to fight it 'cause I know that my last love don't matter no more
I forgot
But you got me up 
You got my, my love 
Tryna fall in love, loveShut my eyes
Close me in
I feel the window
Caving in
Set my life
To the wind
I wanna be free
Once again
Here i am
Back again
Coming home at 3 am
My hearts contempt
To overwhelm
My foolish lies my happy cries
Some times i close my eyes
Hope to die, while still alive
Drowning in your foolish lies
My eyes are filled with downing skies
Pistons faintly reach my mind
My last resort
To take my life
I won't go without
A fight
I Wanna Die When Im 24
I Wanna Die When Im 24
Give Up Just Give Up
Give Up Just Give Up
I Wanna Die When Im 24Yeah, yeah

Smoke a blunt to get the vibe

I don't wanna be here no more
I don't wanna be here no more
I don't wanna see you no more
You may even see things you can't stand to see
Or they show you lies- the bold truth
And remember, this is not your story
And you aren't in itAt the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
At the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
At the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
At the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
Money, car, clothes, that's the shit that's all around me
Big booty hoes, that's the shit, they tryna drown me
In but I know that there's more to life than that, man
Plus, a nigga got two strikes on him 'cause he a black man
Ridin' down Redan
Please light up the weed man
I've been fuckin' stressin'
Can't wait for the weekend
So I can go out with my niggas, drown all of this pain
In some champagne
Make it rain, probably lose my damn, brain
Then fuck up some commas
Then take care of momma, yeah 
The bills steady comin' 
And she gotta handle it 
I gotta hurry before she get old and start callin' for some help
How can I help my mom, if I can't help myself?
So I'm ridin' down Redan
Somebody call the weed man
'Cause I've been fuckin' stressin'
I can't wait for the weekend
So I can go out with my niggas, drown all of this pain
In some champagne
Make it rain, probably lose my damn, brain
But that don't mean a damn thing
At the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
At the beginning of every day
It's important to take a knee and pray
I forgot sometimes but got the faith
When the odds against me, I still find a way
I feel like the Lord had to punish me
Three years in the pen and they humble me
This shit get so tough, you gotta take a knee
And to my brother B, thank you for your honesty
Fuck the past, my focus on what's in front me
Fuck the media, the feds and the industry
In my cell, got my bible, readin' Timothy
'Cause when you young, rich and black, you get no sympathy
You could've chose anybody, but you chose me
I could've did thirty years, but I did three
I know the Lord guided me, 'cause I couldn't see
And He the one that gave me air 'cause I couldn't breathe
I couldn't breathe
I couldn't breathe

Tüm bu kameralardan uzakta
Hayal kurmak istemiyorum, tüm bunları aştım
Ecel köşede bekler.
Beni iki gözümün arasından vurur.
Onlar bir taraf seçtiklerinde ve değiştiklerinde komik oluyorlar
Kimsenin yaşadığım şeyi yaşaması gerekmiyor, hayır..
Fakat herkes benim ne yapmam gerektiğimi biliyormuş gibi gözüküyor
Öyleyse hadi bir günlüğüne vücutları değişelim
Sen ben olabilirsin, ben de sen
Bu tamamıyla otomatik olduğundan, yapabilirsin
Şimdi değiş.
Söyle nasıl hissettiriyor?
Başkası olmak.
Şimdi değiş.
Düşündüğün gibi değildi.

Onu güvende mi tutacaksın yoksa katlayacak mısın?
"Şunu bil, eğer beni aldattığını öğrenirsem
Seni ve o orospuyu öldürürüm,bunun geri dönüşü olmaz."
Bunu bana söylediği zaman, onu nasıl suçlayabilirdim?
Küçük bir kasaba kızıydı, şimdiyse tamamiyle ünlü.
Belki bu benim suçumdur. Hiçbir şey karanlıkta yaşadığım zamanlar gibi değil
Her şeyi başlangıçta sana anlattım

Why you wanna kick me out of my natural element?
I'm tryna work it outLyrics from snippet
Gettin' out, this for us, feel like I'm Jordan Peele
EA, do 140 on the freeway
Turn up with my DJ, but only on my b-day
'Cause I don't like the club at all
Remember the days they wouldn't play my songs at all
Now I gotta shrug it off6lackhood Universal mehn

Last day of school
I bought myself a chain
Been to the streets alot
Momma said I change
To much on my mind
I can't even explain
I need a pain eraser
To take away this pain
Cos' am married to the game
Money is all what I aim
I'll pull out this shame
All I want is CHANGE........X2
Party after party
We just getting started
This is a type of movie that I feel I have acted
If I tell that I love you,you the person that I trusted
Am in NEED FOR SPEED for love ,you the MOST WANTED
Party after party
We just getting started
This is a type of movie that I feel I have acted
If I tell that I love you,you the person that I trusted
Am in NEED FOR SPEED for love ,you the MOST WANTED
Cos' am married to the game
Money is all what I aim
I'll pull out this shame
All I want is CHANGE.....X2
One,Two,Three
They like and follow me
Four,Five,Six
Am breaking their stricts
I used to be a follower and disciple when they lead
But look at me now,am runnin their streets
They're planning,they're watching waitin for me to fall
Eventhough I break a leg I still stand tall
Call it CALL OF DUTY I never see a war
Overall,I win it,never lose it or even draw
Call me Young Dripper
Because am not a Dreamer
Young future leader
Am a future BILLIONAIRE
Grow up and build your stature
And be matured
Be somebody's mentor
Not somebody's hater
Haters gonna die before I checkmate
I'll be going higher than a spacecake
I'll be living life cos' am classic
Its not magic thats how we planned it
Jokers make you laugh career
I wish you were sharp like a spear
I wish you were mine mamacita
She was like I can't ,am sorry my dear
Cos' am married to the game
Money is all what I aim
I'll pull out this shame
All I want is CHANGE........X2

Flipping in sauce
Dripping with cheddar cheese
Besides its butterfly doors
Lookking al cheesy but its wheezy
And its making your mind freezy
Like double mc cheeseЯ читаю в стиле трепа
Я вершу свои дела
Да я в музыке легенда
Нал коплю на каделак
Самый свежий, самый стильный
Подтверждаю это факт
Я сегодня с твоей тати совершаю взрослый акт
Проволялись ночь в кровати, твоя тати моя хоуми
Она хочет со мной пати, она хочет со мной дома
Проволялись ночь в кровати, твоя тати моя хоуми
Она хочет со мной пати, она хочет со мной дома
Завалили братья сквад, но я им просто так не сдамся
Я нагну всех ваших баб, ведь куча денег на балансе
Залетаю в супермаркет, чтоб купить по ананасу
Да, я лучший парень трешер, потому что я фрилансер

Моя шаути на хвосте
Пистолет в моей руке 
Cannys залетел ко мне 
Тусим вместе на треп хате
Нам не скучно с нами тати
Едем вместе на бугати
Разьебем мы вместе патиHook
