Thought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of time
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah

I don't need nothing else but you
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you

Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
I understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh, so won't

Focus on communicating

I don't wanna fall in love off of subtweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide in
Oh, I might make you mine by the night, and
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating

Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough 
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus 
I know your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day, she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know that we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
17, and we got a dream to have a family
A house, and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly, we turned 23
And now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Our old friends are now our enemies
And now I, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day, you know where we'd ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life, then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
To start a new life together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
Run away now, run away now
Run away now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't setBetter
Nothing, baby
Nothing feels better
I'm not really drunk, I never get that fucked up
I'm not, I'm so sober
Love to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
'Cause I live down the street
So we meet when you need and it's yours
All I hear is...
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I'll admit
Nothing feels better than this
You say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
You keep my hand around your neck, we connect, are you feeling it now?
'Cause I am
I got so high the other night, I swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground
Ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
In my ears
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit
Nothing feels better than this 
Nothing feels better than this2, 3, 4
The hard part always seems to last forever
Sometimes I forget that we aren't together
Deep down in my heart, I hope you're doing alright
But from time to time I often think of why you aren't mine
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
Now, I can't say I'll be alright without you
And I can't say that I haven't tried to
But, all your stuff is gone
I erased all the pictures from my phone
Of me and you
Here's what I'll do
I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
I hope you think of all the times we shared
I hope you'll finally realize I was the only one who cared
It's crazy how this love thing seems unfair
You won't find a love like mine anywhere
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that no one else
Is gonna hold you down the way that I do
But I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day you'll get the sense to call me
I'm hoping that you'll say
You're missing me the way I'm missing you
So I'll keep your number saved
'Cause I hope one day I'll get the pride to call you
To tell you that I'm finally over you
I'm finally over youSorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
For my whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it 
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent 
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it 
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it 
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent 
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it 
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen

Talk about where we're goin'
Before we get lost, lend me your thoughts
Can't get what we want without knowin'
I've never felt like this before
I apologize if I'm movin' too far
Can we just talk? Can we just talk?
Figure out where we're goin'

Figure out where we're goin'

Searchin' for pieces, covering up the hole
I'll fight for your love, I'll fight for your soul
I'll throw all of my cares away for you
I'll be there to wait for you
Maybe you weren't the one for me
But deep down I wanted you to be
I'll still see you in my dreams
All the things that I did for you, just wasn't it for you
So I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
Through my emotion
I will be coasting, roller-coasting
I'm hoping that you'll come back to me
Moving on seems harder to do
When the one that you love moves faster than you
I gave you my all, I showed the proof of your lies
And you weren't worth it, you don't deserve me
As time passes I'm feeling high
You're not the one I'm thinking of tonight
I may not be over you, but I'll try inside
I'm feeling better now, finally feeling special now, oh
Coasting, roller-coasting
In my emotions, oh
I'll be coasting, roller-coasting
I noticed you weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
You weren't the one for me
Weren't the one for me
You weren't the one

But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Saturday nights, light gray Silverado
You drive it 'cause you have to
Stay up working late at a job you hate
Fix your makeup in a dirty bathroom
No more love, in and out of clubs
Knowing what you gotta do
You've got plans wrapped in rubber bands
And that's the only thing you'll never lose
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
'Cause I care, I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
Than right here around you
I care, care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
They don't care about you
Nowhere like I do
All the things that I know
That your parents don't
Don't care about you
Nowhere like I
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do 
Nowhere like I do Living the good life full of goodbyes
My eyes are on the grey skies
Saying I don't want to come home tonight
Yeah, and I'm high up, off what?
I don't even remember
But my friend passed out in the Uber ride
Oh, I'm from the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen
Maybe the end is near
But I've been waiting all year
To get the hell up out of here
And throw away my fears
I'm so faded 
Off of all the things that I've taken, and
Maybe I'm not really drunk
Maybe I'm really good at faking
From the city of the 9-1-5
Where all the girls are pretty
And they're down for the hype
All my boys are with me
Going up for the night
But who cares, who cares
'Cause this is our year
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American dream
We don't always say what we mean
That's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen 
American teen
Mmm, oh yeah
We don't always say what we mean
When we're high off our American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Oh, I'm proud to be American
So wake me up in the spring
While I'm high off my American 
And we don't always say what we mean
It's the lie of an American teen
My youth is the foundation of me
Living life as an American teen

I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy
Need your therapy
I don't mean to come off aggressive 
I'm just here to pass off the message 
'Cause you were in my head when
I thought I lost my mind
But we do this every time
Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy
I'm not one for relationships
It's over-rated
We could still be lovers
That's all I'm saying, and
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy

That I was always interested
All the feelings I kept in
What should we do?
Whatever you want to
'Cause there's something that you're doing has me falling all the way
I'm tripping off your love and all the other drugs we taking
Over all the others, you're the one all over me
I need your therapy, need your therapy

Lalalalalala
I'm needin', needin' you
LalalalalalaI'm not the best at showing my emotions
You cut me deep and you left me wide open
I fought the demons that lie in between us
They'd think we're perfect if they'd ever seen us, but
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
Burning burning burning, dadadadada
Turning turning turning turning, dadadadada
I took the time to think of what you said
You were tap-dancing in my head
I must be honest, I have a lot of pride
But I'm broken inside
I guess this sounds like another sad love song
I can't get over how it all went wrong
But, I let the words come together
Then, maybe I'll feel better
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting

Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurting
Bridges they are burning
Lover, I am worried
Tables they are turning
Lover, I am hurtingWe've been here before, surrounded in the cold
You take me to places I've never known
And you push me to places I'll never go
I would die for you
Tell me the truth
Am I all that you would need?
If we're keeping it a hundred, you're all that I need for me
From the jump until forever from now, I would ride for you
But you got me shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been through it whole
I've been through the worst
But I never knew how much our love could hurt
Over my family I put you first
Writing out my feelings is the only thing that work
I don't hear from the friends I thought were mine too
But I hold on to the poems I would write you
Happy seventeen, I saw us two and you saw three
I guess our lines are structured like a haiku
[Chorus 2
You got me shot down by love
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Oh I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down, knocked down
Knocked down
Knocked down
I've been shot down by love
You got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?
I've been knocked down by you
And you got my heart now
Why won't you stop now?I've been seeing angels
In my living room
That have walked the sun
And have slept on the moon
Covered in the fragrance
Of their own perfume
Telling me the stories
Stories coming true
Well you see these angels
These angels see the light
Yeah I had my troubles
Troubles, all right
I've been seeing angels
Oh no
They'll hold onto their secrets
And torn up memories
We float above horizons
And sail across the seas
I hope for better days
And lightly times are tough
The angels give me strength
And I'm not giving up
So I wipe away my tears
I unveil my pain
They're brushing off my shoulders
And I hold on to their stain
I've been seeing angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels
Angels, ayy
AngelsCold blooded, cold blooded
The way you've been treating me is getting out of hand
And you walk around like you're so innocent
I gave you my heart and it melted in your arms
This isn't a place that I belong
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can’t feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch
I lost my sight and you're leading me on
Is it 'cause you're used to guys always doing you wrong?
Do you really love me?
Or is it just revenge?
Lately you don't seem so genuine
And I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes 
That you're no good for me
And love is blind
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
I feel your fear
Surrounded by your skin
You feel my heartbeat vibrate so violent
Inside of your head
I see it in your eyes
You're no good for me
And love is blind
Ooh, and cold blooded, cold blooded
You want what I'm giving up
But my love is not enough
Cold blooded, cold blooded
And I can't feel my fingertips
But you feel better when we touch
Mmmm
Fill me up, keep me hot
Use me up of all I've got
Cold blooded, cold blooded 
Cold blooded, cold blooded Evade my intellect
Feed into my introspect
Wrap your words around my brain
Driving me insane, yeah, ooh
You found the real me
Save my inner being
Switch on me like seasons
Do I need to give you a reason?
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Yeah 
I know you're tired of inconsistency
Are you into me? Are you feeling me?
To be honest
I'm into you, and the way that you talk is so damn cool
With your love I'm on a different high I've never felt before
And if your love is a drug, I'm an addict 'cause, damn, I'm feening for more, yeah
We've been talking for a minute now
Let me know where your heads at, am I in it? Yeah
You put me on your super high
I want to get lost in your paradise
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Lucid dream, in reality
I'm just tryna feel your gravity
Always fallin in love, and I'm tired of the cycle
We don't even need a title
You're always on my mind
It's funny how I'm thinking about you all the damn time
You don't got to be mine, just be mine for the night
I don't know what this is but it feels just right
I wanna make a move
Let me know if that sounds cool, yeah
All the things I'd do
All the things I'd do for you
There's millions of reasons to love you 
There's millions of reasons 
You give me a reason to want you 
You give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason 
Give me a reason, give me a reason, give me a reason Can't count up the times you've blown my line
And that's been on my mind a lot lately

AlrightI lost my heart in the nighttime
She left me out in the cold
She left me broken and weary
Drunk off the lies she told
I fell in love in the morning
But when the day gets cold
I'm back to life in my lonely
City of El Paso
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
I lost my mind when you left me
And I didn't have much of that
But you were so quick to reject me
So I'll take my time being sad
I fell so hard, I'll admit it
The feeling wasn't mutual
So I'm back to live on my lonely
In the city of El Paso
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love 
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise, promise, promise
Promise, promise that you'll keep my love 
But the days get harder in November
Love grows colder in the winter
All the things you say, I'll remember
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Promise that you'll keep my love with ya
Love grows colder in the winter
Promise that you'll keep my love with yaGot my headlights off, we're sittin' outside
If you climb in my car, then we're here all night, ooh
A couple blunts rolled and I got my windows down
Shorty, it's been a while since you've been this high
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around
You like keepin' around
Late at night, eleven, we're cruisin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
Late at night, eleven, we're crusin'
Lately, I've been watchin' your movements
If I'm the only one that you're choosin'
Am I your favorite drug you've been usin'?
21s sittin' on my M5 
Ride around summer, all-wheel-drive, yeah
Couple blunts in and I got my windows down
Lookin' real nice in my passenger side
If you're waitin' on love, then you waitin' for a while
If your neighbors wake up, then we gotta turn it down
So you say I'm the type you like keepin' around

Two-step in the motherfucker, yeah
Everybody two-step in the motherfucker, what?
Two-step in the motherfucker, everybody get up, yeah
Can you feel this energy?
This is the start of something great
We might... be a little late... hey
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go
I got a blacked out Chevrolet
You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated
I don't have any obligations
So let's have a little fun
Go 'head and drop all the relations
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let go, let go
Let's go, let's go
So let's go, let's go
Let go, let's goSpend my time worrying of broken promises
Focused on the smell of all the burnt out cigarettes
My thoughts play on repeat
Only comfort that I keep
'Cause in a moment I will be
Something you will forget
Hopeless, hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Used to lift me higher
But I guess our time's expired
I'm giving you the match
Set our love on fire
Hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
]
Now tell me was I ever something that you could regret
I know I wasn't the one for you
But at least I tried my best
Surrounded by questions like, "Why'd you two part ways?"
But if my memory’s right
You're the one that left
I'll be hopeless hopelessly romantic
You, you got me stranded
Ooh, I'm blue, blue, blue
Ooh yeah, I'm blue, blue, blue, oh
Yeah, I'm blue, blue, blueYou say I'm trippin'; bullshit
You're the one to make me do shit
You're the one to make me feel it
The feeling of stupid
I was in your corner
When you were putting me through shit
Now you wanna leave
No, you leaving me was foolish
You left me this scar on my heart
And I left you a brand new car
How nice of you, the price of true love
True love is absolute
So what more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way
Yeah, all of these excuses
Say I'm the one that made you ruthless
Well you're the reason I'm crazy
And with you, I feel useless
I let you have it
You took me for granted
Always wanna play the victim
When they don't know the truth is...
You left me this scar on my heart
When I'd never take it that far 
Why would you say that it was true love
If true love is absolute, what more can I say?
What more can I say?
You make me this way
What more can I say?
You make me this way
I tried to stay the night
You won't let me inside
Oh, you push me away
You'll never change
Just another fight
Between you and your pride
Oh, what more can I say?
What more can I?
What more can I say? 
You make me this way
You make me this way
What more can I say?
What more?
You make me this way 
What, can I?Remix, baby, yeah
I meet you at the spot, send the location
I don't do this a lot, special occasion
I know you ain't a thottie, you ain't no basic
I turn your dry spot to an oasis
I kiss the right spots, I know all the places
Oh I lick the right spots, that's an ultimatum
The loud in rotation, cloud 9, flotation
Let the rose petals spread like rosacea
I know your ex to blame for your cold nature
Tell him stay in his lane, stop the road ragin'
And now I got you in here makin' those faces
Runnin' 'round the bedroom like four bases, moolah!
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
Drop me a pin, let's fall
Way deeper into whatever we're callin' it
Whatever we're fallin' into
'Cause I don't really care about rules 
I don't really care about rules 
I just really care about you 
I'm enjoyin' starin' into 
Your eyes when I'm all in it with you
They can choose to watch, but I'd rather they just listen
Could fill up an album with everything that they're missin'
They so superficial, don't understand how we're chillin'
We don't need a lot, we got us and that's why we're winnin'
To them it's a park bench, us a magic carpet
Little trips to Target turn to avant garde shit
I promise, we got this, we got this
Baby just send me your
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
Nothing else, but you
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride
I don't need nothing else but you
Ride, ride, ride, come and vibe with me tonight
Ride, ride.... tonight
I don't need nothing else but you
But you, but you
Nothing else but you
But you

Do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, I don't need nothing else but youAre we better off believing
What the ignorance suggests?
I wish living life was easy 
But mine has been a mess
They say it comes with the seasons 
But the seasons come and go 
I go blurry when I'm thinking
Is it me or vertigo?
Criticized, who am I to give up?
I’m breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah
I've been better off than broken
I’ve been battered, I've been beat
I wish I was more outspoken
But the words are out of reach
Hmm, thought I loved you in the moment
I was happy, I was young
I've been learning, I've been growing
But the worst is yet to come
Criticized, who am I to give up? 
I'm breathing, what's the reason to let up?
Sympathize, who am I to give up?
Putting on my favorite get up
Are we alive?
Or are we dreaming?
After the ride
Are you leaving?
Are we alive? 
Or are we dreaming? 
After the ride
Are you leaving? 
Yeah
Eyes closed, eyes closed

And I couldn't stand the scent
But if it's what it takes to put a smile on your face
I guess I'll deal with it
You hung with the popular kids
And I couldn't stand them
But I sucked it up, because I wanted to be more than friends
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
We were ridin' down Dyer with my top down
Singin' our favorite songs
But the funny thing is
Every time we did, you'd always get the words wrong
And I was your biggest fan
You should never forget it
I bet your new man
Doesn't love you like I did
Does he love you like I did?
Does he love you like I did?
Noooo…
You should walk away with me
In your heart
Keep me in your mind
You don't have to speak
Of our past, just
Keep me in your life
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive
Keep me alive

Keep me alive
Ohhhhh
Nooooo
Ohhhhh
NoooooYou'd rather speak more than listen
And that's based off our first impression
I'm new to all this affection
But I'm going in the right direction
Floating through different dimensions
But not losing sense of religion
Honey, I forgot to mention
I'm so entranced by you, it hurts
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
Can't let me go if I'm fallin'
I've been on the path of importance
Let the love pull you in slowly
The river is running, we're flowing
I'm coming down, you've been rollin'
And we're letting free, now we're open
Pour me a, pour me a potion
I'm rocking, I'm rocking the motion
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
I'm in love with the moment
See me floatin', see me glowin'
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
Now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like that, like that, ayy
Ooh, now, left, right, left, right
Take it back, bring it side to side
Like
Nothing feels better than this
That made me feel like I'm just speeding, doing 60 in a 35
We're sitting in a car and just holding handsMmm, mmm
Oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Alright
Don’t save me, I'm in no need of saving 
And if you stay with me, I know you need patience 
Blood and cologne on the fragrance 
'Cause if ya deal with me, I know you know what pain is 
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck 
And I don't even like to think about it
On my own, but still so crowded
Walls come down and the guards come up
But there's nowhere to run, I feel surrounded
Hurt feels better when I'm by myself
No one really means it when they're wishing you well
I got no one to call, no one
And people only love you when they're needing your wealth
Damn, laying down, staring at my ceiling fan
Everybody acting like they give a damn
Where is everybody when you need a hand?
I've been burning rubber on the Michelin
Flying in the rain like I'm Superman
I could say I love it, but that just depends
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love
So if you're gonna love me
You gotta love all of me
You gotta love, deeper than that
Now, if you're gonna leave me
You better run far away
I’d hate for you to leave me attached
'Cause I'm in love with bad luck
I’m in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
I'm in love with bad luck
Move too close, get caught up
Move too close, get caught up
I'm in love with bad luck
Yeah 
Bad, bad luckPower
Got me sittin' by my phone, I’ve been waiting for hours
On my line, sending mirror pics of you fresh out the shower
So I might as well swing over to your place 
It’s crowded
In LA, but I’ll be there at 8 if the traffic allows it
Say you’re down, I could show you around
If you’re really about it, yeah
But for you, I got something to prove, what do you say?

We can save it for later, yeah
I just like the way it feels when you're around
When you're around, ah
Now I know we're not dating, nah
Maybe soon by the way things go, we’ve been talking for ages
Take it step by step, slow it down, we just need to be patient, love
If the love feels good and it's real, it'll all work out
It'll all work out, yeah
Should we bring it right back?
Honestly, it's better like that

Had to struggle for a while 
Just so I could live it up when it's time to live 
I knew something had to give 
Broke as hell using Lyft 
I could never get a lift, now they all want one from me

I don't know what you been waiting for
So you've got your love locked up instead
But somethin' better's waitin' at your door
You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you're feelin' down
You get strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found
You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up

You locked the door and it’s raining 
But baby, I’m not complaining, no

Can you feel the tension? You've got my attention
I know we're just friends, but I'd rather be together instead, yeah
’Cause the days get brighter when you're here
So I gotta keep you near 
Goin' crazy and I just can't get you outta my head

Just can't get you outta my headMmm, mmm
Mmm, yeah
You go searching for paradise
You sit back and close your eyes
We're burning, yet so alive
And now you've got your hands up
Hoping you catch the high
Feels like the summer time
Chasing the northern lights, oh
Don't like watching your momma cry
You say you'd rather die
She says you're wasting your life
Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends
Do you hear me through your speakers
So much distance, space between us
Say you're dreaming and I’ve been, too
And no-one knows what you’ve been through
And I've been thinking a little deeper
Contemplation, getting cleaner
See no leaders, need more teachers
I'm in shambles, I don't sleep much
Oh, life don’t stop the more we pray
All your wrongs from yesterday
Smokin’ himalayan haze
Won’t wash all your sins away
Hate don’t give
Love don’t rewind all the good times
All the dollars you’ll spend
Give it up for nights like this
Don’t give into overthinking
Pour a drink when it ends 
Yeah, yeahLife is never easy when you need it to be
Try to knock me down, but I get back on my feet
Everybody's angry and they're coming for me 
But I can't give them energy that I won't receive 
So I brush 'em off, I got a lot on my sleeve
Like I'm moving backwards, but it's all on repeat
This place is getting crowded, I got no room to breathe
I hope the only thing I'm losing isn't my memory
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
Now it's real, take your time, you're almost there
Wherever we’re going, gotta be prepared
We’ll be fine, are you scared? Are you scared?
People keep on talking 'bout what they wanna be
Walking down the line, but they don’t live what they preach 
Sharing attributes with all our own enemies
You gotta pay to live and even dying ain't free
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
I'ma keep it moving, got a hundred things I gotta do today, yeah
You gotta take it slow 
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control 
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
You gotta take it slow 
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
Gotta take it slow
Dust yourself off, don’t you lose control
'Cause the world keeps spinning, the sun won't shine on my face
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still alive
Had a hundred friends, but I cut em off, I don’t need em
Not like any of them gave a fuck if I was breathing
Summer's over so they switching around like the seasons
Gotta keep my guard up, now I'm playing defense
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
But I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
I'm too busy trying to fight away all of my demons
Everybody wants a favor, everybody needs me
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Outta sight, outta mind, got no time
So blind, hundred days and I'm still alive, what a life
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Hundred days and I'm still alive
Its been a hundred, mmm
Hundred, hundred days and I'm still aliveI've ran away for miles
It's gettin' hard for me to breathe
'Cause the man that I've been runnin' from is inside of me
I tell him keep it quiet
So hardly does he speak
'Cause he wants to keep his distance
But it's hard for him to leave
He knows I hear him cryin'
Cryin' out for help
I don't know how to save him
I can't even save myself
There's many people dyin'
I've always been afraid
Not that I'm scared of livin'
I'm scared of feeling pain
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I've been so used to winnin'
It was hard for me to lose
No, there's nothing wrong with me
There's just something wrong with you
So I've been making changes
Been workin' on my health
No more competition
Can't compete against myself, no, no, no
I'm not doin' this to be loved, no, no
I've been doin' this to be remembered
Let the people hear it if they want to
Help the one's around me get it on, too
If I die tomorrow and I'm gone
Let the blood run high
Let the carpets drown
I'll be forever now
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
I don't need another hand, I need a couple suggestions
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Now, does my raw emotion make me less of a man? Hmm
Always had a little trouble with self-reflections
Let this be a promise
That when it's said and done
Be a flower in the garden
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sun
Be one with the sunWe were running onto something
And we didn't say "forever," but it's all we wanted
You were so in love with simple things
And now we're searching for the fire dripped in kerosene
I've been loving more, living less
Off of highs and lows, so obsessed
Couldn't get nothin
But we're never running out
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go
Is this Heaven or Armageddon?
I'll be gettin' high with you to watch the endin'
We were drownin' down our memories
A cemetery full of bottles, man, that liquor bleed
When you're loving more, caring less
It's the highs and lows with no regrets, oh
And we wanted it all then
But we're never running out
We'll be free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear me calling?
Oh, it's all or nothing
When you're free spirits, free spirits
Can you hear it calling?
'Cause I don't wanna live and die alone, don't let me go
So tell me when you're falling
No, I can never doubt your love
Can you hear me calling?
Is it everything you're dreaming of?
Leave it all on the night
As long as you're not leaving me behind
On your heart, your heart, ah
Free spirits, free spirit
Free spirits, free spiritSay you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
It's been too much, I've been on the side and I'm waiting
Got a little time, maybe all night, if I'm patient
What's on your mind? I can never read you 
No, I always leave you crying when we fight, but I don't mean to, yeah
No, no, love don't come easy
Especially when you're loving me, yeah
It's never enough for the both of us, so sorry
Couldn’t have known it would ever be this hard
Ooh, we had it all, but we lost and that's our fault
I should be here waiting for you to answer my calls, no
But I'm never giving up on word, I've been
I've been focusing on putting me first
Still could never see you with somebody else
I can't even live with being by myself
That's the part of me that really needs your help
Lately, I haven't been doing very well
That's the difference between heaven and hell
I feel heaven when you're here with me
I feel hell every time you leave
But I need to get you off of my back
I gotta get you off of my back
We said we would never take it this far
Here we are, going back and forth
I hoped we would never make it this far
But now, I gotta find my worth
Say you don't love me no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be no more if you really don't want to
Say you can't deal with me no more, just say you don't want me
I never know what you feel no more, just say you don't want me
We don't gotta be, we don't gotta be, yeah, no more
We don't gotta be no more, no more, no more, no more, noNow, baby
Can't tell you why, why we
Ain't getting high no more, tried so hard
There's something I've been feeling
And we're lonely
But we never used to be
Either we're arguing or you leave
We both know something's missing
I've been holding on
Holding on to nothing
You don't care too much
And it's obvious that
You're already gone
So unleash your weapon
Aim it at my chest then
If our love is a drug
You're the one with the trigger 
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don't wanna remember you , yeah, yeah, yeah
Don't try to change your mind
When the blood is on your hands
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don't wanna remember you, yeah, yeah
Shoot me down, shoot me down
You're the one with the trigger
Hey, hey, hey
Soul to soul
We used to rock so slow
I felt your blood boil and my heartbeat rush
You free me, why's it slipping?
There's no one left
Go on and hold your breath 
Say that you want me, but you don't want stress
I can't say I feel different
I've been holding on
Holding on to nothing
You don't care too much
And it's obvious that
You're already gone
So unleash your weapon 
Aim it at my chest then 
If our love is a drug
You're the one with the trigger 
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don't wanna remember you, yeah, yeah, yeah 
Don't try to change your mind
When the blood is on your hands
Shoot me down, shoot me down
I don't wanna remember you, yeah, yeah
Shoot me down, shoot me down
You're the one with the trigger
Hey, hey, heySaturday nights, blueberry cigarillos
Swishers make my throat hurt
Rolling OCB's on the side for me
Light 'em up and let 'em both burn
Family feuds, say your mom's confused
Off of shit she doesn't wanna learn
But daddy's gone, say he's never home
And wishing only makes it worse
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
Saturday nights, your works shoes are stilettos
Smell of cheap perfume
Makeup on your face, try to hide the pain
All the lies, they look like the truth
Deep in your heart, all you want is love
But you never felt good enough
You got wrapped up in other plans
But this ain't the way the story ends
I guess there's certain dreams that you gotta keep
'Cause they'll only know what you let 'em see
All the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
And all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care like I do, nowhere like I do
Nowhere like I do
'Cause I care , I care about you
There's nowhere I'd rather be than right here around you
I care , care about you 
There's nowhere I'd rather be
With all the things that I know that your parents don't
They don't care about you the way that I do, oh
All the things that I know that your parents don't
Don't care about you the way that I, the way that I do
The way that I do 
The way that I do 
The way that I do 
The way that I do, I do, oh So you're still thinking of me, just like I know you should
I cannot give you everything, you know I wish I could
I'm so high at the moment, I'm so caught up in this
Yeah, we're just young, dumb and broke
But we still got love to give...
While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb, broke high school kids
Just a young gun with a quick fuse
I was uptight, I wanna let loose
I was dreaming of bigger things
And wanna leave my old life behind
Not a yessir, not a follower
Fit the box, fit the mold
Have a seat in the foyer, take a number
I was lightning before the thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thun-
Thunder, thun-thun-thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, feel the thunder
Lightning, then the thunder, thunder
Thunder, thunder, thunder
We have so much in common, we argue all the time
You always say I'm wrong, I'm pretty sure I'm right
They say you're basic, they say you're easy
You're always riding in the backseat
Now I'm smiling from the stage
While you were clapping in the nose bleeds...
While we're young dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke
Young, dumb
Young, young, dumb and broke

In the back of my mind I know it's hard on us
But to tell you the truth there's no more love, no more love
It's not easy to say, I’m giving up
And I've been losing count
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
You've been working 9 to 5
So it was hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
Nahh, All the shit that you say, do you mean it?
And when you tell me you love me do you believe it?
I can see it in your eyes you've had enough of it
And I've been missing out
When the seconds turn to minutes into hours
Working 9 to 5 cause it's hard to find the time for me, yeah
Are we gonna be alright
If I come through tonight, yeah
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah
Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a while
It's hard to say goodbye when I'm leaving, yeah

Let me inside, dim down the lights
Just know I'm coming home for a reason
Baby can I stay a whileI feel like I'm losing you whenever I'm offline
Though I never had you, I used to pretend that you're mine
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
I feel like there's nothing for me here, but still, I try
Bruising my finger hitting your line
If I'm holding back, I might just lose my mind 
Keeping my phone alive 
Hoping that you call this time 
Thought I heard your ringing 
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Keepin' you on my radar
Lately, you're so damn cold
You used to hold me down
You're far, so it's been a while
I still remember your voice
How you talk so soft in the morning
You're the only one I'm wanting
Love stays still and I'm frozen
But I'm opening thoughts that I keep within
I guess I gotta be a man
I tried as hard as I can
Keeping my phone alive 
Hoping that you call this time
Thought I heard you ringin'
You know I hear things sometimes
Call my line, call my line
Come alive, come alive
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend
Show me, don't pretend 
Show me, don't pretend 
Show me, don't pretendSo, this is gonna be one take!
One, two, three, four
I walk, I walk, I see the light
I push, I fall, and all of my life
I search for my love, I cannot find
A love like yours, as hard as I've tried
Lay by my side just for the night
This isn't love but it feels right
I must admit I cry at nights
I'm stuck on you and I don't know why
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
I don't know why I feel like this
At times I don't think I can handle it
I don't know why I feel so low
You were the one who kept me whole
You chew me up then spit me out
You stole the words right out my mouth
You fed me with "I love you"s
I don't know why I'm stuck
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?
You hit me hard, then you tore my world apart
How do I move on if I don't know where to start?
You've got a hold on me I'll admit that is true
So why do I keep searching when I'm stuck on you?You just turned 21, so lately, you've been drinking
Wasted on alcohol you chase to fight the feeling
Thinking 'bout letting go, would that be easy for you then? Yeah
So lay with me, lay with me, we're underneath the bleachers
Stay or leave, stay or leave, I hope you're never leaving
All of these memories crawling underneath your skin, skin 
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright, alright
Don't believe everything
The shit you like gives you anxiety, but finally
I see you smiling when you say you need privacy
You're only hiding from yourself, mmm, oh
I say I'm fine, coming home
I see the sun come up and shut the blinds
Episodes, I know I never take my own advice when I'm wrong
But I can't do it by myself, oh
'Cause you're in pain, but who's to blame?
All our lives, it never ends
Yeah, alright 
You gotta hold on tight
Yeah, alright
You gotta hold on tight
'Cause I'm in pain, but I'm to blame
To end this fight, I have to change
Yeah, alright
Hold on tight
Yeah, alright
Hold on tightI think I'm fearful of things like traveling
I'm fearful of failure
I'm fearful of being embarrassed
Things like that, I think hinder me from doing the best that I can sometimes
But I think that if I learn to be less fearful
I would get further
I feel like I'm not always in the correct direction
Even though I know I'm on the right path
I'm like "I'm on the right path"
But am I walking the right way, or should I be turning around?
Like little things like that that I go back and forth about in my head
And I think it's always nice to have reassurance
I think it's really nice to see how far being a genuine person can get you
For me at least, like I think that's the reason that I am where I am
I think that I am a big mix of all the people around me
And I'm just happy
I can't complain about anything
Oh yeah
That I'm trying to get so motherfucking high, nigga
I don't wanna feel nothing Taking off, turn off the lights
We're so in denial of breaking up, we make it up
Every time I look in your eyes, I’m back in love
I've waited all my life, for someone like you
But I'm losing sight of your point of view
Are we broken? Lost in emotion
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we’re both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
It's no one's fault, that's what they say
You want it your way, you know it all
We said its no one's fault, losing our minds
Lie after lie, fake love
We had a hell of a ride
Issues aside, both of us
Are we broken? Lost in emotion 
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Is this the last fight? Lay here one last night
I know we're both tired, that's our excuse
Are you all in? Are you bluffing?
Are you, mmm, ooh
Are you, ohWould you ride for me?
Lie for me?
Die for me?
Vibe with me?
I don't want this to end
But i'm not your man
So when this hits the fan would you?
I've got a girl on my way and she looks like Rihanna

Catch me rolling to the spot in my blacked out Honda
My main girl is foreign and she tastes like designer

Drop the attitude, just leave the frustration in the past

I hate you blowin' up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
We both wanna love
We both wanna slide
We both wanna argue until we're both right
And you want a hug
I kiss you goodnight
Maybe we're both just out of our mind 
And you throw tantrums while I'm twistin' up
No medicine is fixin' us
Can't tell you why but tell you what
You got me thinkin'

Sometimes it be like that
I cross the seas wit' you 
Wasn't even supposed to be wit' you 
Yeah, and it gets crazy in the night
I cannot sleep with you 
And I could keep you nice and warm 
Won't do no thinking, I'm in love 
If I was to give you the world 
That's anything that you can think of 
Got too much goin' to be upset
I swear I'd rather be your friend
I said I'm gonna be right back

Sometimes it be like that
Sometimes, when you thought you found the love of your life 
Now you're thinkin' I'm just one of those guys, leading on
I can't help when you read it wrong
Don't know why I trip on us
You put me down, I pick you up
Can't tell you why but tell you what 
You got me thinkin'
I might be better on my own
I hate you blowing up my phone
I wish I never met your ass
Sometimes it be like that
But I'm not myself the nights you're gone
There ain't no way I'm movin' on
I'm not afraid to need you bad
Sometimes it be like that
Yeah, yeah
Sometimes when you're fallin' off track
Baby, don't you leave me like that
Don't cry

This is the start of something great
We might be a little late
Hey, but at least we're on our way
You got too much time to waste
Focusing on what people say
They might not like that we've arrived
But we're here to stay
Leave your sorrow on the table
Pick up your worries and throw them out the window
You don't gotta let your friends know
There's so much trouble to get into
Let's go, let go
Let's go, let go

You don't have a destination
Traveling where the wind will take us
That might be from place to place
Oh shit, I just graduated

Didn't ask for help and now I’m lost
Life comes in phases 
Consequences and mistakes
I'm sorry that it's taken me so long
Mister, mister, please let off your power
Give me half an hour, or better yet, a full
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it, and then there’s more to lose
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim Reaper, just give me one more night
I need another chance to say goodbye
I shouldn't have to die to feel alive
Here's the thing with disappearing
You can yell and no one hears you
Times like this, I need an ear
When I finally have so much to say
Wish I could see your face, oh
And do what I have to stop the tears
Sister, sister, please know that I'm sorry
I wish you could've stopped me from falling off the hill
Only sweet until it all goes sour
But life is what you make it until it gets too real
Gatekeeper, can you show me more to life?
Lately, I've been living out of spite
Grim reaper, just give me one more night

Feels like something's missing, where you been lately?
Tryna tell myself that I ain't in too deep
Give me all of you, and take all of me
This is more than we
How the time flies, know I got my ways about me
Always into mind's eyes, see you sold it to me
Mommy told me he's a nice guy
Know you've got your ways about you too
This is new to me, is this new to you?
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So won't you
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you 
I don't wanna fall in love off of sub-tweets, so
Let's get personal
I got a lot of cool spots that we can go
Tell me what's the move and I got you
I'm only acting like this 'cause I like you
Just give me the vibe to slide then
Oh, I might make you mine by the night and
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Oh, you say it's all you need
So you can take control and baby, I'll follow your lead
You say it's best to plan it through, well boy I don't agree
The best things happen unplanned, a result of you and me
This is more than they can teach
Meet me somewhere off the map
I share my location with no one else so don't be late
It's undecided it will determine our fate
Boy would you mind if we continued this off in space?
Earth has never been it for me
All of what I'm envisioning isn't just what the eye can see
Or what the mind can read
Balance is just balance, ying and yang
I'll hold you down if you're here for the madness
Nothing's ever straightforward, but I'm sure that we can manage
I say I'm calm and collected, you say it's passive aggressive
What's with the fightin' and stressin'
I'm not here for that, neither are you, it's not what we do
Maybe I'm just missing your touch, you should come through
Yeah, yeah
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but youHe keeps leaving you for dead
I don't know what you been waiting for 
So you've got your love locked up instead
But somethin' better's waitin' at your door
You don't know your worth
All the things I know that you deserve
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt
Find someone you know will put you first
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first?
Find someone who loves you at your worst
It's been three years, still countin'
You in love, but still doubtin'
If he's in love with you 
Omoge, I know you got that vibe
Shey him dey do you well ?
Shey him dey make you smile ?
Shey him dey treat you right ?
Are you happy? 
You need real, you need love, you need time
And I know that, you been gone, you been done, you been tryin'
I know I can get it
Find yourself a real thing
Find yourself a new thing
You don't know your worth 
All the things I know that you deserve 
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt 
Find someone you know will put you first 
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Gotta keep, gotta keep, gotta keep your head up
Who puts you first? 
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Don't forget the words I said
Picking you up when you're feelin' down
You get strung on thoughts left in your head
When you lose hope, soon you will be found
You don't know your worth 
All the things I know that you deserve 
Say it's not real if it doesn't hurt 
Find someone you know will put you first 
Find someone who loves you at your worst
Yeah, yeah
Davido, oh
Keep your head up, keep your head up
On and on and on and in
Yeah
Find someone who loves you at your worstUh
Yeah, yeah
When I was young, I fell in love
We used to hold hands, man, that was enough 
Then we grew up, started to touch
Used to kiss underneath the light on the back of the bus 
Oh no, your daddy didn't like me much
And he didn't believe me when I said you were the one
Oh, every day she found a way out of the window to sneak out late
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know that we ride
Through the backstreets in my blue Corvette
Baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me, yeah
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Seventeen and we got a dream to have a family
A house and everything in between
And then, oh, suddenly we turned twenty-three
Now we got pressure for taking our life more seriously
We got our dead-end jobs and got bills to pay
Half our friends are now our enemies
Now I-, I'm thinking back to when I was young
Back to the day when I was falling in love
He used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't set
And every day you know where we ride
Through the backstreets in a blue Corvette
And baby, you know I just wanna leave tonight
We can go anywhere we want
Drive down to the coast, jump in the sea
Just take my hand and come with me
Singing
We can do anything if we put our minds to it
Take your old life then you put a line through it
My love is yours if you're willing to take it
Give me your heart 'cause I ain't gonna break it
So come away, starting today
Start a new life, together in a different place
We know that love is how all these ideas came to be
So baby, run away with me
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
Run away, now
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
He used to meet me on the Eastside
She used to meet me on the Eastside
In the city where the sun don't setSnakehips
Sorry if it's hard to catch my vibe, mmm
I need a lover to trust, tell me you're on my side
Are you down for the ride?
It's not easy for someone to catch my eye
But I've been waitin' for you for my whole damn life
My whole lifetime
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
I've been so into your mystery
Is it because of our history?
Are you into me?
When it feels so good, but it's bad for you
Can't say I don't want it 'cause I know I do
Come on over, I need your company
Cravin' that synergy
Don't be afraid to tell me if you ain't with it
I see you're focused, yeah, you're so independent
It's hard for me to open up, I'll admit it
You've got some shit to say and I'm here to listen
So baby, tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies
Tell me where your love lies
Waste the day and spend the night
Underneath the sunrise
Show me where your love lies

Get in line and come along and dance with me
Womaniser, tantalise her, move her body up and down and fantasise herThought I found a way
Thought I found a way out 
But you never go away 
So I guess I gotta stay now
Oh, I hope some day I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive, outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Walking out of town
Looking for a better place 
Something's on my mind
Always in my head space
But I know someday I'll make it out of here
Even if it takes all night or a hundred years
Need a place to hide, but I can't find one near
Wanna feel alive outside I can't fight my fear
Isn't it lovely, all alone
Heart made of glass, my mind of stone
Tear me to pieces, skin to bone
Hello, welcome home
Woah, yeah
Yeah, ah
Woah, woah
Hello, welcome homeI've been bouncing wall from wall
I thought I've felt it all, but I didn't
I've written a thousand songs about you
I'm just hoping one day that you'll hear it
I guess I've gotten used to pain
But I'm one blow from insanity
How can I find myself?
I've lost way more than identity
And I've been through many phases of you
All reminiscence, I hated the truth
I don't think I deserve your abuse
You tore me up but I'm changing
And you're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin' out and I'm hurtin'
And you're just a whirlwind
And I'll pick up the pieces you've broken
You're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin' out and I'm hurtin'
No, no, no, no, no
I'm cryin' out and I'm hurtin'
150 on the dash, I'm movin' too fast
I'm panicking
Maybe I'll crash, I guess it depends how much mess I'm in
Love never lasts when we think
And it doesn't live long mistreated
If I realize that somewhere in my past
I'll finally be a better human
And I've been through many phases of you
All reminiscence, I hated the truth
I don't think I deserve your abuse
You tore me up but I'm changing
And you're just a whirlwind
And I'll pick up the pieces you've broken
You're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin' out and I'm hurtin'
No, no, no, no, no
And you're just a whirlwind
I'm cryin' out and I'm hurtin'Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
At times I wonder why I fool with you
But this is new to me, this is new to you
Initially, I didn't wanna fall for you
Gather my attention it was all for you, so don't
Take advantage, don't leave my heart damaged
To understand that things go a little bit better when you plan it... oh
So, won't you
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communicating
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through 
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
Send me wherever you were writin'
Send to me whatever you've been thinkin' 'bout
Won't be surprised if I'm feelin' the same way that you do
I'm a stranger to this all
Not a stranger to the fall
I just wish you wouldn't mind to call me back, no
Send me your location, let's
Focus on communication
'Cause I just need the time and place to come through, no
Send me your location
Let's ride the vibrations
I don't need nothing else but you
Should I throw in the towel or throw you vowels?
I've been, constantly tryin' to track you down
Smiley, I'm skin and teeth 'cause your skinnin' out
Give me neck, your neck'll spin like an owl, I'll spin you 'round
I.e., I felt your presence upon your entrance
They need attention, you need affection
My only sentence, I'll leave you breathless
If you're guilty that's a life full of diamonds without the pressures
And raccoon, you're in my circle, that's eternal, we're in the loop
Your ex is cussin', he's supposed to, that's an excuse
That's what they do... I follow through
So send me your location
'Cause I want your vibrations and frequencies
Only trees and seeds
I don't need nothing else but you
Nothing else but you
Do, do, do, do, do, do
Oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm, mmm
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, mmm, mmm, mmm
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
Do, do, do, do, do, do, do
I don't need nothing else but you          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        I knew this chick by the name of Vevorine
Who introduced me to the streets and put me on to the game
We did in the rain, on the hood of a Range
But Vevorine, had a special friend called Heroin
She told me, that's how she met Ray Charles and Marvin Gaye
But back then, I ain't gon' front, I was peddling 'caine
In the, form of crack, she said that was a no-no
Cause it's a poor man's Drug, and I will never give love
To how fast heroine, that's low as cocaine was
Martin had a dream, nigga, I did too
To make it out the hood, rich, bitch, off that stoop
So, I took it that thaw, and hit the street
With bundles of that ghetto love, to give it to kids
Momma said, never get high on your own supply
Especially if you plan to leave this hood bitch rich
Reminiscing on my past, damn it brings me to tears
See the more money that comes in, the more I disappear
Fresh to death, the latest kicks, rocking the latest gear
New Year's after the ball, twenty one song in they ear
Watch this strip, make me back it up, D'Angelo knows the feeling
Off that needles warm embrace, in a sexual healing
This tracks moves like the 70's, got me feeling great
Watching my pen nodding off, spilling words out on the
I'm scared to love, cause you remind me of my past
Baby, you gotta trust me, cause I gotta girl and you got a man
I don't want you to judge me, I just wanna be your friend
Baby, you gotta trust me...
Aiyo I live by the rules, trust nothing in skirts
Cause with that big butt and a smile, she be waiting to flirt
With a next man, a next hand, up under the skirt
Another dick in the jaw, more dick in the draws
While you home sleeping, she creeping, you thinking it's yours
That's just how women is, I reminisce
On when I had to learn from experience, why they call you a bitch
And I ain't the best, but I ain't never denied
Tell me what nigga, flow sicker, spit shit better than mine
The plot dope on these tracks, you get federal time
You get your wig pushed back, that clap metal with mine
I'm on the grind, I don't settle for mines, nigga
With this track, a broad, with a pack, before I peddle a dime
Line for line, whose the best artist, the rest y'all garbage
But it's awkward, it's ass backwards, they still spinning your garbage
It's me, blunt: the artist, y'all niggas is garbage
Sweat jackets velour, rap money, looking like crack money
Relax, money, niggas, it's raw, sweet aromatic
Backwood, fanatic nigga, this is Cali
Vigilante's tattered, in wife beaters and khakis
I'm taking over, cause y'all, cooking too much baking soda
B12, rock selling niggas vacation's over
Medallion's guaca', only rock a three piece suit
We're nver holdin' case the cops try to stop us
My henchmen behind me, in black benz's with big toppers
Get up on my life, nigga, the kid's proper
Wrist glint, the big shit, cult following fans be vixen
This is grown man business, pay attention
Or lay your position, fuck around and have a fatal collision
The moment where you should of made your decision
I made it, I'm living, I'm paid and I'm winning
From the aid of my wisdom, I created a systemMy ride or die
Let’s burn out tonight
Even if we don’t survive
We were right by being wrong
Don’t look back to the wreck
Stay with me, turn your head
This is it, all that's left
Just some times that we had, oh
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear
Ooh, ooh
And now the way you say
My name sounds like a song
That you've been singing all along
Don’t forget it once I'm gone
Oh, Heaven , make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here 
Heaven, if you come over
Oh, I know how to make us disappear
Heaven , make me an offer 
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out here 
Heaven, if you come over 
Oh, I know how to make us disappear
Heaven, make me an offer
Lord, there’s nothing for me left out hereYeah, I'd rather be a lover than a fighter
'Cause all my life, I've been fighting
Never felt a feeling of comfort
All this time, I've been hiding
And I never had someone to call my own, oh nah
I'm so used to sharing
Love only left me alone
But I'm at one with the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I'm in need of a savior, but I'm not asking for favors
My whole life, I've felt like a burden
I think too much, and I hate it
I'm so used to being in the wrong, I'm tired of caring
Loving never gave me a home, so I'll sit here in the silence
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been silent for too long
I've been quiet for too long
I found peace in your violence
Can't tell me there's no point in trying
I'm at one, and I've been quiet for too longLove to see you shine in the night like the diamond you are
I'm good on the side, it's alright, just hold me in the dark
No one's gotta know what we do, hit me up when you're bored
'Cause I live down the street so we meet when you need it, it's yours
All I hear is
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit, nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit, nothing feels better than this
(Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit, nothing feels better than this)
Say we're just friends but I swear when nobody's around
You keep my hand around your neck
We connect, are you feeling it now? 'Cause I am
I got so high the other night
Swear to God, felt my feet lift the ground, ooh, yeah
Your back against the wall, this is all you've been talking about
My ears
(Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better
Nothing feels better than this
Nothing feels better, oh no
We don't gotta hide, this is what you like
I admit, nothing feels better than this)
Nothing feels better than this

Spend my days countin' down
Time will pass, that I know
Whatcha done broke me down
Not alone, I’m vulnerable
Let you in, take good care
See the signs, crack the code
The time will pass, that I know
Love will grow like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Like a wildflower
Pull me in, then get close
Feel your heartbeat on mine
Where have you been? I've waited long
But now you're here, right on time
When it’s safe, they will pour
Who'll like to see you cry?
Take your hand, hold on mine
Love will burn like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower 
Like a wildflower
