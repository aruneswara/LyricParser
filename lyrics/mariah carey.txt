I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you, yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need 
Don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace 
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? 
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for 
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby Sweet love, yeah
I didn't mean it when I said I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight, I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing, I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting here beside myself
Guess I didn't know you, guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips 'cause I don't have a choice
Oh, what I wouldn't give to have you lying by my side
Right here, 'cause, baby
When you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio
Singing to me, "If you think you're lonely now"
Wait a minute, this is too deep, I gotta change the station
So I turn the dial, tryin' to catch a break
And then I hear Babyface, "I only think of you"
And it's breaking my heart
I'm tryna keep it together, but I'm falling apart
I'm feeling all out of my element, throwing things, crying
Tryin' to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song
Ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please, 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me on the phone till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please, 'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on when times get rough?
Who's gonna talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gonna take your place? There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby, baby, we belong togetherAh, ah, you’re beautiful 
Ah, ah, you’re beautiful
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby, do it again, yeah
You’re beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful
Good Lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh, how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful
Oh, you make me feel undressable
And I can’t pretend
That doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah
You’re beautiful
And your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend
That that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yes

Saying we up in your house, saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA, and I'm out at Jermaine's

I'm part of you indefinitely

No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I will always beHow 'bout you?
How 'bout you?
You took my love for granted
You left me lost and disenchanted
Bulldozed my heart as if you planned it
My prince was so unjustly handsome
Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Get the fuck out
Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye baby
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
 take your tings and be on your merry way
My friends all saw it in your eyes
They told me once, they told me twice
I looked beyond all the signs
I guess false love makes you blind, ay
Who was that knight in shining armor?
I could've sworn you'd love me harder
Might as well down this Caymus bottle
I ain't the type to play the martyr
How 'bout you get the fuck out? 
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
How about you get the fuck out?
Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby
Scusa mi, Mimi call you a valet
Take your tings and be on your merry way
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Stop telling me these lies when you're bluffing
How 'bout you get the fuck out?
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Don't mean to be rude, but take your shit and leave
Go stay at your friend's house or something
Go stay with your homeboys you was talking to
I ain't tryna be rude, but you're lucky
I ain't kick your ass out last weekend
Take your tings and be on your merry way
Fly off with the wind, bye bye, baby]

Mustard on that beat, ho
It was all so overwhelming
She was like, "I don't know, don't tell me"
He had eyes that said, "Girl, I'll save you"
She had doubts, like they might not make it
So they both held tight to face it
There were vows, she was bound to take 'em
She was full of such trepidation
There in front of the whole damn nation
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"
Ooh, shots of Remy
Playing Confessions, and our bodies blendin'
Ooh, I'm in love, it's true
Yeah, damn I fucks with you
And we all make mistakes sometimes
But we muddle through
I don't know what I'm supposed to do 
Oh baby, I'm in love, it's true
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
With you, you, you
Baby, I'm in love, it's true
Waves were breakin' on that shore
As we were sneakin' through that door
Had to leave by half past four
Still I yearned to touch you more and more
It was war, can't predict the comin' storm
Promise that you'll keep me warm
I don't wanna play this wrong
He said, "Yo, I've been lovin' you so long
Ever since that Bone Thugs song
You ain't gotta break down, you're too strong"
Ooh, shots of Remy

My temperature's through the roof
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do
If there's a camera up in here

'Cause if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
'Cause they be all up in my business like a Wendy interview
But this is private, 'tween you and I
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body
Boy, you can put me on you like a brand new white tee
I'll hug your body tighter than my favorite jeans
I want you to caress me like a tropical breeze
And float away with you in the Caribbean Sea
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gonna leave with me when I do, I do

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youYeah

'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
Uh-huh
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Uh-huh
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you wanna do
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby 
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?

I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
I'm all over ready
Okay, cool, alright
She wanna shop with Jay
Play box with Jay
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart 
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh why, did you have to run your game on me?
 I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly

 Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly

Run your game on me
I should have known right from the start

ReRe's got a new boyfriend 
ReRe and Kenny sitting in a tree
K-I-S-S-I-N-G
Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby

Ah, uh-huh, uh-huh, baby
Whoo!

I need him, I need him, I need him, I need him
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
I love him, I love him, I love him, I love him
I got myself a lover
Who knows what I like
When he invites me over
I come every time
And when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's
Delirium time
He's all mine
And his lovin' makes me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me 
All night long 
Loverboy, c'mon and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
I got myself a lover
And he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven
To feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy
Takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's
Delirium time
I get weak
When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me 
All night long
Loverboy, c'mon and take me 
Only you know how to make me 
Shudder with anticipation
All night long
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now
It's the same feeling
I always seem to get around you 
'Cause you affect me, you fascinate me
I thank heaven for the things that you do, oh
This stuff is starting now, oh
This stuff is starting now
This stuff is starting now, ooh
My eyes roll in my head
I toss and turn in my bed
In the morning when I think about you 
Simply put, you're the reason why 
Even though I'm real shy, it's like candy
I attempt to look my best for you, indeed I do, just for you
Loverboy, come on and love me
Give me more , touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
 Loverboy, come on and take me
 Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long
Loverboy, come on and love me 
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long
 Loverboy, come on and take me
 Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long
Loverboy, come on and love me 
Give me more, touch me and touch me 
I enjoy the way you rock me...Many nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now, we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seems like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
You will when you    believe
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small but still resilient voice says, "Help is very near!"
There can be miracles when you believe
Though hope is frail, it's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles you can achieve?
When you believe, somehow you will
Now, you will, you will when you believe
You will when you believe, just believe
Just believe, you will when you believeOoh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce
Check it out
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh
Everybody just
Everybody just bounce, bounce
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
Just like the Calgon commercial, I

Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy, I gotta 
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby, and that means I gotta
By the time you get this message, it's gonna be too late
So don't bother paging me 'cause I'll be on my way
See, I grabbed all my diamonds and clothes
Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me, baby
Hate to say I told you so
Well, at first I didn't know, but now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks and lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off
You'll never ever find a girl who loves you more than me
'Cause the loving ain't the same and you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay

On the beach, in the streets

Hold up my phone's breakin' up

I gotta get this off of my mind
You wasn't worth my time
So I'm leaving you behind
Yeah, 'cause I need a real love in my life
Save this recording because
I'm never coming back home
Baby, I'm gone, don't ya know?

How good it feels insideYou've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good
I feel nice
I've never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above

When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so

You called yesterday
To basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was OK
To just walk away from the one thing
That's unyielding and sacred to me
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
So what do you do when somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through?
Do you cling to your pride and sing "I Will Survive"?
Do you lash out and say: "How dare you leave this way"?
Do you hold on in vain as they just slip away?
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality, I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile, gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel 
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'till I go home at night
Then turn down all the lights and then I breakdown and cry
I'm gonna breakdown

Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
Break break down, steady breakin' me on down
(It'll break ya down, only if you let it
Every day crazy situation's rockin' my mind
Tryin' to break me down, but I won't let it, forget it)
I been feeling like your breaking me down
Kicking me around, stressing me out
I think you better go and get out
And let me release some stress, stress
(Don't ever wanna feel no pain, pain
Hoping for the sun but it looks like rain, rain, rain, rain
Lord, I just wanna maintain)
Yeah, I'm feeling pressures you all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you

In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love
TonightGet 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
They told me get 'em, I got 'em
I swear this word to my father
And the only way to make it to the top
If you go and get it from the bottom
And I have never asked for no hand outs
You won’t carry me, no Mariah
These haters love when I was dead broke
But they are not mad at me
I’m on fire and I’m going to burn
And I am not going to learn
I remember they said that it is not my turn
But it is not confirmed, then the tables turned
Just look at me now, try to hold me down
But I am not going to stop, because I’m going to climb
To the mountain top, to the mountain top, now let go
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Path that I chose flashing camera’s as I pose
Throwing big money as she dances on the pole
Lime green Lamborghini dances in the road
License still suspended, no I never stop for tolls
Born slick talker, twice a week shopper
Blow a hundred racks she don’t know a footlocker
Red bottom boss house big as Baltimore
With a blonde bombshell trying to bomb with your boy
In the James Bond Beamer chrome wheel two seater
Smoking like Pimp C, spoken like a trill nigga
On a cloudy day baby I can make it rain
Rubber band, 50 grand bet it brighten up your day
Came from humble beginnings
Then was Hummers and Benzes
Now it’s hundred and millions this is only the beginning
A don, a diva, the bomb achiever
The one believer, the game gets deeper
Can’t fall down stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toes, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Get 'em, get 'em, get 'em 
Hit 'em, hit 'em, hit 'em 
Can’t fall down now, so even when clouds surround you
And everyone seems to doubt you
Baby, still know who you are
So you got to keep on climbing
In spite of the chains that bind you
You can see the mountain top
It’s not too far
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall down
Can’t fall down, stay triumphant, keep on living
Stay on your toe, get off the ropes
Don’t let them ever count you out
Realize all things are possible
In your heart who’s the greatest
Reach for the stars, be all that you are
And make them all fall downWhy you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bag, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Name hold weight like kilos
Boy, you actin' so corny like Fritos
Wouldn’t have none of that without me though
Ain’t none of my business, it's tea though
Outta ammo, gotta reload
If life was a game, you're a free throw
It's nothing that you don’t already know
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
How I say this? Fact that you still exist
No disrespect, no second thought it truly, truly is
Truthfully I’m through with this
Why are we still doing this?
Answer the phone like, "Who is this?"
Take your head and knock some sense
Je ne comprends pas
Ain’t no compliments
Ain’t no being friends
Ain’t no false pretense
Ain’t no make amends
Ain’t no come against
That’s the story, ain’t no happy ends
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
Is it lack of ice got you so cold?
Have you ever felt this on your own?
Why you tryin' to play like you’re so grown?
Everything you own, boy, you still owe
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally
There’s an end to infinity
To infinity
To infinity
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
You're leaving, you're leaving, you're out the door
Infinity loving me more and more
'Cause I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
I believe infinity is more than just a made up dream
Infinity, infinity, infinityI ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn

No baby, no baby, no baby, no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby, yeah
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine 
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
So why you act like you don't know how this loving used to be?
I bet she can't do it like me, she'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you, babe
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about usLadies and Gentlemen...

But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey 
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey 
Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute
But I'm tired of crying
No more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playing with my mind
Told you I'm finished
Gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't 
Boy I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
See I used to love you
But I don't, I don't 
Boy I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't
I tried to make it work
No matter how much it hurt
You had to make it all about you
Tell me why you go and do me like you do
I went from me and you
To walking right out on you
I know you want love, in your feelings
Fronting on me like your love was the realest
And I'm tired of crying
No more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playing with my mind
Told you I'm finished
Gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't 
Boy I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
See I used to love you
But I don't, I don't 
Boy I was bugging
Thinking somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, I just got you ring, for what?
I put you in the game, now it's game over
Every time you went to the Louis store you got chauffeured
Hold up, how you gon' leave that?
Hold up, give me my ring back
Never mind, you can keep that
'Cause every time you look at your ring, me, you gon' dream that
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey

Take away them precious memories 
And I won't, and I won't, and I won't

But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Can we recover
Will the world ever be
A place of peace and harmony
With no war and with no brutality
If we loved each other
We would find victory
But in this harsh reality
Sometimes I'm so despondent
That I feel the need to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
He said He'll never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him
I need you Lord, I need you Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head up
With God's love you'll survive
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home

Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore

Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye 
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye
As a child, there were them times
I didn't get it, but you kept me in line
I didn't know why you didn't show up sometimes
On Sunday mornings, and I missed you
But I'm glad we talked through
All them grown folk things separation brings
You never let me know it
You never let it show because you loved me, and obviously
There's so much more left to say
If you were with me today, face-to-face
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by 
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face

Bye bye, bye bye When you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb to overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And I truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you're
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't overflowing steadily
I can't prevent this hurt from almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me 
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly, butterfly 
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Oh, fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly 
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Fly
Spread your wings and fly
ButterflyIt's like our first date
Time past fast, like the flash of a blink
A little Chardonnay, lingerie and a mink
All I could think 
So don't complain when I'm in home late
A couple loose lips and the ship gon' sink
Don't even try to act like your shit don't stink
But still... ASAP!
Hold up wait, hit both brakes
Fuck third base 'cus I hit home plate
I'mma party hard like the disco days
Fat black plaques and them french fold braid
Cause homie pack steel, like below waist
Shawty got grill, like Chipotle
Now my favorite meal be the shrimp lo mein
But still... 
Hop on the back of my bike
Let the good wind blow through your hair
With an ass like that and a smile so bright
Oh, you’re killing me, you know it ain’t fair, yeah
Ride on through the middle of the night
Let the moonlight kiss your skin
When you dance like that, your jeans so tight
Oh, you’re killing me, baby do it again
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
I like when you run red lights
Don’t stop ’til you thrill me, oh how you thrill me
Always in control, how you do it, I don’t know
But I don’t care, take me anywhere
‘Cause it’s beautiful, ooh you make me feel invincible
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, oh yeah
You’re beautiful, and your mind is fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah
You’re beautiful, good lord, you’re fucking beautiful
And I can’t pretend that that doesn’t mean a thing to me, to me, yeah, yeah
Oh oh oh oh
Yeah yeah
You don’t know what you’re doing darling
Hop on back my bike darling
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh
Don’t you worry darlingTreated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to beIt wasn't raining yet
But it was definitely a little misty on
That warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked in the room
And I was twisted in the web of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet
And started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me in your arms
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and the pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night, I dreamed that I
Whispered the words "I love you, boy"
And touched you so very
Subtly as we were kissing goodbye
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy nightHey, baby, what's happenin'? How you doin'?
We can make it, baby, me and you
It wasn't really, wasn't really
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really
So, it's summertime, lil splash a wine
And forget about it
If you're so inclined, let's take a ride tonight
So, then maybe if the stars align
We'll fix our minds on another tangent
And it's kinda like impossible to top this at all
Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be
It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all
It wasn't really, it wasn't really
Wasn't really much at all
Oh, my philosophy
Doesn't quite apply to you and me
But I won't think too much
So, come on and feel my touch
It wasn't really much at all
Just a little sensitivity, yeah that's all
Here in my heart is where you should be
Ooh, you are
Giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen
Here in my arms is where you should be
It wasn't really, it wasn't really much
It wasn't really much at all 
It wasn't really, it wasn't really 
Wasn't really much at all
Wassup, ma? Hush, got fly
Here's a quest, why you left? Was it my messed up eye? Why?
Reminisce, wannabe, huh?
See, hon, followed sheep from once the first chick
Clark Wallabees on 
Swag, honey drip, spendin' some time
Remember them rhymes?
Your gold fronts looked better than mines did
Was ecstasy, poundin' in the BM
Clownin' me and that was way before wore gowns and the skin'
Givin' me life
Giving me life and it's everything 
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feelin' myself like I'm Norma Jeane 
Here in my arms is where you should be 
Ooh, you are giving me life 
And it's everything 
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Livin' like Babs 'cause it's evergreen 
Here in my arms is where you should be
Ooh, you are giving me life and it's everything
Thinkin' 'bout when we were seventeen
Feeling myself like I'm Norma Jeane
Here in my arms is where you should be 
Giving me life and it's everything
It was a stone groove, my man
You are the most righteous
Yeah, right, just get the fuck out
(Get the fuck out, get the fuck out
Get the fuck out, get the fuck out)
Oh, oh, oh-oh, oh
Giving me life and it's all 
Giving me life, da-da-da, yeah 
Giving me life and it's all 
Giving me life and it's all 
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Giving me life and it's all
Whoa, whoa-whoa
Giving me life and it's all
Oh, giving me life and it's allDon't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over, over
Don't breakdown yet, it's over
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
Break-breakdown
Steady breaking me on down
You called yesterday to basically say
That you care for me but
That you're just not in love
Immediately I pretended to be feeling similarly
And led you to believe I was O.K. to just walk away
From the one thing that's unyielding and sacred to me
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel and I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry
So what do you do when
Somebody you're so devoted to
Suddenly just stops loving you
And it seems they haven't got a clue
Of the pain that rejection is putting you through
Do you cling to your pride
And sing "I Will Survive"
Do you lash out and say
How dare you leave this way
Do you hold in vain
As they just slip away
Well, I guess I'm trying to be nonchalant about it
And I'm going to extremes to prove I'm fine without you
But in reality I'm slowly losing my mind 
Underneath the guise of smile
Gradually I'm dying inside
Friends ask me how I feel 
And I lie convincingly
'Cause I don't want to reveal the fact that I'm suffering
So I wear my disguise 'til I go home at night
And turn down all the lights
And then I breakdown and cry
Gonna break you down, down, down, only if you let it 
Everyday crazy situations rocking my mind trying to break me down
But I won't let it, forget it
If you feel the same way that I do
Then let me hear y'all all sing too
Sing, it's al-right, it's alright, it's alright, yeah
Hoping for the sun, but it looks like rain
B-O-N-E, but it's still the same
Came this far, but it's been a long road
Troubles gonna come but we gotta stay strong, hold on, on
Aw, yeah, I often feel the pressures, y'all
But nevertheless Krayzie won't fall
It's over, it's ending here, here
I said it's over, it's ending here, here
So I'll be on my way
And maybe we can meet up in the future one day
But for now I'm bailing, bailing
Bailing!, baby gotta get up, can't take no more
I'm headed for the door
Come and take a look into this humble eye
Tell me, if we lived a lie would our souls unite?
Every new day is a test for me
So I just pray to the Lord for him to bless me, please
There's struggles I'm going through lately
Breaks me down, set me free
Let me be, let me be
Who else do we have to rely on
Whose shoulder can a thug go cry on
Came to get my vibe on
While you look into my eyes
Won't underestimate this soldier story
I'mma tell you right now I'mma stand up
Wrong if I let my lead bust
Pac said keep your head up
Don't let this world get the best of you
All my struggles, I'm through
If it's over, over, over
Don't breakdown yet it's over
Cry, cry 
Cry, cry 
Cry, cry 
Cry, cry Uh, yeah, Cluemanati
MC to the J-O-E

Let's make it last forever
For the world
Make it real, baby
Uh, Desert Storm, baby
Uh, check it
Thank God I found you
This for you
Let's show the world you're my golden girl
When we shoppin', they see us on the streets
They say, "Son, scooped a hot one"
You taste like banana cake
You shaped like the number eight 
And you my number one candidate
I can't lose you, it's like I'm bettin' in Vegas, crucial
Sweatin', knowin' these players is wantin' you, Boo
I get the chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
Thank God I found you
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see, your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, oh
Hmm, I'ma be here night after night to
Feel your loving arms around me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make it alright
No one but you, baby, can make me feel
The way you make me, make me, make me feel, oh

Your touch is wonderful 
Your love is so marvelous
Joy, that's what I feel
When I'm with you, yeah

Could compare to what we have 
Love, it feels so good

Thank God I found you
What? A thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matching brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In beef I become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'ma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
In our bubble north faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin', boo, the type I give my last name to
Make it last
At Lover's Lane, put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows, gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to Will, that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus
Thank God I found you
Thank God I found you, thank you, Lord
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Whoa, oh, oh, oh, oh, don't you let it end
Make it last, oh baby
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
See, I was so lost without your love
I was lost without you
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
My every wish and dreams became reality
Thank God I found you
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last
Oh, oh, oh, oh

We make it last, make it last, 2000
Make it last

He hit my girl, word? Oh that's what you heard? 
He know he a bird, I know he a nerd 
Catch me in the A with a bad yellow bone

Say we up in your house
Saying I'm up in your car
But you in LA and I'm out at Jermaine's

Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows

 O holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
'Til He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night
O night divine
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine, yeah
O night when Christ was born
O night divine
O night divine 
Ooh, yes it was 
Oh, it is the night of our dear Savior's birth 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Yeah, it is 
It was a long night, long night, long night
Oh, oh, oh, woah, woah, woah, yes it was I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
That cigarette, put it out, put it out
Keep lookin' my way, turn around, turn around
This is a moment you can't buy
I see that longing in your eyes
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
Tell me what that means to you
If it was me that was by your side
Limitless, without no rules
Nothin' to lose
Never no pressure
Just put yourself into my shoes
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life
I'm a confirmation, should you feel unsure
I'm that security when you're insecure
I'll be that baby girl when you're immature
Don't be ambivalent towards me
Somethin' is tellin' me you're ready, am I wrong?
Maybe the lyrics are too heavy in my song
How would you feel if you had me, then I was gone?
Better not be leadin' me on
I'm not your world
No, I'm not your life

Oh, oh
Honey got me hooked on you
I like that
I thought I told you, oh
That we won't stop
Oh 
All the money in the world couldn't even amount
To a teaspoon of honey when it melt in your mouth 
It's The LOX and Mariah as you check'n us out
You know they deal, a few mil every time she come out
With her blowin', and us flowin'
There ain't nuthin' left for us to talk about
But a whole lot of dough
]
And every current affair, we there
Keepin' your hands in the air like we just don't care 
Don't be a liar, would you change your attire? 
Get a farm like Hillshire wit the honey like Mariah
Scape to the ranch and ride a horse
Then come back to the city pushin' a Rolls Royce
]
Oh honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there 
And you're the only one who makes me come runnin'
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare, oh
]
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin'  for ya, cryin'  for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
]
I can't be elusive with you, honey 
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you 
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby, I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another taste of your honey 
You know Ma$e huff, we puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem World sound directly to your town
In fact, this is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single and made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well 'cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot, I get 'em from the shop
Buy them everything they got, from the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta meet me, wanna spoil you with my riches
And you could tell that Mase is real 'cause he do real things
And I make things that's average look real mean
When it comes to sex, I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth, I hear you still scream
Harlem World, we won't stop, Mariah, you're fire
Harlem World, we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher
Harlem World, we won't stop, Mariah, you're on fire
Harlem World, we won't stop, so Mariah, take us higher

 Ooh, whoa 
Every little thing you do
 
Ooh, whoa, honey, got me hooked on you
Honey, it's like
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet

One hit of your love addicted me

Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, can't describe
How good it feels insideI shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything OK
But we just threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces, curled on the floor
Supernatural love conquers all
'Member we used to touch the sky
And lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe, can't our love be revived?
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry
I thought we'd be forever and always
You were serenity, you took away the bad days
Didn't always treat you right, but it was OK
I do somethin' stupid and you still stay with me
But you can only go for so long
Doing the one you claim to love wrong
Before too much is enough
You look up, find your love gone and
We were so good together
How come we could not weather
This storm and just do better
Why did we say goodbye?
]
'Cause lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Baby, I'm missing you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Baby, I'm missing' you
Don't allow our love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
And I'm gonna say
Lightning don't strike the same place twice
When you and I said goodbye, I felt the angels cry
'Cause true love's a gift, we let it drift in a storm
Every night, I feel the angels cry
Oh, babe, don't let angels cryI gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm older, hey
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
I'm gonna take a little time 
A little time to look around me 
I've got nowhere left to hide 
It looks like love has finally found me 
In my life, there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've travelled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is 
And I know you can show me
Show me, I wanna know
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is 
And I know you can show me, hey, yeah
I wanna know what love is
Let's talk about love
I want you to show meOh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Where do I go from here?
How do I disappear?
Here beyond the looking glass
Somewhere off the beaten path
Heartache never seems to pass, just lasts
And I'd go
Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay real close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life
La da da da da
La da da da da
Somewhat desensitized
Still the same hopeful child
Haunted by those severed ties
Pushing past the parasites
Down but not demoralized
Unconfined, but don't let go
Yes I know that tomorrow comes
So I'll be here when you rise 
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
A portrait of my life
And for the finale, she can float around effortlessly
And dream away the hours in her mind
And I let go
Yet I know that tomorrow comes, so I'll be here when you rise
Stay here close and the moment will subside
Look the other way as I bottle myself up inside
I won't let the teardrops spill tonight
Just conceal myself and hide
This portrait of my life Did you like when I put my lips there?
 'Cause I like when you kissin' me everywhere
 Do you mind if we go back in 
One mo' gen? 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen?
You give me that fever I ain't tryna break
Been a little while but I don't mind to wait
I'm gon' need a ride home now, sooner than later
Must I reiterate? Can we pick up the pace?
And once we lit this towering inferno 
The flame keeps burning higher hotter we go 
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely
Come and give me what you owe me, yeah, yeah
 Did you like when I put my lips there?
 'Cause I like when you kissin' me everywhere
 Do you mind if we go back in 
One mo' gen? 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen 
Yeah-yeah, yeah-yeah, one mo' gen
Can we just get it in one mo' gen? 
Ain't no use in being stingy with it
If you think you're gettin' off, forget it
And if you think it ain't all for you, you're wrong
Baby, it's all for you
Addicted to you, come support my habit
Third person, yeah she gotta have it
If you think I'm on call for you, you're right
Baby, I'm on to you
And once we lit this towering inferno 
The flame keeps burning higher hotter we go 
And the temperature is rising, crack a window
Let's be the opposite of lonely

Mais uma vez
One mo' gen, one mo' gen, one mo gen'I just can't wait, yeah
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need 
And I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake
To hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holdin' on to me so tight
What more can I do?
'Cause, baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh-ho, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing, I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need?
Won't you please bring my baby to me? Yeah
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just wanna see my baby, yeah
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you, baby
It's all I want for Christmas, baby
All I want for Christmas is you
It's all I want for Christmas
All I want for Christmas is you
It's all I want baby, yeah yeah

All I want for Christmas is you, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, babyThe way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway
They'll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won't be about who was wrong who was right
Like fireflies emanating the light
Just you and I universally tied
There's truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly gotta have no fear
First they love you, like ooo it’s just you
And then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there's only one you
And there's a God up above you
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to
Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway
There's a band of color that reflects the love you have inside
And you will discover there is solace though you’re terrified
And I promise there is truth for those who really want to hear
If you wanna touch the sky and fly you’ve got to have no fear
First they love you and then they judge you
And try and chain you and then they drain you
You can push through it stay the same you and
Never let 'em bring you down
Remember there’s only one you
And here's a God up above you 
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to
Let love be your runway
There is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway
Runway, runway...
Runway, runway...
Runway, runway...
Runway, runway...
Let love be your runway
There is a higher place 
Just embrace that feeling when you're rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race keep kissing the horizon
Runway...
Runway...
Just shake off those demons that you're fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway
The way it feels to flyWe're all in this together
You're my only hope
And it's too divided, too deep to understand
But if we don't do it, tell me, who will?
Oh, we always say these words that don't mean too much
I wonder, where is the love?
It's curious
The fear still holding us down
One day, will we look up?
You got a right to your own opinion
But when it comes to the world we live in
Isn't it time that we start rebuilding
All of the things that have basically crumbled?
We all tend to forget that
We all cease to exist if
Wе all live for ourselves
If nobody bothеrs to find a solution
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day, woah, oh
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day
We're all in this together
You're my only hope 
And it's too divided, too deep to understand
But if we don't do it, tell me, who will? Yeah
Always say these words that don't mean too much
I wonder, where is the love?
It's curious
That fear still holding us back
One day, will we look up?
It's up to us
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day, woah, oh
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't 
 We won't ever learn to save the day
La-la-la, la, la-la, la
Woah, la
Woah, la 
La
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't
We won't ever learn to save the day, woah, oh 
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't 
We won't ever learn to save the day, woah, oh 
If he won't, and she won't, and they won't, then we won't 
We won't ever learn to save the day 
We gon' learn, we gon' learn
Said we gotta learnI had it all but I let it slip away
Couldn't see I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly, I'm so incomplete
Lord, I need you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be here
I don't wanna be here alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do
And I feel that you do, inside
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was so blind to let you go
I can't escape the pain inside
Because love takes time
I don't wanna be there
I don't wanna be there aloneThat summer... the summer '88 is the best...
But that's your nostalgia though
"Just for the nostalgia," you gotta say
That's my most nostalgic moment of hip-hop music ever
Right
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to ya
I won't fool ya, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that lovemaking we did, boy
It was so real I wanna feel that again
Long lost friend from way back when
Eric B was president
Tell me where the melody went
And if you still care, say yeah, yeah, yeah
Sing it like I used to do, this one is for me to you, oh
La di da di da di da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
Oh baby you know
Make love, that’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
Well, this is dedicated to you
I'll just sit right here and sing that good old school shit to ya
I won't fool ya, I won't make you be my own
Oh baby you know, all that love making we did
Boy it was so real I wanna feel that again
And all your friends from way back then
Tell me can you visualize
36 Chambers high
It feels like we’re there, yeah yeah yeah
Remix of a Fantasy, I hear ‘em singing back to me like
La di da di da di da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
Oh baby you know
Make love, that’s how you do it
Just like you did it back then
Well, this is dedicated to you
Nah, we don’t wish today’s game was old again
We just wish it wasn’t full of Draconian, Babylonian, phony men
FOH my summation fascinates, we have debates
Who’s the greatest, living or passed away
I ask MC, see what she has to say
Eric B or Master P, some see it differently
‘87 meant to me? I try to describe it, you try to relive it
I try to revive it, hoping that you get it, yeah
Something about "La Di Da Di" got inside our bodies
Something about "My Adidas" coming out the speakers
Used to do Doo-wop or the Pee-Wee Herman
Rest in peace Heavy D, "Moneyearnin’ Mount Vernon"
Let’s go
La di da di da di da
That's how you do it
That's how to make it okay
Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
Oh baby you know
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
This is dedicated to you
Oh baby you knowLying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind?
We sailed on together, we drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
Arms
Yeah, yeah
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you
Wanting you near
How much I wanted you home
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I come to you with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see
What your love means to me
Open arms
ArmsWhen you get caught in the rain
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught
And in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's okay
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I'll make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh, yes you can
Oh, you're gonna make it through the
Rain]
Uh, you're thirsty

Chasing them bright lights
Even change your name
Say you a boss now
Ain't nothing out your range
Well almost anything
You used to be Mister all-about-we
Now you’re just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords and act like you see
You thirsty for a dream
Leaving me drowning

Filled with discontent
Finding you can’t quench
Why you try so damn hard

Thinking you a G now 
Boy you just looking thirsty
See your name in lights
And dream of fancy cars
Like superstars
You don’t know who you are
That VIP
Too far for you to see
Outside the club
Adding me constantly
Can’t get the re back
'Cause boy, you’re thirstyOne dark night
Something said, "Follow the light"
So you look up and see the word
That's written upon the sky
Strong and wise
Keeping the Lord as your guide
And through the doubt, you realize
He's with you all the while
Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Shining bright
The spirit of love at first sight
And when the door won't welcome you
Heaven will help you inside
Gathered 'round
Bearing the gifts to the crown
A miracle comes, the babe is born
And angels are heard on high
Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow that voice you heard that no one else believed
Follow the dream that brought the King on Christmas Eve, oh
Follow that star above you
Should the world try to break you down
There is one who waits for you
Though you can't see him now
Thunder and rain surrounds you
But His love's just a breath away
If you follow the voice, follow the song
Follow the word that makes you strong
Follow your heart, follow the light
Follow that... star
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's Christmas
Follow your heart, it's ChristmasI need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, baby
I want a lover who knows me
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights
'Till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
I don't want another pretender
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind
I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Every day
Of my life
Always
So come and take me away
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down 
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you please come around? 
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
I need you so, I need you so
Take me up
Come on, baby
With you, babyEver since you left me
I've been trying to hide the pain
Painting on a smile with lipstick
Putting on a big charade
So difficult to keep pretending
It's getting harder everyday
It's plain to see I'm cold and heartsick
Since you turned and walked away
I just keep going 'round and 'round
And 'round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
Saturday I saw you
Holding hands with someone new
Somehow I kept my composure
Just like everything was cool
But inside I kept repeating
Don't you let them see you cry
So I casually turned my head
As the tears rolled down my eyes
I just keep going 'round and 'round
And 'round in circles
Keep on tumbling down
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
Nothing's the same
You got me running around in circles over you
Everything is you
How can I pull through?
My heart is consumed, I'm so confused
Still caught up in you, love can be so cruel
Baby, don't know how to turn you loose
Oh boy, my world has changed
And I don't think I can make it without you
No, nothing's the same
You got me running around
And running around
And running around
Nothing's the same
Baby, baby, 'cause you
Got me running around in circles over you
Yeah, yeah, yeahOh, whoa, whoa, whoa
Would you mind, would you mind?
I like the way you're movin'
Come fill me with your music, yeah, yeah
Do you mind if I try?
I like the way you're movin'
Control me, make me lose it, ayy, yeah
Would you mind? Would you mind, baby?
How you want it? How you want it?
Tell me how you want it
Hot as mama's cookin' in the kitchen during summer
'Cause if you want it I could serve it, come and get it
Won't you let me clean the plate and do the dishes?
All that I want is to be all you need
Baby, in fact
Ooh, your good lovin' did something to me
You make me, make me wanna
Touch you right there
You make me, make me wanna
Kiss you over there
You make me, make me wanna

Wanna stay long, love you
I got your back, I wouldn't front 
I came that night, you know I want it 
I wake up to you in the morning 
And eat that pussy up for lunch 
And I take care you like a son 
Heard they would talk but not on Sunday
Every day she help me count the money
Bought her diamonds just to match with the Chanel purse 
We stick together, we can take over the whole world 
I know you expectin' it straighter than an S-curl 
You constantly winning and shittin' on my ex-girl 
You make me, make me wanna

Yo, what's happening?
What you crying for?
Now you know you look too damn good to be crying
Come here, holla at a playa
DPG style, you know, you know
When I think of our untimely end
And everything we could have been
I cry, baby, I cry
]
Okay, so it's five AM and I still can't sleep
Took some medicine, but it's not working
Someone's clinging to me and it's bittersweet
'Cause he's head over heels, but it ain't that deep
I finally changed my number, got a different pager
Then last Saturday your cousin called
To say you're trying to reach me
Probably because you see that I'm with someone new 
]
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes, so that he won't know
I still cry baby, over you and me
]
Sipping Bailey's Cream, by the stereo 
Trying to find relief on the radio 
I'm suppressing the tears
But they start to flow
'Cause the next song I hear is the song I wrote
When we first got together early that September
I can't bear to listen, so I might as well drift
In the kitchen pour another glass or two
And try to forget you 
]
Late at night like a little child
Wandering 'round alone in my new friend's home
On my tippy toes  so that he won't know
I still cry, baby, over you and me
Baby, hear me when I say
"Let that man be on his way"
Don't even waste your time
And worry 'bout how he handle things
Baby, hear me when I say
"A playa feeling good today"
You know you're too fly to even waste your time
Watch how I handle things
Man, you's a fool for this
But on the real dog, I'm cool with this
We doing this
D-O double G Z-Y
Kiss the girls and make them cry

On my tippy toes, so that he won't know

I don't get no sleep
I'm up all week
Can't stop thinking of you and me
And everything we used to be
It could have been so perfect
Still I cry, I cry, I cry
Oh, I gotta get me some sleep
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry
Baby and I cry, cry, cry, cry

Wahoo
Just play the record, Clue
Guess who's back in the motherfucking house
With two big tig ol' bitties for your mouth?
Heartbreakers must parttake of the sensation
So So Def and Clue, hits in the making
Oh, guess who dropping the five-double-o
Like yippy yi, yippy yo, yay
When I talk smack y'all better skip back
Like here we go
'Cause the bitch don't play
Boy, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do the things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leaving me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me? 
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Give me some real love
Need someone to give me some real love
Need someone  to give me some real love
Need someone to give me some real love
Why when I met ya that night, baby
I didn't know it wouldn't last
I give my love to you, honey
Wish I could take it all back
See, I have never met a guy
That was better at telling lies
Should've known you'd break my heart
If Da Brat gave a fuck about a nigga
My heart would be broke
Shoulda known you were star struck
When I let you stroke
My guard was up in the beginning
But then I gave you my heart and you broke it again
I'm a fool when you smile at me, I'm convinced
I get caught in you and I just can't resist
I know you lie to me
It just drives me nuts
That one kiss could persuade me to believe your bluffs
You set it up, impress me with gifts and rings
I wish love was dollars, 'cause money ain't a thing
Clue-minati and MC move the party
I got a .42 calibur ready to blaze somebody
It's that dumb as you
It's that for each member of my crew
In fact, I'ma heart-break you
Now you flat on your back
You really don't know
So I'd advise you not to trust me yo
Baby, I'm the real thing 
So why you got me sweating you consistently, baby? 
Baby, I got that good thing
So why you making love to me? You crazy, baby
I like the way he used to spank me
He used to lie me on my back take that
He used to have me in the sack, legs back
But now, he be buggin' lately
Hey boy, why you actin' stanky? 
I keep it stiff like wood, baby 
So if you wanna keep a good lady
You need to stop with all the heartbreaking
 Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
That you'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me 
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start 
You'd go and break my heart
Heartbreaker, you've got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantlyYou made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget?
Baby, we were the best
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
Baby, I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Oh, you got me feelin' some type of way
Ain't no you without me, hope you feel the same
'Cause if there's no you, there's no me, ain't no us, ain't no we
That just can't be, don't you see?
Mariah, Trigga, M-I-N-E
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine
You made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget?
Baby, we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
Baby, I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want too badly?
Wanted to let you have me
Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crushed me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly?
Now I'm lying here, falling apart
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine
]
 You made me feel
Our love would never end
 How can I forget?
Baby, we were the best 
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
I suffer dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
It's Valentine's day and I'm feeling this way
Man, I really just hope I don't kill myself
Stop all this shit that you talkin'
You talkin', you talkin' like you done found somebody else
Stop that, stop that
Girl, don't you know that it's mine, mine?
I might just need to remind
Slide up in there from behind
Oh, you got me feelin' some type of way
Ain't no you without me, hope you feel the same
'Cause if there's no you, there's no me, ain't no us, ain't no we
That just can't be, don't you see?
Mariah, Trigga, M-I-N-E
Oh, you made me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me, how can I forget that?
My baby, we were the best
I suffer in dreams of you all through the night
And baby, I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mineWhen you left, I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please, 'cause we belong together
Haha, remix, Desert Storm

Uh, yo, show your respect whenever you hear me or see me
Hot like the real fever, the real diva
So successful, yet still so eager
No matter what they say, it's on forever
 more than ever
 we gon' get it on together
And M-C, you know we belong together
I lost a part of me
When you left boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please, 'cause we belong together
Who I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together
I only think of you on two occasions
That's day and night
I'd go for broke if I could be wit you
Only you can make it right, make it right, make it right

We belong together like the sun in the summertime
Bounce in a lemon range 
 Mariah on the other line
Baby, I'ma come back 
Februaries and skellies, after parties and tellies
Baby, I'ma come back with every part of you ready
I lost a part of me
When you left boy, can't you see?
Boy, come back, baby, please, 'cause we belong together
Who I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there
Oh, baby, baby, we belong together

I can't sleep at night when you are on my mind
Bobby Womack's on the radio singing to me
If you think you're lonely now, wait until tonight
Boy, I'm feeling all out of my element
Throwing things, crying, trying to figure out where the hell I went wrong
The pain reflected in this song, ain't even half of what I'm feeling inside
I need you, need you back in my life, baby

You gonna need a shoulder to cry on
Classic Mustang Cobra to ride on
Past is the past, just let it be bygone's
Matter of fact, I know a fly song that we could vibe on
Let's get it straight
If it's the six or the quarter to eight
Yeah and Kiss, Ghost and MC
Get close and toast to the diva and MC's
 Take it easy, you
 naw
I lost a part of me
When you left boy, can't you see
Boy, come back, baby, please, 'cause we belong together
Who I gon' lean on when times get rough?
Who's gon' to talk to me till the sun comes up?
Who's gon' take your place, there ain't nobody there

This is, Desert Storm remix, ha ha 
DJ Clue, Desert Storm 
 MC
 Woo
Is it so hard to believe 
We back, babyI remember when you used to be mine
Way back when
I was too naive to love you right
But now if I only had the opportunity
I would do anything
Because my heart still believes
Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life
It's irrelevant to dwell on the past
I'm accountable for what went bad
And I mean that
But I keep on praying for another chance
Just to have you back
Because I've grown
And I know how to be your everything
Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Maybe we could bring it back to life
No, no, it ain't over yet
I just can't accept the possibility
We weren't made for each other's arms
I know you're my destiny
We can't erase what was meant to be
Part of you and part of me
If we try one more time
Maybe somehow we'll survive
Maybe you could be mine again
Maybe we could make that dream for real
Like way back then
When love was yours and mine
Boy, maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back
Maybe we could bring it back to
Life
Maybe you could be mineOh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Ooh-ooh
La la la
Oh, oh-oh
Oh-oh
Once upon a time, we swore not to say goodbye
Something got a hold of us and we changed
Then you sat alone in pride
And I sat at home and cried
How'd our fairytale just end up this way?
We went 'round for 'round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye?
I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off 
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you
Ooh, this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night
Wanna pause it, but I can't make it stay 
We went 'round for 'round 'til we knocked love out
We were laying in the ring, not making a sound
And if that's a metaphor of you and I
Why is it so hard to say goodbye? 
I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off 
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you
No need to call my phone 'cause I changed my number today
And matter fact - I think I'm moving away 
Sorry, the frustration's got me feeling that way
And I just keep having one last thing to say
And I just wanna hold you, touch you, feel you, be near you
I miss you, baby, baby, baby 
I'm tired of tryin' to fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy, I can't wait to hate you
I can't wait to hate you, make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off 
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
I can't wait to face you, break you down so low
There's no place left to go
I can't wait to hate you, baby You look in my eyes
And I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy
But you still can touch my heart
And after all this time
You'd think that I
I wouldn't feel the same
But time melts into nothing
And nothing's changed
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dream
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
Each day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy I could find
You know that I
I'm not the desperate type
If there's one spark of hope
Left in my grasp
I'll hold it with both hands
It's worth the risk of burning
To have a second chance
No, no, no, no, no, no, I need you, baby
I still believe that we can be together
Whoa, oh, no, no, no, ooh
If we believe that true love never has to end
Then we must know that we will love again, mmm
Ohh
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again 
I had a dream, you and me
Will find ourselves in love again, yeah
I still believe 
Someday you and me 
In love again, yeah
I had a dream 
Someday you and me 
Will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe
Someday you and me
Will find ourselves in love again
I had a dreamOh, ooh ooh ooh
Oh, ooh ooh
Oh-oh, ooh ooh ooh
Why do I stay, why do I stay in love? Ooh
Oh, ooh ooh ooh 
Oh, ooh ooh 
Oh-oh, ooh ooh ooh 
Baby, I stay in love with you
Dying inside 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up, can't take this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is, baby, I try and try so hard to keep our love alive
If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it 
From our hearts and minds and I know
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down 
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na
Baby, I stay in love with you
It cuts so deep, it hurts down to my soul
My friends tell me I ain't the same no more
We still need each other when we stumble and fall
How we gonna act like what we had ain't nothing at all now?
Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down, like we used to
Hit the block, proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone
Now go, I know
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down 
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down

We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze
And I'm so shy 
A bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high
As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Oh-oh 
Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you 
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye 
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting
To another state of mind 
And imagined I was yours and you were mine 
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Lay underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
I was drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars, baby, babyI shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything ok
But we just
Threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all
'member we used to touch the sky
And
Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Limitless omnipresent
Kind of love couldn't have guessed
It would just up and disappear in
The whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope
Wobbling but won't let go
Waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow
I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane
It's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby we can get back that shine
'Cause
Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry
Come on baby, can our love be revived
Bring it back and we're gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry
Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Lighting don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it slip
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry & both]

And saying I'm the one you need
To keep you warm
And lay with you tonight
Baby I feel the same way
I don't want to leave
Wanna hold you close
And feel your love inside
But I don't wanna play myself
'Cause I know you're with someone else
And I don't need complications in my life
And I don't wanna fall back in
And get caught up in you again
Boy I'm so conflicted in my mind
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you
Till the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love
Obviously, procrastinating just to be
Close to you a little longer now
It's hard for me
To break away from you baby
Never could resist you
And I still haven't learned how
And I don't wanna be a fool
But it's hard when it comes to you
And I'm feeling vulnerable tonight
'Cause I don't wanna miss the chance
Of reliving our sweet romance
Boy, I'm so confused down deep inside
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you til the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love
You keep saying stay the night
Just let me rock you til the morning light
It's cold outside
And much too late to drive
You know I need you baby
I'm so lost without your love
Oh, you keep on saying
And you keep on saying baby 
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying baby
And you keep on saying baby baby baby baby, oh 
And you keep on, keep on, keep on saying baby 
And you keep on saying stayYou need to go
Don't look so surprised
'Cause we had love that won't be immortalized
Say you need me now
So alone without me now
But our lil romance is through
Because basically boy you
You just don't know what to do
I can give it to you, but what you gonna do
With it if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
But sucking your teeth, don't fuck up my mood
I'm trying to give it all to you
I can understand it's things we go through
Put C's on your bag, let's see this here through
And we can be as high as receipts from Nobu
But I gotta get it out of you
She said "'le' throw a ring on it"
She don't love you unless she put your whole name on it
Gettin' money at this age is hard
Not the datin', I act a way
When all the pretty bitches love you for your stage presence
I miss you almost half as much as you miss me
You used to act so tough, for your insecurity
Now that I found myself you're aching to be mine
Can't even help yourself from playing the fool each night
Ooo... how I loved you
Ooo... how I needed you
Ooo... boy I feel brand new
Ooo... since you turned me lose
Baby
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
First you wanna leave
Then you never go
I'mma set you free, boy
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You love me more than you love sunny summer days
And even more than you love floating in a haze
Boy when you lost my heart, you lost everything
Now all that you can do is listen to me sing
Ooo... how I loved you
Ooo... how I needed you
Ooo... boy I feel brand new
Ooo... since you turned me lose
Boy
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do 
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
First you wanna leave
Then you never go
I'mma set you free, boy
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
I can give it to you, but what you gon' do
With it, if I hit it, I bet you stuck, stoop
And the motto I got, no class in this school
Take your bags and go boo
Never mind all of the flexin' I do
Balenciagas, got me two steppin' on smooth
Never will I lower my standards, my boo
I could show you where a ten is like Sampras on cue
That’s kinda funny cause love still means lose
Unless we kill a racquet in back-and-forth moves
Somehow you keep showing your Agassi do it
Did you catch it all, screw it
All the girls need is respect and I do it
Never catch feelings cause jets is my fuel
Giuseppe my foot, my sweats be En Noir
So sexy, they ain't sweating me, I bet you ain't know her
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
First you wanna leave
Then you never go
I'mma set you free, boy
Baby, you don't know
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what, you don't know what
You don't know what to do
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know
You don't know
You don't know what to do to me
You don't know what to do to me

By incredible Jackson 5
And it's always been one of my favorite songs
And I hope it's yours
It's called, "I'll be there"
You and I must make a pact
We must bring salvation back
Where there is love
I'll be there
I'll reach out my hand to you
I'll have faith in all you do
Just call my name
And I'll be there
I'll be there to comfort you
Build my world of dreams around you
I'm so glad I found you
I'll be there with a love so strong
I'll be your strength
You know I'll keep holding on
Let me fill your heart
With joy and laughter
Togetherness, well it's all I'm after

If you should ever find someone new
I know she'd better be good to you
'Cause if she doesn't
I'll be there
Don't you know baby, yeah, yeah
I'll be there

Just call my name
And I'll be there

You know I'll be there
Just call my name
And I'll be there
Just look over your shoulder
Just call my name
And I'll be there
Thank youIt's 2:11 and I'm stressing
Watching TV in my hotel suite
I check my service every second
At 2:10 you still hadn't called me
So I'm gonna leave my cell phone
Turned on in my purse by the bed
And before I fall asleep
I guess I'll just check my machine
Again and again 'cause I'm
Obsessing on you
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"
Zoning out, thinking about you and me between the sheets
I wanna get intimate, but you're not within my reach
So I'll have a little more wine
And I'll try to drink you out of my head
And I'll lay awake awhile
'Til I'm high enough I can
Forget all about you until
I wake up again
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"
Slipping into dreams
I feel my love surround you
My subconscious seems
To weave itself around you
Do you care for me?
Beyond idolization
Tell me how you feel
But don't keep me at bay
'Cause I won't be waiting long
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and whisper softly to me:
"You wanna be my babydoll"
I wanna be your babydoll
Wrap me up nice and tight
Love me all through the night
Come lay me down
Enfold me in your arms
Cover me with velvet kisses
Rock me on and on and cuddle up next to me:
"Come on and be my babydoll"
Still layin' up in bed, it’s 3:27
My body’s lonely
Why ain’t ya callin'?
I’m ready for ya, boy don’t you know it?
Ooooh, you can ring my bell
Ring my bell, my bell
I wanna be your babydoll
I wanna be your babydollLove wandered inside
Stronger than you
Stronger than I
And now that it has begun
We cannot turn back
We can only turn into one
I won't ever be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I'm truly inspired
Finding my soul
There in your eyes
And you
Have opened my heart
And lifted me inside
By showing me yourself
Undisguised
And I will never be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
The part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away, mmm
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I am inside
And I will never be too far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
I will never be too far to feel you

'Cause when I'm without you 
It always seems like 
Part of me is missing, baby
Sometimes I don't call like I don't care at all

I just make a wish and if it's you my whole day changes
'Cause when I know you're thinking of me 
Heaven knows 
Suddenly it's not so dismal, baby
Sometimes I don't call, like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile

Feeling you , fiending for you 
Just waiting on you , when I see you I would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you
See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
See baby, I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found
You
You
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude

Faded, oh
It was overcast that day
And I was feeling some kind of way
I pulled the covers up over my head
Tried reaching for you, but that was then
I can’t forget
My heart's hung over but ain't nothing different
I close my eyes, nothing but faded pictures of you, of you...
Faded
Baby you’re faded
Baby you’re faded
Faded
You come and you go
You’re just an echo
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you’re not here
So intangible
Just like an echo
Still tryin' to pretend it's possible
To bring us back to life
But we continue to subside
Hanging on for life on this rollercoaster ride
I call your name, baby subconsciously
Always somewhere but you're not there for me
Boy you, boy you...
You're faded
Baby you’re faded
Baby you’re faded
Faded
You come and you go
You’re just an echo
A whisper in my ear
But in the morning you’re not here
So intangible
Just like an echo
Faded
You’re always somewhere but you’re not there for me
Not there for me, not there for me
You’re always somewhere but you’re not there for me
Not there for me, not there for meCry, cry, cry 
Cry, cry, cry 
Cry, cry
Maybe I didn’t leave much between us that day
And maybe I shouldn’t have told you I loved you
Played the game, and now I understand
Wish I could have you back
And kiss you soft and feel your hands on me
Till we both break down
Till we both break down
Till we both break down
And cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry, cry
'Till we both
And maybe I didn’t give you your space back then
And maybe I should have just held out a little bit longer
But I was subdued by you, and I didn't know enough
Truly too enchanted to disregard the words you said to make me yours
I need to hold you 'till we both
Break down
I should've known that you were tired of me
Oh, till we both break down
And cry
Oh, my love
Imprudently I left every cell in me so naked
Somewhere at the core of you, blares our song
I just need you till we both
I'm just saying
Might as well tell the truth about the matter
Yes, I guess it's selfish of me to just expect that I'm entitled to have you
But tonight all I wanna do is just hold you till
We both break down and cry
Oh, we both break down and cry
'Till we both break down and
CryYou were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
Because I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll never come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
But when your down in your time in need
And you're thinking 'bout how you might be coming back to hold me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore
Someday
Someday, ooh someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for

I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around
I should've left it at "How ya doin'?"
I should've left it at "I like your music too" and
I should've never called you back when you pursued me
I should've never given you my fucking two way
I should've never listened to your woeful stories
The ones I'm sure you told a thousand times before me
You should've never intimated we were lovers
When you know very well we never even touched each other
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore?
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
I guess your momma never told you
What comes around comes back around
I gotta break it to ya delicately, dummy
Taking my G5 twenty minutes wasn't nothing
But I guess you wouldn't know that's the way I roll
Consequently now your ego's fully overblown
You don't want the world to know that you're just a puppet show
And the little boy inside often sits at home alone
And cries, cries, cries, cries
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody
Your pain is so deep rooted
What will your life become?
You try to hide it, but you're lost and lonesome
Still just a frail shook one
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down, and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Who's gonna love you when it all falls down and
Who's gonna love you when your bankroll runs out?
Who's gonna care when the novelty's over?
When the star of the show isn't you anymore
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall down
Nobody cares when the tears of a clown fall downHah, you know girl, it's crazy
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh
See, I've always been wanting a girl like you
Ooh, ooh, ooh, ooh, oh

So tell me won't you come over and see about me, baby?
I've got the Cry's on ice, I'm about to get in
Up in V-I-P with all my ladies
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something about you
Hear a little something about me

What my intentions are for you and I to get into
Baby, I just wanna hug and kiss and love you
Look into my eyes, baby, don't be shy
Is it yes or no? We ain't got all night!
Tell me how many times in your life
Will you get an opportunity like this tonight?
Tell me a little something 'bout you
Hear a little something 'bout me

Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
I'm riding home in pain again, baby
But that don't mean shit to you
You're currently engaged in an intimate conversation
With a young groupie or two
They say players only love you when they're playing games
Still I gave my heart to you
I should have stayed away-ay-ay-ay
Like my friends all told me to
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?
See, I'm looking for a man that'll rub me slow
Make me sing real high when he goes down low
But see, it ain't just a physical thing
He's gotta treat me affectionately
And I gotta know he won't betray my trust
Just like every other motherfucker does
Is this just an impossible dream, baby?
Too elusive to pursue
It's been such a sad and windy road for me
Just searchin' for the truth
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?
]
Now you know I'm rolling Beamer and a Benz
And I'm dishing out ends
Why you hating on a play, baller?
Having better conversations while we rolling on twenty four
And I know you got doubts
Why you listen to what people talk about?
You ain't figured out why they call you
The heifer steady hating 'cause you rolling on twenty four
See how you money flow
You dressed in designer clothes from head to the toe
You are not satisfied then tell me what you looking for?
Well, I'll be your one and only
If you give me a chance, I'll make a change for you girl
I know I am not been the most faithful nigga in the world
But let's stay together so we can shine like pearls
Spending to a wallet, fill a Swisha with fire
To kiss you lips, I desire
Twist and Mariah, together like a rim and a tire
Well, come on Shorty let me make it better
We can do whatever, while we sitting on suede and leather
Feeling through the city while we rolling chrome and
Let's kick it in the Chi
I know I messed up with you, I ain't gon' lie
I knew you was feeling, you really know your guy
But baby girl, I ain't mean to blow your high
Let me pick the pieces up and put them back together
'Cause I want to be with you, don't wanna  leave you lonely
Ride with you like the homie, never no phony
Shorty, can I be your one and only?
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
So, so lonely
I'm lookin' for my one and only
Every time I turn around
I find my heart in pieces on the ground
Why can't I find my one and only?Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her king
Let every heart prepare him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders, wonders of His love
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me]
This is for my people who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high 
We will never say bye, no, no, no 
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins 
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers 
Lift your head to the sky 
'Cause we will never say bye 
I know, I know you’re gone, I know I'll see you again
One thing that I can promise, we gon' meet up again
Hopefully up in Heaven, prayin' that I'm forgiven
For everything that I've done, and that I forgot to mention
I feel so bad to be without my homie
And ever since you've been absent, I've been so lonely
Why does life cycle around like a trophy?
Even though I know somebody took the time to warn me
That you can't be with me and it's just crazy
And every day I'm wishing that you could come save me
And I know a man ain't supposed to cry
It’s taken all the strength in my soul to say goodbye
]
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye 
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye 
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for awhile
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by 
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye bye
Yeah, I feel you, sweetheart, let me talk to 'em
Yeah, how come they call it goodbye?
How come the good die?
See, I just get high and think of the good times
That I had with my pops, he was a good guy
How come the good die?? As I protect my mother
'Cause I'm her oldest son, and there are different worlds
And we in the coldest one, which one did granny go to?
And why do death come?
As my baby ask, "where do babies come from?"
I tell her, "where?", I tell her "why?"
And I tell her I love her until I tell her bye
And whenever I shall ever die, I hope you celebrate it
I hope you never hate it, and they say Heaven's gated
But I think I know the code, and let's get your life right
By the end of the road, that’s why I drive alone down memory lane
So if I crash, I hope you all remember Wayne, goodbye
Never knew I could hurt like this 
And everyday life rolls on 
I wish I could talk to you for awhile 
Miss you, but I try not to cry 
As time goes by 
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you 
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye

If you get this letter, won't you help me out?
I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I'm 'sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this void inside and I just can't take it
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night
Ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas
Santa's gon' come and make him mine, ho, ho, ho
Santa's gon' come and make him mine this Christmas night

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
'Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, ol' Kris Kringle, save me
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you, Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa, won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

Oh, Santa Claus
If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December, I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies
The tree's all sparkly and gold
But inside, I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole

You don’t have to speak up for yourself
Be still and let God fight your battles
Somebody come and go with me, friend!
There will be mountains that I will have to climb
And there will be battles that I will have to fight
But victory or defeat, it's up to me to decide
But how can I expect to win if I never try?
I just can't give up now
Come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
Never said there wouldn't be trials
Never said I wouldn't fall
Never said that everything would go
The way I want it to go
But when my back is against the wall
And I feel all hope is gone
I'll just lift my head up to the sky
And say, “Help me to be strong”
I just can't give up now
I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe He's brought me this far to leave me
No you didn't bring me out here to leave me lonely
Even when I can't see clearly
I know that you are with me, so I can’t
Oh, I just can't give up now
Cause I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me 
And I don't believe 
He's brought me this far to leave me
And I can't give up now
Yeah, just can't, oh
Can't give up now
Said I've come too far from where I started from
Nobody told me 
And I don't believe 
He's brought me this far to leave me
I just can't give up now 
I've come too far from where I started from 
Nobody told me the road would be easy 
Don't believe, He's brought me this far to leave me 
I can't give up now!
I just can't give up now
Said I've come too far
Come too far from where I started from
No one said it would be easy
Nobody told me the road would be easy
And I don't believe
He's brought me this far to leave me
I don't feel no ways tired
I don't believe He's brought me this far Jesus, Jesus

Three wise men came from afar
They were guided by a shining star
To see King Jesus where He lay
In a manger filled with hay, oh

So I don't understand why you got yo' tongue on my name 
Most bitches talk shit, then get punched in the face

Brothers wan' play me, I blow they back out

Portuguese for you não
Japanese for you 
I said it
I said no
Haha, I think, I think that was it
YepI was a wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away 
I left the worse unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
As I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And though time's rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child 
Feeling inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 
Guardian angel, I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image 
And you're still alive 
As I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soonThere you are, holding her hand
I am lost, dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right?
Don't you know you were my life?
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go
Just cast aside, you don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by, don't care to see me cry
And here I am, still holding on
I can't accept my world is gone, no, no
Even though I try, I can't let go
'Cause something in your eyes captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Every day of my life?
Do you know the way it feels when all you have just dies?
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind
Even though I try, I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
'Cause every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let you go
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes captured my soul
Every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know, I can't let goNot more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord 
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happenIt's not chipped we're not cracked

You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
I keep on reaching and I
I keep on trying
But you never even hold me
And it seems like you don't know me, baby
I keep on yearning and I
I guess I'm learning
That it's just a losing fight
'Cause there's no passion in your eyes
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
You know you're slipping away from me
I keep denying that our
Our love is dying
But it's all a big charade
And it's a fruitless game to play
I can't remember when you
You last were tender
And it's always touch and go
The silence chills me to the bone
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping away from the life and the love we made
Baby, I'm so afraid
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading fast it seems
When you're slipping away from me
Away, away, away, away, yeah
Hey, yeah
Further, further 
Ooh, yeah
You're so far
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me 
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloof 
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me 
So far, so far
You're slipping away, away
Slipping away from what we had
Truly, I just don't understand 
So far, so far, so far
You're slipping away, away
You're slipping right out of my grasp
When you're fading so fast it seems
You know you're slipping away
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you 
Try and I try, but you're so aloof 
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me 
Time after time I reach for you 
Try and I try but you're so aloof
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me 
Time after time I reach for you 
Try and I try but you're so aloof 
Where is the boy that you used to be?
Baby, you're slipping away from me
Time after time I reach for you
Try and I try, but you're so aloofMany nights we've prayed
With no proof anyone could hear
In our hearts a hopeful song
We barely understood
Now we are not afraid
Although we know there's much to fear
We were moving mountains
Long before we knew we could
Oh yes
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
In this time of fear
When prayer so often proves in vain
Hope seemed like the summer birds
Too swiftly flown away
Yet now I'm standing here
My heart's so full, I can't explain
Seeking faith and speaking words
I never thought I'd say
There can be miracles
When you believe
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Mmm, who knows what miracles
You can achieve
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
You will when you believe
They don't always happen when you ask
And it's easy to give in to your fears
But when you're blinded by your pain
Can't see your way clear through the rain
A small, but still, resilient voice
Says help is very near
There can be miracles
When you believe
Though hope is frail
It's hard to kill
Who knows what miracles
You can achieve
When you believe
Somehow you will
Now you will
You will when you believe
You will when you believe
You will when you believe
Just believe 
Just believe
You will when you believeI’m making a statement of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder to help myself remember
I know no longer live in your dominion 
You’re just trifling, nothing more than a liability
Gotta bundle all your possessions
Outside the kitchen window right now
Letting go
Letting go ain’t easy
Oh, it’s just exceedingly hurtful
‘Cause somebody you used to know
It’s flinging your world around
And they watch, as you’re falling down, down, down
Falling down, baby
Evidently your words were merely lies
Reverberating in my ears
And the echo won’t subside
There’s deep, deep loss of hope
And the anger burns in me
I hope you don’t get no ideas ’bout reuniting, baby
‘Cause that’s the last thing I truly need
Your audacity is too much to be believed, so
Go to "Mimi" on your contacts, press delete
Letting go ain’t easy
Oh, it’s just exceedingly hurtful
‘Cause somebody you used to know
It’s flinging your world around
And they watch, as you’re falling down, down
Falling down, baby
Baby letting go, baby letting go
Ain’t easy, easy
Baby letting go, baby letting go 
Ain’t easy, Ain’t easy
Baby letting go, it ain’t easy
‘Cause somebody you used to know
It’s flinging your world around
And you know what?
They watch as you’re falling, as you’re falling
Down
Fall
It ain’t easy babyYet another early morning and you walk in like it's nothing
Hold up, hold up, hold tight
Ain't no donuts, ain't no coffee
See, I know you seen me calling and calling
I should crack you right in your forehead
Let me take a breath 
And regain my composure
Told you one more time 
If you f'ed up it's over
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do, baby
It's a wrap for you, baby 
Shooo-do-do-do-do
It's a wrap for you, baby 
Oh, baby
If I ever misrepresented my self image, then I'm sorry
I was oh so acquiescent but I learned my lesson
Boy, you're sorry 
Bump, bump, bump, all out in the open
Don't make me go call Maury Povich
Let me take a breath 
And regain my composure
Told you one more time 
If you f'ed up it's over
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scoo-do-do-do-do, scoo-do-do-do-do, baby
It's a wrap for you, baby 
Shooo-do-do-do-do
It's a wrap for you, baby 
Oh, baby
Put all of your shit in the elevator
It's goin' down like a denominator
Tryin' to keep holdin' on, holding on
Boy, let me go
You gon' wake my neighbors, get away from my door
That was your last shot, you ain't coming back
It's the Martini I mean it, baby, it's a wrap
It's a wrap, it's a wrap
When it's gone, it's gone, it's gone, it's gone
You're dead wrong, so wrong, so wrong, so wrong
So just scroo-do-do-do-do, scroo-do-do-do-do, baby
Boy, I wasn't playing a game
I told you, I told you
If you f'd up one more time it's over 
So get out of my face, I'm hungover
Been sitting here all night, leave me alone
Since quarter-to-three I've been drinking Patrón
Watch the credits roll, it's a wrapY-y-you 
Y-y-you
Ahh, ooh, oh, oh, oh, oh 
You know you got me, yeah
You know you got me, uh-huh-huh-huh
You know you got me, yeah
You know you got me
Uh, it's Mariah and Free
Just Blaze beats, yeah
It's the Roc and Mariah and the women go 
And I love it when the ladies sing
And they love it when the whistles blow over the ring
Slide upon ya strip and go
Just to pick up ya sister bro
You like to pick and choose who she dates
While I state who I like to stick and move
Silly fool, she know that I got her
I'll run up on the strip and go
For Mariah play a brother role
I'll play a different role
Let her roll in the wheel, long days nowhere to go
And no other slimie will do
She just like honey so she got me like Winnie the Pooh
Long nights let her chill with the crew
Only backwards will do and she know how to roll
They say out with the old and in with the new
But she's my dreamlover so I can't let go, hey, no
Please believe me, I've never been a liar
Touch fire Mariah and Free-weezy
I get shy around you
Don't know what to say, I don't know what to do
'Cause you do something to me
That I can't describe, baby
Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby, it's true
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
Boy, I'm entangled up in you
These feelings I just can't elude
'Cause you're so captivating
That I inadvertently
Always catch myself thinkin' 'bout
The things you do
There ain't no one else
I got my heart set on you
You really got me, baby, it's true
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
You know you got me 
Mami, got me, buying property
Speeding too fast, high velocity
Coppin' bracelets, baby rock piece
Vacay, Saint-Tropez and Capri
And usually I be on my shit
Harlem Shakin' these groupies off me quick
But this time it's diff
Think the love gon' stick
Like Velcro, let go, hell no
Ma, you know you got me
Said I'm insecure when I'm around you
Don't know what to say or to do
Catching feelings boy, in spite of myself
I can't think of nobody else, sugar
You're the star of all my dreams
I just wanna be your everything
Boy you know you really got me
Baby, yeah
You know you got me 
You know you got me

Uhh 
Hmm 
Uh, ooh 
Yeah, ooh
It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web 
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you  caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you'
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us
Score up in the project hall
Third floor gravitates on the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw bass
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you, the one that's like my pistol, I said crystal
Keep you on my side 'til the ficial 
Ain't it ill how we click, boo? Just me and you
Got me stuck off the realness, just me and you
Up on the roof beats, Pebble Beach
Talk to me anytime, even when I wit my peeps
Ruler L, why you smell like the perfume Chanel?
Push big G's rappin' all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top
Do it 'til we both drop
M-O-B-B with Mariah sounds so hot
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I 
Every time I feel the need
]
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy nightSometimes I wonder
Where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
Make believing
Is hard alone
Out here on my own
We're always proving
Who we are
Always reaching for
That rising star
To guide me far
And shine me home
Out here on my own
When I'm down and feeling blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh baby, be strong for me
Baby, belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you
Until the morning
Sun appears
Making light
Of all my fears
I dry the tears
I've never shown
Out here on my own
But when I'm down and feeling blue
I close my eyes so I can be with you
Oh baby, be strong for me
Baby, belong to me
Help me through
Help me need you
Sometimes I wonder
Where I've been
Who I am
Do I fit in
I may not win
But I can't be thrown
Out here on my own
Out here on my ownI remember so many nights in the bed alone
Wondering could I muster the strength to exist in the bitter cold
But you showed up once in a while, I guess that's alright
Cause I told my heart that you needed time for yourself, it's fine
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And round I go
To know that you still love me
I need to know, say that you do
I need to know, say that you do
Wear it sometimes when I tried to discern our reality
Wish that I just could be somebody else if you talked to me
Kept praying inside, let him love me for who I am
Please, my Lord
But you were just somewhere that I couldn’t reach, couldn’t understand
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And round I go
To know if you still love me
I need to know, say that you do
I need to know, say that you do
Didn’t we swear we'd give each other everything
Didn’t I give you all of me
Oh oh oh
No, not a day goes by
No, no, no
When I don't wonder inside
If you feel the way you used to feel
I camouflage my tears
And you wear your disguise
And round and round I go
I need to know, say that you do
I need to know, say that you do
I need to know, say that you do
That's all I really wanted...
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh
I need to know...
Tell me that you still love me
I cry and cry as you laugh and laugh at the question
But I need to know
I need to know, say that you do
Wear it sometimes when I try to discern our reality...Our love goes 'round, our love goes 'round
Our love goes 'round and 'round
With you babe, with you, babe
With you babe, with you, baby
Baby baby, don't you ever let go
More and more until we both overflow
Got a feeling that my heart's never known
Tender kisses and I'm floating on air
You can have me anytime, anywhere
When you need me, I will always be there
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was Heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love
Loving you is like a taste of Heaven
Wanna gaze into your eyes forever
Run away and spend our lives together
Baby baby, all it takes is one touch
And immediately I feel a rush
Baby boy, too much is never enough
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love
I don't need anything, when you're here next to me
Nobody in this whole wide world
Could ever replace you in my eyes
We found paradise, forever you and I, yeah
Our love goes 'round, our love goes 'round
Our love goes 'round and 'round 
With you babe, with you, babe
With you babe, with you, baby
And our love goes 'round and 'round
Way up high, a joy ride
We can touch the stars above
We found love
And our love was Heaven sent
From the day we first met
We've got something they can't touch
We found love
Baby, baby, baby, we found loveThey can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down, but I will not allow
Anyone to succeed hanging clouds over me
And they can try how to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter in what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me, no, no, no
They
Oh, they, they can do
Anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to your pride and just push them aside
See I, I have learned
There's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul that they can not possess
So I won't be afraid and the darkness will fade
'Cause there's
There's a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes, they can try
But they can't take that away from me
No, oh-oh, they can't take this
Precious love I'll always have inside me
Certainly, the Lord will guide me where I need to go
Oh, oh, they can say
Anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily sailing out of their reach
Oh, Lord, they do try
Hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to fall
Tell me what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly, yes
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me, no, no, no
MeThis goes out to you and you and you
You know who you are
Hmm, hmm, hmm
When glory days turn to stormy nights
You must have been so petrified
You against the world in a losing fight 
Captive of your demons inside
So you sought an enemy
Like times before to mock ignorantly
Take heed to the Word, it's time
Check Proverbs 19:29
Don't cry
I wish you well 
I wish you well 
I wish you well 
I truly wanted solidarity
Still wearing my blinders back then 
I weep for what I dreamed we all could be
I'll keep you in prayer 'til the end
Still bruised, still walk on eggshells
Same frightened child, hide to protect myself
But you can't manipulate me like before 
Examine first John chapter four, verse four
I wish you well 
I wish you well 
I wish you well
Be strong in the Lord and power of His might
If my shows of gratitude are minuscule
Inside your mind, sorry 
There's only so much I can do
I love you and did all that I could 
Maybe when you're cursing me
You don't feel so incomplete
But we've all made mistakes
Felt the guilt and self-hate
I know that you've been there for plenty
Maybe still got love for me
But let him without sin cast the first stone brethren
But who remains standing then
Not you not I see Phillipians 4:9
So I wish you well
I wish you well
I wish you well
No weapon formed against me shall prosper
Surely God is my salvation
I will trust and not be afraid
The Lord, the Lord is my salvation
I will trust in Him
Yes, I know that I know that I know that I know that I know that I know
But I have had God's help to this very day
And so I stand here and testify
To small and great alike
So the more you curse me
The more you're blessing me
The Word said it
Love your enemies
Do good to those who curse you
Pray for those who mistreat you
Psalms 129:2
They have greatly oppressed me from my youth
But they have not gained victory over me 
I wish you well
He that keeps his mind state on the Lord
He will keep them in perfect peaceYeah
Yeah, oooh

Man, is it the glitter on her breasts or the gloss of the lips?
Hickeys on the chest or the toss of the hips?

You can laugh now but ya cry later

Freak thongs in my specialized peep shows

Toes curl from Peachtree to Melrose, the whole world
It's cool, 'cause see I like it when we smoked out
All choked out with some freak shit 
You kinda got me like a feen when you call out
Now get your boys for my girls, we can roll out
I got myself a lover who knows what I like
When he invites me over I come every time
And when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's delirium time
He's all mine and his lovin' gets me high
Like a taste of ecstasy
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
Loverboy, c'mon and take me 
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long
I got myself a lover and he's so sublime
It's quite a bit of heaven to feel him inside
'Cause when my sugar daddy takes me for a ride
Whatever way we go it's delirium time
I get weak when his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body
All I need is him to be my loverboy
Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock me all night long 
Loverboy, c'mon and take me 
Only you know how to make me
Shudder with anticipation all night long 
Come on, yeah
Pardon me, you're kinda innocent
A vision of love
You adore me, even though my image is thug
What I see in you is for my eyes only to see
I bring out the freak in you up and down on me
I'm your lovergirl, me your loverboy
And when we home alone, become each other's toys
Making noise, we can't avoid
The way I throw that
Cat pop, backdrop, stopwatch
Brat-tat, get ya more rock harder
All of the things you wanna do to me, you oughta
We can get obscene, my parina and your ding-a-ling mingle
Bother me not, when the sensation come out
Because I'll make you scream

Feel me, when I pump-pu-pump, lady
Remind me we can be close like family

Butterfinger my tangerines
Chickens only taste my loverboy in they dreams
Here, all my ladies let me hear you scream

Loverboy, c'mon and love me
Give me more, touch me and touch me
I enjoy the way you rock meI still remember
That hazy September
I've been waitin' for somebody like you
To come back around
We would walk in the park every Saturday
Brand new all in love kissin' time away
You was all up on me, it was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple things
Anklets, name plates that you gave to me
Sweet tarts, Ring Pops
Had that candy bling
And you were my world
Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ, play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind
It was everything that I could do
To stay away
And I often reminisce
About the games we played
Oh yeah, it was tag, chase, spin the bottle
Them butterflies would last till tomorrow
Then the lights came on
I had to run right home
And now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
And I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind
I'm the same Mimi
Fame ain't changed me
Butterfly flow like Muhammad Ali
Wish I can bring you back like the O.D.B
Thinkin' about the whirlpools
Me you and Jack
No matter what I do
All the memories are stacked
Thinkin' 'bout 10th grade
Thinkin' 'bout 11th
Then you went Doug E. Fresh
All the way to heaven
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mindOnce again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretending not to know the difference
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing
'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
Said I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cryBaby, don't tell me you miss me, you love me
Don't whisper gently that you can't forget me tonight
Tonight
'Cause I've heard it all before
Just turn away, don't play that game
Baby, I don't want to anymore
Let it all fade away
Don't you know the love is gone
It's too late
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, baby
No, no, no
Don't tell me you're sorry you hurt me
How many times can I give in?
How many battles can you win?
Oh, don't beg for mercy tonight
Tonight
'Cause I can't take anymore
Just turn around, don't break me down
Baby, I don't love you like before
Let it all fade away
Don't you know that love is gone?
It's too late, oh
Everything fades away
Nothing ever stays the same, baby
Oh, oh
So hard for me to let you go
Don't leave me standing in the cold
Oh baby, give it one more chance
I know that we can make it last
Just let me love you one more time
'Cause I don't wanna lose my mind
So hard for me to let you go
So hard for me to let you go
Let it all fade away 
Love is gone it's too late 
Everything fades away 
Nothing ever stays the same, babe
Nothing ever stays the same
Oh, whoa, whoa
Let it all fade away 
Love is gone, it's too late 
Everything fades away 
Nothing ever stays the same
It only fades, it only fades
Only fades, it only fades
Baby, don't tell me you miss me you love me
It only fades, it only fades
Only fades, it only fades 
Baby, don't tell me you miss me, you love me 
It only fades, it only fades
Only fades, it only fades 
Baby don't tell me you miss me, you love me 
It only fades, it only fades
Only fades, it only fades 
Baby, don't tell me you miss meWhoa, welcome to a day of my life, day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Whoa, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Though the lights were low
I could see you both in a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still, I was frozen right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door, jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous to be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows just so I could breathe
Can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm going 'bout a hundred, mascara runnin'
Laughing out of anger, but it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you, I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this happen in my own bedroom
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh
And I'm gon' la-la-la-la-la-laugh right in your face, boy
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
So I pulled to the side of the road to fix my face
But I can't cover with make up what my tears want to erase
I wake up in a haze, morning dew and sun rays
As I drive, I hide my eyes behind my black Cavalli Shades
A block from the house slowly creep in the driveway
Tip toe through the door, but you're there wide awake
You're like: "Where you been?"
I'm like: "Sorry, but I fell asleep on Jasmine's sofa
I could've swore that Rae Rae called you and told ya"
You're like: "You okay?"
I'm like: "I'm alright, little sleep and I'll be fine."
But if you only knew what was in the back of my mind
You already stung, but you really gon' find out in time
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
Betcha gon' know though how it feels
How it feels for real
This is for real, for real, for real
Oprah Winfrey, whole segment, for real, for real
20/20, Barbara Walters, for real, for real
60 Minutes, for real
Baby, I had all my trust in you
And look at what you put me through
You got me all crazy
Somewhere down the line, you're gon' get what you deserve
You fucking jerk
You were supposed to save me, my sweet baby
Now we're fading away
But your gonna know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
To be continuedIf I could recapture all of the memories
And bring them to life, surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me surviving the night?
You're fading out of my sight swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're
Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
Vanishing
AwayWhoa
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against all odds
And that's what I've gotta face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
So there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've gotta take
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Take a look at me now

Boy meets girl and looks in her eyes 
Time stands still and two hearts catch fire 
Off they go roller coaster ride
Up and down and around, twisted all out they minds
And then his friends
Said, "It's too soon to settle down"
And then her friends
Said, "He's a playa, slow it down"
They couldn't be who they was
'Cause it just seemed like love
Wasn't on they side
]
But this isn't just another love story 
Together we'll make history 
I know because it's just too real
There'll be no end to our love story
And this ain't gon' end up like that Casablanca movie 
This ain't no fairy tale or fiction this is truly 
Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby

When they meet up again
Second time around
See that they're just friends
But the feeling's still strong
And it's been too long
To be trippin' like they ain't been missing
They on the phone like "Ay bay bay"
Let's meet up today
Gots about an hour or two
You might as well come through
We can make like it was 
Just the two of us

Ours for all eternity
They'll be no end to our love story, baby
Just when it seemed like all the odds were stacked against them
They came back stronger than before, matter fact than some
Stronger than pride, looking like them
Looking like her, looking like him
Stronger than hate and the whole world too
Looking like me, looking like you

I've been waiting for someone to come into my life
Who would bring me joy and give me pleasure
I have taken chances on romances once or twice
And I found that in my heart it's you I treasure
You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever
All my life my love's been waiting for you
All my life my heart's been waiting too
All my, all my, all my life
All my, all my, all my life
I've been wishing on a star, I've been praying on my knees
I've got some sly and sexy tricks to show you
Most of all I'll give you anything boy that you need
To keep you right here by my side, I know you, I'll show you
You and only you can make me feel the way I do
You and only you can make it better
You and only you can do the freaky things you do
And I'm so into you and that's forever and ever
All my life my love's been waiting for you
All my life my heart's been waiting too
Don't you know I need you and adore you
All my life I'll give to only you
All my, all my, all my life
All my, all my, all my life
I have taken chances on romances once or twiceI just can't seem to give you up, you're mine, you're mine...
Mine, mine, mine, mine
You're mine
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine
You made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby, we were the best
Suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Summer days and summer nights
When I felt you in my arms
Didn't I want to badly
Wanted to let you have me
Autumn days and stormy nights
When you crushed me with your charms
Didn't I need you madly
Now I'm lying here falling apart
I can't seem to live without your love
Suffocating here by myself, dying for your touch
Springtime eyes that get you every time
And I just can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Boy you made me feel
Our love would never end
How can I forget
Baby, we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Oh, you made me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that
My baby, we were the best
I suffered dreams of you all through the night
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
I can't seem to give you up, you're mineWhen I am lost
You shine a light for me and set me free
When I am low
You wash away my tears
And take me through
The loneliness
And emptiness
Through the darkest night
Somehow I survive
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have, I want to give to thee
If I should fall
Your love is strong enough to lift me up
If I'm afraid
You chase away my fears
And take me to
A brighter place
Beyond the rain
And I feel alright
Because you're by my side
Through it all
When you tell me I'm the only one you need
Sweet and tenderly
And your love
Breaks away the clouds surrounding me
All I have, I want to give to thee
You take me through
The loneliness and emptiness
And I feel alright
'Cause your by my side
Through it all
You tell me I'm the only one you need
So sweet and tenderly
And your love
Just breaks away the clouds surrounding me
And baby, all I have, I want to give to thee
Want to give you all of my love
Now and forever my love
All I have, I want to give to theeIt's M.C. and Y.J
Another hit, OK
We lookin' fly, takin' off
Saw us on a runway
On any given Sunday, Monday, Tuesday
They try to confuse me
I never let 'em use me
I was a girl, you was the man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me
Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there, under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much
More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built
And I dealt with it
Like a kid, I wished I could fly away, but instead
I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started, I'd keep cryin'
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Vacant inside, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while, put up a fight
It's just too much, night after night
After a while, I would just lie
You was dead wrong, said you was right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life
Flickering like a candle
Doing my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave
Kept the tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects

Hey, magnifical, or should I say magnificent? 
Ain't nothing worth your happiness
And I ain't caring who you're with
Misery loves company
So we ain't tryna hang with y'all
Hurt you if you let 'em in
Gotta keep your circle small
Keep tryin' to play apology
I tell him I ain't bowlin' though
Think they want me outta here
I tell 'em I ain't goin' though
Side effects be drowsiness, loneliness
How is this?
I think the call it hateration
What can you prescribe for this?
Forgive, but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me

Side effects 
Side effects It's hard to explain
Inherently it's just always been strange
Neither here nor there
Always somewhat out of place everywhere
Ambiguous
Without a sense of belonging to touch
Somewhere halfway
Feeling there's no one completely the same
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
Early on, you face
The realization you don't have a space
Where you fit in
And recognize you
Were born to exist
Standing alone
Eager to just
Believe it's good enough to be what
You really are
But in your heart
Uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the
Outside
And it's hard
And it's hard
And it's hard
Irreversibly
Falling in between
And it's hard
And it's hard
To be understood
As you are
As you are
Oh, and God knows
That you're standing on your own
Blind and unguided
Into a world divided
You're thrown
Where you're never quite the same
Although you try, try, and try
To tell yourself
You really are
But in your heart - uncertainty forever lies
And you'll always be
Somewhere on the outside
You'll always be
Somewhere on the outsideAndy Warhol said "in the future everybody will be famous"
No, he said "everybody will be world-famous for 15 minutes"

This is so out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned
Won't you look at me
You're avoiding my gaze
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways
It isn't fair
It isn't right
If it's really gone
Then tell me tonight

Look at what you got me going through
Can’t help myself because
You make it look good 
Say you make it look good
Around you I know I ain't supposed to be
Acting like I know you notice me
Fantasize about the way you lick your lips
Fingertips on my hips as we dip
Oh boy, you make it look good
Baby baby, sometimes I need you but I feel so shy
Simply can't leave you
'Cause them other girls are gonna try
Guess their mama never told them not to...

How much I still love you 
I've got to see you
Wherever you are
And I've got to be there
I'm wishing on stars
I've got to reveal what's inside of my heart
But the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you, baby
Honestly I know it's silly of me
To want you so badly
But keep it concealed
See my inferiority complex kicks in
And the words escape me
And I'm paralyzed
So helpless when I
Look into your eyes
And how I wish you only knew
What I feel inside for you

That nothing and nobody
Can ever seem to fill that void

And it don't quit like that
We were as one, baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, baby
Our love will never die, np
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If your determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, baby
Our love will never end, no, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back, boy 
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time
Who brings the ruckus and the pain like me?
It's evident, tha residents of So So Def
Got the industry on lock, where outsiders can't enter
Ever since the arrival of this West Side representer
Who rocks your Music Box and breaks down your structure
You fantasize as you visualize me as your Dreamlover
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face Reality
Reason through mc's, Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary, I'm gettin' g's
If you heard of me's, then you know that we's makin' g's
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me to tha back
Steady stacking papers, smokin' on fat stacks of danks
See, to some I'm a hero of this feel on file, but that's my style
And they don't pay me, nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real for my peeps in that street 'Cause to them, I'ma always be their baby
May we always be together
In the sands of time
And it don't stop, and it don't quit
And it don't stop, uh, and it don't quit
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I - we'll always beI never thought 
That I'd be 
Without you 
Why me? 
I never thought 
That I'd be 
Without you 
Why me? 
Love, want your body next to me
On me actually off that ecstasy
Reminiscing how we used to smoke and freak
 and fall asleep, lockin' for a week
Now we barely even talk and walk the block
Kiss and cuddle up
Girl, we're losing touch
What's a man to do but go crazy, babe?
I know you're mad but you don't really hate me, babe
It's deeper than that
And baby, if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side 
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again
Sometimes I close my eyes and just pretend
What if I had a chance to do it all again?
Sometimes for happiness we hesitate
Just like the game, I hear the love won't wait
What if I had another best friend? 
What if I had someone on whom I could depend? 
Someone who makes me feel like you used to 
Tell me, babe, what would you do? 
And baby if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend
I would love you unconditionally 
You'll never wanna let me go, baby 
I promise I will be by your side 
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Darling, if we got together again
And baby if we got together again
Sugar, I would be your very best friend 
I would love you unconditionally
You'll never want to let me go, baby
I promise I will be by your side 
I'll give you anything you need to get by
Then my broken heart will finally mend
Baby, if we got together again 
Why would you wanna go
Through the pain of loving another man?
The truth is nobody can love you like I can
It's a damn shame we can't get along
We used to get it on, where'd it all go wrong?
I admit the flesh is weak, but the game is strong
We go my way, your way, baby, we moving on
It's true, gon' miss you
Who would've thought I'd be without you?
I never thought 
That I'd be 
Without you 
Why me? Why me? 
I never thought 
That I'd be 
Without you 
Why me? 
If we got
And baby, if we got together again

Then my broken heart will finally mend

Oh, oh-oh, oh 
Oh, oh-oh, oh 
Oh, oh-oh, oh 
For the record, you oughta know
You wasn't thinking when you let me go
But whatever, that's how it goes
Win some, you lose some, and others you hold in your heart
Why it gets so hard, tears you all apart
Even though you try to let go, no, no, no
Suddenly you're here, and it's all surreal
And I don't know what the deal
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try 
Like back in the day, that look on your face
Feels like, the first time
Them other regularities, they can't compete with MC
The whole entire world can tell
That you love yourself some me
People see you now, asking all about me
And how they always thought we were so perfect together
Let's rewrite the end, start over again
And it's gon' go better now
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try 
Like back in the day, that look on your face
Feels like, the first time
For the record 
You'll always be a part of me, no matter what you do
And for the record 
Can't nobody say I didn't give my all to you
And for the record 
I told you underneath the stars that you belong to me
And for the record 
It's obvious that we just can't let go of us, honey 
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time 
Give me one good reason why 
We can't just press rewind 
I don't wanna spend my life 
Thinking what it could've been like
 If we had another try 
Like back in the day, that look on your face 
Feels like, the first time 
'Cause when I'm looking in your eyes
Feels like the first time
Give me one good reason why
We can't just press rewind
I don't wanna spend my life
Thinking what it could've been like
If we had another try 
Like back in the day, that look on your face
Feels like, the first time
For the record, baby
Now you know, babyI wonder if you think of me
Somewhere in the shadows of your mind
Although our love could never be
I find I think about you all the time 
Am I in your fantasies?
The way you always wander into mine
And are you longing endlessly?
Just like me deep inside 
When the nights are dark and cold
And when you're lying all alone
When you feel the touch of another love
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
I picture you embracing me
We drift away and leave the world behind, baby
But it's only make believe
Love can be so unkind 
When the nights are dark and cold
And when you're lying all alone
When you feel the touch of another love
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
Hey, tell me, baby 
'Cause I need you, baby 
Really love you, baby
When the nights are dark and cold
And when you're lying all alone
When you feel the touch of another love
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
When the nights are dark and cold
And when you're lying all alone 
When you feel the touch of another love
Am I the one you're dreaming of?
'Cause I think about you, baby
When I'm lying all alone, yeah
I think of you
Yes, I doOh, oh
Yeah, yeah, oh, oh
Ooh, yeah, yeah
 The snow's coming down
 I'm watching it fall
 Lots of people around
 Baby, please come home
 The church bells in town
 Are ringing in song
 Full of happy sounds
 Baby, please come home
 They're singing "Deck The Halls"
 But it's not like Christmas at all
 'Cause I remember when you were here
 And all the fun we had last year
 Pretty lights on the tree
 I'm watching them shine
 You should be here with me
 Baby, please come home
 They're singing "Deck The Halls"
 But it's not like Christmas at all
 'Cause I remember when you were here
 And all the fun we had last year
 If there was a way
 I'd hold back this tear
 But it's Christmas day
 Please
 Please
 Please  Please 
Baby, please come home 
Baby, please come home 
Baby, please come home 
Baby, please come home 
Oh, yeah, yeah 
Woo 
Woo

I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you 
You ain't even gotta worry about a thing 
I gotcha, babe 
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game, I'm here to stay 
See, our love is stronger than any drug
Addictive, just can't get enough 
And every time I'm with you, I want some more
Just close the door, and let's explore each other 
Long as I know you got me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time  
Don't care what no one has to say 
They don't understand us like we do 
I need you near me night and day 
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do 
Scoop me up and we can go 
To that little spot where no one knows 
Spend a little time, just us alone 
You can caress my body, and never let go 
Long as I know you got me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be lovin' you long time

You gotta know I love you, shawty
Show you I care, I try just 'cause 
Ten carat solitaires I buy, just 'cause 
I just love  you in the nude, in the bed, in the pool
And your legs when you move
All your booty and your beauty and the sexy way you do it
Make me wanna buy ya all that you desire times two 
Like the biggest Louis bags, The Bentley and newest Jags
And the huge pad
And make you laugh when you be mad
Just invite your friends over for dinner, and you can brag
Chanel and Tiffany this, Versace and Gucci that
Lifestyle like that, if you leave you'll be back
Everywhere you could go, they either broke or pretty whack
Plus you ain't gotta ask where my heart really at
But you wanna waste time with one of them silly cats
Go and be my guest, though I don't suggest
It's just so hard to get love like this 
I don't want another, ain't gon' never be another
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another 
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
Don't want another ain't gon' never be another 
Can't nobody do what you do to me 
I'll be loving you long as I can breathe 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
Long as I know you got me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be lovin' you long time  
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin'
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin'
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin', I'll be lovin' you
Whoa, whoa, whoa, whoa 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
Hey, babe 
I'll be lovin' you long time I'd rather be with you, but you never tried to holla
We can spend a couple milli actin' silly in Milano
Boy, hit your horn beep, beep, I'll follow
Have your whip in my driveway by tomorrow
Secretly I know you wanna hit it like the lotto
And after that, we can ketchup like tomato
We can make love in Italy in the Grotto
Fresh off the jet at the Met
They're screamin' bravo, bravo, bravo
Steppin' in my Jimmy Choo's, yeah
I got it all cute for ya, baby
Nothing like them other girls
I would never be rude to you, baby

The end, the end, the end, the end
More than just friends
Boy, until the end
Boy, you got me all mixed up like Serato
You got me spinnin' 'round for ya like a lil' model
Steady fiendin' for you like them fries at McDonalds
I wanna be all on your lips like gelato
Permanently paint me in your picture like Picasso
Love me down till I hit the top of my soprano
We can pop bottles, get me actin' all me llamo
Then baby come and pluck this thing like a cello
Steppin' in my Chrissy Lou's, yeah
I got it all cute for ya, baby
Nothing like them other girls
I would never be rude to you, baby
Can't wait, just say that you wanna be
More than just friends
Boy, I'm gonna love you until the end

Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life, only for you
From now until...
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years
From now until
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one, yes
You will always be the only one
If you should ever need me
Unfailingly I will return to your arms
And unburden your heart
And if you should remember
That we belong together
Never be ashamed
Call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
Oh baby, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only oneNo matter what, baby
No matter, no matter what they say
No matter what people say
I still believe we can still be together
No matter what, baby
No matter, no matter what they say
No matter what people say
I still believe we can still be together
Baby, I still believe 
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
If you still believe 
You'll find everything you're searchin' for, maybe more
Well, boy, you seem to be lost in uncertainty
But when you wake up feelin' alone, you never shoulda let it go
Well, baby, it always been sure 
I just wasn't too certain that yours were legitimate, genuine
Really the Real McCoy
And after all this time, you look into my eyes
And everything is still the same
My love for you will fade away
Baby, I still believe 
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together
I'm still a believer of this, so stop
Just listen and look into my eyes
I want you to visualize and realize
And see that it ain't never been too easy
Being Krayzie Bone
To bitches that runnin' outta there with that persuasion
Runnin' up in my brain
Won't go insane
I figure that's why they be callin' me Krayzie 'cause I still maintain
We gonna struggle through all them hard times 
And I can tell you that peace and happiness is hard to find
C'mon, we can get there
I'm not tryna make excuses or reasons
But these demons got me seeing things that's really been misleading me
Maybe that's just my life
Baby, I'm just a thug, coldhearted, but I can feel the love 
Just keep the faith, and don't break it
Shake all the players and haters
And next thing we will make it
And I say, 'Yeah' and 'Uh huh'
You got to believe it 
You got to believe
Baby, I still believe 
No matter, no matter what they say
And it's more than my imagination 
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
No matter, no matter what they say
Baby, I had a dream
No matter, no matter what they say
And it's more than my imagination 
Because I still believe we belong together
No matter, no matter what they say
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
If you wanna view paradise 
Think about our lovin', baby 
Nothing could be closer to it 
If we don't believe, we'll lose it 
]
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
I know you be missin' every bit of the feelin'
You get when you use to hit this, shh
'Cause can't nobody fuck like me
They all in my business
And vicious lies can lead
To innocent victims losing they lives for greed
Paparazzi invading my privacy
Obviously, it's prophecy
Ain't no article that can stop me 
And even if my label drop me
I'ma still sell copies
I'm so, so phenomenal, def
Most know me for leaving bullet holes
In the abdominal area, throat, and chest
One of the baddest motherfuckers left 
Still puffin' and lovin' nothin' 'til my last breath
I only believed it was possible 
You ain't nuttin', my, me and amigo friend
They lay in the dugout, pretendin' to be unstoppable
Lost the ego!
Get in the way of my guns
And they ain't got no prob for droppin' you 
The best thing for you to do is run
'Cause I'm plannin' on poppin' you
I gotta live my life, my life the middle
Or Da Brat don't get no sunshine
Baby, I still believe 
And it's more than my imagination
It's so real, I know we're gonna be together
Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination 
Because I still believe we belong together
Baby, I still believe
And it's more than my imagination 
It's so real I know we're gonna be together
 Baby, I had a dream
And it's more than my imagination
Because I still believe we belong together
Baby, I still believe 
And it's more than my imagination

Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love
You got me lost in the clouds
Floating, like oh
Keep me here always
We’re the only thing that’s true
Beautiful as the sun
Showers upon you, baby
Our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love
We communicate without saying the words out loud
Heavenly, it’s more than a state of mind
Now that you’re in my life and oh
Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate
'cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love
You make beat
You make beat go
Beautiful as you make
All my tears dissipate
'cause our love is supernatural
Hey baby, actually
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our love
Our love
Our love

You make beat
You make beat go
You make beat)
See, you make the beat go
On and on and on and on!
(You make beat
You make beat go)
I’m for sure it’s forever
Talking ‘bout our loveCall my phone, yeah
Baby, call my phone, yeah
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Call my phone, yeah
Baby, call my phone, oh right
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Lost without my other half
How can I live without ya?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe? 
And everything is off, without you
Guess it's all my fault, lady sings the blues
No one could deny it, we were flying like United
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
Got photos of us on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone 
Boy, I just can't erase 'em
The first text I ever got from ya still saved in my inbox
And I read it back time after time
Boy, I'm lost, can't you look?
Won't you please find me?
I'm down to my last tear, come rescue me
See, it's broken my heart to the point where I don't leave the house, no reason out, weekends out just ain't the same without you
But I thought we were inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up 
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever 
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone now
It's been sixteen days since I held you tight
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night
Boy, I just wish you'd show up and make everything alright
So what you waitin' for?
'Cause both us have thought that we're inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparableOoh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Ooh wee, ooh wee
Take this seriously
Like Pac, all eyez on me
That's right, you are intrigued
You notice what it'll be
I'm like the lottery
Hot Bentley with the keys
Light in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days
I'm like that ooh wee
You're feelin' to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like
La-da-da, ooh wee
I'm that chick you like 
La-da-da, ooh wee
I'm that chick you like 
I do'z it naturally
Hypnotize, like Biggie
But you ain't havin' dreams
Nah, you ain't seeing things
Or hallucinating
I brings that levity
Light in the sky, let's fly high
Boy, I got you caught up inside of my haze
And you're gonna be gone for days
I'm like that ooh wee
You're feelin' to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like 
La-da-da, ooh wee
I'm that chick you like 
La-da-da, ooh wee
I'm that chick you like 
Boy, just relax and unwind
Pull me in and breathe
Once you do there ain't no rules, it's up to you
Ain't no rules it's time, just keep on kissin' me
Hold on and baby
We can party all night, through the night, all right
I'm like that ooh wee
You're feelin' to blaze up and taste me
Got flavor like ice cream
'Cause I'm that chick you like 
And you know you need this made
And you know I got this made
Gonna be your everything
I'm that chick you like 
La-da-da, ooh wee 
I'm that chick you like 
La-da-da, ooh wee
I'm that chick you like 
I'm like that uptown haze
Them real thugs blaze
We'll touch the sky
Cause I'm that chick you like
Uh-huh...I've often wondered if there's ever been a perfect family
I've always longed for undividedness
And sought stability
A flower taught me how to pray
But as I grew, that flower changed
She started flailing in the wind
Like golden petals scattering
And I miss you, dandelion
And even love you
And I wish there was a way
For me to trust you
But it hurts me every time
I try to touch you
But I miss you, dandelion
And even love you
I gravitated towards a patriarch
So young predictably
I was resigned to spend my life
Within a maze of misery
A boy and a girl befriended me
We're bonded through despondency
I stayed so long, but finally
I fled to save my sanity
And I miss you, little sis and little brother
And I hope you realize
I'll always love you 
And although you're struggling, you will recover
And I miss you, little sis and little brother
So many I considered closest to me
Turned on a dime and sold me out dutifully
Although that knife was chipping away at me
They turned their eyes away and went home to sleep
And I missed a lot of life, but I'll recover
Though I know you really like to see me suffer
Still I wish that you and I'd forgive each other
'Cause I miss you, Valentine, and really loved you
I really loved you 
I tried so hard, but you drove me away
To preserve my sanity
And I found the strength to break away
FlyCome closer
You seem so far away
There's something I know you need to say
I feel your emotions
When I look in your eyes
Your silence
Whispering misunderstandings
There's so much you need to realize
You'll feel my emotions
If you look in my eyes
Hey, darling
I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind 
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Believe me
I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer, my darling
Feel the love in my eyes 
Hey, darling
I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind 
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind 
I know you feel my love
In your mind, yeah
Hey, darling
Well, I know you think my love is slipping away
But, baby, it's all in your mind 
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Got to let you know, baby
Baby, it's all in your mind
You know my love is good now, baby, yes
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Baby, it's all in your mind
Baby, it's all in your mind 
Baby, it's all in your mindOh, ooh yeah
In the mix, yeah
Yaaay us!
Yaaay us!
Oh, they keep trying but they can't stop us
'Cause we got a love
That keeps rising up
And yeah they fight it but we just proceed
To be who we are
Baby you and me
Life turns around
'Round and 'round it goes
Oh, it's a mixed up world
And that's for sure
We gonna get by
On our own, side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I got you, you got me
Yaaay us!
In the mix
Yaaay us!
In the mix
Oh we keep it inspiring even though they set limits
For us to follow, won't let 'em break us
It's all so shadowy
Never stop striving and we gonna keep climbing up
Nah we won't cower
We stayin' strong now with superpowers
Life turns around
Round and round it goes
Oh, it's a mixed up world
And that's for sure
We gonna get by
On our own, side by side
Love's all we need to be free
I got you, you got me

Goodnight Charles!
Something that they can't define
It's tough sometimes
Just us surviving
Here in the mix Baby, don't you know
That life is sweet?
It swiftly goes
So I just gotta know
That it's more than lust 
That you're worth my trust 
You gotta search inside yourself
And purely open up to me
Before I'll be with you
You gotta give me something sacred
More than merely physical 
One night's not enough
Gotta be certain
I'm so in love with you
It's just another Saturday evening
He's watching all the girls go by
He finds your body kind of appealing
So he hits you with his favorite lie, yes
He's looking you over
He whispеrs, "Let's get to know each othеr better, baby"
He's moving in closer
But what you see may not be the entirety
So be wary
He's just out for the one night
He just wants you 'til he gets his way now, baby, baby
So don't gamble with your life
It don't pay 
You see her standing there on the corner
Sashaying as the cars go by
You casually look over your shoulder
As she winks at you and bats her eyes, yes
You're thinking about it
Your conscience tells you to go
But something's in the way now
The prospect's arousing
You think just this once can't hurt them
But you might have another thing coming
You're just out for a good time
Baby, so later you'll forget her name 
So don't gamble with your life, it don't pay
You're just out for the one night
But it's more than a little game now, baby, baby 
So don't gamble with your life
It don't pay
Yeah, it don't pay
No no, don't pay
It don't pay
No no no no no it don't
It don't pay
No, it don't, no, it don't
It don't pay
It don't pay
It don't pay
It don't payWe were two little people wrapped up in this big old world
Drifting round in space out of place just a boy and girl
Then you took my hand and made me a part of you
And I looked in your heart
And saw all my dreams come true
You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up
And now I love ya like summer time, love ya like cherry wine
Love ya like free money, like a preacher loves Sunday
Love ya like freeze pop, love ya like a milk shake
Love ya like a high school girl on a first date
Love ya like shootin' stars, love ya like a muscle car
Love ya like we're destined
Love ya like my lover and my best friend
Yeah, you did the impossible
Tonight I'm gonna need all your attention
Close the door
I wanna do things I probably shouldn't mention
Like a bird I'm gon' hum
Those three words, I love you, I love you, I love you
Freeze the time, let the world go by
If you're mine say, you love me, you love me, you love me
Boy take my hand and make me a part of you
And the love that you gave to me has pulled me through
You did the impossible
You rescued my love
You did the impossible
See, I had almost given up
And now I love ya like sunsets, bubble baths on the jet
Love ya like Kool-aid, Louis Millionaire shades
Love ya like sugar daddys, love ya like a pimp caddy
Love ya like a holiday Duncan Hines yellow cake
Love ya like it's 5 am and I'm off work
Love ya like Louboutin heels and a mini skirt
Love ya like an asher cut pink and white engagement ring
Love ya like layin' in a bed bumpin Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
And I'm forever your lady
Laying in the bed bumpin' Jodeci
I'd almost given up
The impossibleOh
No
To all my exes need to tell you that I'm sorry 
That I didn't leave you sooner
I'm sorry I gave you more time than I shoulda
'Cause I shoulda walked right by you that day
When you told me I was cute
Shoulda smiled, said, "Thank you" and walked away
But it's something about the dudes that be rude and only rock the wheat Timbs
That ain't got no Snapple apple when they come, they off the Remy
I mean really, I clearly needa be careful with myself
Needa be careful and watch my step 'cause I ain't fell for a real one yet
Yeah, I still ain't admit to my feelings, pretending my feelings ain't in it
I admit it, I settle for less, and that is exactly what I been getting
Instead of the man I know I deserve, I settle for boys that get on my nerves
And then I be mad like, "What is you doin'?"
Mad at them when you the one choosin' and using 'em to feel that empty void
That only God's supposed to fill
But I go against his will, for the thrill of that fake love
Instead of waiting on something real
I just settle for them feelings that I feel, no deal
I ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA "I cut you off" 
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with "I'm sorry," but I'm sorry, 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na 
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed
Oh, oh, oh
You shoulda known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no
You came so close, you just don't know
Irregardless of what transpired
It ain't even worthy of a slick reply
Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up
You shoulda' known that it's bigger than you
You'll never know what I already knew
After everything I already been through
I can't waste no time, pay no 'tention to you
I said no
No, no, no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
No, no
I said no
A no-no
No, no
That's a no-no
No, no, I said no-no
No, no
No
Care for me, care for me
Even though it ain't true, they don't love me, they just love what I do
But ayy, I be lying when I say it too
So bae, I'm sorry that I didn't leave you sooner
I'm sorry I gave you more time than I should've
'Cause I knew I should've left you as a groupie 'stead of giving you my best
I'm not sorry, had to cut you like a check
Write you off and level up like my yacht's top deck
'Cause you was just disappearing, now I ride a jet
I said no
A no-no
I said no-no
That's a no-no
No, no
I said no-no
Parlez-vous français? I said non
Lemme translate it, I said no
I can say it en español
No
Portuguese for you não
Japanese for you 
I said no
I think, I think that was it
YepSometimes I feel so alone and uncertain
Sometimes I don't feel at all
Searching my soul for a reason for living
Needing you here, holding onto me
Sometimes I feel like you don't understand me
You'll never know me at all, no, no
Searching your eyes, but you don't really see me
Out of my mind as I call
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Don't let our love fade away
'Cause I need you
I still need you
Don't let it all fade away
Sometimes I try to pretend I'm not hurting
Hide with my face to the wall
Searching my mind for thе reasons you're leaving
Dying insidе as I call
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Don't let our love fade away
'Cause I need you
I still need you
Don't let it all fade away, oh
I need to feel you
I long to touch you
I never dreamed we'd end up this way
I'm slowly drowning
My fears surround me
Can't breathe without you
Don't fade away
Can you hear me?
Can you hear me?
Don't let our love fade away
'Cause I need you
I still need you
Don't let it all fade away
No, don't let it all fade away
No, baby, woo
Don't fade awayYo, if you ever been in a relationship
And got hurt really, really bad
This song's for you
I mean, you know what it feel like
To not ever wanna do it again
Then you meet somebody
Without a doubt you know they the one
Huh, yeah, but you be so scared and nervous
That you don't wanna get hurt again
See, I'm going through a situation that I can't help
Wanna get a little closer, but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again, babe
I know it's hard but ya gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get when you have it ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better, but I can't stop what I feel
When you're next to me, I really think I

Finally found somebody that could be the one
But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad

But I promised myself that I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared, and I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore, this is bad

See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I know everyone out there can relate
So the question is:
One: Do I really wanna trust this feeling?
Two: Do I wanna let it pass me by?
Three: Do you think it's only superficial?
Four: Could it actually be different this time?
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon

You're almost home
You're almost home
You're almost home
I've seen the light in the sky
In disguise, like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark
I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom
I'm believing in my heart
'Cause underneath the good
Is something greater than you know
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home
When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from, it's like some other universe
You count your steps like they're regrets
You catch one breath then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn
So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home
When you let your
Heart be the compass
You won't get lost
Not if you trust it
When you hear the
Sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before
When you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
'Cause you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home, home, home, home
When you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
You're almost there, you're almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home, home, home, homeAh, ah, ah

You ain't even gotta worry about a thing
I gotcha, babe
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game, I'm here to stay
See, our love is stronger than any drug
Addictive, just can't get enough
And every time I'm with you, I want some more
Just close the door, and let's explore each other
Long as I know you got me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
Don't care what no one has to say
They don't understand us like we do
I need you near me night and day
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do
Scoop me up and we can go
To that little spot where no one knows
Spend a little time, just us alone
You can caress my body, and never let go
Long as I know you got me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
I'll be lovin' you long time  
There's no stopping you and me 
I'll be lovin' you long time 
 I'll be lovin' you long time

Don't want another, ain't gon' never be another

Hey, babe
I'll be lovin' you long time You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby now
I won't be the prisoner of your love
Maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I'm not gonna be a prisoner of your love
I know you're lying, denying all of your actions
So listen up cause here's my reaction
Here comes the night
No more living in the shadow of your love
This is my life
You always tried so hard to keep me down, but now I'll rise above
Those empty lies
Stop pretending that my accusations take you by surprise
I've realized
Now I'm ending all the secrecy, I see through your disguise
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on, I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, no
I won't be the prisoner of your love
No longer blind
I can focus on deception used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it's all a mystery, there's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now to change the way I feel inside
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on, I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll be gone
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, no
I won't be a prisoner of your love
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
I won't be the prisoner of your love
Of your love
No
So if you wanna be my love you can't be a liar
Play around, you see me and then say
"Mariah, I miss you"
Expect me to hug and kiss you
Don't mean to diss you
But I guess I'm not the kind of girl you thought I was
I've had enough and now I'll see you later 'cause
Boy, maybe you don't think that I'll be strong enough
But I won't be the prisoner, baby, of your love
No more, no more
No more, no more, no more, no more
No, no, baby, now
I won't be the prisoner of your love
I'm just not the girl you thought I was
 Not gonna be
I won't be the prisoner of your love
I'm not one of those girls who'll wait around
Crying 'cause you're playing dirty all over the town
You can't do that, I'm not a doormat
You're just a player, that's not my format
See yaSoft heavenly eyes gazed into me
Transcending space and time
And I was rendered still
There were no words for me to find at all
As I stood there beside myself
I could see you and no one else
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same
Only once in a lifetime love rushes in
Changing you with the tide
And dawn's ribbon of light
Bursts through the dark
Wakening you inside
And I thought it was all untrue
Until there all at once I knew
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same
With no beginning and
Without an end
You are the one for me
And it's evident
And your eyes told me so
And your eyes let me know
When I saw you
When I saw you
I could not breathe
I fell so deep
Oh, when I saw you
When I saw you
I'd never be
I'd never be the same
Oh no
Never be the sameUh, this is dedicated to all the ladies out there
That's tired of getting played, you know?
Y'all know what this is

And I'm so ashamed

Like it's nothin'

See, you said that you loved me too, and so I trusted you
But I guess that subconsciously I knew
But I didn't wanna face the truth 
That I was only being used 
And you were just frontin'

I never knew enough about you, babe
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering

Nothin'  anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playin' a game

Every day and every night, I stay by the phone 
Never go no place, so just in case you call, I'll be home 
Seems like all I do is think about our pseudo romance
While you're somewhere burnin' diesel in the streets havin' laughs

Somebody say you know what I'm going through
You've been left with nothin'
Too much you can't count on one hand 
Sing it: three, four, five, six
Seven days a week, you're drowning in tears

Now you're laying up in bed every night singing
Ayy boy, thanx 4 nothin'

I never knew enough about you, babe 
And I guess I only have myself to blame
Now I'm broken-hearted and shattering
But you were just playing a game
No, nothin' 
Anyone could do to convince me, babe
I was living in a lie, just a masquerade
Now I only know that I'll never be the same
But you were just playing a game

You were just frontiin' 
So thanx 4 nothin'Oh, welcome to a day of my life 
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Oh, welcome, welcome, welcome to a day of my life
The memoirs of an imperfect angel
Though the lights were low
I could see you both
In a lover's silhouette
And my heart stood still
I was froze right there
Staring down at her red dress
So I bolted out the door
Jumped right into the car
It's too dangerous
To be in the vicinity of where you are
Rolled down all the windows
Just so I could breathe
I can't believe you just actually did this shit to me
I'm goin' 'bout a hundred
Mascara running
Laughing out of anger
But it don't strike me as funny
Been too good to you
I've been virtuous and true
To have something like this
Happen in my own bedroom
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels
Betcha gon' know oh how it feels
Betcha gon' know, oh, how it feels
How it feels for real
And you see your whole world collapse
Before we both get loud
I'ma break it down
And let you know what happened for real
I was over her house
Me and her on the couch
And the whole plan was just to chill
And then it got hot
After taking some shots
The time must have slipped away
Because all I know
I woke hungover
And girl it was the very next day
With the sun in my face
I woke up in a rage
Screamed, "What have you done to me?"
And I'm telling you babe
I know it sounds crazy
She must have put something in my drink
I know you don't believe it
And you think I'm dead wrong
Standing there butt naked
With nothing but a sheet on
Then she came down
With nothing but a robe on
And that's when
I put my damn clothes on
Got the fuck up out of there
Girl, you know I know how it looks
Girl, you know I know how it looks
Girl, you know I know how it looks
This is for real, for real, for real

Baby, I had all my trust in you and look at what you put me through 
You got me all crazy, somewhere down the line you gon' get what you deserve, you fucking jerk
Your were supposed to save me, my sweet baby 
Now we're fading away 
But you gon' know how this feels
Even if it's the last thing I ever do
To be continued...Alright Jermaine, it's time for Lil Bow Wow to go to sleep

So, so def
I don't want a lot for Christmas 
There is just one thing I need  
Don't care about presents 
Underneath the Christmas tree 
I don't need to hang my stocking 
There upon the fireplace  
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day 
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you 
You, baby 
Oh, oh, oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas 
I won't even wish for snow  
I'm just gonna keep on waiting 
Underneath the mistletoe 
I won't make a list and send it 
To the North Pole for Saint Nick  
I won't even stay awake to hear those magic reindeer click 
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do? 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you 
You, baby 
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere  
And the sound of children's laughter fills the air
 
And everyone is singing  
I hear those sleigh bells ringing  
Santa won't you bring me  the one I really need  
Won't you please bring my baby to me? 
I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for  
I just want to see my baby  
Standing right outside my door
  
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know  
Make my wish come true 
Baby, all I want for Christmas is you 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby I told you Jermaine likes it, then I like it

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you 
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
]
I'd give my all to have 
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel 
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on /
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

So put your loving arms around me, boy 
And hold me like I was a cuddly toy 
Let me feel that warmth of your embrace 
Don't let go, oh

'Cause there could be no sadder sight to see 
Than if we were to miss this opportunity 
So send me up a signal and I'll catch the light

Stay a little while, child

Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child

Well, since you put it that way
Honey, I'm gon' stay
And only your love could make Peter parley 
Let the limo leave and cancel the flight
And not only will I stay, girl, I'm spendin' the night
And if it's right, I'm spendin' my life, all out
And if it seems like I'm rushin', then I'll sleep on the couch
MC, it's your call, I'm ready to ball
And if you need me, I'm ready to brawl
And that's forever by law, together we ball, we takin' it all
I'll make you feel a way a woman never felt before
I see women on many levels, never higher than yours
With a body like that, that face, no flaw
You got to be heaven sent, sayin' you's a dime
You off to meter and it's evident, you like the way I rhyme
Yes, I shine, I'm a veteran
Picture me and honey spendin' money like whatever then
We both got it

 So why don't you
Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child  
Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child

There's no need to act surprised 
Cause there's no room to serve us right
So let's push love to the limit 
And life to the edge
I've only one request of you
Stay a while

Just one more night with you 
I'd risk my life to feel 
Your body next to mine

Now Mariah, you know I love you
I've loved you all my life
But I wouldn't be a friend or even a fan
If I didn't give you the real
You've been hanging on to this dude
Knowing he doing you dirty
Why don't you just cut this guy loose?
You know, tell him it's a wrap
Because you better than that
And you Mariah Carey, remember?
Shit
Yet another early morning
And you walk in like it's nothing

Starry eyed
As you put your hand in mine
It was twilight
On the Fourth of July
Sparkling colors were strewn across the sky
And we sat close enough
That we just barely touched
While roman candles went soaring above us and baby
Then you put your hand in mine
And we wandered away
I was trembling inside
But I wanted to stay 
Pressed against you there and leave the world behind
On that Fourth of July 
So starry eyed 
On the flowery hillside
Breathless and fervid
Amid the dandelions
As it swept over me 
Like the wind through the trees
I felt you sigh with a sweet intensity and baby
Then you put your hand in mine 
And we floated away
Delicately lay entwined
In an intimate daze 
A crescent moon began to shine 
And I wanted to stay 
Tangled up with you among the fireflies
On that Fourth of July 
Thunder clouds 
Hung around 
So threateningly 
Ominously hovering
And the sky 
Opened wide
Showering
Oh, yeah, yeah
Then you put your hand in mine 
And we ran from the rain
Tentatively kissed goodnight
And went our separate ways
And I've never truly felt the way that I
Felt that Fourth of July 
Truly I have never felt the same inside
Like that Fourth of July 
Truly I could never feel the same as I
Felt that Fourth of July ]
2008, watch it! Yeah!
Yo, Mariah Carey alongside Gong Marley
Huh, natty, check it, pepper!
Can't get him outta my mind
Can't explain it, but it's somethin 'bout him makin' me high
Like a motor revin' over and over, it don't stop
He cruised beside me, now I'm flyin', drivin'
Through yellow lights
I'm ignorin' every sign of caution that they provide
Driver's Education 101 slipped out of my mind
I need me a caddy with some cruise control
No, no, no
I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
C-R-U-I-S-E control
Can't nobody, can't nobody tell me nothin'
When he comes in to view
'Cause he's the flyest ting when he be cruisin' on me avenue
Then da door open, de gals 'pon de block
They be hopin, to rob the clock me say "No, man"
Step up, step up bottle broken
Think I'm jokin'
I've been told so many sagas
He brings the drama, six baby mamas
But, oh-oh, I can't resist him
Just wanna kiss him
I need cruise control
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise control
You put your hand in cruise control
And you deny me if you want
And you will starve yourself of love
If you don't speed and break the law
You can't get no speeding ticket
On the highway to my heart
And it might be a rocky road
And you can exit if you want 
Look at life just like a pessimist
You already like a wife up in my premises
And right ya now you cruise control it is my nemesis
Just come again and stop and start just like a genesis
Might needa go slow
I don't know why I ease up on the break
Every time I see his face
I'm outta control, ah, I don't know
How to stay up in my lane
Every day and night
He's cruisin' through my brain
Wherever I go, he be cruisin'
Turn to the right, uh, he so smooth with it
Deep down inside, don't wanna lose him
He already know I'm willin' to go
Gotta get on cruise controlYou come to me with a casual flow
And suddenly my defenses start to go
When you talk to me in that sensual tone
It envelopes me and I lose my self-control
And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face, I go off 
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your arms
Imagining that you're taking it slow
And so tenderly
'Till the feeling overflows
When you look at me, I go soft and cave in
And I can't conceal that I'm slowly weakening
And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face, I go off 
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your arms
You and me in a cloud of reverie
Spin around inside my head unendingly
Thoughts run wild as I sit and rhapsodize
Paint pretty pictures of what I'd do if you were mine
And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face, I go off 
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your arms
And baby, I just melt away
Fall like rain
Every time I see your face, I go off
I just wanna break it down
Anytime you come around
And baby, I could melt away in your armsMC, MC, aha

Don't you know that you seem just a little crazy?
You had my trust and intimacy
But you threw it away, just threw it away
And now it's all in the past
When I think of you, I just laugh
My friends must have thought
I was high to have given so much
To someone not worth my time
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do 
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Til your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
You were so insecure and your crew was so immature
Conversations painfully weak
You were much better off when you didn't speak
But boy, to tell you the truth
It was my illusion of you
Being somehow destined for me
That had me in a daze
But we're not the same in truth
Funny how sometimes
You can really lose your mind
And do things you would never do 
You rhapsodize
And get caught up in the hype
'Till your senses return to you
Love plays you for a fool
I really hope when you hear this song
That you know it was meant for you
Though your attention span's not that long
Try to do the best you can do!

Exquisite furs, this preferred
You even got a set of keys to the Spiz in Jers
Get your man that ain't promise
I'm the kid that'll make sure you keep that tan from St. Thomas
It's no trouble at all
So you can imagine after I go double this fall
Most this player can do is retire
I know Gucci's newest attire
And shoes is required
I don't care who was your priors
Any man saying he don't want you is a liar
All they can do is admire

You know I hopped into my car
Didn't get very far, no
Because I had you on my mind
Why be so unkind
You've got your women all around
All around this town, boy
But I was trapped in love with you
And I didn't know what to do
But when I turned on the radio
I found out all that I needed to know
 Check it out

, uh-huh, yeah, uh-huh, yeah, uh
Uh-huh, yeah, yeah
You know I'm really missing you, baby, uh huh, yeah 
You know I'm really missing you, baby, uh huh, yeah 
You know I'm really missing you, baby, uh huh, yeah
Baby, baby, I'm missing you 
Longing for you everyday and I reach for you every night
Baby, nothing's been the same since the day we said good-bye
And I can't go on like this for too long
Baby, baby, I'm missing you
Boy, I need you next to me and I'm hungering for your touch
Caught up in the memories and you're all I'm thinking of
'Cause I can't get past what we used to have 
Baby, baby I'm missing you 
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss you
All I do is reminisce of the love that we used to share
Can't recover from your kiss because nothing else compares
Ain't no substitute, when it comes to you 
Baby, baby, I'm missing you
Visions of us hand in hand come to me when I close my eyes
Baby, I don't understand how we let it all slip by
Tell me, can we try, baby, one more time?
Baby, baby, I miss you
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here, 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss you
]
Remember when, our eyes first met 
I knew I'd never be the same again 
Why can't it just be like it was? 
Enough is enough 
Baby I miss your love
 Ja-da-*MUAH*
Uh, uh huh
Yo, I remember when I first kicked it to you
We hit it off well, then I used to whisper to you
It was all swell
Said you came from a family with money
Me, I was fresh off the block handling twenties
When I smile was you open or what 
Say you can't judge a book by the cover 'til you open it up
Past hot, we was more like lava-ble 
Used to chill and the smoke didn't bother you
Beauty of a rose, scent of a flower
Love when I tell her to, get in the shower, hit it for hours 
When I thought you was able to cope
That's where things fell apart ma, then it stagnated us both
And now the pain is killing you crazy
While all the time in your mind, you knew I was feeling you crazy
But Kiss is official boo and I'mma come clean
You miss me, well I miss you too, come on
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here, 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss you
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here, 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss you
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here, 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss you
I'm talkin' 'bout how I used to like it when you whispered to me
Tell me that you love me and those beautiful things
Baby, won't you come here, 'cause I'm really in need?
I'm lost in your love and I don't know what to do with myself
I don't wanna be with nobody else
I just think about you, think about us
Think about how much I miss youWho would've believed
That you and me would fall
And land together
And who could've foreseen
In you I'd find the place
I belonged forever
And if I move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
I'd given up hope
Losing the faith that love
Could be mine to treasure
And now nothing's the same
I found myself reborn
On the day I met you
And if we move closer
Then love will take over
And lead the way
Suddenly you are lying
Here with me and the truths
I used to hold have changed
And if I move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the way
If we move closer
And let it take over
Then love will lead the wayBaby, baby, baby
What's it gonna be?
Oh, baby, baby, baby, yeah yeah
Is it him or is it me?
Oh, don't make me waste my time
Don't make me lose my mind baby, yeah
Baby, baby, baby
Can't you stay with me tonight?
Oh, baby, baby, baby
Come, on, don't my kisses please you right?
You were so hard to find
The beautiful ones, they hurt you every time
Paint a perfect picture
And bring to life a vision in one's mind
The beautiful ones
Always smash the picture
Always every time
]
If I told you, baby
That I was in love with you
Oh, baby, baby, baby
If we got married 
Would that be cool?
You make me so confused
The beautiful ones
You always seem to lose, baby
]
Baby, baby 
See the beautiful ones
See the beautiful ones
'Cause I want you
Yes, I mean, I want you
Oh, yeah, baby
I want you, oh yeah
You may not know where I'm going, baby
I may not know, said I may not know
Said you may not know
But I mean what I mean
But one thing, one thing is certain, baby
I know what I want
And that's to please you, baby, to please you, baby
The one thing is I want you I want you
I need you oh so bad, so bad
I want you
Why, oh, why?

I need you
Baby, baby, baby
I want you
Tell me why
The beautiful ones
They hurt you every timeOoh
The fire is burning
The room's all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance
The carolers sing in the snow
Everybody's laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone's so happy
Except for me tonight because
I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
Ooh, yeah, mmm
I gaze out the window
This cold winter's night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine, yeah
Everybody's smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone's embracing
Except for you and I, baby
I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you, no, no, no, no
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you, oh
Most at Christmas time, oh
In the springtime
Those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
'Til Autumn's leaves are gone
I get by without you
'Til the snow begins to fall and then
I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you, no, no, no, no
Get you off my mind
Every other season
Comes along and I'm alright
But then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
OohBaby, you're all
Oh, baby, yeah
Ooh yeah, yeah, baby
You oughta know
I'm just alone
And I would never let you down
There shouldn't be uncertainty
No I would never play around
No baby don't be so insecure
Nobody's gonna steal my heart away
Just trust me
Our loving will endure
If I'm the only one for you boy
And you're the only one for me
Baby you're all I live for
All I have
Till forever
Good or bad
Everything that I adore
Baby you're all I live for
When I'm away
Don't be afraid
Baby you're always on my mind
Though we're apart
You're in my heart
Baby your love keeps me alive
Darling you're everything to me
No other love could ever take your place
There's no need for pain and jealousy
'Cause you're the only thing I treasure
And you're the only one I need
Baby you're all I live for
All I have
Till forever
Good or bad 
Everything that I adore
Baby you're all I live for
And our love will shine 
Oh, shine forever more
Time after time 
Baby I find myself falling
Deeper than before
Baby you're all...
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Baby you're all I live for
All I need
Till forever 
Good or bad 
Everything that I adore 
All I live for
Baby, you're all...In Excelsis Deo

For you
Ah 
Baby, it's all for youNow you're shining, now you're shining
Shining like a sunflower up in the sky
Shining like a sunflower up in the sky
Thank you for forgiving
Hurtful things I've done
As a child, adolescent or woman
Thank you for embracing a flaxen-haired baby
Although I'm aware you had your doubts
I guess anybody have a doubt
Please be at peace, father
I'm at peace with you
Bitterness isn't worth clinging to
After all the anguish we've all been through
Thank you for the mountains
The lake of the clouds
I'm picturing you and me there, right now
As the crystal cascades showered down
Strange to feel that proud, strong man
Grip tightly to my hand
Hard to see the life inside
Wane as the days went by
Trying to preserve each word
He murmured in my ear
Watch part of my life disappear
Father, thanks for reaching out and lovingly
Saying that you've always been proud of me
I needed to feel that so desperately
You're always alive inside of me Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone, you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love
I look into your eyes
You turn the other way
And now I realize
It's all a game you play
I hold you in the night
And wake to find you gone
You're running out of sight
It's so hard holding on
All alone in love
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone, you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love
You haunt me in my dreams
I'm calling out your name
I watch you fade away
Your love is not the same
I figured out your style
To quickly drift apart
You held me for a while
Planned it from the start
All alone in love
Sitting in the dark without you
How am I supposed to make it
Through the night
Slowly fall apart without you
Cry away the hours
'Till the morning light
Swept me away
But now I'm lost in the dark
Set me on fire
But now I'm left with a spark
Alone you got beyond the haze and
I'm lost inside the maze
I guess I'm all alone in love
I guess I'm all alone
Guess I'm all alone in love
Oh yeah
I'm so all alone
All alone in loveBaby
I've had enough of danger
And people on the streets
I'm looking out for angels
Just trying to find some peace
Now I think it's time
That you let me know
So if you love me, say you love me
But if you don’t, just let me go
'cause teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
And the last one I had
Made me cry
So I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
Because it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
When you were just a stranger
And I was at your feet
I didn't feel the danger
Now I feel the heat
That look in your eyes
Telling me no
So you think that you love me
Know that you need me
I wrote the song, I know it's wrong
Just let me go
And teacher
There are things that I don't want to learn
Oh, the last one I had
Made me cry
Oh so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause it ain't no joy
For an uptown boy
Whose teacher has told him
Goodbye, goodbye, goodbye
Who is that teacher?
I'm the student
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Boy I'm just gonna say goodbye
You are my teacher
You are my leader
So when you say that you need me
That you'll never leave me
I know you're wrong, you're not that strong
Let me go
And teacher
There are things that I still have to learn
But the one thing I have is my pride
Oh, so I don't want to learn to
Hold you, touch you
Think that you're mine
'cause there ain't no joy
Just an uptown boy
Who just isn't willing to try
I'm so cold inside
Maybe just one more tryThe wind has taken you
You're free finally at peace
So still you lie
Leaving your cares behind
The pain is gone
Gone with the spirit in your eyes
Now you're wandering around
Above us
Looking downward
As we cry
You've flown into the wind
Escaping all the hurt within
Took to
To the sky
Leaving the world behind
So young to die
How could you let it all pass you by?
And to the wind go so many dreams
That you held inside
Now you're just a memory
Burning in my mind
So young to die
How could you let life pass you by?
And now you'll never know I loved you
And now you'll never know I cared
I really loved you
And now you'll never know
You'll only fade
Into the windSee it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved on
So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
What can I say, I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
And in my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so
Your heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby, just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush inShattered dreams
Cut through my mind
Tragically our love has died
Memories confine my head
Bitterly I face the end
Trustingly, I gave my self to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies
And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be in love
Stranded here
In nothingness
With only tears
And loneliness
Foolishly, I gave my soul to you
I let you inside
Believing your lies
And you don't remember
Every time you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
And you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together
How you needed me
How we used to be
Helplessly, I fell so deep
I was so naive to let you in
Why did I let you in
To my heart
And you don't remember
Anything that you told me
You were mine forever
For eternity
Yes, you will
I know you don't remember
How you used to hold me
How we'd melt together, together
How you needed me
How we used to be in loveI can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you go
I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you go
I can't wait to hate you make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
At night I think of you
I want to be your lady baby
I still love you, boo
Can't wait to hate you
I just can't go on
Cause I gave my all to you
Ooh this was a love phenomenon no one could explain
And I wish I could press reset and feel that feeling again
I sit and press rewind and watch us every night
Wanna pause it but I can't make it stay
Just gotta let it play
We went round for round till we knocked love out
Laying in the ring not making a sound
And I just wanna hold you, touch you
Feel you, be near you
I miss you baby baby baby
I'm tired of tryin to fake through
But there's nothing I can do
Boy I can't wait to hate you
I can't wait to hate you make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
Ooh shawty hate me
No longer wants to date me
She say that I'm a lost cause
She even hate my dirty drawers
Tryin' to keep it real
Every time she try to shake me off
I'm ok, I'll be good
Everyday filet mignon
H.A.T.E on Young Juice
But you can't leave the Juiceman 'lone
Every time I come around
You sneak and try to use your phone
Girl you should know that
Juiceman ride 'round on this chrome
Insane jewelry, dirty pinky
Half a million on my home
At night I think of you
I want to be your little baby
I still love you, boo
Can't wait to hate you
I just can't go on
Cause I gave my all to you
I can't wait to hate, no escape
The situation is not that great
So, I know we ain't A-1
There's a lot at stake, hear what I say hun
Since day one, I was the real deal
No beef, just me and this whip appeal
I just wanna peel off in the whip
Feel me before somebody gets killed
Really, I kinda see it all as spilled milk
Let that cat get it up
This time no regrets, no worries
Snow flurries, snow blizzards, cold shoulder
Cold blooded, snow lizard
And now that I'm older, I told her
To go find something to play wit
I'm colder than a polar bears toe nails
Then I showed her to the door, playa
Yellow like my Lamborghini
Got her in a red bikini
So much money, make a wish
I can be your dream of genie
Many plenty women dig me
So much jewelry they should chrome me
Got her girlfriends hatin' on me
She can't wait to leave me lonely
Phantoms in Atlanta madam
Damn we such a major tell 'em
Incense oils and scented candles
Leave me you'll be crazy baby
Me you can go crazy places
Fly you, buy you crazy bracelets
Lately I been workin crazy
I know that you waitin patient
Late at night you think of me
If was you I'd quit me
Always out there chasin money
I feel you, ironically
Gucci mane make money ski
All these boys be hatin on me
I thought you'd stay down with me
You got me back in the streets
I can't wait to hate you make you pain like I do
Still can't shake you off
I can't wait to break through these emotional changes
Seems like such a lost cause
At night I think of you
I want to be your little baby
I still love you, boo
Can't wait to hate you
I just can't go on
Cause I gave my all to you
I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you go
I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you go
I can't wait to H.A.T.E.U
Cause right now I need you
Can't wait to make you goBut why? Why...
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
And you hoppin' in that Benz truck, callin' all your friends up
Twisted off the liquor, talkin' crazy, can't stand up
Twisted off the vodka, drink some water
And I'm goin' crazy tryna get my life in order
Every time we pull up all my dogs got their hood up
I was tryna pull my hood up, got me ridin' with my hood up, Lord
From the bottom to the top and you know it
Leavin' one eye open, baby, like Fetty Wap
We be grindin' to the top, we never folding
Bad bitches, they be callin', European cars rollin'
Why you mad? Talkin' 'bout you're mad
Could it be that you just lost the best you've ever had?
That’s your bad, yup, that’s too bad
Show is over, you ain’t gotta act
Close the door, lose the key
Leave my heart on the mat for me
I was yours eternally, there’s an end to infinity
To infinity, to infinity
It's like every time you call me, you know I can't leave you lonely
Cause I was always there when you need me, you said that you'd be there 'til the end
What must I say? I never thought it would happen this way
But I can tell you're down again, yeah and I'mma fall, stayin' to the end
Yeah, it started fuck you and your opinion, my heart cold, got no feelin'
Turnt up, got no ceilin', can't come down, no thank you
I know I'm no angel and I don't know why I go straight to danger
Can't explain it, lil suspicion done drove her crazy
And now she goin' through my phone, shit doin' what she wants
You're surely delusional, losin' your mind right now but I bet you'll miss me when I'm gone
Get the fuckin' with the suckas if you want, you finna go out back, know I had it and lost it
Know I'm mad, but hold up how you know I'm mad though?
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Baby why you mad? Go on, tell me why you're mad
Packin' shit up in your bag and you're leavin' out the back
Why you mad?

Here's your standing O
Boy, you remind me of a love that seemed so sublime
Your kisses told me, oh, so many lies
Shades on like I am stuntin' through the night
But I'm just hiding puffy eyes
To keep the world from knowing what's inside
I didn't know oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh
I was a show oh, oh, oh, oh-oh-oh

The parts of affection you couldn't see
As you embrace her in your arms, give her "my all"
Give her more than you gave to me
When you had nothing, I gave
When you were weak, I made you brave
You wanna leave me with the scars on my heart
It's funny how y'all forget it all

I'm so sorry, but you had your chance baby
I'm so sorry, but you had your chance baby
I'm so sorry, but you had your chance baby
I'm so sorry, but you had your chance baby
Well, it's been a while
Since I looked into your eyes
Never dreamed I'd see you tonight
And it's interesting that I
Just don't feel a thing
For the so called love of my life
We used to be close
We used to be best friends
I let you into my soul
It took me so long to forget
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chance
See, I spent so many sleepless nights
Trying to block you from my mind
I was so convinced
I'd die without you once upon a time
Now my eyes are open and I can see
You were devious and shady
Only trifling with me
We used to be close
We used to be best friends
I let you into my soul
It took me so long to forget
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chance
Where are you when I needed you most?
Would've done anything to hold you close
Would've given the whole world to be back in your arms
But you left me so torn apart
And now you want me back again
After my heartache and suffering
I was your fool
But that's all in the past
So sorry, boy, but you had your chanceGypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin' for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go
Oh — I'm sorry, but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh, can't you see?
You got the best of me
Whoa, can't you see?
You're bringin' on the heartbreak

Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on
Don't you know? Don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
Ex-girlfriend, you don't listen
Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
Hey ex-girlfriend
It's too bad when you had him your thing didn't work
But he's all mine now, so stop pursuing him
Before you get your feelings hurt
See, our love is hot and no, it won't stop
'Cause I got him on lock
And although he rejects you
It doesn't seem to affect you
'Cause you just keep trying to get with him
So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer, I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Til I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again?
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on

Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
Hey ex-girlfriend, whatever your name is
I'm really not amused
'Cause the things you do are very offensive
And sometimes straight up rude
All those late night calls and notes on his car
Won't get you anywhere
You can call his mom as much as you want
And he won't really care
So don't, don't keep, keep calling
Hanging up the phone
When I answer, I know it
Tears you up inside and
Why do you sit in silence
On the other end
'Til I hang up and you
Predictably call right back again?
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on

Stop trying, he's not gonna give in
He's not yours anymore, don't you know?
You gotta let him go, let him go, let him go
I understand why
You want him back
But you need to know
Our love's too strong for you to penetrate
It's too late, he's not your baby no more
Ex-girlfriend, ex-girlfriend
Ex-girlfriend
Ex-girlfriend
See, he's not gonna give in
Ex-girlfriend, you can't have him
It's about time that you found you a new man

It's about time that you found you a new man
He's moved on

You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah
Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute
But I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was... blind
You kept playin' with my... mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and...
Rear view, bye
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back

You go hard for them
You don't ever ever wanna be apart from them
It's like I won, and you become a part of them
You hold them soft and still go hard for them
But instead of lookin' at how far we've come
I'm regrettin' it, damn, are you done?
Wanted kids and thought you fathered them
Now? I wouldn't even bother, hon
You see I never had a clue that harm would come
And I really loved you and now I'm done
See I got my car and it's started up
And I'll be long gone when your karma come
Had me believe I was wife
I really thought this was life
But now I'm finished, it's back to business

I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Hey boy, what's going on?
Thanks, I'm doing okay
Don't believe rumors- hey
How's your family?
Please say hello for me
Guess we've both grown up a bit
But I have to admit
It really still feels good
Here by your side
Sitting right next to you
Just like I used to do
You know we can't deny
No one else in our lives
Holds a candle to, you and I
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
So here we are again
All by ourselves
So familiar, you know
That it actually almost feels like deja vu
Of that night on the roof
We kissed under the sky amid the city lights
A sudden flashback to so long ago
In the dark, all alone
With our bodies this close
Guess some things never change
'Cause I still melt away
When you touch me
And say my name
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
I Should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
It still feels, feels good
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise
So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonight
I should just hug you goodbye
But I just can't walk away from paradise

So I guess I'll sing you that sweet lullaby
And we can revisit us one more time
Yes, I'll come home with you tonightOoh, yeah
Lord, I pray
That in my lifetime there will come a day
When the world will wake up with unclouded eyes
And there'll be no more need to cry
Won’t you bring that dream to life?
Oh Lord, I pray
Deliver us from bigotry and hate
Please give shelter to the wayward children
And comfort them and keep them safe
Oh Lord, I pray
For a world with no weapons one day
Please give wisdom to the ones who lead us
Jesus, help them find thеir way
Oh, I'm praying that the love you shower down on us
Will lift us up and wе will live as one
I know there'll come a day
I know you’ll make a way
Please listen as I pray
Lord, I pray 
That in my lifetime there will come a day
When the world will wake up with unclouded eyes
And there'll be no more need to cry
Won't you bring that dream to life?
Lord, I pray 
That in my lifetime there will come a day 
When we all can open up our hearts and minds
And see we're all the same inside
Won't you bring that dream to life?
Won't you bring that dream to life?It's Mariah

Night and day 
Why I gotta fight to keep 'em all away? 
They crammin' but they know they can't have none
Obsessin', but they messin' with the wrong one
I ain't who you think I'm is
I will snatch off all this ish

And I won't hear you laugh anymore
Every night I won't see you walk
Through that door
'Cause time wasn't on your side
It isn't right
I can't say I love you
It's too late to tell you
But I really need you to know
Oh, baby, no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
Now baby, can you hear me?
Wherever you may be tonight
Are you near me?
I need you to be by my side
'Cause I never said goodbye
It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you?
God knows I need you to know
Oh, baby, no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
Somewhere I know you'll be with me
Someday in another time
But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
Oh, you will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
No, I'll never forget you 
I'll never let you out of my heart

I know you don't believe that it's over like that 
You know you still love me 
And I love you too
You know this ain't gon' be our last kiss
Nah, I know you don't believe that it's over like that
Feels so empty inside since our last kiss goodbye
Picture you in my mind and I can't seem to rationalize
The way we let it end
It just don't make no sense
This can't be happening
I need you back again
Everybody asking questions
Like we're some kind of obsession
For the millionth time asking
I'm like, "Uhh, just let it rest"
Can I get a minute to breathe?
They're like, "Nope!
What's up with you and so an so?"

But in my heart I know this 
Ain't gon' be our last kiss

What we got is still somethin' somethin'
Oh, this feelin' is too good to miss 
And ain't no kiss gon' ever be our last kiss

You said you'd never leave me so I'll keep believing that eventually
We gon' kiss away the hurt, do it like it were
And wake up how we used to be
Never let it go get it right
Bring it back home, stay for life
Call it what you want, it's in your eyes
We gon' make it through this, I'll prove it
Somethin' 'bout our love will not fade away
Always everlasting and

'Cause them regular folk went home, yeah-yeah
I need you, come on
Touching you in dreams of blue
In a mesmerizing interlude
Half asleep, semi conscious
But I know this feeling ain't gon' pass
The moments that we shared seem so very real
Undeniably so
Tough guy exterior but, ooh, I got a glimpse
You're falling in love
And you'll never be the same again, mesmerized

I don't miss my dogs, I'm wishing the days could go fast
So I could crash, close my eyes
Try to go to sleep and bring you back
But I can't bring you back, nah, can't bring you back
So I back, back memories of us acting bad
Wish time could freeze but our time is up
And I promise ya, I'ma hold it down
'Til it's my time to leave, and I'm okay
I mean, I'm alright, not okay
And it hurts my soul I won't see your face
But if you truly are in a better place
Like what they say, then that's okay
I'll be aright, I've been up all night
Like if I'm di-di-dipping with my nigga
Living with the time tick-tick-tick-ticking away
So forever I'm forever
I'm in search of yesterday 
Like a Beatles song, I close my eyes
Repeat the song, tryna bring us back to where we belong
Middle of the club where B was on, adidas on
Blowing on stank like Cheech and Chong
Going back and forth between Monique and Dawn
So when I meet the Don
You should know I meet back up with my dog when I go
So when time say "Goodbye" we'll say "Hello"

Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
Bye, bye, bye, bye, bye, bye
And you never got a chance to see how good I've done
And you never got to see me back at number one
I wish that you were here to celebrate together
I wish that we could spend the holidays together
I remember when you used to tuck me in at night
With the teddy bear you gave to me that I held so tight
I thought you were so strong, you'd make it through whatever
It's so hard to accept the fact you're gone forever
I never knew I could hurt like this
And every day life rolls on
I wish I could talk to you for a while
Miss you, but I try not to cry
As time goes by 
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye 
This is for my peoples who just lost somebody
Your best friend, your baby, your man or your lady
Put your hand way up high
We will never say bye 
Mama's, daddies, sisters, brothers, friends and cousins
This is for my peoples who lost their grandmothers
Lift your head to the sky, 'cause we will never say bye
Bye
Never knew I could hurt like this 
And every day life rolls on 
I wish I could talk to you for a while 
Miss you, but I try not to cry 
As time goes by 
And it's true that you've reached a better place
Still, I'd give the world to see your face
And be right here next to you 
But it's like you're gone too soon
Now the hardest thing to do is say bye bye
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye, bye bye 
Bye bye, bye bye Mmm, yeah
Mmm
Let me tell you something, baby
Ooh, ooh-ooh-ooh, yeah
I wish I understood why I can't get over you at all
You pushed me to the side, but I come a-running when you call
You step outside my life and you leave me waiting for a sign 
And then you come around
Give me your apologies and I don't mind
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? 
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change 
I'm tryin' to believe you won't go away again this time, oh no
But something deep inside tells me
That you're gonna change your mind
Well, I'll never pin you down
Makes me wonder why I even try, Lord, oh
You say you'll stick around
But somehow, I know you'll say goodbye
Here we go around again 
One more time
Will it ever end? 
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change 
Here we go around again 
One more time 
Will it ever end? 
Here we go around again
It's all the same
Never gonna change
First you leave me
Then you keep me
Waitin' around til you come back again 
Make your mind up
'Cause it's so tough
When I don't know if I'm with or without your love
Love, ooh baby
Your love, hey hey
Uh-huh, oh yes
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? 
Here we go around again 
It's all the same
Never gonna change 
Here we go around again
One more time
Will it ever end? 
Here we go around again 
It's all the same 
Never gonna change 
Here we go around again 
Here we go around again 
Here we go around again 
Here we go around again
The end of that was... iffyA broken man without a home
Desperate and so alone
A victim of society
No one really wants to see
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just help each other?
Isn't there enough to share?
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change 
In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we accept each other?
Can't we make ourselves aware?
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change 
And maybe then the future will be a time
Without war, destitution and sorrow
And hungry children won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow
Come on, come on
Some of us don't even wonder
Some of us don't even care
Couldn't we just love each other?
Isn't there enough to share?
Come together to relieve the pain 
There's got to be a way
And together we'll bring on a change
There's got to be, there's got to be
There's got to, got to, got to be a wayWe've known each other for a long, long time
But I never really noticed all the magic in your eyes
I've been around you a thousand times before
And you've always been a friend to me
But now I'm wanting more
I must have been so blind, I never realized
You're the one that's right for me
All the while I couldn't see
And now I feel so strange
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And I don't know what to do 'cause, baby
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love with you
There's no explaining how I feel inside
I'm going through a transformation that's so hard for me to hide
I had a revelation that finally opened up my eyes
The one I spent a lifetime searching for was right here all the time
I was oblivious, so very out of touch
All the while I couldn't see
You're the one that's right for me
And now my world has changed
I'll never be the same
I'm going 'round and 'round in circles
And it's all because of you, sweet baby
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways 
I've been thinking about you 
It's unbelievable to me 
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love with you
I've been thinking about you, baby, baby, baby
In the most peculiar ways 
I've been thinking about you 
It's unbelievable to me 
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love with you
Don't you know that you're blowing my mind?
What you do to me, I can't describe 
Baby, I can't hold back anymore
I just can't conceal it
You're the one I really adore
I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways 
I've been thinking about you 
In the most peculiar ways 
I've been thinking about you
I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinkin', thinkin', thinkin', thinkin' about you
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I've been thinking about you
In the most peculiar ways
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling, I'm falling
In the most peculiar ways 
I've been thinking about you
It's unbelievable to me
But suddenly I think I'm falling in love with youCome here

I wasn't trying to lead you on
Now you bring me home
And tell me "goodnight"'s not enough for you
I'm sorry, baby
I didn’t mean to turn you on
You read me wrong
I wasn't trying to lead you on
I want a friend
I didn’t mean to turn you on
Ho, I didn't mean to turn you on
I know you expected a one night stand
When I refused I knew you wouldn't understand
Boy, I told you twice
I was only trying to be nice, only trying to be nice
Oh, I didn't mean to turn you on, ho
Turn you on
Tell me why should I feel guilty 'cause I won't give
Guilty 'cause I won't give in?
I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
Ho, I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
I didn’t mean to turn you on
I didn’t mean to turn you on
You know I didn’t mean to turn you on, baby
You think that I'm a fool
'Cause I wouldn't play by your rules
You don't stand a chance
All I want to do is dance with you
I told you twice I was only trying to be nice
I loved you for a friend
But I guess this is the end of our relationship
'Cause I didn’t mean to turn you on
I didn’t mean to turn you on
I didn’t mean to turn you on
I didn’t mean to turn you on
Ho, I didn’t mean to turn you on, babyThe whole world feels a little bit more love
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go
There's people singing "Let It Snow"
And hanging up that mistletoe
And me and you gonna have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we gon' kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait
Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes
So many souls hurt
So many don't have enough
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
But baby if you spread love
Someday it might be enough
To heal each other one by one
And we gon' get together and rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout because the Savior reigns
So don't dismay
Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes
It's gon' be alright
When Christmas comes
Oh, jingle all the way
Oh what fun
And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
And we gon' laugh together as the children play
And through the years it's always gonna be this way
Come what may
Because this Christmas time, get together
It's gonna be so nice
Better than ever
And baby you're the one that I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
When Christmas comesIf you only knew
What I feel for you
If you only lived for me
The way I lived for you
I'd be in Heaven
My dreams would come true
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you
If you were my own
To caress and hold
I would shower you with love
And drown within your soul
'Cause I live and breathe for you
And I really need you to know
That all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you
Everything I do is for you
You are every part of me
And I don't want to face
Another day
Alone
Without your love
'Cause all I've ever wanted
Is you
And you alone
And I love you so
More than you could ever know
All I've ever wanted
Is you
All I've ever wanted
Is you
Is you
YouLord only knows
Why I love you so
You're a heartless man
I don't understand
Why you gotta be
Why do you need to be so cold?
So cold, how can you be
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
You play games with my mind
Cheat and lie time after time
And I know you'll never change
But I just can't break away
I don't know why
I let you treat me the way you do
You're just no good for me
I wish I never fell for you
You are
So cold, how can you be 
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold, so cold
So many times
You keep me waiting around endlessly
You just laugh as I drown in despair
Never a worry, never a care
I don't know why
I let you hurt me the way you do
You've got a spell on me
I'm hopelessly in love with you
You are
So cold, how can you be 
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
So cold, how can you be 
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold, don't even feel
Your kiss is on fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
Made of stone
Oh, you're wicked to the bone
I give you my heart
You tear me apart
You're like a devil in  disguise
So cold
So cold  how can you be 
So cold , so cruel to me?
Ice cold , don't even feel
So cold, how can you be
So cold, so cruel to me?
Ice cold , don't even feel
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so cold
So cold, ice cold 
Your kiss is like fire
But deep down inside you're so coldSlippin', slidin', glidin'
Low ridin' 
Ain't no hidin' from this hit 
Fool, you know how we do it 
Just keep it poppin', ain't no stoppin'
Fo' hoppin', ass droppin'
Keep it poppin', ain't no stoppin' 
Fo' hoppin' ass droppin'

Everytime I try to leave
Something pulls me back, baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible 
Every time we say goodbye 
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so 
But you're irresistible 
I don't wanna lose you to somebody else
But I can't go on contradicting myself
I know that it's pointless to keep holding on
But something inside tells me you're where I belong
Every time I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Every time we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible
I know that it's unrealistic to think
That things will get better between you and me
'Cause time after time, you just shatter my heart
But when I'm without you, I feel so torn apart
Every time I try to leave
Something pulls me back baby
Tried and tried to let you go
But it's just impossible
Every time we say goodbye
Bitter tear drops fill my eyes
Wish I didn't need you so
But you're irresistible
Boy, I wish
That I didn't love you so
I try to tell you no
But you're irresistible
Westside, Westside
She's comin' to the Westside, Westside 
Mariah's on the Westside, Westside 
Hittin' on the Westside, Westside
Ain't nothin' goin' on but a party and a hit song
Jumpin' all night long
It's like times gettin' deeper and the game's gettin flier
'cause the Westside done connected with Mariah
I hit the Grammy party and the 64 is what I drove through
'cause divas like thugs too
Mack 10, I'm so so gangsta with meals
And I ain't lyin' that's on everything I'm keepin' it real
Can you feel it nothin' can save ya
From this young rider with big wheels and paper
The Millenium Clyde and Bonnie, doin' 90
With Giovannis on the big body
Ya friends say "Girl he ain't lovin' ya right"
You stay down with this thug in ya life
What we got is deeper than physical
Dub C and Mariah, gangsta lovin' is irresistible
See I only want it to be like it was
When we got together and first fell in love
Sometimes it's just like I'm addicted to you
This love's so consuming
I don't know what to do

But you're irresistible I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight
Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing
I hear those sleigh bells ringing
Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for
I just want to see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you baby
All I want for Christmas is you babyDo you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Now looking back on all we've planned
We let so many dreams slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see 
How sad the answer to those questions can be?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know, baby?
Mmm, mmm
Mmm, mmm, mmm
Baby
MmmWhy we make up just to break up?
Wanna be together, but the world tryna takes us
In different directions and ain't even tell us to treasure the blessings collected
But hold on up wait a second, caught up in my recollection
I remember that body you flexing
Baby, me and you was all night sexing
Your boy put it down, didn't he?
You told me you'd never forget
First time that you let me hit it
Got on top of it and just rode it, rode it
All night long, shoulda been all life long
Me and you cheating, won't right no wrongs
But, what a good memory, we'll stay strong
Now I know I've met a lot of other women in my lifetime
I've still never met none like you
So I'm never, said I'm never, given up the pleasure, not ever
I know, you was the only one true to me
I shoulda thugged you so much more
'Cause it shows, through do everything you do for me
You kept it real with your boy
Believe me, I remember them days
When nothing came between me and you
We be straight up doing our thang
When you be next to me, we in ecstasy
I'mma love it, I'mma never leave it cause that's all we got
Keep me in your memory...
And don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine 
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about
Let me brush my shoulders off real quick man
Aye Mimi baby, you need me baby?
You know I know how to treat a lady
See a girl like you, need a guy like me
Not a busta like that, sucka like that
Soon as you leave, he gon' want you right back
He don't want you like that
I want you like that
She like, baby no, she like baby don't
I'm like baby you know your baby won't leave you in the cold like that
 I ain't new to this, I'm true to this
I treat you like when I was moving bricks
That's serious, baby I'm serious
I ain't talking materialistic
I'm talking serious business
I'm talking about the wish of wishes
Don't you wish you get this?
I know you sick, I know you tired
I know you sick of being sick and tired
X him out, count me in
You don't need to be with a clown like him
So don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about usWait a minute before you walk away
Let me finish, I've got a lot to say
Baby, I'm not gonna tolerate
This game that you play
You'll regret it if you desert me this way
When there's nobody to dry your eyes
Suddenly you're gonna realize
Don't you know you need me?
Don't you see?
Believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby, remember, you need me
Honey, listen
Don't make a big mistake
I'm in your system
You really can't escape, no, no
When there's nobody to hold your hand
Suddenly you're gonna understand
Don't you know you need me?
Don't you see?
Believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby, remember, you need me
Don't you know you need me?
Don't you see?
Got to believe me
Before you act so hastily
Baby, remember, you need me
No one understands you like I do
After everything that we've been through
Baby, you can turn around and leave
But I know that you'll keep coming right back to me
Yeah darling, yeah, woah
Don't you know you need me?
Don't you see?
Got to believe me
That before you act so hastily
Baby, remember, you need me

Baby, remember, you need me
Don't you know you need me?
Don't you see?
Believe meWhen our lips touched that morning
I was gone, game over
Held you tight, a fleeting moment
That left me far from sober
So I left that played out mess behind
All that sadness and distress of mine
And we found ourselves suspended yeah
Hovering above the roof mid air
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy

Our love is like we're skydiving
So they say you got some chick
That keeps you warm at night along for the ride but
If you ask me that's bullshit
Because obviously heaven sent you for me
See they never told me about love or life
But I'm learning each moment we fly
Where we land is of no consequence
We’re in tandem, it’s beyond intense
This ain't no jump bumpin'
Wanna play? Skydiving
You and me
Floating on intimacy

You and me got a secret love baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love baby
It was a summer's day when walking by
She didn't notice as as you turned
And you discreetly winked your eye
And I remembered you from back in the day
You were the boy I couldn't breathe without
The one that got away
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love baby
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now baby
But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love baby
Now that I found you, I cannot let you go
You know I got my man at home
But baby I still need you so
And I know you ain't never leaving that girl
But every time you touch me baby
It feels so incredible
Oh baby, oh baby
Come give it to me now baby
But keep it between us
You and me got a secret love baby
Oh baby, oh baby

But keep it on the hush
You're not mine, got a secret love baby

Come give it to me, baby
We got a secret love, darling
Keep it on the hush, babyChristmas time is in the air again
Christmas chimes reminding me of
When we felt like the snow
So deep in love
High above us, the evergreens
Sparkle with lights and feel the breeze
As we made future Christmas memories
Christmas shoppers glance at us and smile
'Cause the mistletoe is occupied
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer with you all year
And not wait 'til the morning
When Christmas time is in the air again
Mr. Grinch simply can't resist
Warming up when he looks our way
Even Old Scrooge makes a Christmas wish
For a honey to hold Christmas day
And to feel love like ours always
La da da, da da da dum
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer
With you all throughout the year
And not wait 'til the morning
When Christmas time is in the air
Christmas time is everywhere
Christmas time is in the air again
Again
And againIf you could only see
That I was not put here for you
To judge me and dispute my innermost truth
And after all these years of enmity, envy, and tears
It's a shame you don't know me at all
I was wondering
Would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?
Those ancient buried recollections
We transform them and select them
You have yours
I have mine
That's fine
While we're too torn to heal
Our stitch has never disappeared
I have mine
You have yours
I'm sure
I was wondering
Would you reach for me
If you saw that I was languishing?
I was wondering, would you cry for me
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?
If I was drowning, suffocating
If I told you that I couldn't breathe?Oh, to the floor, everybody to the floor

Baby I believe in miracles because I'm
Baby I'm forever yours, yours 
I believe in miracles, baby I'm forever yours Once upon a time, you whispered softly in my ear
Loving words and fairy tales that I longed to hear
I gave you my body and soul and you took control
As you slowly swept me up and carried me away
You told me pretty lies
As I held onto you tight
You knew how to get your way
Ignorance was bliss in your warm embrace
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away 
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Every now and then I drown in thoughts of yesterday
And the fool's paradise that you blew away
I feel you beside me again and remember when
You came to my window on a dark and stormy day
Baby, I need you now 
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away 
But you still haunt me
Long ago you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me 
Take me back to yesterday
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
So long ago, so long ago, so long ago
Baby, I need you now 
'Cause tonight I'm crumbling down
Sinking in the memories
Shadows of you keep washing over me
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
And take me back to yesterday
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt me
So long ago
Long ago, you used to want me
Now it's all so far away
But you still haunt meI'd never have known
The way it feels to love
Without the love you showered down upon me
Warm, warm as the sun
Melting away the rain
Giving me strength to face another morning
So many times I felt afraid
And turned to you to find my way
I reach inside and find you there
You go with me everywhere
All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm
Never alone
'Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me
I won't let go
Of precious memories
They are the light of hope that burns inside me
And every time I lose my way
You shine for me and I'm okay
You lift me way beyond it all
And you never let me fall
All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm never alone
'Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me
You'll always catch me when I fall
All
It would take all
All of my life to find
Someone more there for me
There for me
And I'm never alone
'Cause in my heart I know
You're always there for me
There for me
My love
You're always there for meThe way it feels to fly
The way it feels to fly
Runway, runway, runway
They’ll come a day when we won’t have to fight
Won’t be about who is wrong, who is right
Like fireflies, emanating the light
Just you and I, universally tied
There’s truth for those if they want to hear
Somewhere out in the atmosphere
To survive gotta persevere
Cause to fly, gotta have no fear
First they love you, like oh it's just you and
Then they bait you and try to change you
You can push through it, stay the same you and
Never let them bring you down 
Remember there’s only one you 
There’s a God up above you 
You can soar above the hurt when it taunts you
Float like a hummingbird if you want to
Let love be your runway, there is a higher place
Just embrace that feeling when you’re rising
And your face is kissing the horizon
And if they count you out
Let go and watch you drown
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, keep kissing the horizon
Runway, yeah yeah
Runway, yeah yeah yeah
Just shake off those demons that you’re fighting
Win the race, let love be your runway

The way it feels to flyI am a dream, just beginning
Truth is I prayed and you opened my eyes
And you revealed something to me
Suddenly I am no longer confined
To a life that's defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I'm a break through the door 'til I get in
Everything that I got I'm a give it
100 percent and I ain't stopping 'til I reach the finish
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, one hundred percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it one hundred percent, so go on put your ones up
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know you can do something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent
You can only do it if you do it like I did
Cause suffering ain't easy
But if you can turn your wounds into living proof
That you've survived the fight and you're no longer defined
To a life that's defined by limits
I don't need no permission to live it
I was a break thru the door till I get in
Everything that I got Ima give it
100 percent and I won't stop till I reach the finish
I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
I'm giving everything I got
I'm a go getter, one hundred percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I am givin it one hundred percent, so go on put your ones up
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know you can do something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent
Don't you ever 
Be discouraged 
Let nobody take your courage 
If you gonna pray don't worry 
If you gonna worry don't pray 
You just keep the faith and listen to me
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know you can do something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent
 I'm a believer, not just a dreamer
 I'm giving everything I got
 I'm a go getter, one hundred percenter
Undoubtedly I can reach the top
And I ain't gonna let nothing discourage or dissuade me
Cause I'm walking out of here a champion either way, babe
I gotta give one hundred percent, so go on put your ones up
If you're putting in a hundred put your ones up, ones up
If you know you can do something, put your ones up, ones up
If you really comprehend this, put your ones up, ones up
If you're walking into victory keep on shining
One hundred percent I've still got a lot to learn
But, at least I know where I can turn
When I'm in my times of need
Just as long 
Just as long as I believe
Oh, yes
I've loved a lot, hurt a lot
Been burned a lot in my life and times
Spent precious years wrapped up in fears
With no end in sight
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my saving grace within you
Yes, I've been bruised
Grew up confused
Been destitute
I've seen life from many sides
Been stigmatized
Been black and white
Felt inferior inside
Until my saving grace shined on me
Until my saving grace set me free
Giving me peace
Giving me strength when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
I found my saving grace within you
And the bountiful things that you do
Lord thank you
For delivering me
And giving me peace
Giving me strength
Giving me hope when I'd
Almost lost it all
Catching my every fall
I still exist because you kept me safe
Always my saving grace
Pulls me through
I found my saving grace within you
Within you
Yes Lord
My saving grace Lord is
YouLying beside you
This joy is so deep
I reach out and touch you
Tenderly
Looking inside you
My world is complete
I struggled to find you
Now I'm free
Precious love
Burning so deeply
Shining completely
For you
So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now
Is all I need
Adrift in the moment
So sacred and pure
Alive for you only
I am yours
As you touch me so sweetly
And you whisper my name
I feel how you love me
We are the same
Precious one
Don't ever leave me
Forever need me
This way
So blessed
Amazingly
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now
Is all I need
Stay with me
Beyond the end
I treasure you
'Cause you made me whole again
So, so blessed
Amazingly blessed
Touching you now
Awakens me
You are my heart
My everything
Feeling you now
Is all I, all I really need
Feeling you now
Is all I needIt's just the way
It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I had a crush on you
Painstakingly I would conceal the truth
You probably always knew
But I was timid like a child
Inhibited and way too shy
I'd glance but then avert my eyes
All twisted up in my desire
But I am not that girl today
Ain't got a lot of time for games
I've waited and I've waited
Now it's time for me to tell you 'bout the way
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby
 Oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day, day
Baby, I was so into you
Now I wonder why I never pursued you
The way I wanted to, oh, no
Kiss me and touch me and
Immerse your love in mine
 I'll keep unraveling
As we explore our fantasies tonight
Tell me what you like
Now show me what you like, show me
It's just they way I want you, baby
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
 Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Why it's just the way?
Why it's just the way?
Oh, it's just the way I feel about you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I feel about you every night and day
Oh, it's just the way I feel about you every night and day
It's just they way I want you, baby, oh, so bad
Every night and everyday
Must we hesitate?
It's just the feeling that comes over me
I cannot alleviate
Please don't make me wait
It's just the way I want you, baby
 Oh, so bad
Every night and everyday, day, dayDo you know
How it feels
Lying here without you, baby?
You could never understand what's happening to me
So alone
Nothing's real
I just dream about you, baby
And forever wonder why you had to break free
Even though you're not my lover
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
It's so hard
To believe
I don't have you right beside me
As I long to touch you, but you're out of my reach
And my heart doesn't feel
It's so very cold inside of me
Just a shadow of someone that I used to be
Oh, even though you're not my lover, baby
Even though you're not my friend
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
You were the only one 
That I allowed inside my heart
Now I'm just holding on
To something so far gone
Oh, where did I go wrong?
Even though you're not my lover, baby
And even though you're not my friend 
I would give my all
To have you here
Just to hold you once again
Just to hold you once again]

You know what?, y'all ain't ready for this
You're still scrambling from the damage of the last remix
Most of your stories bore me, y'all love to lie
To my royalties, be the glory
Mariah, Honey B. Fly
Ah, me and B-R, we are
Usually seen in hot spots
Jumpin' outta two seaters
We got Money to make
And many records to break
We not similar to any
So make no mistake
This is So So Def
Oh, honey, you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who
Makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far
Beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another taste of your
Honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin'  for ya, cryin'  for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
I can't be elusive with you, honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
Y'all be saying this and that
But then y'all don't wanna see this new phenomenon
This Don Chi Chi
It's somethin' nasty
Word to B.I.G
I'm in it for life
Dead president for life
And by the minute, I get more nice
I'm the J-E-R, The M-A-I, N, don't forget the E
And she goes by the unforgettable name
Of the B to the R to the A to the T
I like colossal size pieces of rocks
And getting pushed in the Bentley drop top
Undefeated indefinitely
Don't stop
We rock in all kinds of spots, calling all the shots
And y'all knows how we get down
My beliefs is being dolla bill seeker and a Benjamin keeper
Don't mind poppin' the glory
Or slow wind with some clown with seven digit accounts

Who lives inside the golden world
But don't believe
That's all there is to see
You'll never know the real me
She smiles through a thousand tears
And harbors adolescent fears
She dreams of all
That she can never be
She wades in insecurity
And hides herself inside of me
Don't say, "She takes it all for granted"
I'm well aware of all I have
Don't think that I am disenchanted
Please understand
It seems as though I've always been
Somebody outside looking in
Well, here I am for all of them to bleed
But they can't take my heart from me
And they can't bring me to my knees
They'll never know the real meSolo dos cuerpos, jugando a amar
Juntos en la oscuridad
Fuimos queriendo, cada vez más
Nada podía cambiar
El paso del tiempo, nos quiso alejar
Y nuestro amor pudo más
Y ahora estoy frente a ti, amándote
Mi corazón no puede esconder
Que yo sin ti no sé querer
Vuelvo a vivir a tu lado el amor
Que soñé...
Sola en mi cuarto sin tu calor
Fui conociendo el temor
Te quise tanto mi alma te di
Hoy que regresas a mí
Se llena el vacío
Se apaga el dolor
Hoy tengo tu amor
Y ahora estoy frente a ti, amándote
Mi corazón no puede esconder
Que yo sin ti no sé querer
Vuelvo a vivir a tu lado el amor que soñé
Que soñé...Tracklist:1. Cry.

Got me fly and sexy
Something in you gets me so tingly inside
Visions of us in the cut tonight
And I find you so appealing
Definitely feeling you
If you didn't know
Boy, you're the secret I've never told
Bet you think I'm teasing
But I ain't got no reason to deny
The way I feel inside tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like "I want you over and over and over and over again"
Me and you making it last all night
My heart is beating faster all the time
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
Ooh, boy. what you gonna do about it?
Listen, I got stacks like the international house of pancakes
Your man great, got more Rovers then a Land makes
I make hits and I don't care about your damn hate
Can't stop doing it, I just do it for the fans sake
You know this man take trips to Japan
Tell him to try to run out away
What would I land on
'05's my year, '06 ain't stopping
You woke up again and your chart I'm topping
That's how I do it, ma'am
What must I say? 
What must I do 
To show how much
I think about freaking you?
What must I say, what must I do?
To show how much
I think about freaking you?
Tonight, I need your body
Tonight, you got my time
Tonight, you won't be sorry
Tonight, you going be mine 
Bet you think I'm teasing
But I ain't got no reason to deny
The way I feel inside tonight
I just wanna touch you
Put my hands on you and love you
You'll be like "I want you over and over and over and over again"
Me and you making it last all night
My heart is beating faster all the time
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
Ooh, boy what you going to do about it?
Me and you making it last all night
My heart is beating faster all the time
Boy, you don't even know
Everything that flows through my mind
Ooh, boy what you going to do about it?La-da-da
I look at you looking at me
Feels like a feeling meant to be
And as your body moves with mine
It's like I'm lifted out of time
And time again
Patiently I've waited for this moment to arrive
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?
I feel your touch caressing me
This feeling's all I'll ever need
With every kiss from your sweet lips
It's like I'm drifting out of
Time alone will tell
If you feel the way I feel
When I look in your eyes
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?
Time and time and time again 
So patiently I've waited for this moment to arrive
After tonight
Will you remember
How sweet and tenderly
You reached for me
And pulled me closer?
After you go
Baby, will you return to love me
After tonight begins to fade?
After tonight begins to fade
After all, after all, after all
When the morning comes
When the morning comes
After tonight begins to fade

Lighting a ray of hope for me
And now I am free
Free to live
Free to laugh
Free to soar
Free to shine

Baby, when you look my way
You keep on blowing my mind
You keep on making me high
Keep giving me butterflies
And every little thing you do
Just lifts me off of the ground
Heart leaps when you come around
See, I'm just breaking it down
You got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can't imagine
Boy, I'm on a tangent
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
Always tryin' to make believe
It's just a casual thing
You're so unnerving to me
Feels like I'm living a dream
Baby, please don't wake me up
Im lost in the reverie
Drifting ethereally
I'm right where I wanna be
You got everything I need
Just want you to want me
You just can't imagine
Boy, I'm on a tangent
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out

Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
I don't care 'bout nothing but you, baby
I don't care 'bout nothing but you, baby
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And ain't nothing I can do
Turning me upside down
Boy, you got me twisted out
Thoughts of you fill my head
Toss and turn in my bed
'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to do
'Cause I'm sprung over you

'Cause I'm sprung over you
And I don't know, don't know what to doNow that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need 
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymore
I never knew if I could believe in you
I thought I was just a diversion
And you were killing some time
My friends, they told me to leave you
They said you'd never ever ever be mine
But you gave me your love and you said I'm the one
You want for the rest of your life
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want 
I can be what you need 
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymore
I was afraid that it was all a masquerade
And that I was only a plaything
And you would leave me behind
But now I feel so secure
By your side, I can conquer the world
'Cause I gave you my love and I know you're the one
I want for the rest of my life
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want 
I can be what you need 
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymore
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need 
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymore
I really feel it 
I really feel it 
I really feel it
Sweet, sweet ecstasy 
'Cause you opened my eyes and I realize your love is real
It's for real
Now that I know that you want me for me
I can be what you want
I can be what you need 
Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymore
Now that I know that you want me for me

Now that I know that your love is for real
I can finally see 
This is not make believe anymoreSo sweet
In my daydreams
And every night, you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep, but it's a fantasy
Every night, you creep into my dreams
It's so real
In my daydreams
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
In my daydreams
It seems so real
You touch me
You come into my room
Come to me
But it's just a fantasy
It feels so sweet
But it's just a dream
Oh baby, it's just a sweet fantasy
And daydream is all that I can do
I feel raptured over you
In silence I keep it to myself
Come and take me
Don't want nobody else
Take me down
Take me down
And a sweet and sweet
And a sweet so sweet
And a sweet and sweet
And it's deeper than reality
It's just a sweet
It's just so sweet
You're like the kiss of life
You're like the kiss of life
Building in the sky
Boy, you're just a fantasy
Oh baby, you come into my room
But you're just a fantasyChristmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is here
We'll drawing near
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the year
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the yearDoesn't it ever stay?
Must it always fade away?
Couldn't love ever be
Something tangible and real?
Farewell, fair-weather friend
Abandonment returns to taunt me again
I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life for the first time
I only wanted you to be there
When I opened up my eyes
I was caught in your masquerade
Wish I'd stayed beneath my veil
But it just seemed so easy to
Open up myself to you
Once more into the wind
The embers scatter
And the chill settles in
I, I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life for the first time
I only wanted you to be there
When I opened up my eyes, eyes
I only wanted you to stay
Linger and mean the words you said
Foolishly I romanticized
Someone was saving my life for the first time
I only wanted you to be
The one to get me through the night
I only wanted you to be there
When I opened up my eyes
Oh, doesn't it ever stay?
I only wanted you to stay'Cause it's a chanteuse, dahling, I'm a chanteuse
I'm on the stage
Gotta feel it
I'm on the piano, you know how good this feels?
When I was little, I would be in lingerie on the piano
At like, 13
Appropriate? Not really
But it's me, and I can't help it
Lullaby of birdland, that's what I
Always hear when you sigh
Never in my wordland
Could there be ways to reveal
In a phrase how I feel
Have you ever heard two turtle doves
Bill and coo when they love?
That's the kind of magic
Music we make with our lips when wе kiss
And there's a weepy old willow
He rеally knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should say farewell and goodbye
Ooh, lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet, then we'll go
Flyin' high in birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love
And there's a weepy old willow
And he really knows how to cry
That's how I'd cry in my pillow
If you should say
Fare thee well and goodbye
Lullaby of birdland whisper low
Kiss me sweet then we'll go
Flyin' high in birdland
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love
High in the sky up above
All because we're in love
In love
I'm so in love with you, boy
All because we're in love
And all because
I can't live without you
I won't live without you
I'm making up something
But that don't mean nothin' 'cause it's
In love
He said let me grab that
Before it becomes a tangentWoo woo, ugh hey; do the thing!
 Uh oh! Uh oh!
 Watch yourself, get on the floor, move your feet
 Woo eee
There ain't nothing you can do with the man
Except for shake your ass and clap your hands
And bob your head and move your feet
I ain't the type of rapper just to ride a beat
I set the track on fire
I take the roof, the house and let the air out your tires

Let Mystikal move you and Mariah sing

And I'm  truly inspired
Finding my soul 
There in your eyes

Far away to feel you
And I won't hesitate at all
Whenever you call
And I'll always remember
That part of you so tender
I'll be the one to catch your fall
Whenever you call
And I will breathe for you each day
Comfort you through all the pain
Gently kiss your fears away
You can turn to me and cry
Always understand that I
Give you all I have inside

Far away to feel you

The angels did say
Was to certain poor shepherds
In fields as they lay
In fields where they lay
Keeping their sheep
On a cold winter's night
That was so deep
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
Noel, Noel, Noel, Noel
Born is the King of Israel
They looked up
And saw a star
Shining in the East
Beyond them far
And to the Earth
It gave great light
And so it continued
Both day and night

On Christmas dayFeels so good, oh baby
I see my ma' Mimi in Waikiki
With the Marabou slippers I kick it
It's Mary Poppins in the Harry Winston and the
World ain't ready for your La Perla teddy
And I'm thrilled to have you
Can't keep a L but it's well
How you rock Van Cleef & Arpels
Château le Tour or Château Lafite
Lounge on the shore, mags on the beach
Cats on the streets, friends on the block
Back on my feet, Cam's on the clock
Army with two liners but it's you shinin'
Why you need pink you got blue diamonds
I can't help it
When I'm not around you
Cause all I ever seem to do is drift away
In dreams about you
Cause when I'm without you
It always seems like part of me is missing baby
Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all
 I need you  adore you 
Gotta have you 
I wanna feel your touch
This ain't no little crush
So come and get my love

Just waiting on you 
When I see you 
I'm gonna wrap you up
Inside my love
And never let you go boy

My heart races when my Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings
I just make a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
Cause when I know you're thinking of me
Heaven knows
Suddenly it's not so dismal baby
Sometimes I don't call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile

Of the highest One
And Mary believed
The word she received of God's only son
The Virgin rejoiced
Gave thanks to the Lord
And as Joseph dreamt
The angel was sent with tidings of peace and joy
Of the blessed baby boy
They travelled for miles
To reach Bethlehem
Yet when they arrived
No one could provide a place at the inn for them
But God kept them safe
From hurt, harm and danger
And His warm embrace
Away in a manger waiting for Jesus' birth
To glorify the Earth
Then He came
One child can change the world
Christmas Morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord
Wondrous star
Led shepherds and wise men
Through valleys and mountains
Angels surrounded them as they travelled far
As Heaven and Home
Rang out for the Saviour
The Sweet Prince of peace
Lay majestively asleep glorious and pure
And His mercy endures for always
One child can change the world
Christmas Morn'
The King of all kings was born
He reigns forevermore
Let us worship and adore
Christ the Lord
One child can change the world 
Christmas Morn' 
The King of all kings was born

On Christmas Morn'Gotta just stand up again
And just say the rain ain't gonna melt me away
When you get caught
In the pouring rain
With nowhere to run
Without anyone and you
Get a little bit frightened
Cause you've lost your way home
But through all the thunder and lightening
Just keep praying and keep
Saying to yourself

You are now in the summer of the GOAT
Light blue sky, oh yes I
Smoke your body until your mind feel high
Cause this is such a gutter lullaby
If I keep it 100, then your girlfriend's a dime
Do the math, I'm with you because you're ten times as fly
Put your L's in the air, baby girl lets ride
I'm too live, me love you long time
You're the perfect summer day
Girl you always shine
A love like ours is the greatest of all time
If E=MC²
That's fine
It don't take an Einstein to see it's our time
You ain't even gotta worry
About a thing I gotcha babe
And ain't nobody takin' me away
It's not a game I'm here to stay
See our love is stronger than any drug

There's no stopping you and me
I'll be loving you long time 
I'll be loving you long time 
Don't care what no one has to say
They don't understand us like we do
I need you near me night and day
Together there ain't nothin' we can't do
Scoop me up and we can go
To that little spot where no one knows
Spend a little time just us alone
You can caress my body and never let go
Long as I know you got me
I'll be loving you long time 
I'll be loving you long time 
There's no stopping you and me
I'll be loving you long time 
I'll be loving you long time 
You act funny when you and your friend walk around, bloated
Hit you with a pillow while you're doing aerobics
Snatch you up grab you, kiss you, from behind
Whisper in your ear "you are not going nowhere, you mine"
Now what? You know what it is, I love you sugar
Grab my face, tell me don't move, and pick my boogers
Those are the things that I love about you
Besides I can't even picture in this world, doing life without you
My motivation, medication, healer
Certain situations, you know how to ease my frustrations
And besides the oxtails, I love you long time
I'll double that if you don't feed my babies the swine
And you still feel good if you done in no time
And Imma down at the drop of a dime
And I'm daddy  when it come to the

I don't wanna let you in
But you know what happens
When I, when I, when I feel it
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
Keep telling you it's over
But boy here we go again
You say: I'm coming over
'Cause you know I'll let you in
So sly and so persuasive
I don't wanna let you win
But my restrain's diminishing
And then I go
When I, when I, when I feel it
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
Keep trying to convince myself
You ain't no good for me
Make futile resolutions
That I'm gonna let you be
But every time you come back
My defenses start to wane
And I can hardly break away
And then I go
When I, when I, when I feel it
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
I feel it deep inside
I feel it come alive
Here comes that feeling again
When I, when I, when I
When I feel your love
Here comes that feeling again
Here it comes again, boy
And I feel it
And I feel it
Here comes that feeling again
And I feel it
Oh baby
Here it comes and here it comes
And here it comes againYou're with me 'til the bitter end
What we had transcends this experience
Too painful to talk about
So I'll hold it in 'til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again
A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
When I remember
Glittering lights
Incandescent eyes
Still preserved in my mind
In the memories I'll find solace
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
And I'll remember
A place in time still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
'Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
And though we can never be
I'll think of you and me
Always remember love
You're never too farUh, uh, uh, uh
So So Def
Finally found somebody
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
I'm going through a situation that I can't help
Wanna get a little closer but I promised myself
That I would never give my heart away again, baby
Baby, baby, baby
See, I know it's hard but you gotta understand it
The truth is all the hurt and the pain
And the shit that you get when you have it
Ain't worth it
I've been there so many times
I should know better but I
Can't stop what I feel
When you're next to me
I really think I
Finally found somebody
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
Now how you're gonna tell me that I'm not the one
Baby I need to be for sure before I give you my love
But you'll never know until you give me a chance
But there's a lot of things about me I don't you understand
See, I've been cheated on 
And I've been treated wrong 
See I've been there, done that back again
And all I'm looking for is my special friend
But I've been lied to and cried through some cold, lonely nights
I've been played and betrayed and this fake shit ain't right
Tell me what you wanna do
Baby I'm just so confused
'Cause this time it might be true that baby you're the one
See the problem with relationships
In general is that it's always a game
In the beginning they'll do anything to have you
And once they do it's never the same
And I, know everyone out there can relate
So the question is
One: do I really wanna trust this feeling
Two: do I wanna let it pass me by
Three: do you think it's only superficial
Four: could it actually be different this time
Someone to love me
Someone to be my everything
Maybe I've stumbled upon
It's just me and you, baby
You're so sexy and you're driving me crazy
You smell so good, I wish you would
Meet me in the streets, we can tour the hood
And I'll show you all this heaven sent loving is good
And the feeling loving the greatest wood
If it's love that you're looking for, baby it's me
The vainglorious man BC
Because I love to love you baby
And miss Mariah love me baby
It's me and you against the world
I'll protect you baby girl
This connection's made in heaven
Everyday I count my blessings
It's never enough, I need second helpers
Come make me some of this heaven senders
'Cause I'm here for you baby
Finally found somebody
That could be the one 
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared 
And I'm nervous 
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad
'Cause I know that you're the one
Finally found somebody
That could be the one
But I promised myself
That I wouldn't give in to love
And I'm scared
And I'm nervous
Don't wanna be hurt anymore
This is bad 
'Cause I know that you're the one1. Cry

Uh, you thirsty
Chasing them bright lights
Even change your name
Say you a boss now
Ain't nothin' out your range
Well, almost anything
You used to be Mr. 'All About We'
Now you're just thirsty for celebrity
Best thing that happened to your ass was me
Pull down them Tom Fords and act like you see
You, thirsty for a dream
Leaving me drowning
Boy there ain't no S.O.S
Filled with discontent
Finding you can't quench
Why you try so damn hard
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Uh, you thirsty
Somebody get this girl a glass of water
I say she six nickels, not a dime past a quarter
Her daddy question me why she thirsty, nigga ask your daughter
Back up off me, you look a little salty
So thirsty, should drink coffee
And you ain't really gotta keep hittin' my phone, I see every message
Texting me asking where I'm going, baby girl stop stressin'
Then I walked in like the man of the year with these thirsty girls in my section
These thirsty girls want a blessin'
Get wet, you won't get shit from me
No defect, but you can get the D
No sequel, it's only one of me
That thirsty bitch she slit my tires
It got me on fire
Rich Homie Quan times Mariah, sing!
Boss now, you're trying to be a boss now
Thinking you a boss now
Boy you just looking thirsty now
Boss now, you're trying to be a boss now
Thinking you a G now
Boy you're just looking thirsty now
You know you thirsty
See your name in lights
And dream of fancy cars
Flexing like stars
You don't know who you are
That VIP
Too far for you to see
Outside the club

'Cause boy you're thirsty]

Your beautiful to me your beautiful to me your beautiful to me your beautiful to meO little town of Bethlehem
How still we see thee lie
Above thy deep and dreamless sleep
The silent stars go by
Yet in thy dark streets shineth
The everlasting light
The hopes and fears of all the years
Are met in thee tonight
Pa, rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Rum, pa, pum, pum
Then he smiled at me
For Christ is born of Mary
And gathered all above
While mortals sleep
The angels keep
Their watch of wondering love
All morning stars together
Proclaim the Holy birth
And praise and sing
To God the King
And peace to men on EarthI saw you yesterday
And I heard what you had to say
All those ugly ways you think about me
But I know it's okay
Gonna keep a smile on my face
Hate don't change the way I feel about my inner being
Cause I won't let 'em dim my light
And I'm holding my head up high
Even though my exterior
Is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep living my life
To defame my name and honey
Don't care what they say 'bout me
Imperfect
That's all that I'll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
Imperfect
Imperfect
Imperfect
As I look at the TV screen
Internet and magazines
So much insecurity surrounds me
Wish I could change some things
Gotta steal with my self-esteem
Folks so superficial makes it hard to just survive
Cause I won't let 'em dim my light
And I'm holding my head up high
Even though my exterior
Is not impeccable to you
I don't know if my wrongs is right
But I'm gonna keep living my life
To defame my name and honey
Don't care what they say 'bout me
Imperfect
That's all that I'll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
Imperfect
Imperfect
Imperfect
I may not walk like a super model
Or look as flawless as they do
I don't know where you get off judging
Cause I'm imperfect just like you
So I don't care about your status
So I'll swear up to here I've had it
Ain't trying to win no beauty pageant
Cause in my heart is all that matters
Imperfect
That's all that I'll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's
Imperfect
When you tryna live in harmony
But the song of life is out of key
Just be perfectly
Imperfect
Imperfect
Imperfect

Imperfect
That's all that I'll ever be
And God knows that's alright with me
Cause I know there's no one greater and everybody's

ImperfectMy dear, my dear, my dear, you do not know me
But I know you very well
So let me tell about Da Brat-ta-ta-ta-ta
I'm light skin, redbone, peanut butter complxion
Very affectionate, very direct
When I'm expressing myself
I'm 5'5", my astrology sign is Aries
Thick in my thighs, 36Bs
Pretty brown eyes, no hair weaves
Put it down with these lucious suckable lips
Making you wanna reach out and touch'em
Come on and give me a kiss
Could it be those hips just pokin' out of my jeans?
I showed them once or twice
And some niggas have become feems
I'm a javouci rocking, hat cockin, blunt smoking
No stopping, weave cocking
With constant heat dropping
Bombs on nonbelievers charming
All the people, they fallin' like Alicia
I'm preaching what I'm speaking
This you ain't used to seeing
So please, believe it, you needin the B to the R muthafucking AT
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I'd be sitting in my car waiting on you to drop off my package
A big zipped locked baggy to support my habit
We'll go together like Roger and Jessica Rabbit
I'm spoiled rotten, I'm rocking pink silk panties at the moment
But I'm sport cotton but jeanie's dreamin' of
Jeanie will blink me to scottie
So he can beam me pump adrenaline into my blook steam
Proceed extremely with caution
I'm probably gleaming
Because my bling bling is worth a fortune
It seems things will never change
So I puffed often cause these days niggas is crazy
You can't pay me to roll without my AK
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
I can't let go of this game
I can't let go of this fame
But for sure, before I go
You niggas gonna know my name
'Cause I'm so doogie, one in a million
Cop a brazzillion for the coochie that rides smoothly
Pass the doogie, the dutchie
Rudely interrupted, your regularly scheduled program
I throw down and bust it
There ain't no hoe around touching me
I'm sharper than cutlerly
I slice niggas to itty bitty pieces
I'm steppin in the club now ya'll, hey now
Niggas showing me love ya'll, hey now
I rapp for my thugs ya'll, hey now
Especially my niggas, they got the ooh
I guess you wonder where I've been
I search to find the love within
I came back to let you know
I gotta thing for you and I can't let it go
You know, you know, you know, you know
You know, you know, you know, you know
And I can't let go, I smoke
So, so def

Ooh, I, I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need itReflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorize
A picture fades of you and I together
I haven't come to terms with how we said goodbye
Did you really care, care at all for me?
Did you really care, did you care at all for me?
A displaced little girl wept years in silence
And whispered wishes you'd materialize
She pressed on night and day to keep on living
And tried so many ways to keep her soul alive
Did you really care, care enough for me?
Did you really care, did you care at all for me?
If I'm not quite good enough
Or somehow undeserving of a mother's love
You could have had the decency to give me up
Before you gave me life
Don't you even care, just the slightest little bit, for me?
'Cause I really need to feel you cared
Even once upon a time for me
I need to believe, in my heart of heart of hearts, you care for me
I need to understand why you left me there so helplessly
Don't you even care, care at all for me?
Reflections of your love have come to wither
I thought I'd done my best to memorizeI lay awake sometimes
Scared to close my eyes
And I wonder where I left myself
And lost the will to fight
And the night melts into morning
Still it's cold beneath the sun
'Cause the fire in me is languishing
And I'm too frozen to run
Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine
In time
'Cause you see
I've got a lot to dream
There's more than this
For me
An angel lands with broken wings
He warms me with his eyes
And the ice that's sheathed around my heart
Unravels as he smiles
See I grew up locked in sorrow
So I learn to block the pain
But I won't give up tomorrow
'Cause I've come to life again
Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know I'm gonna be fine
That's right
'Cause for real
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this
For me
But I keep on going 'cause...
Every once in a while
There's a distant glimmer of hope
I find somewhere deep inside
Someone strong still resides
And I know she's gonna be fine
In time
'Cause you see
I've got a right to dream
There's more than this
For meBreak

BreakTe estoy pensando
En mi larga noche en soledad
Si el error fue amarte
En mi corazón vuelvo a estar mal
Porque estoy en ti
Y no se vivir
Si a mi lado no estás
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Dime si me sientes
Imaginando verme frente a ti
Siempre estás presente
Y en mis sueños logro descubrir
Que aunque no estás
Mi estrella fugaz
Te deseo alcanzar
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy
Mi amor
Mi amorOn the back cover of this album is a personal treasure
This is my first and only self-portrait
I drew it when I was three-and-a-half and entitled it
"Me. I Am Mariah."
Please don't judge me for such a simplistic title
Come on, I was only three-and-a-half
It was a creative visualisation of how I saw myself
With the purity of a child's heart before it was ever broken
I've kept this drawing private for so long
But because this album is a reflection of some of the peaks and valleys that have made me who I am today
I've decided to share it with those of you who actually care
And have been here for me through it all
I've been through a lot, but I've always known me
I am Mariah
Along the way there have been a couple of nicknames
And I've inadvertently embodied many personas
Lately, they've been calling me, "The Elusive Chanteuse"I was a wayward child
With the weight of the world
That I held deep inside
Life was a winding road
And I learned many things
Little ones shouldn't know
But I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky
And the times rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Funny how one can learn
To grow numb to the madness
And block it away
I left the worse unsaid
Let it all dissipate
And I try to forget
As I closed my eyes
Steadied my feet on thе ground
Raised my head to the sky
And thе time rolled by
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soon
Nearing the edge 
Oblivious I almost 
Fell right over 
A part of me 
Will never be quite able 
To feel stable 
That woman-child 
Failing inside 
Was on the verge of fading 
Thankfully I 
Woke up in time 
Guardian angel, I
Sail away on an ocean
With you by my side
Orange clouds roll by
They burn into your image
And you're still alive
As I closed my eyes 
Steadied my feet on the ground
Raised my head to the sky 
And though time's rolled by 
Still I feel like a child
As I look at the moon
Maybe I grew up
A little too soonI am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love tonight
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life
Feel your body, feel your body, baby
I'd give my all 
I'd give my all
 I'd risk my life
I'd give my all
I'd give my all tonight
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
I'd give my all for your love
I, I'd, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all

Got MC high
Yo boys on fire
Trick trop the low
There they go
Radio killa
It's only been 20 good minutes since I kissed you
Oh, come back boo, I miss you
Wish I had 20 million hours to caress you
And undress you, to be continued
If I had 20 million hours
I'll have 20 million ways to caress you
Say my name and Ludacris to the rescue
Make your heart skip a beat
Hand cuff you to the bed
I'ma cop and I'ma cardiac arrest you
You got the right to command me to taste you
Touch, tease, and you like it when I chase you
'Cause ain't no woman in the world
Not even in my imagination I could ever find to replace you
And you still got it goin' on
You're the girl all in my dreams
Now we playin' our favorite song
Turn it up and I'ma make you scream
I'ma make you think you live in another galaxy
Make you lose your mind
Then you might have to claim insanity
Sometimes we argue and we fight
But they better know that that's my baby
You might even think he cute
But everybody knows that I'm his lady
Every time you see us, we super fly
So proud he's by my side
He knows I'm ride or die
You don't know how we roll
I got you worked up, hacked up
Backed up, loved up, hugged up
We'll never break up
Shawty so purrty
Every day her birthday, she riding on her favorite route
We stay put on that spade out
She love me like them 43 carats on her wrist
She love me when I'm singing "Shawty, you a ten"
She love me 'cause I'm oh so ghetto
Well, go ahead, rock 'wit it
Don't stop, get It
I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
I got your lovin' on my mind
I got your lovin' on my mind
Boy, I'm all wrapped up in you
Shawty, you know you my boo
Tell me what I'm supposed to do
When you're not around
Oh, baby 
Oh, baby 
Oh, baby 
Oh, baby 
Oh, boy you got me, you got me, you got me
Boy, I got your lovin' on my mind
I I got your lovin' on my mind
You got me wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
I, I got your lovin' on my mind
Wrapped up, packed up
Ribbon with a bow on it
Ribbon with a bow on it, baby
Boy, you don't even know the things you do
I could spend my whole life with you
I got your lovin' on my mind
Baby, I could spend my life with you, ooh
And it's been 20 good minutes since I kissed you
Come back boo, I miss youO holy night the stars are brightly shining
It is the night of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world in sin and error pining
Till He appeared and the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night
O night divine
A thrill of hope, the weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks a new and glorious morn
Fall on your knees
O hear the angels' voices
O night divine
O night when Christ was born
O night divine, O night
O night divineWhy?
Oh, why? 
Did
Woo-hoo, ooh
I should have known
That you'd
That you'd
Go and break
Knowing I was
Knowing I was
So vulnerable
OhShe was kind of fragile
And she had a lot to grapple with
But basically she kept
It all inside
Childlike and effervescent
With a well of pain
The depth of I could not imagine
If I tried
Never thought that I
Would hear them say
Twister went and threw it all away
She was kind of magical
Her laughter sent you casually
Floating through a moment
Of release
Dear God, it's all so tragic
And I'll never have the chance
To feel the closure
That I ultimately need
No, I never dreamed
That there would come a time
Twister'd go and leave it all behind
Lord I pray she's found some peace
And her soul's somewhere at ease
Yeah I'm feeling kind of fragile
And I've got a lot to handle
But I guess this is my way
Of saying goodbyeLove Hangover
If there's a cure for this
I don't want it
I don't want it
And if there's a remedy
I'll run from it
From it
I think about it all the time
Never let it out of my mind
'Cause I love you ooh ooh, baby
I've got the sweetest hangover
I don't wanna get over
The sweetest hangover
Yeah yeah yeah
I don't wanna get over
I don't wanna get
I don't wanna get
Over
Heartbreaker
You know what?
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
Oh, your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy, if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me, baby
Or leave me feeling used?
Would you go and break my heart?
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart
It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist at all
Heartbreaker, you got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back incessantly 
Oh, why did you have to run your game on me?
I should have known right from the start
You'd go and break my heart

Of days that I once knew
Those days that I spent with you
Oh no! Don’t let 'em play it
'Cause it fills up my heart with pain
So please stop it right away
'Cause I remember just what he said
He said "darling"
But I know that he lied
You know that you lied

Hey mister, don’t play no more
Don’t play it no more
I can’t stand it
Don’t play it no more

I was only seventeen
I never dreamed he'd be so mean
He told me "darling"
But, baby, baby, you lied

I will be alright
If I can find that

When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
And everywhere that you go, there's people singin' "Let It Snow"
And hangin' up that mistletoe
And me and you gon' have ourselves a holiday
And we don't need nobody else to celebrate
And we gon' kiss our worries and our cares away
I can't wait
Because this Christmastime, get together
It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
And baby, you're the one, special treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
Until Christmas comes 
Oh, baby 
So many souls hurt, so many don't have enough
When Christmas comes, when Christmas comes
But baby, if you spread love 
Someday it might be enough 
To heal each other one by one
And we gon' get together and rejoice and pray
And we gon' help the world become a better place
And we gon' sing and shout because the savior reigns
So don't dismay
Because this Christmastime, get together
It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
Because this gift of love lasts forever
The Lord makes our hearts open up
Soon as Christmas comes 
It's gon' be alright when Christmas comes
 Oh, jingle all the way
Oh, what fun  
And we gon' reminisce about the good old days
And we gon' laugh together as the children play
And through the years it's always  gonna be this way
Come what may
Because this Christmastime, get together
It's gonna be so nice, better than ever
And baby, you're the one that I treasure
I can't wait to unwrap your love
When Christmas comes
La-la-la-la-la, da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-da

La-la-la-la-la, da-da, da-da, da-da-da-da-da, da-daYou're with me
Til the bitter end
What we have transcends
This experience
Too painful to
Talk about
So I'll hold it in
Til my heart can mend
And be brave enough to love again
A place in time
Still belongs to us
Stays preserved in my mind
In the memories there is solace
Never too far away
I won't let time erase
One bit of yesterday
Cause I have learned that
Nobody can take your place
Though we can never be
I'll keep you close to me
Always remember
Love
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Nobody can take your place
You're never too farYou've got me feeling emotions
Higher
High
Higher
I feel good
I feel nice
I’ve never felt so
Satisfied
I'm in love
I'm alive
Intoxicated
Flying high
It feels like a dream
When you touch me tenderly
I don’t know if it's real
But I like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning
When I rise
You are the first thing
On my mind
And in the middle
Of the night
I feel your heartbeat
Next to mine
It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I really like the way I feel
Inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I’ve ever dreamed of
You’ve got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I’ve ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
You know the way to make me lose control
When you're looking into my eyes
You make me feel so
High
Higher emotions
Deeper than I’ve ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Higher emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of

Que no sabes el final
Y te asusta lo que lees
Asi la vida es
Cuando naces
Ya te expones al dolor
Y de a poco y con valor
Logras crecer
Y como un libro el corazon
Nos enseña que hay temor
Que hay fracasos y maldad
Que hay batallas que ganar
Y en cada pagina el amor
Nos combierte en luchador
Y descubres lo comun
No hay un héroe como tu
Son muy pocos
Que se arriesgan por amor
Pero tu tienes la fe
Y eso lo es todo
No decaigas
Que vivir es aprender
Y no hay nada que temer
Si crees en ti
Y como un libro el corazon
Nos enseña que hay temor
Que hay fracasos y maldad
Que hay batallas que ganar
Y en cada pagina el amor
Nos combierte en luchador
Y descubres lo comun
No hay un héroe como tu
Solo Dios
Sabe donde y cuando
La vida nos dira
Lo has echo bien
Solo
Con un sueño solo
Sabras como vencer
Y como un libro el corazon
Nos enseña que hay temor
Que hay fracasos y maldad
Que hay batallas que ganar
Y en cada pagina el amor
Nos combierte en luchador
Y descubres lo comun
No hay un héroe como tuJust some everyday people
Trying make it through the pain

How could anyone else compete with that?
So I just can't help feeling sentimental
About things in the past
We promised to keep it casual
But at times that can be so difficult
This relationship's so untypical
And I can't understand
Tell me why, tell me why
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again
Baby, why can't we be just friends?
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again
When I feel your stare catching me off-guard
Boy, it's just not fair 'cause you know for sure
How to lure me in with that magnetic smile
Tell me why, tell me why
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try not to bend
There goes my heart again
Baby, why can't we be just friends?
It's a mess but we still pretend
Any fool could foresee the end
But there goes my heart again
Tell me why, tell me why
First, you love me and then you leave me
And then I'm falling back in your arms
There's no conclusion, you're so deceiving
'Cause I get taken in by your charms
Even though I try so very hard not to bend
There goes my heart again
There goes, there goes
There goes my heart again
There goes my heart again
Baby, baby, baby, baby
There goes my heart again
Baby, baby, baby, baby

'Cause I know inside we belong to each other incidentally

You're the only one who gives me that feelin'
You know I like the way you kick it, girl
You know I like it when ya in my world
Come here lil momma, let me freak yo body

Girl, you know you get me so erotic
Especially when I be sipping hypnotic
Got me feeling like I'm smoking on Kronic
When we fucking it be so exotic
Now I know that I be turning on fiyay wit Mariah
And she know she be dealing wit a balla
Can't go fast cause I'm heavy through the wire
Fulfillin' desires like a chi shot calla
Do you love how the twist throw it at you?
Do you love when I hit it from the back too?
Let me feel how you work it that one way
Come on baby girl, let me see what that do
I wish that we could
Blow out the speakers
Over and Over
To them Jodeci cuts
"Forever your lady"
You act right then maybe
Ain't nothing to talk about
Put the music loud
So they won't hear me say
Ah-ha, ha ah!
Come and be my one and only
Tired of being so lonely... come hold me
Ah-ha ha ah!
I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say
Ah-ha ha ah!
Come be my one and only
Tired of being so lonely... console me
Ah-ha, ha ah!
I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say
Now we pulling up out the garage
In the platinum blue arnage
Me and you about to hit that club
To the bar so we can sip that bud
Both of us together, we would be the livest
If I had to break it down, how would I describe it?
We the type of couple when we get up on each other
We get it cracking in the kitchen or the bedroom
It don't matter where we at, we be making noise
So play the track so the base will make ya head boom
Break ya off when here one leg up
And you know I like the way you put it on me
It's the east coast queen and the midwest Mob Boss?
Shorty I will never leave ya lonely
I wish that we could
Blow out the speakers
Over and Over
To them Jodeci cuts
"Forever your lady"
You act right then maybe
Ain't nothing to talk about
Put the music loud
So they won't hear me say
Ah-ha, ha ah!
Come and be my one and only
Tired of being so lonely... come hold me

I wanna wrap myself around you or whenever you want to
Come make me say

Tired of being so lonely... console me
Ah-ha, ha ah!

If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

Thank you so much, goodnight everybody
Merry ChristmasWhen you get caught in the rain, with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain, without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved
But nobody comes and you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, what you say is
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arrive safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
What you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
Every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
As shadows grow close, don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And sure they tell you, you'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say, yeah
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again, on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I live one more day and night
And I can make it through the rainI got a real remix
You know what it is already
MC
Mocha
And no time surrendering
To the spice and cinnamon
Left you trembling and the nights remembering
The love lost
Got set up and tossed
If you say it ain't so
Well, that's how you come across 
Still can't spot one
Who can top son? 
Can call on your dogs
'Cause you know I'm one
If you put it in the clip, then I'll pop one 
If you push in the whip
Then I got shotgun 
Or back swoop, let's be practical
Act natural
Is what we have to do
I'ma ride for you
And then I'll slide with you
Understand, I ain't the one to be lying to 
I'm in my Benz drop
Crawling down your block
I'm like the ice you're working for
To put on your watch
I want you staring and comparing to the stuff you've got
Have your heart stop
Watch my joints chart tops
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually
We will find ourselves in love again
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Boy, when you look into my eyes
I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but it's true
You would think things have changed
But inside, I know I really feel the same
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Each night and every day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy inside
If there's a spark of hope in my grasp
I will keep holding on
'Cause it's worth the risk to have a second chance
I still believe in you 
I still believe in you
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
I still believe in you

Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but didn't know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying
You should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict
This ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday Oo Someday

Holding on to me so tight
What more can I do
Baby all I want for Christmas is you
You...

So brightly everywhere
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing

Santa won't you bring me the one I really need
Won't you please bring my baby to me...
Oh I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for

With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just gonna keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do?
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air 
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? 
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas
This is all I'm asking for 
I just wanna see my baby
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is you
You, baby
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby Silent night
Holy night
All is calm
All is bright
'Round yon virgin Mother and Child
Holy infant so tender and mild
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep in heavenly peace
Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh, love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Jesus Lord at Thy, Thy birth
Oh, Jesus Lord at Thy birth
Sleep 
Sleep
Sleep in heavenly peace
Sleep, sleep, sleep 
Sleep in heavenly, heavenly, heavenly peace
Peace
Peace
Sleep 
Oh, sleep in heavenly peace
Thank youThere's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you reach into your soul
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youYou made me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that
My baby, we were the best
I suffer in dreams, tell me why is love like suicide
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
Give you up, you're mine
You made me feel
Like love would never end
Tell me how can I forget that
My baby, we were the best
I suffer in dreams, tell me why is love like suicide
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine
And baby I can't seem to give you up, you're mine]
Give me some of that eggnog
Turn me up too
Y'all know it's Christmas
Here comes Santa Claus
Here comes Santa Claus
Right down Santa Claus Lane
Vixen and Blitzen and all his reindeer
Pulling on the reins
Bells are ringing, children singing
All is merry and bright
Hang your stockings
With Christmas cheer
'Cause Santa Claus comes tonight
Oh, ho, ho, who wouldn't go
Oh, ho, ho, who wouldn't go

Snoop D-O Double G
Flying through sky

In a big red suit
With some big black boots

Normally seen in a blue bandana-ana
Came to bring some joy
Bag full of toys, girls and boys
Wire to wire, flyest to flyest
Sing it, Mariah

Thank youDo you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Now looking back on all we've planned
We let so many dreams slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answer to those questions can be?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know, baby?(Something in your eyes
I guess that means I'm gonna do this one for you
We're done with the show but...
We're done with the show but I wanna do this one for you because I thank you so much for coming...
You've been great for me
You know, I'm not used to doing this and you guys made it great for me so...
I just wanna thank you so much
Thank you...
There you are holding her hand
I am lost
Dying to understand
Didn't I cherish you right
Don't you know you were my life
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Just cast aside
You don't even know I'm alive
You just walk on by
Don't care to see me cry
And here I am
Still holding on
I can't accept
My world is gone
Even though I try I can't let go
Something in your eyes
Captured my soul
And every night I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let go
Do you even realize the sorrow I have inside
Everyday of my life
Do you know the way it feels
When all you have just dies
I try and try to deny that I need you
But still you remain on my mind
No I just can't get you out of my mind
I never can say goodbye
'Cause every night
I see you in my dreams
You're all I know
I can't let you go
Even though I try
I can't let go of something I need so badly
You're all I know
I can't let go
Thank you!
Thank you so much for coming out...
I really really appreciated it and I love you so much...
Thank you!Late nights, playing in the dark
Boy, remember wakin' up in my arms
Boy, don't you know that you're always in my heart?
So don't forget about us
Please don't forget of the late nights
Chased Double O, S-L, all they see is our brake lights
You know we get busy like midtown
I need you back, I can't forget, you know how we get down
And I can't say if it hadn't been for the pad and pen
That ain't even matter then, I'm always at it then
But when I think about it I'll be gettin' mad again
Cause the way we broke up was badder than Brad and Jen
Just let it die with no goodbyes
Details don't matter, we both paid the price
Tears in my eyes
You know sometimes it'd be like that, baby, yeah
Now every time I see you, I pretend I'm fine
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
Boy, remember wakin' up in my arms
Boy, don't you know that you're always in my heart?
So don't forget about us
Please don't forget
The good times, the good wine
The talks after sex
The walks on the deck
What about us?
The love and the trust
On the highway
Testarossa kickin' up dust
What about the plans for the kids and the yard full of dogs
Think of the time
Shapar for the fall
Still look at the phone, pray to God that you call
They say love larger than life, I'd die cause you on
Bonita Applebum, ma
You gotta put me on
In the 6, with the chicks, wild'n out, til the morn'
But I still can't find myself smilin' in the morn'
And I gotta tell myself I been wild'n since you gone
Yeah I've got some other chicks
But I ain't got that other shit
Met 'em on the road, gotta double up the rubbers quick
They ain't the chicks that I be under the covers with
Gotta let you know that you my only love I miss
Oh, they say that you're in a new relationship
But we both know nothing comes close to
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine 
No matter who you go through
We are one, that's a fact that you can't deny
So, baby, we just can't let the fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about
Soon as you hear this song you'll remember
I'm gone 'til Noviembre
But long ass sinner
I'm long as the Jim bay
No you can't forget that
Late night
Chit chat
Turned into meet'n out
Eaten at them with that
Don't fall asleep, boo
Three screws, hit that
Break ups, make ups, go to Jacob
And get that
I'm missin' her feel
Touchin' on ya gently
His and her grills
Horn of the end days
Client's first steel
Ridin' on the 50's
Ain't nothin change but the keys and the clothes
When I was with you
I took it easy on the road
Coulda dissed you
Been on the 4 "C's" gettin' warm So don't get amnesia
Baby, when we met
You was down in Ibiza
And didn't have a Visa
I brought you in like Bush did to Condoleezza
Now I gotta brush it like the waves on the seas
So don't forget about
Late nights, playing in the dark
And waking up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes, you still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playin' in the dark
Boy, remember wakin' up in my arms
Boy, don't you know that you're always in my heart?
So don't forget about usI still remember
That hazy September
I've been waitin' for somebody like you
To come back around
We would walk in the park every Saturday
Brand new all in love kissin' time away
You was all up on me, it was plain to see
That I was your girl
Way back when it was the simple things
Anklets, name plates that you gave to me
Sweet tarts, Ring Pops
Had that candy bling
And you were my world
Now I wish I could go back
And make time stop
I would take this love
Throw back from the top
Go DJ, play my song
And I'm gon' think about you
All night long
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mind
Yeah, T-Pain
Back in the day when would to hold hands
You my little lady, I’m your old man
That’s all, yeah baby, that’s all
Shawty gettin ready for my romance
Get in my time machine and let’s slow dance
And we ball, all over the mall
And baby I wish  we could go  back to 1994
Where the booty dance hall, all on the boulevard
And they be like, “Go T-Pain, do your G thang”
And I’m a keep the track bumping like a bee sting ,’m so raw
And I’mma think about Mariah until the day I get tired
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more 
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again 
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore 
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like 
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school 
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I'm the same Mimi
Fame ain't changed me
Butterfly flow like Muhammad Ali
Wish I can bring you back like the O.D.B
Thinkin' about the whirlpools
Me you and Jack
No matter what I do
All the memories are stacked
Thinkin' 'bout 10th grade
Thinkin' 'bout 11th
Then you went Doug E. Fresh
All the way to heaven
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love any more
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Back in the day we were in love
We're not in love anymore
But some days I sit and wish
We were in love again
Irresponsible things we would do like
Fall asleep on the phone
And skippin' school
Now I'm back to the future missin' you
My sweet baby
My sweet thing, like candy
Felt like real love, not just play play
Missin' you my sweet baby
I can't delete your picture from my mindOne summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breezе
And I'm so shy 
A bundle of butterflies
Flushеd with the heat of desire
On a natural high
As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting
To another state of mind 
And imagined I was yours and you were mine 
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Lay underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
I was drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars, baby, baby]
If Jermaine likes it... 
Then I like it...
You know what?, y'all ain't ready for this
You're still scrambling from the damage of the last remix
Most of your stories bore me, y'all love to lie
To my royalties, be the glory
Mariah, Honey B. Fly
Ah, me and B-R, we are
Usually seen in hot spots
Jumpin' outta two seaters
We got Money to make
And many records to break
We not similar to any
So make no mistake
This is So So Def
Oh, honey, you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who
Makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far
Beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another taste of your
Honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin'  for ya, cryin'  for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
I can't be elusive with you, honey
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
Y'all be saying this and that
But then y'all don't wanna see this new phenomenon
This Don Chi Chi
It's something nasty
Word to B.I.G
I'm in it for life
Dead president for life
And by the minute, I get more nice
I'm the J-E-R, The M-A-I, N, don't forget the E
And she goes by the unforgettable name
Of the B to the R to the A to the T
I like colossal size pieces of rocks
And getting pushed in the Bentley drop top
Undefeated indefinitely
Don't stop
We rock in all kinds of spots, calling all the shots
And y'all knows how we get down
My beliefs is being dolla bill seeker and a Benjamin keeper
Don't mind poppin' the glory
Or slow wind with some clown with seven digit accounts
They say
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night 
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night 
They say
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night 
Hey, JD won't you play that song?
And keep 'em dancing all night 
 It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet 
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me 
Now I'm strung out on you darlin' 
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
 It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for you, cryin' for you, I adore youNote: An asterisk  next to a song title denotes that the song title has not been officially confirmed

Don't you ever be lonely
It's alright, it's alright 
Anytime you need a friend
I will be hereWe're gonna do a song called If It's Over, which I wrote with one of my idols, Carole King
Won't you talk to me
This is so out of hand
Something's gone wrong
With the life that we planned
Won't you look at me
You're avoiding my gaze
And it seems like you've changed
In so many ways
It isn't fair
It isn't right
If it's really gone
Then tell me tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Let me go
Don't you know
I don't need no apologies
No
I'm not looking for sympathy
All I'm asking for
Is your honesty
Won't you give it to me
Give it to me now
It isn't fair
It just isn't right
'Cause if is't really gone
You've got to say the word tonight
If it's over
If it's over
Won't you let me know
Baby if it's over
If it's over
Over — let me go
Thank you... thank you...No, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow shows
Yes, it shows
No, I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there, but then I let you go
And now it's only fair that I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't give
I can't give anymore
Well, I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way the story goes
You always smile, but in your eyes, your sorrow show
Yes, it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No, no, no, no, hey
I can't live 
If living is without you 
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Can't live InstrumentalI ain't even mad, no, not like befo'
Off with your head, now slither out the door
Snakes in the grass, it's time to cut the lawn
Ed Scissorhands, AKA "I cut you off" 
You ain't gonna lie to my face no mo'
Hit me with 'I'm sorry', but I'm sorry, 
Na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na-na, 
Get me Ed Shapiro on the phone
Case closed

That's a no-no
No, no

Irregardless of what transpired

Even if I was the last woman alive
I would be like Ginger, you ain't Gilligan
I really don't care, I'm in love with the island
Rockin' Dior 'cause it goes with my diamonds
Got a pink gown Custom by Alaia
I'll be on stage when the stadium light up

Patiently to see you in heaven

And all that I know is I'll wait
Patiently to see you in heaven
Darling I never showed you
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
, Both]
Although the sun will never shine the same
I'll always look to a brighter day 
Lord, I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven

I'm only kidding
Okay...
This next song was my first single...
Ever!
And it's called
Vision of Love...
Thank you...
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
Had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to be
Thank you!Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him, prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and nature sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the world
The Lord is come
Let Earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heavеn and nature sing
And heaven and naturе sing
And heaven and heaven and nature sing
Joy to the Earth
The Savior reigns
Let men their songs employ
While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat the sounding joy
Repeat, repeat the sounding joy
Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
He rules the world
With truth and grace
And makes the nations prove
The glories of His righteousness
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His love
And wonders of His
Joy, joy to the world
All, all the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and meI'm so high
To the tippy tippy top you don't stop
To the tippy tippy top you don't quit
And to the tippy tippy top you don't stop
And to the tippy tippy top you don't quit
Hey now, who can take you higher
Add fuel to your fire?
Tag team and desire
Trackmasters and Mariah
Take you higher
One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
]
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted 
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze, oh
So shy , a bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby, yeah
]
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Oh, beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you 
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I laid in bed all night and I was
]
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted 
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby, yeah
Drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby, yeah

I was drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting 
I was drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting 
Baby, I was fade, fade, fade, fading
And I was fade, fade, fade, fadingCall my phone, yeah
Baby, call my phone, yeah 
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone 
Call my phone, yeah 
Baby, call my phone, oh right 
Baby, call my phone, yeah
I've been waiting to hear your ringtone
Lost without my other half
How can I live without ya?
I don't want another
That's why I'm messed up about ya
Can't even dream without seein' you
Why should I even try to breathe? 
And everything is off, where are you?
Guess it's all my fault, lady sings the blues
No one could deny it, we were flying like United
Thought we'd never be divided
'Cause the love we had inside us was inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
'Cause I know we're still inseparable
Got photos of us on my refrigerator
Videos on my phone 
Boy, I just can't erase 'em
The first text I ever got from ya still saved in my inbox
And I read it back time after time
Boy, I'm lost, can't you look? 
Won't you please find me?
I'm down to my last tear, come rescue me
See, it's broken my heart to the point where I don't leave the house, no reason out, weekends out just ain't the same without you

Ferrari two seater we be whipping
But you can tell the difference when my passenger be missing
Somebody tell me, have you seen her?
Looking for my diva
Somehow I lost the love but when I find her
I’m gon’ remind her
She’s all that I desire 
Mariah
Tryin to shake, shake me  off, girl
Break, break this off girl
I won’t let you do because we belong together
I never thought we end up like this, like this, ‘bout , yup
But I thought we were inseparable

Jealous of your love
'Cause you swore you'd never ever give it up 
'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparable
Thought we'd stay together, always and forever 
But now I see that no one is inseparable 
One of us just gotta pick the phone up
It's been sixteen days since I held you tight
Balled up me and my pillow in the middle of the night
I’m laying here missing you on your side of the bed
So what you waitin' for?
'Cause both us have thought that we're inseparable
If you're bumping this song
And you're searching for the moment
When two hearts went wrong 
Jealous of your love

Me and Mariah, go back like babies and pacifiers 
We’re inseparable

'Cause you'd thought y'all was inseparableSorry I've never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
'Cause you've flown away, so far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile

Honey, you can have me
Honey, you can have me when you want me
Honey, you can have me
Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
Every time you call me I come runnin' 
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin'  for ya, cryin'  for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Oh, I can't be elusive with you, honey 
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you 
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?

Ooh, IChristmas time is in the air again
Christmas chimes reminding me of when
We fell like the snow
So deep in love
High above us the evergreens
Sparkled with lights
And filled the breeze
As we made future Christmas memories
Christmas shoppers glance at us
And smile
'Cause the mistletoe is occupied
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer
With you all year
And not wait till the moment when
Christmas time is in the air again
Mean Mr. Grinch simply can’t rеsist
Warming up when he looks our way
Even Old Scroogе makes a Christmas wish
For a honey to hold Christmas day
And to feel love like ours always
La dat da
Dat da da dum
And the dream is to share
This Christmas cheer
With you all throughout the year
And not wait till the moment when
Christmas time is in the air
Christmas time is everywhere
Christmas time is in the air again
Again
And againAnd this next song is my next single
And it's called Make It Happen
Thank you...
Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
If you believe...
You can make it
Ohhhhh
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Thank you...I came to have a party
Open off that Bacardi
Feeling so hot tamale
Boy I know you watchin' me
So what's it gonna to be
Purple taking me higher
I'm lifted and I like it
Boy, you got me inspired
Baby, come and get it
If you're really feelin’ me

A cause for celebration
I ain't gonna let nobody's drama bother me
'Cause it's my night
No stress, no fights

No tears no time to cry
Just making the most of life
Everybody is livin' it up

The night you heard my true confession, boy
I had to let you know
I spent a night of guilty passion so
I called to say
There'll never be another to take your place, no
Now I pray that'll you put an end
To these tears of shame rolling down my face
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
Weakness of the body, body
It didn't mean a thing
I guess I needed to prove my love was true
I had to feel the sting
Of a night in another's arms away from you
Now I'm lying
Staring at the ceiling held in my pain
Now I'm crying
I turned our days of sunshine
Into these days and nights of rain
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
Weakness of the body
Gotta have your love
Weakness of the body, body
Every morning I wake up and remember you're gone
I look in the mirror and ask myself why did I did you so wrong
Now I feel the love that burns so hot inside
Just trust me one more time
And I promise to make you happy
I called to say
There'll never be another to take your place
Now I pray that'll you put an end
To these tears of shame rolling down my face
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you here with me tonight
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you, yeah
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart
But the weakness of the body
How can I make it right?
I gotta have you, got to, got to have you
Weakness of the body
Weakness of the body
It tore our love apart
Now I'm feeling sad and lonely
I have the strength of heart...]
Hmmm 
Uhh 
Hmm 
Uh, ooh 
Yeah, ooh
It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web 
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wantеd you to taste my sadness
As you kissed mе in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you  caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you'
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
I got you stuck off the realness
Feel this pourin' down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us
Score up in the project hall
Third floor gravitates on the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw bass
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all, you the one that's like my pistol, I said crystal
Keep you on my side 'til the ficial 
Ain't it ill how we click, boo? Just me and you
Got me stuck off the realness, just me and you
Up on the roof beats, Pebble Beach
Talk to me anytime, even when I wit my peeps
Ruler L, why you smell like the perfume Chanel?
Push big G's rappin' all is simply heavy
We can do it on a roof top
Do it 'til we both drop
M-O-B-B with Mariah sounds so hot
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I 
Every time I feel the need

I envision you caressing me
And go back in time

Make my wish come true
All I want 
Make my wish come true
All I want 
Make my wish come true
All I want 
Make my wish come true
All I want 
Make my wish come true
All I want 
Make my wish come true
I don't want a lot for Christmas
There is just one thing I need 
I don't care about the presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace 
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas Day
I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you 
You, baby
Oh, I won't ask for much this Christmas
I won't even wish for snow 
I'm just going to keep on waiting
Underneath the mistletoe
I won't make a list and send it 
To the North Pole for Saint Nick 
I won't even stay awake to
Hear those magic reindeer click
'Cause I just want you here tonight 
Holding on to me so tight 
What more can I do?
Oh, baby, all I want for Christmas is you 
You, baby
Ohh
Ohh
Oh, all the lights are shining
So brightly everywhere 
And the sound of children's
Laughter fills the air
And everyone is singing 
I hear those sleigh bells ringing 
Santa, won't you bring me the one I really need? 
Won't you please bring my baby to me?
Oh, I don't want a lot for Christmas 
This is all I'm asking for 
I just want to see my baby 
Standing right outside my door
Oh, I just want you for my own 
More than you could ever know 
Make my wish come true
Oh baby, all I want for Christmas is
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby 
All I want for Christmas is you, baby We were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
 Yes you will
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
 you'll be right back, baby
Oh baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on 
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me 
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
 You and I will always be
 You and I will always beHark! The herald angels sing
Glory to the new born KingOh, holy night
The stars are brightly shining
It is the night
Of our dear Savior's birth
Long lay the world
In sin and error pining
Till He appeared
And the soul felt its worth
A thrill of hope
The weary world rejoices
For yonder breaks
A new glorious morn
Fall on your knees
Oh, hear the angels' voices
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
When Christ was born
Oh, night divine
Oh, night
Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine
Oh, night divine
Oh, nightChristmas time is here
Happiness and cheer
Fun for all that children call
Their favorite time of the year
Snowflakes in the air
Carols everywhere
Olden times and ancient rhymes
Of love and dreams to share
Sleigh bells in the air
Beauty everywhere
Yuletide by the fireside
And joyful memories there
Christmas time is herе
We'll be drawing near
Oh, that wе could always see
Such spirit through the years
Oh, that we could always see
Such spirit through the years...Oh-oh, ohh
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Ahh, yeah
I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause ove takes time
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone
Losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Tell me how to stop the rain
Tears are falling down endlessly
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside 
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
Because love takes time
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there alone
Thank you...
Ahh...
This next song, uh, was my first single and it's called "Vision of Love" and I'm just so thankful for all the success that its brought me and I'd like to thank the company and everyone. And here it is...Gypsy, sittin' lookin' pretty
A broken rose and laughin' eyes
You're a mystery
Always runnin' wild
Like a child without a home
You're always searchin'
Searchin' for a feelin'
But it's easy come and easy go
Oh — I'm sorry but it's true
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Whoah can't you see
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartache
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Oh
You're such a secret
Misty eyed and shady
Baby, how you hold the key
Oh, you're like a candle
Your flame slowly fadin'
Burnin' out and burnin' me
Can't you see
Just tryin' to say to you
You're bringin' on the heartache
Takin' all the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You're bringin' on the hearbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
Can't you see
Can't you see
No
No
No
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You got the best of me
Oh can't you see
You're bringin' on the heartbreak

You're bringin' on the heartbreak
You're bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
Bringin' on the heartache
You're bringin' on the heartbreak
You're bringin' on the heartbreakDo you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you’re hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you’re going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Now looking back on all we've planned
We let so many dreams slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answer to those questions can be?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know, baby?Ladies and gentlemen, Mariah Carey
Thank you. This is my current single, "Love Takes Time."InstrumentalOh, whoa
Mmm, oh
Treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Oh, I carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny 
And I'll be eternally grateful, oh
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed 
Would find me eventually, yeah
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Yeah, I had a vision of love
And it was all, all, that you turned out to... be
Yeah, oh, and mmm
Thank you. Thank you. Now I'd like to bring out someone who went out with me on the road, on a promotion tour. And, he is an incredible incredible pianist on the Sony label, by the name of Richard Tee. Thank you. This is a song called "Vanishing"If I could recapture all of the memories
And bring them to life, surely I would
Hear the distant laughter
Wasn't it you and me surviving the night?
You're fading out of my sight swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing
Ahh, oh
I was so enraptured
No sensibility
To open my eyes
I misunderstood
Now you're fading faster
It's suddenly hard to see
You're taking the light
Letting the shadows inside swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're, oh
Reaching out into the distance
Searching for spirits of the past
Just a trace of your existence to grasp
And if somehow I could recapture
All of the memories
And bring them to life
Lord knows I would
But now you're fading faster
Getting so hard to see
Taking the light
Letting the darkness inside swiftly
You're vanishing
Drifting away
You're vanishing, oh
You're vanishing
Drifting so far away
Whoa
You're vanishing
Whoa, oh-oh-oh, oh yeah
Away

We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breeze, oh
So shy , a bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high 
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high 
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Drifted, drifted 
On a natural high
Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you 
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I laid in bed all night and I was
Drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby
And we drifted, drifted, drifted, drifted
Ooh, and I was yours
And you were my own, my own, baby
As we lay
As we lay underneath the stars, baby

I was drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting 
I was drifting, drifting, drifting, drifting 
Baby, I was fade, fade, fade, fading
And I was fade, fade, fade, fadingSanta Claus is coming to town

It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desirе for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wantеd you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn’t bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you  caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you’
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
I'll be missing you
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I

Te estoy pensando
En mi larga noche en soledad
Si el error fue amarte
En mi corazón vuelvo a estar mal
Porque estoy en ti
Y no se vivir
Si a mi lado no estás
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Dime si me sientes
Imaginando verme frente a ti
Siempre estás presеnte
Y en mis sueños logro dеscubrir
Que aunque no estás
Mi estrella fugaz
Te deseo alcanzar
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy

Hey, whoa, hey
Hey, hey, hey, yeah
You were so blind to let me go
You had it all but did not know
No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday, ooh, someday
The one you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey, hey
Boy, you're going to pay 'cause, baby, I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
As soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you shoulda have known
Believe me, I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others

Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll never come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me, the one and only?
And when your down and your time in need
And you're thinking 'bout
How you might be coming back to hold me
Just think again because I won't need your love anymore

Our neighbors needed help, and Robin Hood reached out to us for our support
New Yorkers answered the call and stepped up
Tonight, I would like to dedicate this song to the thousands of heroes in New York who did their part to help put our great city back on the road to full recovery
No, nothing could tear us away
We could be heroes, just for one day
We could be heroes, just for one day
And then a hero comеs along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears asidе
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in
A hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you

The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every, every heart prepare Him, prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing

And heaven and heaven and nature sing

Try to bring me down
But I will not allow
Anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me
They can't take this
From me
They can do anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won't ever win
If you cling to you pride
And just push them aside
See
I have learned there's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul
That they can not possess
So I won't be afraid
And darkness will fade
'Cause there's light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
They can't take this
'Cause there's light in me

They can try
But they can't take that away from me
They can't take this
Precious love
I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go
They can say anything they want to say
Try to break me down
But I won't face the ground
I will rise steadily
Sailing out of their reach
Oh Lord
They do try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams

Feel this pourin down on your buildings
The rain about to fall us
Score up in the project hall
Third floor gravitates on the staircase
As we embrace strictly loud without the raw bass
Me and my ol' dog blowin' out the smokes fog
But over all you, the one that's like my pistol, I said crystal
Keep you on my side 'til the ficial 
Ain't it ill how we click, boo? Just me and you
Got me stuck off the realness, just me and you

Lying that you're sexing me, when everybody knows
It's clear that you're upset with me, oh oh oh

You're delusional, you're delusional
Boy, you're losing your mind

You know what it is already
MC
Mocha
And no time surrendering
To the spice and cinnamon
Left you trembling and the nights remembering
The love lost
Got set up and tossed
If you say it ain't so
Well, that's how you come across 
Still can't spot one
Who can top son? 
Can call on your dogs
'Cause you know I'm one
If you put it in the clip, then I'll pop one 
If you push in the whip
Then I got shotgun 
Or back swoop, let's be practical
Act natural
Is what we have to do
I'ma ride for you
And then I'll slide with you
Understand, I ain't the one to be lying to 
I'm in my Benz drop
Crawling down your block
I'm like the ice you're working for
To put on your watch
I want you staring and comparing to the stuff you've got
Have your heart stop
Watch my joints chart tops
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually
We will find ourselves in love again
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Boy, when you look into my eyes
I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but it's true
You would think things have changed
But inside, I know I really feel the same
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Each night and every day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy inside
If there's a spark of hope in my grasp
I will keep holding on
'Cause it's worth the risk to have a second chance
I still believe in you 
I still believe in you
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
I still believe in you
Breakdown
All that I love 
Simply let go 
We let it all 
Just pass us by
Don't be afraid 
True love will never end
We will love
Again
Yes, yes, y'all, you know it don't stop
My keep rockin', 'cause I just keep that
Yes, yes, y'all, you know it don't stop

Uh, I know cats say I be
Lil' J-I-G
The dough backing you okay by me
I need a man in my life who can handle my price
And still be on my shh after I stand 'em up twice
Let me see if you got what I need
Like a little triggerman for the shopping sprees
Might let you lock me down with the option to leave
Point moves mandatory that you're copping me these
Plus I gotta be whipping the latest
And before anything, J has to okay this
So, make sure you're coming right with yours
I mean, like have me drummin' or fighting wars
Step your game up
If you're runnin' tight with yours
'Cause see my is returning the night before
I come in interested if you're interested
Ballers, I take up that never sensitive
I still believe in you and me 
Still believe that eventually 
We will find ourselves 
In love again 
I still believe, boy 
You know that true love never ends
I still believe in you and me 
Still believe that eventually 
We will find ourselves In love again

Uhh
Hmm
Uh, ooh
It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desire for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wanted you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relivе the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so wе finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you  caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night  I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you'
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and IS-s-someday

No one you'll find will ever be
Closer to all your dreams than me
Believing the grass would be greener
You told yourself "I just don't need her now"
But I know you'll soon discover
You're never satisfied with any other
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
And when you find yourself alone
Don't come back crying, you should have known
Believe me I'm not pretending
It's not hard to predict this ending now
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time when you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me the one and only
But when your down un your time of need
And you're thinking that you might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause I won't need your love anymore
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, someday, yeah yeah
Ohhh yeah yeah
You're gonna be wishing for me
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me, yeah yeah
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday, ooh, someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You're gonna be wishing for me
For me, for me, for me, for me, for me, yeah yeah
Someday, hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Someday
You're gonna be wishing for me
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping scoreThey can say anything they want to say
Try to bring me down
But I will not allow
Anyone to succeed
Hanging clouds over me
And they can try hard to make me feel
That I don't matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
’Cause there's a light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
From me
They can do anything they want to you
If you let them in
But they won’t ever win
If you cling to you pride
And just push them aside
See
I have learned there's an inner peace I own
Something in my soul
That they can not possess
So I won't be afraid
And darkness will fade
'Cause there's light in me
That shines brightly
They can try
But they can't take that away from me
No
They can't take this
Precious love
I'll always have inside me
Certainly the Lord will guide me
Where I need to go
They can say anything they want to say
Try to break me down
But I won’t face the ground
I will rise steadily
Sailing out of their reach
Oh Lord
They do try hard to make me feel
That I don’t matter at all
But I refuse to falter
In what I believe
Or lose faith in my dreams
'Cause there’s a light in me
That shines brightly
Yes, they can try
But they can't take that away from me
From meI would give up everything
Before I'd separate myself from you
After so much suffering
I finally found unvarnished truth
I was all by myself for the longest time
So cold inside
And the hurt from the heartache would not subside
I felt like dying
Until you saved my life
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby I'm so thankful I found you
I will give you everything
There's nothing in this world I wouldn't do
To ensure your happiness
I'll cherish every part of you
'Cause without you beside me I can't survive
Don't wanna try
If you keeping me warm each and every night
I'll be alright
'Cause I need you in my life
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
'Cause baby, I'm so thankful I found you
See, I was so desolate before you came to me
Looking back
I guess it shows that we were destined
To shine over the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel
This way
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
My every wish and every dream
Somehow became reality
When you brought the sunlight
Completed my whole life
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
See baby, I'm so thankful I found you
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found
You
You
I'm overwhelmed with gratitude
My baby, I'm so thankful I found youOh, oh, oh, oh
Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way
He's gonna make it happen
Make, make...
You can make it, you can make it...
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You, you can make it
You can make it...
You, you, you can make it...
You can make it...
You, you, you can make it...
You can make it...
Make it...
Make, make, make it..
If you believe..
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it Oh, ooh
Oh
I've seen the light in the sky
In disguise, like fireflies
Burning bright, just to vanish in the dark
I've held hope in my two hands
That there would be another chance
To find the kingdom
I'm believing in my heart
'Cause underneath the good
Is something greater than you know
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home
When you run, run so far
You've forgotten who you are
Where you're from, it's like some other universe
You count your steps like they're regrets
You catch one breath, then lose the rest
Wrong is right, right is left
And there's nowhere left to turn
So don't believe in everything
You think, you think you know
When you're almost there and you're almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
When you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home
When you let your
Heart be the compass
You won't get lost
Not if you trust it
When you hear the
Sound of the trumpet
Louder than ever before
When you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
'Cause you're almost there, almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
When you're almost there, almost home
Just open up your eyes and go
'Cause you're almost there, you're almost home
Know you're not alone, you're almost home
Home
Ooh, homeTake a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
How can I just let you walk away
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking
Every breath with you
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave
'Cause we've shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've got to face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one
Who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've got to take
Take a look at me now
So take a look at me now
'Cause there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've got to face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've got to take
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
Take a look at me nowI got a real remix

And no time surrendering
To the spice and cinnamon
Left you trembling and the nights remembering
The love lost
Got set up and tossed
If you say it ain't so
Well, that's how you come across 
Still can't spot one
Who can top son? 
Can call on your dogs
'Cause you know I'm one
If you put it in the clip, then I'll pop one 
If you push in the whip
Then I got shotgun 
Or back swoop, let's be practical
Act natural
Is what we have to do
I'ma ride for you
And then I'll slide with you
Understand, I ain't the one to be lying to 
I'm in my Benz drop
Crawling down your block
I'm like the ice you're working for
To put on your watch
I want you staring and comparing to the stuff you've got
Have your heart stop
Watch my joints chart tops
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually
We will find ourselves in love again
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Boy, when you look into my eyes
I get emotional inside
I know it's crazy, but it's true
You would think things have changed
But inside, I know I really feel the same
I still believe in you
And me
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
Each night and every day of my life
I'm filled with all the joy inside
If there's a spark of hope in my grasp
I will keep holding on
'Cause it's worth the risk to have a second chance
I still believe in you 
I still believe in you
Still believe eventually 
We will find ourselves in love again 
I still believe, boy
You know that true love never ends
I still believe in you
Breakdown
All that I love 
Simply let go 
We let it all 
Just pass us by
Don't be afraid 
True love will never end
We will love

And still be on my shh after I stand 'em up twice

Point moves mandatory that you're copping me these
Plus I gotta be whipping the latest
And before anything, J has to okay this
So, make sure you're coming right with yours
I mean, like have me drummin' or fighting wars

But when you wake up feelin' alone, you never shoulda let it go

We gonna struggle through all them hard times 
And I can tell you that peace and happiness is hard to find
C'mon, we can get there

But these demons got me seeing things that's really been misleading me
Maybe that's just my life
Baby, I'm just a thug, coldhearted, but I can feel the love

Before you came to me
Looking back I guess
It shows that we were
Destined to shine
After the rain, to appreciate
The gift of what we have
And I'd go through it all over again
To be able to feel this way
Thank God I found you
I was lost without you

Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds

Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
We let
We let, we let
Now looking back on all we've planned

Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?

In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far, like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the mеmory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all to havе
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love
Tonight
Just one more night
Just one more night 
Just one more night, just one more night
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on, go on without your love
Just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Just one more night
Just one more night
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine 
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song

What's up New York?
How you feeling?One summer night
We ran away for a while
Laughing, we hurried beneath the sky
To an obscure place to hide
That no one could find
And we drifted to another state of mind
And imagined I was yours and you were mine
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Weak in the knees
Wrapped in the warm gentle breezе
And I'm so shy 
A bundle of butterflies
Flushed with the heat of desire
On a natural high
As we drifted to another place in time
And the feeling was so heady and sublime
As I lost my heart to you there in the dark
Underneath the stars 
Beautiful and bitter sweetly
You were fading into me
And I was gently fading into you 
But the time went sailing by
Reluctantly we said good-bye
And left our secret place so far behind
And I lay in bed all night and I was drifting
To another state of mind 
And imagined I was yours and you were mine 
As we lay upon the grass there in the dark
Lay underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars 
I was drifting, drifting
Underneath the stars 
Underneath the stars, baby, babyI still believe
In you and me

It's evident, tha residents of So So Def
Got the industry on lock, where outsiders can't enter
Ever since the arrival of this West Side representer
Who rocks your Music Box and breaks down your structure
You fantasize as you visualize me as your Dreamlover
With your emotions unplugging your daydream face reality
Reason through mc's, Inflicting fatalities
Ain't no cap on my salary, I'm gettin' g's
If you heard of me's, then you know that we's makin' g's
Let's Xscape with Mariah Carey and me to tha back
Steady stacking papers, smokin' on fat stacks of danks
See, to some I'm a hero of this feel on file, but that's my style
And they don't pay me, nor can they fade me
So what I do is keep it true and real for my peeps in that street 'Cause to them, I'ma always be their baby
We were as one, baby
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you wanna be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, baby
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh, darling cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If your determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably, you'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, baby
Our love will never end, no, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're ever gonna shake me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back, boy 
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder
I know that you'll be right back baby
Oh baby believe me it's only a matter of time, time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me
Ooh darling cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I - we'll always beSo take a look at me now
Take a look at me now
How can I just let you walk away?
Just let you leave without a trace
When I stand here taking every breath with you, ooh
You're the only one who really knew me at all
How can you just walk away from me
When all I can do is watch you leave?
'Cause we shared the laughter and the pain
And even shared the tears
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So takе a look at me now
'Cause therе's just an empty space
There's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
When there's just an empty space
And you coming back to me is against the odds
And that's what I've gotta face
I wish I could just make you turn around
Turn around and see me cry
There's so much I need to say to you
So many reasons why
You're the only one who really knew me at all
So take a look at me now
There's just an empty space
And there's nothing left here to remind me
Just the memory of your face
So take a look at me now
So there's just an empty space
But to wait for you is all I can do
And that's what I've gotta face
Take a good look at me now
'Cause I'll still be standing here
And you coming back to me is against all odds
That's the chance I've gotta take
Hey, yeah
Whoa
Take a look at me now
MmmOh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Oh, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet, sweet, baby

Thank you everybody, stay happy, stay blessed
Goodnight...When we were together
Everything just felt right
It seemed we were destined
To last for a lifetime
I wasn't prepared
To be left standing
Up here in tears
Don't you know I
Can't help thinking that life
Will never be the same
Time goes by
But my love for you never dies
Once in a lifetime"]
Te estoy pensando
En mi larga noche en soledad
Si el error fue amarte
En mi corazón vuelvo a estar mal
Porque estoy en ti
Y no se vivir
Si a mi lado no estás
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Dime si me sientes
Imaginando verme frente a ti
Siempre estás presente
Y en mis sueños logro descubrir
Que aunque no estás
Mi estrella fugaz
Te deseo alcanzar
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar
Reviviendo aquí nuestra canción
Mi todo te lo doy
Por tener tu amor
Mi todo yo te doy
Por una noche más
Y así poder sentir
Tu cuerpo junto a mí
Ya no puedo estar

To disillusion me one more time

I get thе chills when you in my sight
Feels like it's meant to be right
Thank God I found you
I feel a rush when I kiss you at night, uh
Shorty knows she my baby girl and
Player haters try hard to get her
But she'll be lounging in my cradle tonight, oh
Typically a thug wouldn't say this
But you see, your love has got me faded
No girl ever made me feel like you do, oh
Hmm, I'ma be here night after night to
Feel your loving arms around me
Baby, baby, baby, baby, you make it alright

What? A thug's dream wife, jeans tight, beautiful skin
Matching brown Timbs, hot as jalapenos
She knows how to hide the ninos
The rap Rudolph Valentino
In beef I become the black Al Pacino
Relax, sweetie, in Benz you could watch the TV
Or lay back and pump Mariah's hot CD
And I'ma touch you in the wrong places
Or we could walk through the park
In our bubble north faces, I'm lost in your love
Thank God I found you, you my crown jewel
I'm sayin' boo the type I give my last name to
Make it last
At Lover's Lane, put the top up
When it start to rain in the parkin' lot
Then we finish doing our thing
Fog the windows, gettin' very sentimental
Sippin' Cosmos with the cherry in the middle
I keep it honest, word to Will, that's my promise
Signin' off, truly yours, Nastradamus
Thank God I found you
Thank God I found you, thank you, Lord
We make it last, make it last
We make it last, make it last

In my imagination I be all up on you
I know you got that fever for me 102°
And boy I know I feel the same
My temperature's through the roof
Touch my body, put me on the floor
Wrestle me around, play with me some more
Touch my body, throw me on the bed
I just wanna make you feel like you never did
Touch my body, let me wrap my thighs
All around your waist, just a little taste
Touch my body, know you like my curves
Come on and give me what I deserve
And touch my body
If there's a camera up in here
Then it's gon' leave with me when I do 
If there's a camera up in here
Then I best not catch this flick on YouTube 
Cause if you run your mouth
And brag about this secret rendezvous
I will hunt you down
Cause they be all up in my business
Like a Wendy interview
But this is private 'tween you and I

A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder

I got you stuck off the realness

I got you stuck off the realness
I got you stuck off the realness 
I got you stuck off the realness
It wasn't raining yet 
But it was definitely 
A little misty on that warm November night
And my heart was pounding 
My inner voice resounding
Begging me to turn away
But I just had to see your face to feel alive
And then you casually walked into the room
And I was twisted in the web
Of my desirе for you
My apprehension blew away
I only wantеd you to taste my sadness
As you kissed me in the dark
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
And so we finished the Moet and
Started feeling liberated
And I surrendered as you took me
In your arms 
I was so caught up in the moment
I couldn't bear to let you go yet
So I threw caution to the wind
And started listening to my longing heart
And then you softly pressed your lips to mine
And feelings surfaced I'd suppressed
For such a long time 
And for a while I forgot the sorrow and pain
And melted with you as we stood there in the rain
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time
To relieve the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you  caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Last night I dreamed that I
Whispered the words 'I love you'
And touched you so very subtly
As we were kissing goodbye
Ooh, yeah, yeah
Hey, baby
I'm missing you
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need 
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night 
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me 
And go back in time 
To relive the splendor of you and I 
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and I
On the rooftop that rainy night
Every time  I feel the need
I envision you caressing me
And go back in time
To relive the splendor of you and IOoh

Let's talk about love
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I'm gonna take a little timе
A littlе time to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide
It looks like love has finally found me
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is 
I want you to show me 
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
Show me, I wanna know
What
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
And I know you can show me
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
Let's talk about love
And I'm feeling so much loveWhen you get caught in the rain
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught
And in pain without anyone
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's ok
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid 
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh yes you can
You're gonna make it through the
RainDo you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Do you get what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you know
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Now looking back on all we've planned
We let so many dreams slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answer to those questions can be
Do you know where you're going to
Do you like the things that life is showing you
Where are you going to
Do you know
Do you get what you're hoping for
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for
Do you knowWon't you please?

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name 
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, oh, yeah
That's right
Make it 
You're gonna make it
Make it 
Whoa, make it
Oh-oh 
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want 
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord, oh yeah
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen
Don't let go
Don't ever, ever let go 
Don't let go
Don't ever, ever let go
Don't let go
Don't ever, ever let go 
Don't let go

If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want 
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen 
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happenThere's got to be a way

Couldn't we just help each other?
Isn't there enough to share?
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we'll bring on a change 
In another land they still believe
Color grants supremacy
I don't understand
How there can be
Regulated bigotry
Some of us don’t even wonder
Some of us don’t even care
Couldn't we accept each other?
Can’t we make ourselves aware?
There's got to be a way
To connect this world today
Come together to relieve the pain, yeah
There's got to be a way
To unite this human race
And together we’ll bring on a change

And hungry children won't have to die
If we work together today
We'll save tomorrow, yeah, hey, oh yes

I didn't mean it when I said
I didn't love you so
I should have held on tight
I never should have let you go
I didn't know nothing
I was stupid, I was foolish
I was lying to myself
I couldn't have fathomed
I would ever be without your love
Never imagined I'd be sitting
Here beside myself Guess I didn't know you
Guess I didn't know me
But I thought I knew everything
I never felt
The feeling that I'm feeling
Now that I don't hear your voice
Or have your touch and kiss your lips
'Cause I don't have a choicе
Oh what I wouldn't give
To have you lying by my side
Right hеre, 'cause, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please 'cause
We belong together
Who else am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who’s gonna talk to me on the phone
Till the sun comes up
Who’s gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby
We belong together, baby
When you left I lost a part of me
It's still so hard to believe
Come back, baby, please 'cause
We belong together
Who am I gonna lean on
When times get rough
Who’s gonna talk to me
Till the sun comes up
Who’s gonna take your place
There ain't nobody better
Oh, baby baby
We belong together
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To erase all my burdens
And let me be free to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
He said He'll never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him
I need you Lord, I need you Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head up
With God's love you'll survive
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home
Carry me higher LordHere it comes and here it comes
And here it comes again

Guess who's back in the mutherfuckin' house
With two big tig 'ol bitties for your mouth
Heartbreakers must partake in the sensation
So So Def and Clue, hits in the making
Oh, guess who's driving the 5 double O
Like yipi-yi, yipi-yo, yeah
When I talk smack, y'all better skip back
Like here we go, cause the b*tch don't play
Oh your love's so good
I don't wanna let go
And although I should
I can't leave you alone
'Cause you're so disarming
I'm caught up in the midst of you
And I cannot resist at all
Boy if I do
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feeling used
Would you go and break
My heart?
Heartbreaker
You got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back
Incessantly
Oh why did you have to
Run your game on me

You'd go and break my heart

It's a shame to be
So euphoric and weak
When you smile at me
And you tell me the things
That you know
Persuade me to relinquish my love
To you
But I cannot resist resist resist at all
Boy if I do 
The things you want me to
The way I used to do
Would you love me baby
Or leave me feeling used
Would you go and break
My heart?
She wanna pillow fight in the middle of the night
She wanna drive my Benz with five of her friends
She wanna creep past the block, spying again
She wanna roll with Jay, chase skeeos away
She wanna fight with lame chicks, blow my date
She wanna inspect the rest, kick me to the curb
If she find one strand of hair longer than hers
She want love in the jacuzzi, rub up in the movies
Access to the old crib, keys to the newbie
She wanna answer the phone, tattoo her arm
That's when I gotta send her back to her moms
She calls me heartbreaker
When we apart, it makes her want a piece of paper
Scribble down "I hate ya", but she knows she loves Jay because
She loves everything Jay say, Jay does, and all
Heartbreaker
You got the best of me
But I just keep on coming back
Incessantly

Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door
What are you hoping for?
Do you know?
Once we were standing still in time
Chasing the fantasies that filled our minds
You knew how I loved you but my spirit was free
Laughin' at the questions that you once asked of me
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Now looking back on all we've planned
We let so many dreams slip through our hands
Why must we wait so long before we see
How sad the answer to those questions can be?
Do you know where you're going to?
Do you like the things that life is showing you?
Where are you going to?
Do you know?
Do you get what you're hoping for?
When you look behind you, there's no open door

TonightTreated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Prayed through the nights
Felt so alone
Suffered from alienation
Carried the weight on my own
Had to be strong
So I believed
And now I know I've succeeded
In finding the place I conceived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized the dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
You treated me kind
Sweet destiny
And I'll be eternally grateful
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you turned out to beYou'll always be my baby

I know you're kinda busy with your elves right now
And I don't know how
You do the things you do while I sleep on Christmas Eve
But it's amazing
And I bet that you could bring me back my baby
Because every time I see Christmas lights
I feel this burn inside and I just can't take it
I saw them shopping last week
And his new girl was so bleak
And then I swore to myself
Santa's gonna come and make him mine this Christmas night
Ho, ho, ho

There is just one thing I need
I don't care about presents
Underneath the Christmas tree
I don't need to hang my stocking
There upon the fireplace
Santa Claus won't make me happy
With a toy on Christmas day
I just want you for my own
More than you could ever know
Make my wish come true
All I want for Christmas is you...
You baby
Ho ho ho

Thank God I found youSometimes life can be kinda like a rollercoaster ride
It's like... you go on along and everything seems cool...
It's not like you're looking down, but... you're not necessarily looking up... to see who's really in control
When I was little, I used to be so scared of rollercoasters
But, eventually you have to face your fears
If you don't get on the ride, you won't experience the adventure...

I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again
Can't stop now, I've traveled so far
To change this lonely life
I wanna know what love is
I want you to show me
I wanna feel what love is
I know you can show me
I'm gonna take a little time
A little timе to look around me
I've got nowhere left to hide

When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rainThrough the rain, through the rain

I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won’t let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won’t pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I’m wishing on tonight
I’d give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
’Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight

ButterflyWhen you love someone so deeply
They become your life
It's easy to succumb
To overwhelming fears inside
Blindly I imagined I could
Keep you under glass
Now I understand to hold you
I must open up my hands
And watch you rise
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I have learned that beauty
Has to flourish in the light
Wild horses run unbridled
Or their spirit dies
You have given me the courage
To be all that I can
And truly feel your heart will
Lead you back to me when you’re
Ready to land
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
I can't pretend these tears
Aren't overflowing steadily
I can’t prevent this hurt from
Almost overtaking me
But I will stand and say goodbye
For you'll never be mine
Until you know the way it feels to fly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
My butterfly
Spread your wings and prepare to fly
For you have become a butterfly
Fly abandonedly into the sun
If you should return to me
We truly were meant to be
So spread your wings and fly
Butterfly
So flutter through the sky
Butterfly
Spread your wings and fly
ButterflyThose days of love are gone
Our time is through
Still I burn on and on
All of my life, only for you
From now until...
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
As long as I shall live
I'll hold you dear
And I will reminisce
Of our love all through the years
From now until
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one, yes
You will always be the only one
If you should ever need me
Unfailingly I will return to your arms
And unburdеn your heart
And if you should remembеr
That we belong together
Never be ashamed
Call my name
Tell me I'm the one you treasure
Forever
And ever, my darling
Forever
You will always be the only one
You will always be the only one
Oh baby, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one
Forever, you will always be the only one

Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
I feel good, I feel nice
I've never felt so satisfied

When you touch me tenderly
I don't know if it's real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
In the morning when I rise
You are the first thing on my mind
And in the middle of the night

It feels like a dream
When you love me tenderly
I don't know if you're for real
But I like the way I feel inside
You've got me feeling emotions
Deeper than I've ever dreamed of
You've got me feeling emotions
Higher than the heavens above
Oh, you've got me feeling emotions

Give me that unconditional love
Why do I stay, why do I stay in love?
Why do I stay, why do I stay in love?
Dying insidе 'cause I can't stand it
Make or break up, can't takе this madness
We don't even really know why
All I know is, baby, I try and try so hard to keep our love alive
If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it
From our hearts and minds and I know
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down 
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you
Na na na na na na na na na
Na na na na na na na na na 
Na na na na na na na na na
Baby, I stay in love with you
Oh-oh
Oh-oh

Give me that, give me that...
Na na na na na na na na na

And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
I stay in love, oh, I stay
I stay in love
I stay in love, oh, I stay
I stay in love
I stay in love, oh, I stay
I stay in love
Oh-oh-oh-oh

And you coming back to me

Take a look at me now

        When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once againThrough the rain, through the rain
Through the rain, through the rain
When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say that
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prеvail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up oncе again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rainMine

Honey, you can have me when you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
Every time you call me I come runnin' 
'Cause what you got is far beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another tastе of your honey
It's like honey whеn it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin'  for ya, cryin'  for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?
Every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey, I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Oh, I can't be elusive with you, honey 
'Cause it's blatant that I'm feelin' you 
And it's too hard for me to leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me 
Oh baby, I've got a dependency 
Always strung out for another taste of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dyin' for ya, cryin' for ya, I adore ya
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you, darlin', don't you see?

I need it, need it, need it
I need it, need it, need it, need it, need itI am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Baby, can you feel me?
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love tonight
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night, just one more night
Just one more night
I'd give my all to have
 Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life 
Feel your body, feel your body, baby 
I'd give my all 
I'd give my all
 I'd risk my life
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
I'd give my all, I'd give my all, I'd give my all
 I'd risk my life
 I'd risk my life
I, I'd, I'd give my all

Don't leave, don't, don't leave
Don't leave, don't, don't leave
Don't leave, don't, don't leave
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drownеd in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have 
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel 
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
So put your loving arms around me, boy
And hold me like I was a cuddly toy
Let me feel that warmth of your embrace
Don't let go, oh
'Cause there could be no sadder sight to see
Than if we were to miss this opportunity
So send me up a signal and I'll catch the light
If there's no time, you know it's up to you
 So why don't you
Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child 
Stay a little while, child
There's no need to act surprised
Cause there's no room to serve us right
So let's push love to the limit
And life to the edge
I've only one request of you
Stay a while
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonightSo sweet
In my daydreams
And every night, you creep into my dreams
Fantasy
It's so deep, but it's a fantasy
Every night, you creep into my dreams
It's so real
In my daydreams
It's just a sweet
It's just a sweet
In my daydreams
It seems so real
You touch me
You come into my room
Come to me
But it's just a fantasy
It feels so sweet
But it's just a dream
Oh baby, it's just a sweet fantasy
And daydream is all that I can do
I feel raptured over you
In silence I keep it to myself
Come and take me
Don't want nobody else
Take me down
Take me down
And a sweet and sweet
And a sweet so sweet
And a sweet and sweet
And it's deeper than reality
It's just a sweet
It's just so sweet
You're like the kiss of life
You're like the kiss of life
Building in the sky
Boy, you're just a fantasy
Oh baby, you come into my room
But you're just a fantasyDon't ever be lonely

We're gonna try and make it happen for you tonight
Is that alright?
Not more than three short years ago
Without a penny to my name
No proper shoes upon my feet
I often cried myself to sleep
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen, that's right
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Ay! I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away, no
I used to feel the way you do
But still I had to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen, ooh yeah
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want 
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Ohhhh
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord 
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it happen
Make it happen
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Just hold on
There will be tomorrow
And in time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youUm...

I can make, I can make, I can make, I can make
I can make, I can make, I can make, I can make
I can make it through the rain
When you get caught in the rain with nowhere to run
When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I can make it through the rainAnd you feel so far away

Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You’re gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You’re gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord 
He’s gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I’ve found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen

Oh, oh, oh

You, you, you can make itThere's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
And no one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search into yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear, yeah yes
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And then you cast your fears aside
Because you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And then you'll finally see the truth
See that a hero lies in you, whoa oh
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Just hold on, hold on and hold on
And here will be tomorrow
And in time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And then you cast your fears aside
Because you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And then you'll finally see the truth
See that a hero lies in you in you in you in you in you
Oh yes it does, oh yes it does
That a hero lies in you
Thank youNew York! I know we're strong enough to get through this
We will rise again!

Through the Rain

And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day

And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say

Good nightWhen you get caught in the rain
With nowhere to run
When you're distraught
And in pain without anyone
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone, it's ok
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down
Don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound
So keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid
There's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again
On my own and I know
That I'm strong enough to mend
And everytime I feel afraid
I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day
And I make it through the rain
I can make it through the rain
And stand up once again
And I'll live one more day, and I
I can make it through the rain
Oh yes you can
You're gonna make it through the
RainI love this song
When I was little I won a talent contest singing this song
And I believe it went a little something like this...
Guess mine is not the first heart broken
My eyes are not the first to cry
I'm not the first to know
There's just no getting over you
Ladies and Gentlemen, Olivia Newton-John!
You know, I'm just a fool who's willing
To sit around and wait for you
But baby can't you see
There's nothing else for me to do
I'm hopelessly devoted to you
But now there's nowhеre to hide
Since you pushеd my love aside
I'm out of my head
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Hopelessly devoted to you
Olivia Newton-John!I don't know if anybody else out there tonight
Knows what it feels like
To want somebody so bad
That nothing and nobody
Can ever seem to fill that void
That's the situation that I'm talking about right now
And if you feel me
Sing this song with me
Come on
Oh I wish you knew
What I feel inside for you
You probably haven't got a clue
But I wish you knew
How I love you baby
Still love you
Ooh
Do do do do do
Thank you so much...What's up Anaheim!
I go by the name of The Young King
DJ Suss One

I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving ain't the same
And you keep on playing games
Like you know I'm here to stay
I gotta shake, shake you off
Just like the Calgon commercial
I really gotta get up outta here
And go somewhere
I gotta shake you off
Gotta make that move
Find somebody who
Appreciates all the love I give
Boy I gotta shake, shake you off
Gotta do what's best for me
Baby and that means I gotta
Shake you off

Just ask your momma she knows
You're gonna miss me baby
Hate to say "I told you so"
Well at first I didn't know
But now it's clear to me
You would cheat with all your freaks
And lie compulsively
So I packed up my Louis Vuitton
Jumped in your ride and took off

Who loves you more than me
I gotta shake you off
Cause the loving ain't the same

I gotta take a little time
A little time to think things over
I better read between the lines
In case I need it when I'm colder
In my life there's been heartache and pain
I don't know if I can face it again

And I know you can show meI shouldn't have walked away
I would've stayed if you said
We could've made everything ok
But we just
Threw the blame back and forth
We treated love like a sport
The final blow hit so low
I'm still on the ground
I couldn't have prepared myself for this fall
Shattered in pieces curled on the floor
Super natural love conquers all
'member we used to touch the sky
And
Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry
C'mon babe can't our love be revived
Bring it back and we gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just tryin' to survive
As the angels cry
Limitless omnipresent
Kind of love couldn't have guessed
It would just up and disappear in
The whirlwind
Here I am walkin' on this narrow rope
Wobbling but won't let go
Waitin' for a glimpse of the sun's glow
I know I can stand just pull me back up
Like there ain't no hurricane
It's just us
I'm willing to live and die for our love
Baby we can get back that shine
'Cause
Lightning don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it drift
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cry
Come on baby, can our love be revived
Bring it back and we're gon' make it right
I'm on the edge just trying to survive
As the angels cry
Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Baby I'm missin'
You don't allow love to lose
We gotta ride it through
I'm reaching for you
Lighting don't strike
The same place twice
When you and I said goodbye
I felt the angels cry
True love's a gift
But we let it slip
In a storm
Every night
I feel the angels cryIn love with you

If you don't know me at this point
Then I highly doubt you ever will
I really need you to give me
That unconditional love I used to feel
It's a mistake if we just erase it 
From our hearts and minds and I know
We said let go, but I kept on hanging on
Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around

Hey, what I wanna do is ride shotgun next to you
With the top down, like we used to
Hit the block, proud in the SUV
We both know our heart is breaking
Can we learn from our mistakes?
I can't last one moment alone

Inside I know it's over, you're really gone
It's killing me 'cause there ain't a thing that I can do
Baby, I stay in love with you
And I keep on telling myself that you'll come back around
And I try to front like "oh, well"
Each time you let me down 
See, I can't get over you now, no matter what I do
But baby, baby, I stay in love with you

When you're distraught and in pain without anyone
When you keep crying out to be saved, but nobody comes
And you feel so far away
That you just can't find your way home
You can get there alone
It's okay, once you say that
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And if you keep falling down, don't you dare give in
You will arise safe and sound, so keep pressing on steadfastly
And you'll find what you need to prevail
Once you say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up oncе again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And evеry time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain
And when the wind blows
And shadows grow close
Don't be afraid, there's nothing you can't face
And should they tell you
You'll never pull through
Don't hesitate
Stand tall and say
I can make it through the rain
I can stand up once again on my own
And I know that I'm strong enough to mend
And every time I feel afraid, I hold tighter to my faith
And I live one more day and I make it through the rain

        Do do do do do do do do
Do do do
I knew they were singers
And that's why...
We know we're not going to sing this song
I don't think we're gonna sing this song
But somehow I know that...
Jimmy Fallon, he had a concept
And he, he, he
Oh Jimmy said
"I'd like Trey, I'd like Teka and I'd like Tippity Tot to sing it
All up for me"
Won't you just give them a little bit of some kind of emotion on your face like
"Oh I'm feeling something even though we’re not quite sure what Mariah’s doing right now"
We don’t know I see your bla- I see your iPhone, please turn it down
And that was my bad side as well
Oh hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell, hell
Oh why, oh somebody tell me why
And I see you filming me, what the f-
Ooooohhhh
All I know is this part...
But I do recall
That I thought we said we’d get the audience's faces
After this, love will survive...
We don’t even just do this part at all
Let’s skip to another
One of the songs on the repertoire
Repertoire
Just give them some of you, please
Give em some of you...
Please, sing, with me...
I said please...
I think we’re supposed to be angry when I’m singing this song "The Art of Letting Go"
'Cause that song...
We didn’t write it together but I think we should
Try to switch to it I know we can go
Oh we don’t care, just play it in the same damn key, I don’t care
Ohmmm, hold on...
I’m making a statement
I just raised it so much higher
Of my own opinion
Just a brief little reminder
To help myself remember
Doesn’t matter what you do because I
No longer live In that dominion that I once lived in
Where there was people that I didn’t like
And they were there every day and it was
Oh so difficult to be there
But I stayed and I stayed
And I stayed
And I wore them dresses and I did that shit that I hated it, hated it Oh woah woah
Letting go!
Letting go!
Letting go!
Ain’t easy…
'Cause somebody you used to know
They're just flinging your world around
'Cause they're watching you fall
Down
That is a real MFer right there
He don’t even know this song at all
Evidently the words were
But we can...
There’s a verse, we can change any way we like…
...to be continued, okay! I'm exhausted! I'm gonna leave here before I really really go to far!Ooh baby, baby
Ooh baby, oh, yeah
I need a lover to give me
The kind of love that will last always
I need somebody uplifting
To take me away, babe, oh yeah, yeah
I want a lover who knows me, yeah
Who understands how I feel inside
Someone to comfort and hold me
Through the long lonely nights 'till the dawn
Why don't you take me away?
Dreamlover, come rescue me 
Take me up, take me down
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
With you, baby
I don't want another pretender, no
To disillusion me one more time
Whispering words of forever
Playing with my mind, no no
No, no, no, no, no, baby
I need someone to hold on to
The kind of love that won't fly away
I just want someone to belong to
Every day of my life, always
So come and take me away
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down 
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you please come around? 
'Cause I wanna share forever with you
Baby, come and take me away
Dreamlover, come rescue me
Take me up, take me down 
Take me anywhere you want to, baby, now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you please  come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, baby
Dreamlover, come rescue me 
Take me up, take me down 
Take me anywhere you want to baby now
I need you so desperately 
Won't you please come around?
'Cause I wanna share forever with you, babyNot more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord 
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul

It isn't right
I should have said I love you
Why didn't I just tell you?
God knows I need you to know
Oh, baby, no
I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
You will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
Somewhere I know you'll be with me
Someday in another time
But right now you're gone
You just vanished away
But I'll never leave you behind
No, I'll never forget you
I'll never let you out of my heart
Oh, you will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
Oh, you will always be here with me
I'll hold on to the memories, baby
No, I'll never forget you Not more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord 
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
If you believe in yourself enough

And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord

I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it

Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Said I feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me

You treated me kind 
Sweet destiny 
And I'll be eternally grateful 
Holding you so close to me
Prayed through the nights
So faithfully 
Just knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually

I had a vision of love
I had a vision of love
And it was all
All that you
Turned out to
Be-yeahHey everyone...
I'm just doing my best to try and celebrate with you this Easter this Holy Week
Quite the unique time in history, a time that doesn't allow us to be together in person and to be festive and worship with one another. But I'm grateful that so many of us are staying home, staying safe and in doing so, keeping each other safe. We're united in this effort and in this moment
I want to take this time to acknowledge and honor the sacrifices and couragе of those who work every day taking carе of their communities in this time of need and uncertainty
The heroes who are making our daily lives possible. Let’s continue to support them and each other
This is Hero...
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
And no one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
But you can find love
If you search within yourself
And then the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies
A hero lies, a hero lies, a hero...
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
Thank you so much... love you...Silent night
Holy night
Son of God
Oh love's pure light
Radiant beams from Thy holy face
With the dawn of redeeming grace
Jesus, Jesus Lord at Thy, Thy birth
Oh Jesus Lord at Thy birth...

The Lord is come
Let earth receive her King
Let every heart prepare Him room
And heaven and nature sing

While fields and floods
Rocks, hills, and plains
Repeat the sounding joy

Joy to the world
All the boys and girls
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and me

Joy to you and me
Joy to the people everywhere you see
Joy to you and meThe fire is burning
The room's all aglow
Outside the December wind blows
Away in the distance the carolers sing in the snow
Everybody's laughing
The world is celebrating
And everyone's so happy
Except for me tonight
Because I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I'm all right
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time
I gaze out the window
This cold winter's night
At all of the twinkling lights
Alone in the darkness
Remembering when you were mine
Everybody's smiling
The whole world is rejoicing
And everyone's embracing
Except for you and I
Baby I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I'm all right
But then I miss you, most at Christmas time
In the springtime those memories start to fade
With the April rain
Through the summer days
Till Autumn's leaves are gone
I get by without you
Till the snow begins to fall
And then I miss you
Most at Christmas time
And I can't get you
Get you off my mind
Every other season comes along
And I'm all right...
But then I miss you, most at Christmas timeOoh keep that shit simple
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Keep that shit simple
Oh yeah yeah yeah
Baby don't play me
You know you made out of sandStill deal with the side effects
Still deal with the side effects
I was a girl, you was the man
I was too young to understand
I was naive, I just believed
Everything that you told me
Said you were strong, protecting me
Then I found out that you were weak
Keeping me there, under your thumb
'Cause you were scared that I'd become much
More than you could handle
Shining like a chandelier
That decorated every room inside
The private hell we built
And I dealt with it
Like a kid, I wished I could fly away, but instead
I kept my tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started, I'd keep cryin'
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects  
Side effects 
You know I gotchu, Bus-a-bus!
Get rid of the stress, rub it off girl
You don’t really need that, brush it off girl
You ain’t really going back, we ain’t tolerating that
And you know don’t you need to cut it off, girl
Real talk, baby, know I feel your pain
Let me lift your strength cuz it would kill your brain
I don’t even really gotta say no name
Even I was going through the same ol same
Little situation that would probably make you insane
Watch you get a little bored up at the loss of the game
The side effect would probably make you bug just a little bit
While you go through it and you feel a little shame
But it’s alright, it’s ok
See now I’mma get low, I know my way
Real slow, I’mma take it day by day
I remember what my momma used to say
“Stand up straight , hold your head high 
Sky is the limit,  so reach for the sky 
Live to the fullest little baby don’t cry
Don’t matter what they tryin’ to do, fly, baby, fly
Now that I’m good, I’mma reach for the next
While I see the world different from my new specs
On everything that I love with all due respect
I say we moves on, minus the side effects, MC!
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folks be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Vacant inside, no one was there
Couldn't be real, had to keep quiet
Once in a while, put up a fight
It's just too much, night after night
After a while, I would just lie
You was dead wrong, said you was right
Did what I could just to survive
Couldn't believe this was my life
Flickering like a candle
Doing my best to handle sleeping with the enemy
Aware that he was smothering every last part of me
So I broke away and finally found the strength to leave
Kept the tears inside
'Cause I knew if I started I'd keep crying
For the rest of my life with you
I finally built up the strength to walk away
Don't regret it, but I still live with the side effects
Waking up scared some nights
Still dreaming about them violent times
Still a little protective 'bout the people that I let inside
Still a little defensive, thinkin' folk be tryin' to run my life
Still a little depressed inside
I fake a smile and deal with the side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Side effects 
Forgive, but I can't forget
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me 
Forgive, but I can't forget 
Every day I deal with this
I live with the side effects
But I ain't gon' let them get the best of me 
I kept my tears inside

I can't help it
When I’m not around you 
'Cause all I ever seem to do is drift away
In dreams about you
Cause when I'm without you 
It always seems like part of me is missing baby
Sometimes I don’t call
Like I don't care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all
 I need you  adore you 
Gotta have you

My hеart races when my Motorola beeps
Or my cell rings
I just makе a wish and if it's you
My whole day changes
Cause when I know you’re thinking of me 
Heaven knows
Suddenly it’s not so dismal baby
Sometimes I don't call
Like I don’t care at all
But secretly, you're the only thing
That lifts me up and makes me smile
When I'm unhappy
All you gotta do is call
And suddenly things don't really
Seem so bad at all
 I need you  adore you 
Gotta have you 
I wanna feel your touch
This ain’t no little crush

And never let you go boy
Never let you go boy
Baby I need youYou don't think that I’ll be strong enough
No, baby no
I won't be a prisoner of your love
No longer blind
I can focus on deception
Used to keep me by your side
I read your mind
Don't believe it’s all a mystery
There's nothing you can hide
It's all defined
There's nothing you can tell me now
To change the way I feel inside
All the dreams we planned
I believed so I held on
I understand
So when the morning comes
You know that I'll bе gone
You don't think that I'll be strong enough
No, baby, no
I won't bе the prisoner of your love
I’m just not the girl you thought I was
I won’t be a prisoner of your love
I'm not one of those girls who’ll wait around
Crying 'cause you're playing dirty all over the town
You can't do that
I’m not a doormat
You're just a player
That's not my format
See ya
Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind
Believe me I believe in you
There's nothing this feeling couldn't do
Move closer my darling
Feel the love in my eyes
Hey darlin'
I know you think my love is slipping away
But baby it's all in your mind
Don't worry
Hold on tight and hear me when I say
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Baby it's all in your mind
Someday hey hey
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
You'll change your mind and call my name
Soon as you find they're all the same
'Cause I know you'll soon discover
You're needing me in spite of all the others
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score
Maybe now you just can't conceive
That there'll ever come a time
When you're cold and lonely
Baby, how could you ever believe
That another could replace me
The one and only
But when your down
In your time of need
And you're thinking that you
Might be coming back to own me
Just think again 'cause
I won't need your love anymore!
Someday Oo Someday
One you gave away will be the only one you're wishing for
Someday hey hey
Boy you're gonna pay 'cause baby I'm the one who's keeping score]

When his candy kisses sweetly
Caress my whole body

Called "Anytime You Need a Friend"...
I just wanna dedicate it to everybody here tonight...
Thank you for coming...
If you're lonely
And need a friend
And troubles seem like
They never end
Just remember to keep the faith
And love will be there to light the way
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're milеs away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever bе lonely
Love will make it alright
When the shadows are closing in
And your spirit diminishing
Just remember you're not alone
And love will be there
To guide you home
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again 
So don't you fear 
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side 
So don't you ever be lonely
Love will make it alright
If you just believe in me
I will love you endlessly
Take my hand
Take me into your heart
I'll be there forever baby
I won't let go
I'll never let go
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here
You'll never be alone again 
So don't you fear 
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
So don't you ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright
Anytime you need a friend
I will be here 
You'll never be alone again
So don't you fear
Even if you're miles away
I'm by your side
Don't worry, don't ever be lonely
It's alright
It's alright!I had it all
But I let it slip away
Couldn't see that I treated you wrong
Now I wander around
Feeling down and cold
Trying to believe that you're gone
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone
I'm losing my mind
From this hollow in my heart, oh yeah
Suddenly I'm so incomplete
Lord I'm needing you now
Won't you tell me how to stop the rain
My tears are falling down endlеssly
Love takes time
To hеal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I was blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
'Cause love takes time
And I don't want to be here
I don't want to be here alone
You might say that it's over
You might say that you don't care
You might say you don't miss me
You don't need me
But I know that you do and I feel that you do
Inside
Love takes time
To heal when you're hurting so much
Couldn't see that I, I was so blind
To let you go
I can't escape the pain
Inside
Because love takes time yeah
I don't want to be there
I don't want to be there aloneThere's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the еmptiness you felt
Will disappear
And thеn a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Just hold on
And there will be tomorrow
And in time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youNo I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
No I can't forget tomorrow
When I think of all my sorrow
When I had you there
But then I let you go
And now it's only fair
That I should let you know
What you should know
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
Well I can't forget this evening
Or your face as you were leaving
But I guess that's just the way
The story goes
You always smile but in your eyes
Your sorrow shows
Yes it shows
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
I can't live
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No
I can't live
No I can't live
No, no I
No no no no I
No no no no I
Can't live 
If living is without you
I can't live
I can't give anymore
No no I
No no no no I
Can't liveLying beside you, here in the dark
Feeling your heart beat with mine
Softly you whisper, you're so sincere
How could our love be so blind
We sailed on together
We drifted apart
And here you are by my side
So now I come to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me
Open arms...
Living without you, living alone
This empty house seems so cold
Wanting to hold you, wanting you near
How much I wanted you homе
But now that you've come back
Turned night into day
I need you to stay
So now I comе to you, with open arms
Nothing to hide, believe what I say
So here I am, with open arms
Hoping you'll see what your love means to me...
Open armsThis was requested, I haven't been doing it...
But I guess it's nice tonight night, we're gonna make it happen here...
I love those shirts they are stonewinner
Anyway...
Staying on the upward way...
Don't ever let anybody put you down
I don't care if I keep saying it over and over
You gotta keep believing it
And that's how you make it happen
Don't ever give up, no...
Not more than three short years ago
Without a penny to my name
No proper shoes upon my feet
I oftеn cried myself to sleep
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
See I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong
Baby just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I have to keep going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Ohhhh
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
I once was lost
But now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you Lord 
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight
And don't let go
You can make it
Make it happen
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Don't let go, don't ever ever let go
Ever ever let go
No no no, don't let go!
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
Make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen
Make it happen
Thank you so much...
God bless you, thank you so much
Goodnight!I wrote a song a while back, even before One Sweet Day and...
It was... not my favorite song in the world, but I wrote it...
Somebody asked me to write a song, they told me the story and, you know, it was kinda like a moving concept or whatever...
And I did it, I was like, you know it's not necessarily what I like per se...
But after doing the song over and over again, I have people come up to me and saying... coming up to me and saying
Thank you for writing Hero, because it saved my life, it saved my father's life, or it saved my brother's life, or my sister's life, or something of that nature...
I said I always have to sing that song whenever I perform because if I don't, you never know who I'm leaving out and, you know what, in times in my life I've had to turn to that song lyrically and- and... you know, flip it onto my own life and sing it to myself, so...
It's from the Music Box album and um... it's called Hero, so this is for you guys
Thank you Anaheim for being here with me tonight, Orange County, everybody that , like incredible
I have to thank you so much...
And you can sing along to this one too if you want
There's a hero
If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There's an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Ooh yes it does
'Cause it's a long road
When you face the world alone
And no one reaches out a hand
For you to hold
But you can find love, ooh yes you can
If you search within yourself
And the emptiness you felt
Will disappear
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't you let anyone
Tear them away
Just hold on, and hold on, and hold o-o-on
And there will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And then you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you and you and you and you and you and you and you
That a hero lies in you
Every single one of you
Oh yes it does, oh yes it does, I know it does
A hero lies in you
Thank you Jesus
Thank you...Now I have an incredibly special moment...
I usually do something that I quite enjoy during this section...
We're gonna do it next time...
But um... before I say anything
Once again, I gotta thank everybody for being here with me- that’s been here tonight
The singers, the band...
I got some of the most amazing...
People back here behind me and...
I mean, the dancers came out, it was just all
Spectacularity and I just, you know, I really can't know what to say
These two singing girls won't еven sing for the peoplе ’cause if they do they know I wouldn't get back on this thing, they're being nice to me... by not doing that, 'cause they're incredible
Sherry Tatum and MaryAnn Tatum, the queen of Brownsville and the empress of Brownsville, Brooklyn...
So... and Trey, thank you so much for everything, as always, don't forget to get Trey's album, please
Now I know I'm rambling and we’re taping a show, so we’re jsut gonna edit certain parts out...
But I have a very big surprise for you tonight, and I was very surprised by this...
Um... I wanna do a song for you that uh... how do I- how do I say it... you can't call it a duet ’cause it was done with a group of people...
But this song... we wrote this song together, me and my special guests and I might as well just bring them out...
Ladies and gentlemen, Boyz II Men!
I'm so happy they're here tonight!
Sorry I never told you
All I wanted to say
And now it's too late to hold you
’Cause you've flown away
So far away
Never had I imagined
Living without your smile
Feeling and knowing you hear me
It keeps me alive
I said it keep me alive
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
]
Darling I never showed you 
Assumed you'd always be there
I took your presence for granted
But I always cared 
And I miss the love we shared
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
]
Lord I know when I lay me down to sleep
You will always listen as I pray
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
And I know you're shining down on me from heaven
Like so many friends we've lost along the way
And I know eventually we'll be together
One sweet day
]
Sing it up with us in the end, sing the last line
 I never told you
All I, sing it up 
Thank you so much! Boyz II Men!
I miss you! I wanna like sit down and have a party... have a- have a moment...
Thank you guys so much for being here, I wish we were here all night together
One more time, give it up, Boyz II Men!Oh oh
Honey got me hooked on you
Y'all remember this song?
Do you remember this song?!
Alright...
Honey you can have me
When you want me
If you simply ask me to be there
And you're the only one who
Makes me come running
'Cause what you got is far
Beyond compare
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Tastе of your honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
I can't be elusive
With you honey
'Cause it's blatant
That I'm feeling you
And it's too hard for me
To leave abruptly
'Cause you're the only thing
I wanna do
And it's just like honey
When your love comes over me
Oh baby I've got a dependency
Always strung out for another
Taste of your honey
You know Mase huff
With Puff
We blow your house down
Bring that Harlem World sound
Directly to your town
In fact, this is why I act like that
I ain't dropped one single
And made this money back
I rock so swell, I gotta prevail
First rap superstar dominating pop sales
You never wish me well
'Cause it start to sell
And it land me with pretty women in the Swiss hotel
And girls that mean a lot
I get 'em from the shop
Buy them everything they got
From the jeans to the watch
You wanna be my misses
You gotta make me
Wanna spoil you with my riches
And you could tell that
Mase is real 'cause he do real things
And I make things that's average look real mean
When it comes to sex, I got the real thing
So when you cover your mouth
I hear you still scream
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
Honey I can't describe
How good it feels inside
]
Oh oh
Every little thing you do
Oh oh
Honey got me hooked on you
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day
I can hardly wait for another taste of honey
It's like honey when it washes over me
You know sugar never ever was so sweet
And I'm dying for you, cryin' for you I adore you
One hit of your love addicted me
Now I'm strung out on you darlin'
Don't you see every night and day

Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
No baby, no baby, no baby, no
Don't baby, don't baby, don't let it go
My baby boy
Just let it die
With no goodbyes
Details don't matter
When both pay the pricе
Tears in my eyes
You know somеtimes
It'd be like that, baby
Now every time I see you
I pretend I'm fine 
When I wanna reach out to you
But I turn and I walk and I let it ride
Baby, I must confess
We were bigger than anything
Remember us at our best
And don't forget about
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Oh they say
That you're in a new relationship
But we both know
Nothing comes close to 
What we had, it perseveres
That we both can't forget it
How good we used to get it
There's only one me and you
And how we used to shine 
No matter what you go through
We are one, and you can't deny!
So, baby, we just can't let
The fire pass us by
Forever we'd both regret
So don't forget about us
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
And if she's got your head all messed up now
That's the trickery
She'll wanna have like you know how this lovin' used to be
I bet she can't do like me
She'll never be MC
Baby, don't you, don't you forget about us
Late nights, playin' in the dark
And wakin' up inside my arms
Boy, you'll always be in my heart and
I can see it in your eyes
You still want it
So don't forget about us
I'm just speaking from experience
Nothing can compare to your first true love
So I hope this will remind you
When it's for real, it's forever
So don't forget about us
Don't, baby, don't, baby, don't let it go
No, baby, no, baby, no, baby no

Shoe do do do d doo do doWhen I first came out... we did this, um... show called MTV Unplugged right? And...
My friend, um... a person I've known for a really long time, before my first album came out, I knew him... and uh...
We met on a Mississippi road... and um...
It was just fortunate that uh, he happened to be in the studio with us when we were rehearsing for this MTV Unplugged show because...
They wanted us to do a remake of- of an old song... we thought and thought about it and um... my friend and I decided that I'll Be There, which was a... big hit by the Jackson 5 would be something nice to sing for the folks...
So um... anyway... he's here with me tonight and um... it's from the MTV Unplugged EP and it's called I'll Be There...
And listen! If anybody out there is singing, singing folks, please sing along with us

I hope you like it, it's got a message and it's important so um... check it out... and uh, it's called Fly Like a Bird...
Weeping may endure for a night
But joy comes in the morning
Trust Him
Somehow I know that
There's a place up above
With no more hurt and struggling
Free of all atrocities and suffering
Because I feel the unconditional love
From one who cares enough for me
To еrase all my burdens
And let mе be free to
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
He said He'll never forsake you
Or leave you alone
Trust Him
I need you Lord, I need you Lord
I need you right here by my side
Keep your head up
With God's love you'll survive
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Fly like a bird
Take to the sky
I need you now Lord
Carry me high
Don't let the world break me tonight
I need the strength of you by my side
Sometimes this life can be so cold
I pray you'll come and carry me home
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me higher, higher, higher
Carry me home
Carry me higher LordTreated me kind
Sweet destiny
Carried me through desperation
To the one that was waiting for me
It took so long
Still I believed
Somehow the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
Yes it was
See I prayed through the nights
I felt so alone
Suffered from alienation, did you ever feel that way?
Carried the weight on my own
See I had to be so strong
So I believed
And now I know I'vе succeeded
In finding the place I concеived
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given to me
I had a vision of love
And it was all that you've given me
I've realized a dream, oh yeah
And I visualized
The love that came to be
Said I feel so alive
I'm so thankful that I've received
The answer that heaven has sent down to me
'Cause ou treated me kind
Sweet destiny
Yes you did, yes you did
See I prayed through the nights
So faithfully
Just knowing the one that I needed
Would find me eventually
I had a vision of love...
Yes I did, yes I did, yes I did
And it was all, said it was all
Said it was all...
That you, you, you, you, you, you...
And it was all...
That you...
And it was all...
That you...
Turned...
Out...
To...

Thank you...First, I wanna do a song that I wrote, um, a while back... and it's from an album that's still kinda one of my favorite albums that I've done, it's called- it's the Butterfly album... and um... the name of the song... is My All...
I am thinking of you
In my sleepless solitude tonight
If it's wrong to love you
Then my heart just won't let me be right
'Cause I've drowned in you
And I won't pull through
Without you by my side
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
I'd risk my life to feel
Your body next to mine
'Cause I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Tell me Anaheim, can you feel me
Imagining I'm looking in your eyes
I can see you so clearly
Vividly emblazoned in my mind
And yet you're so far
Like a distant star
I'm wishing on tonight
I'd give my all to have
Just one more night with you
Oh ohh I'd risk my life
To feel your body
Feel your body
Feel your body
Feel your body baby baby
No no no no no no, I can't go on
Living in the memory of our song
I'd give my all for your love tonight
Give my all for your love
Tonight yeah, just one more night

You may know this one if you know my catalog
If not, it's something new from the Charmbracelet album, back in the day...
See it's hard to tell somebody
That you're still somewhat
Attached to the dream
Of being in love once again
When it's clear they've moved on
So I sat down and wrote these few words
On the off chance you'd hear
And if you happen to be somewhere listening
You should know I'm still here
If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
What can I say, I had a little extra time
So I figured I might as well explain
A couple little things to you
That you probably never knew
Like you'll always be an intrinsic part of me
Even though life goes on
If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
And in my love will flow
Like the waves to the shore
You can fall into me
Once again effortlessly
And I'll comfort you so
You heart won't hurt anymore
I'm waiting patiently
If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
If you really need me
Baby just reach out and touch me
You don't ever have to be
Downhearted again
If she hurts you or misleads you
Baby all you ever need to do
Is call me and let love rush in
I'm here

So I hope Rudolph and them other eight reindeer
Get you safely here
So you can scoop him up and swoop him right down my chimney
I've been really, really, really good this year
So put on that red suit and make him appear
’Cause Christmas cheer
Just ain't the same without my baby
Come on, oh Kris Kringle, send me help
They say it's unrealistic
But I believe in you Saint Nick
So grant this wish for me right quick
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas night?

If you get this letter, please don't make me wait
'Cause all December I'll be counting down the days
So hop on your sleigh
I promise that I won't forget the milk and cookies
The trees all sparkly and gold
But inside I feel so cold
So soon as you leave the North Pole
Santa won't you come and make him mine this Christmas?
Santa's gonna come and make you mine, ho, ho, ho

If you look inside your heart
You don't have to be afraid
Of what you are
There’s an answer
If you reach into your soul
And the sorrow that you know
Will melt away
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
It's a long road
When you face the world alone
No one reaches out a hand for you to hold
You can find love
If you search within yourself
And the еmptiness you felt
Will disappear
And thеn a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
Lord knows
Dreams are hard to follow
But don't let anyone
Tear them away
Hold on
There will be tomorrow
In time
You'll find the way
And then a hero comes along
With the strength to carry on
And you cast your fears aside
And you know you can survive
So when you feel like hope is gone
Look inside you and be strong
And you'll finally see the truth
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in you
That a hero lies in youWe were as one, babe
For a moment in time
And it seemed everlasting
That you would always be mine
Now you want to be free
So I'll let you fly
'Cause I know in my heart, babe
Our love will never die, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
I ain't gonna cry, no
And I won't beg you to stay
If you're determined to leave, boy
I will not stand in your way
But inevitably
You'll be back again
'Cause you know in your heart, babe
Our love will never end, no
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
I know that you'll be back, boy
When your days and your nights get a little bit colder, oh
I know that you'll be right back, baby
Oh, baby, believe me, it's only a matter of time, time
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
And we'll linger on 
Time can't erase a feeling this strong
No way you're never gonna shake me 
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You'll always be a part of me
I'm part of you indefinitely
Boy, don't you know you can't escape me?
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
 And we'll linger on
Time can't erase a feeling this strong 
No way you're never going to shake me 
Ooh, darling, 'cause you'll always be my baby
You and I will always be
No way you're never gonna shake me
No way you're never gonna shake me
You and I - we'll always beOh, when you walk by every night
Talking sweet and looking fine
I get kind of hectic inside
Mmm, baby, I'm so into you
Darling, if you only knew
All the things that flow through my mind
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby 
Images of rapture
Creep into me slowly
As you're going to my head
And my heart beats faster
When you take me over
Time and time and time again
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby 
Oh, oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my еyes you come and take mе
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby 
I'm in heaven
With my boyfriend, my laughing boyfriend
There's no beginning and there is no end
Feels like I'm dreaming, but I'm not sleeping
Oh, it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
When I close my eyes, you come and take me
On and on and on, it's so deep in my daydreams
But it's just a sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, baby
Sweet, sweet fantasy, babyOnce again we sit in silence
After all is said and done
Only emptiness inside us
Baby, look what we've become
We can make a million promises
But we still won't change
It isn't right to stay together
When you only bring each other pain
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry
Too far apart to bridge the distance
But something keeps us hanging on and on
Pretеnding not to know the differencе
Denying what we had is gone
Every moment we're together
It's just breaking me down
I know we swore it was forever
But it hurts too much to stay around
I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cry, no, no
All the magic's gone
There's just a shadow of a memory
Something just went wrong
We can't go on make-believing
On make-believing
'Cause I don't wanna cry, don't wanna cry
Nothing in the world could take us back
To where we used to be
Though I've given you my heart and soul
Said I've given you my heart and soul
I must find a way of letting go
'Cause baby, I don't wanna cry, cry
I don't wanna cry
I don't wanna cryAlways, always
Always, always
Always, always
Always, always

Yeah, baby
Yeah, baby
Yeah, babyNot more than three short years ago
I was abandoned and alone
Without a penny to my name
So very young and so afraid
No proper shoes upon my feet
Sometimes I couldn't even eat
I often cried myself to sleep
But still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen, oh, yeah
I know life can be so tough
And you feel like giving up
But you must be strong, baby, just hold on
You'll never find the answers
If you throw your life away
I used to feel the way you do
Still I had to keep on going
Never knowing if I could take it
If I would make it through the night
I held on to my faith
I struggled and I prayed
And now I've finally found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord 
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
Make it happen, yeah, make it
You're gonna make it, make it, oh, baby
Make it through the night
I held on to my faith, I struggled and I prayed
And now I've found my way
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen 
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
I once was lost, but now I'm found
I got my feet on solid ground
Thank you, Lord
If you believe within your soul
Just hold on tight and don't let go
You can make it, make it happen, yeah
You can make it, make it happen
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
You're gonna make it, you're gonna make it
If you believe in yourself enough 
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happen
If you believe in yourself enough
And know what you want
You're gonna make it happen, make it happen
And if you get down on your knees at night
And pray to the Lord
He's gonna make it happen, make it happenL... L...

Christmas in New York
What do you feel like doing today
Is it snow
Will it snow
Will it keep on raining so?
We'll go shopping
We're not stopping
Ain't no stopping cause it's Christmas in New York
New York...
We gon' be singing and shouting, praising
It's amazing, Christmas in New York
I'm freestyling and it's not my best
But babe it's still there, still there
It's Christmas in New York
I feel like a dork
Cause I don't know much to say about it
But the packages everywhere
Seen in the streets, bright lights and people
I love you so
Come you know
To my Beacon show, oh oh oh oh
We gon' make it snow, we gon' make it snow
On the stage, later on
I hope we gonna make it snow
Let it snow
Let it snow
Christmas time makes me feel so good
Specially when it's Christmas in New YorkGirl , the times that we had
The times that we had
I was so happy now I'm sad
I packed all my bags
Why the hell did I do that
And now  I'm missing you and all your flaws
Sitting here waiting for your message sitting here waiting here for your calls
And my life was so much better with you in it
Love from the beginning
Now  you've  hit the limit
You've made your decision
You ain't fucking with me
Fed up putting yo trust in me
Fed up fighting with me publicly
I don't mean to hurt you baby
Somewhere in another life
We stole a moment in time
Gave you everything that you needed
I was even down to repeat it
Said you would always be mine
Feeding me nothing but lies
I was so gone, I admit it
Had me messed up for a minute
But I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playin' with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
'Cause, boy, I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't
I tried to make it work
No matter how much it hurt
You had to make it all about you
Tell me why you go and do me like you do?
I went from me and you
To walking right out on you
I know you want love, in your feelings
Frontin' on me like your love was the realest
And I'm tired of cryin', no more tears
Pity party of the year
Cold at night 'cause you're not here
Leaving you was my worst fear
I was caught up, I was blind
You kept playin' with my mind
Told you I'm finished, gassed up the whip and
Rear view, bye
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
But you don't mean nothing
'Cause I don't, I don't
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah
Hold up, hold up, hold up, hold up
Hold up, I just got you a ring, for what?
I put you in the game, now it's game over
Every time you went to the Louis store you got chauffeured
Hold up, how you gon' leave that?
Hold up, give me my ring back
Never mind, you can keep that
'Cause every time you look at your ring, me, you gon' dream that
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You don't understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey
I know you love me
You just don't trust me
You need to understand me
But you love it when I call you Ms. Carey, yeah
'Cause when you love someone
You just don't treat them bad
You messed up all we had
Probably think I'm coming back
But I don't, I don't
'Cause boy I was buggin'
Thinkin' somehow I could trust you
See, I used to love you
But I don't, I don't
