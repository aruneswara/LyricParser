Had some fun on the run though I'll give it to you
But baby, don't get it twisted
You was just another nigga on the hit list

Didn't they tell you that I was a savage?
Fuck ya white horse and ya carriage

A cold sweat, hot-headed believer
I threw my hands in the air, said, "Show me something"
He said, “If you dare, come a little closer”
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh now, tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
It's not much of a life you're living
It's not just something you take, it's given
Round and around and around and around we go
Oh, now tell me now, tell me now, tell me now you know
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
And I want you to stay
Ooh, the reason I hold on
Ooh, 'cause I need this hole gone
Funny you're the broken one
But I'm the only one who needed saving
'Cause when you never see the light
It's hard to know which one of us is caving
Not really sure how to feel about it
Something in the way you move
Makes me feel like I can't live without you
And it takes me all the way
I want you to stay
Stay
I want you to stay
OohThe truth will set you free
But first, it'll piss you off

"How could you let us down?"
But they don't know what I found
Or see it from this way around
Feeling it overtake
All that I used to hate
Worried 'bout every trait
I tried but it's way too late
All the signs I don't read
Two sides of me can't agree
When I breathe in too deep
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
Well, I don’t care I’m in love
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
And I still don’t know why it’s happening
And I still don’t know
Finally taking flight
I know you don't think it's right
I know that you think it's fake
Maybe fake's what I like
Point is I have the right
Not thinking in black and white
I'm thinking it's worth the fight
Soon to be out of sight
Knowing it all this time
Going with what I always longed for
Feel like a brand new person
I don’t care I’m in love
Feel like a brand new person
So how do I know that it's right?
And I know that it's hard to digest
But maybe your story ain’t so different from the rest
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
And I know that it's hard to digest
A realization is as good as it gets
And I know it seems wrong to accept
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
But you've got your demons, and she's got her regrets
Feel like a brand new person
So, how will I know that it's right?
In a new direction
So, how will I know I've gone too far?
Feel like a brand new person
I finally know what it's like
In a new direction
So how will I know I've gone too far?
Feel like a brand new person
And I know it's hard to describe
I finally know what it's likeOh na-na, what's my name?
Oh na-na, what's my name?

Love, love, love
Love and affection
Love, love
L-o-v-e-e-e and affectionOn the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
It's morning, you wake, a sunray hits your face
Smeared makeup as we lay in the wake of destruction 
Hush baby, speak softly, tell me you're awfully sorry
That you pushed me into the coffee table last night so I can push you off me
Try and touch me so I can scream at you not to touch me
Run out the room and I'll follow you like a lost puppy
Baby, without you, I'm nothing, I'm so lost, hug me
Then tell me how ugly I am, but that you'll always love me
Then after that, shove me, in the aftermath of the
Destructive path that we're on, two psychopaths, but we
Know that no matter how many knives we put in each other's backs
That we'll have each other's backs 'cause we're that lucky
Together, we move mountains, let's not make mountains out of molehills
You hit me twice, yeah, but who's counting?
I may have hit you three times, I'm starting to lose count
But together, we'll live forever, we found the youth fountain
Our love is crazy, we're nuts, but I refused counseling
This house is too huge, if you move out, I'll burn all two thousand
Square feet of it to the ground, ain't shit you can do about it
'Cause with you, I'm in my fucking mind, without you, I'm out it
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieThis whiskey got me feelin' pretty
So pardon if I'm impolite
I just really need your ass with me
I'm sorry 'bout the other night
And I know I could be more creative
And come up with poetic lines
But I'm turnt up upstairs and I love you
Is the only thing that's in my mind
You take me higher, higher than I've ever been, babe
Just come over, let's pour a drink, babe
I hope I ain't calling you too late, too late
You light my fire
Let's stay up late and smoke a J
I wanna go back to the old way
But I'm drunk instead, with a full ashtray
With a little bit too much to sayWe the cause of all the commotion
Your mouth running, but where is you going?
What is you smoking, man? That ain't potent
What is you talking, man? That ain't important
Illuminati, High society
We in this party and nobody invited me
We going crazy and I always use my best sense
But it don't matter cause I stay on my fresh prince
Maxin', relaxin, shootin' some pool and
Playing some b-ball outside of the school and
Girls with they top off outside of the pool and
Whips with the drop off outside of the Louvre
You just look stupid to be ignoring
The Delorean parked in front of Armani emporium
And parties at Richie is getting risky
Victoria's Secret show, they miss me
Voices in my head, I need choices in my bed
AHHHHH, get out my fucking head
It's just me and my bad bitch
So you can say I'm on my Brad Pitt
Back to the la familia I'm aligned with
Before I betray them I slit my wrists
At the top is just us nigga
Cause I don't really trust niggas
And we made it through the hurricane
So celebrate and light the Mary Jane
We gon' make it, that's on everything
Truest girls get half naked, every spring
They saying, "Hey Kanye
We need you to go deeper than Tay Zonday,"
Cause my verses got pain, Chocolate Rain
So many lines, you photograph and it make arms break
On the radio, man I miss myself
I need to just step back and kiss myself
Baby, just step up and kiss the belt
A little lower.. that's what's up
Somebody pour her another cup
Is it too much to ask you keep your diamonds up?
I swear until my time is up
My style is sex in the shower, fresh as fuck
So shine bright tonight you and I

Feels so good being bad 
There's no way I'm turning back 
Now the pain is my pleasure 'cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Oh
Ghost in the mirror
I knew your face once, but now it's unclear
And I can't feel my body now
I separate from here and now
Ooh
Oh
A drug and a dream
A lost connection, oh, come back to me
So I can feel alive again
As soul and body try to mend
It's pulling me apart, this time
Everything is never-ending
I slipped into a parallel
They'll never understand
This feeling always gets away
Wishing I could hold on longer
Why does it have to feel so strange
To be in love again, be in love again, be in love again?

Never had a limit, never been religious
I just always had opinions
My daddy told me, "Listen
You better get some money and not die and go to prison"
So you see
Yeah, I got rich and stayed free
Free the dawgs doin' B.I.Ds
I know everybody not like me
Ayy, got the nerve to want a Bentley for her birthday
I said, "Maybe I could rent it for your birthday
Matter of fact I need a favor for the remix
Maybe I can get some 50s for your birthday"

Just waitin' for my thumb like The Fonz
Woo! This beat tastes like lunch

I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? Oh-oh-oh-oh
What now?
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I'm supposed to be in love, but I'm numb again
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just sitting there laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
What now?
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now? 
What now?
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
I don't know where to go
I don't know what to feel
I don't know how to cry
I don't know, oh-oh, why
So what now?It's like you're screaming, and no one can hear
You almost feel ashamed, that someone could be that important
That without them, you feel like nothing
No one will ever understand how much it hurts
You feel hopeless, like nothing can save you
And when it's over and it's gone
You almost wish you could have all that bad stuff back
So that you could have the good
Yellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
Dean on the low
I ask you, "What's the matter?"
You say "Oh, it's nothing at all."
Heart's racing outta control
And you knew that I couldn't let it go
You used to be this boy I loved
And I used to be this girl of your dreams
Who knew the course of this one drive injured us fatally?
You took the best years of my life
I took the best years of your life
Felt like love struck me in the night
I prayed that love don't strike twice
Red lipstick, rose petals, heartbreak
I was his Marilyn Monroe
Brown eyes, tuxedo, fast cars
A James Dean on the low
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?
What's love without tragedy?

Ain't none of it promised, promisedStory of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul, 'cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doin' my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
'Cause I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore
Whoa
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
And every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
And I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be, a murderer
A murderer, no, no, no

I never felt something so strong
You were like my lover and my best friend
All wrapped into one, with a ribbon on it
And all of a sudden, you went and left
I didn't know how to follow
It's like a shot that spun me around and now my heart left
I feel so empty and hollow
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
And now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it 
'Cause now I'm using like I bleed
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
It's like I checked into rehab
Baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
I gotta check into rehab
'Cause baby, you're my disease
Damn, ain't it crazy when you're love swept?
You'll do anything for the one you love
'Cause anytime that you needed me, I'd be there
It's like you were my favorite drug
The only problem is that you was using me
In a different way that I was using you
But now that I know it's not meant to be
You gotta go, I gotta wean myself off of you
And I'll never give myself to another the way I gave it to you
Don't even recognize the ways you hurt me, do you?
It's gonna take a miracle to bring me back
And you're the one to blame
'Cause now I feel like, oh, you're the reason why I'm thinking
I don't wanna smoke on these cigarettes no more
I guess that's what I get for wishful thinking
I should've never let you enter my door 
Next time you wanna go on and leave
I should just let you go on and do it

Like a waterfall, my tears dropped to the floor, the floor
They left a swimming pool of salted crimes, crimes
Oh, what could I do to change your mind?
Nothing
I'm bracing for the pain and I am letting go
I'm using all my strength to get out of this hole
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
You're just another brick and I'm a sledgehammer
Yeah I hit a wall, I prayed that I would make it through, make it through
I can survive a life that's without you, that's without you, yeah
And I will rise up from the ashes now, the ashes now
Oh, the sparrow flies with just the crumbs of loving spilled, yeah
I was bracing for the pain and then I let it go
I gathered all my strength and I found myself whole
I hit a wall, I thought that I would hurt myself
Oh I was sure, your words would leave me unconscious
And on the floor I'd be lying cold, lifeless
But I hit a wall, I hit 'em all, watch the fall

Look up, the sun is just a cloud awayChest to chest 
Nose to nose 
Palm to palm
We were always just that close 
Wrist to wrist 
Toe to toe 
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So how come when I reach out my finger
It feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Eye to eye 
Cheek to cheek 
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me 
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn
And a little last night on these sheets
So how come when I reach out my fingers
It seems like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then, my eyes got wetter
So confused, wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
Hey, hey, hey, hey
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
Been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California kingTake a breath, take it deep
"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger 
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving
Know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
As my life flashes before my eyes
I’m wondering, will I ever see another sunrise?
So many won’t get the chance to say goodbye
But it’s too late to think of the value of my life
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
Know that I must pass this test
You can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no, no
Know that I must pass this test

Soon as the Red Dogs give the block back to the presidents
I used to run my whole block like Obama and them
You ain't gotta believe me, go ask my momma and them
Couldn't even come in my room, smelled like a kilo
Look like me and two of my boys playing casino
Count the style I keep in my bag, they can't afford it
Tell 'em "give me back my swag!" They tryna clone it
See my Louis chucks, Louis flag, Louis frames, Louis belt
What that make me, "Louis Mane"?
I'm in the all-white party wearing all black
With my new black watch, call it the heart attack
Cardiac arrest, Carti'ac a wrist
Yeah, they say they hard, they ain't hard as this
Hard: the one word describes me
If I wasn't doing this, you know where I'd be

Of my heart

Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on

In the same game

Have to go and throw water on my flame

Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

Saw me on a television
But that's just the half of it
Yeah, you saw the half of it
This is the life I live
And that's just the half of it
You saw me on a television
Hanging out my dirty linen
You're entitled to your own opinion
Sit and shake your head at my decisions
I guess the kind of songs that I've been singing
Make it seem as if I'm always winning

Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost in the rock and roll
Got lost in a promise of a love I'd never know 
Shadows chased me far from home
I remember when my heart was filled with gold 
And you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Lost my faith and trust
You and I know gold don't turn to rust 
I still swear that we can reign
Like the kings and queens of better yesterdays 
Don't you know
I've been burned, I've been burned, I've been burned
You've seen me lose control
It's not worth, it's not worth, it's not worth my soul
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna go?
Where you gonna run to, when you get to the edge of the night?
Its time you face the sky, ooh
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on
And the shadows will never find you
Turn your face towards the sun
Let the shadows fall behind you
Don't look back, just carry on

Ah, and I know what you're thinking of
That I don't know a thing about love
But what I know is I'm his girl
And he's the one for me
See, this shit ain't worth tripping over
Do your thing, it doesn't matter
As long as we gon' rock forever
Love is all we need
Do ya thang, do ya thang

See, I know you like being 'round chicks
And looking at her hips, and a little outfit
Hey, what can I say? 
That's what I love about you, babeWhat am I supposed to do with this heart?
How do I take it off if I love at all?
It's like a work of art
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
How was I to know that my love was delusional?
Somebody told me how to mend
A broken hearted soul
In love, we all will fall, but
We fell a little harder
What am I supposed to do with this heart?
It may be wrong, but it feels right
To be lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise 
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
It may be wrong, but it feels right
All my fears are gone tonight
I'm lost in paradise
I'm so lost in paradise 
If I open up my eyes
I can see the storm, I can see the sky
I can see the darkness, flashing lights
All my fears, gone tonight
Let me stay
I'm lost in paradise
Lost in paradise
Yeah
Lost in paradise
Lost in paradiseStupid in love
Oh
Stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size ten in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it, even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mmm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why, oh
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
My new nickname is "You Idiot" 
Mmm, that's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one"
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist on repeatedly tryna tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
Tryna make this work
But you act like a jerk
Silly of me to keep holding on 
But the dunce cap is off
You don't know what you've lost
And you won't realize
Till I'm gone, gone, gone
That I was the one
Which one of us is really dumb?
Oh, no, no, no
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid
I may be dumb, but I'm not stupid in loveRed lipstick, all on the paper

Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care 
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Tryna get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone 
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home, but he don't care
Won't care 
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be gettin' it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone 
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
We stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care 
All we know is we was at home 'cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone

Oh, oh
La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la-la-la, oh
Oh, ohYou're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
Sometimes, I get you
Sometimes, I don't understand
Sometimes, I love you
Sometimes, it's you I can't stand
Sometimes, I wanna hug you
Sometimes, I wanna push you away
Most times, I wanna kiss you
Other times, punch you in the face
'Cause every minute, you start switching up
And you say things like you don't give a fuck
Then I say I'm through with you, take my heart from you
And you come running after me, and baby, I'm back with you, oh
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
Sometimes, I catch you
Sometimes, you get away
Sometimes, I read you
Other times, I'm like, "Where are you on the page?"
Sometimes, I feel like we will be together forever
But you're so complicated, my heart knows better
Why is everything with you so complicated?
Why do you make it hard to love you?
Oh, I hate it
'Cause if you really wanna be alone, I
Will throw my hands up 'cause, baby, I tried
But everything with you is so complicated
Oh, why?
I'ma stick around just a little while longer
Just to make sure that you're really sure
You like sleeping alone

You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, no
You're not easy to love
You're not easy to love, noI'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry 
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life 
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
All my lifeYeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
No
I feel like I'm a hopeless romantic
I can't help falling in love
I fiend for love
I want it, I crave it
I just can't get enough
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I've been let down
But never been tainted
So I'll stay thirsty for more
No, I won't hold back
No drop is wasted
I'll let love run its course
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
You know I'm drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I’m drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It’s all that I need
I'm so intoxicated
I love the way you taste on my lips, when we kiss
You got me so addicted
So much, I can't resist falling into your arms
Take me away
I wear my heart on my sleeve
Always let love take the lead
I may be a little naive, yeah
You know I’m drunk on love, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
You know I'm drunk on love
Drunk, drunk on love
Nothing can sober me up
It's all that I need
It's all that I need
It's all that I needYou have my hands to hold
So how come you won't hold me?
Your words are so damn cold
The winter can't affect me
You're man enough to say
What you think is my business
But, you can't say you love me
Even in between the kisses
Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Your arms around me now
Felt like sunlight in the morning
It always comes around
But, just not when I want it
So all you have to give
Is everything I needed
But, it's so hard to live
Just wonderin' if you're givin'
Tender, tender little kisses you give to me
Just like you give to her, tell me how can you sleep?
Teardrops, little teardrops fallin' in disbelief
How can you lie to her, while you lay with me?
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
You'd rather make up a lie
Then make up a fight
And then you get so upset when I ask you why, oh
I wonder what makes you feel
A part of you can't be real
You said you'd never hurt me
Then, what do you think you did?
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, I'm sure your lips can't find the words to say
But, if you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
Hey, hey, if you don't have an answer
Just don't say
If you don't have an answer
You don't have to answer
You don't have to answer I wanna dance in the dark

Hey, hey, heyThere could be a freak accident
There could be a fatal disease
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
We could all fall down
Before our savior could return
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling, cover me, please
The earth could quake to ruin
We could drift off in our sleep
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and me
The ocean crushed the shore
And take us down forever more
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
If I should go
Hold my hand
If I should leave
Darling cover me, please
I know we hate to think about it
But it's as real as you and me
It's as real as you and meMama, I found a man
Who loves me and understands
Papa, he's quite a man
He adores me, he's my biggest fan
And don't get me wrong
I know he's not perfect in your eyes
But somehow he's flawless in mine
And you may tell me to run, run now
But I can't do that
We're too far down the hole
He's got a hold on my soul
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enough
Mama, don't judge me now
I'm not trying to hurt you
I know this won't make you proud
Papa, did I let you down?
Are you ashamed of how your little girl turned out?
You'll see a monster
I see a smile
You say it's danger
And I'm in denial
But somehow I feel so safe right now
So I guess I'm a fool
I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to stay here
And bask in the glory of his heart
I guess I'm a fool in love
But I'm willing to look so stupid
Till I've had enoughWherever you're going
I wanna go
Wherever you're headed
Can you let me know?
Don't mind catching up
I'm on my way
Just can't take the thought of you miles away
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you 
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
I will write to tell you what's goin' on
But you won't miss nothing but the same old song
If you don't mind catching up
I'll spend the day telling you stories about a land far away
But I know
And I know you're going somewhere to make a better life 
I hope that you'll find it on the first try
And even though it kills me
That you have to go
I know it'll be sadder
If you never hit the road
So farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you 
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you 
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's me
And I'm gon' try to hold it all in
Try to hold back my tears
So it don't make you stay here, yeah
I'mma try to be a big girl now
'Cause I don't wanna be the reason you don't leave
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you 
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
Farewell
Somebody's gonna miss you 
Farewell
Somebody's gonna wish that you were here
That somebody's meOn my roof
Dark and I'm burning a rose
I don't need proof
I'm torn apart and you know
What you did to me was a crime
Cold case love
And I let you reach me one more time
But that's enough
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
Should've investigated
But love blinded eyes
Couldn't see 
And then I tried to cage it
But your love ain't the kind you can keep
Release me now 'cause I did my time
Of this cold case love
My heart's no longer cold and confined
I've had enough
Your love was breaking the law
But I needed a witness
So wake me up when it's over
It don't make any difference
Will it ever be solved
Or am I taking the fall?
Truth was there all along
Tell me, how did we miss it?
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We lost our way
Took this too far
Now I'll never find the pieces of my heart
We've lost enough
Looking for a truth
That was here all along
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
We opened up a cold case love
And it got the best of us
And now prints, pictures and white outlines
Are all that's left at the scene of a crime
Of a cold case love
LoveRide
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

Gunfire left a hole in the tank, losing gasoline
Fire is on my trail and he's after me
Hope it don't get here before I get where I'm goin'
I gotta get where I'm goin'
Take off my mask to breathe
You could've been a part of a masterpiece
Fluid in the brakes was the last to leak
That's the thing
Where I'm goin', I don't need my brakes 
Can't wait to see your face
When your front windows break
And I come crashing through
The lovers needa clear the road
Oh, oh
'Cause this thing is ready to blow
Oh, oh
I just wanna set you on fire
So I won't have to burn alone
Then you
Then you'll know where I'm comin' from
Fire bomb
Fire bomb
Seems cold, but baby, no, it doesn't have to be
Microwaving our metal tragedy
Watching it burn and it's beautiful and it's blue
And it's pitiful and it's through, it's the other half of me
I didn't do it, you lit the match for me
Now we're flying from the blast, baby
That's the thing
Where we're going, we don't need no brakes 
Can't wait to see your face

Everybody wants something, gotta want something
Yeah, yeah, we all want love
Yeah, yeah, we all want loveHere's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
But boy, you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It shoulda been me and you
It coulda been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you
Now baby, it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better, babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely
Hey, hey, hey
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you
All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have, that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on, looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographsOn the first page of our story
The future seemed so bright
Then this thing turned out so evil
I don't know why I'm still surprised
Even angels have their wicked schemes
And you take that to new extremes
But you'll always be my hero
Even though you've lost your mind
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie
Now there's gravel in our voices
Glass is shattered from the fight
In this tug of war, you'll always win
Even when I'm right
'Cause you feed me fables from your head
With violent words and empty threats
And it's sick that all these battles
Are what keeps me satisfied
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie, oh
I love the way you lie, oh
So maybe I'm a masochist
I try to run, but I don't wanna ever leave
'Til the walls are going up
In smoke with all our memories
Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
Well, that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
Well, that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieWhat's up?
I know we haven't spoken for a while
But I was thinkin' 'bout you
And it kinda made me smile
So many things to say
And I'll put 'em in a letter
Thought it might be easier
The words might come out better
How's your mother? hHw's your little brother?
Does he still look just like you?
So many things I wanna know the answers to
Wish I could press rewind
And rewrite every line to the story of me and you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Excuse me, I really didn't mean to ramble on
But there's a lot of feelings that remain since you've been gone
I guess you thought that I would put it all behind me
But it seems there's always somethin' right there to remind me
Like a silly joke, or something on the TV
Boy, it ain't easy
When I hear our song, I get that same old feeling
Wish I could press rewind, turn back the hands of time
And I shouldn't be telling you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Did you know I kept all of your pictures?
Don't have the strength to part with them yet, oh no
Tried to erase the way your kisses taste
But some things a girl can never forget
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to lose
Hope to hear from you soon
P.S., I'm still not over you
Still not over you
Oh, I tried to forget you
Don't you know I've tried and I've tried to get you out my mind?
But it don't get no better, as each day goes by
And I'm lost and confused, I've got nothin' to loseI was picking up your clothes in the closet 
I was about to throw your jeans in the washer 
'Till I saw a piece of paper saying Tasha 
I gotta say I found this a bit shockin 
It's on receipts here to tell you went shopping 
You bought some Nike shoes, but why you buying stockings?
Boy how could you lie to me? Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, I'mma let it go
I ain't standin' around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG
Well, I was home late at night watching TV
Got a call from my girl saying "RiRi
Saw your man in the club I thought he was out of town doing business
Said that he'd be back in three weeks?"
And now I'm mad, sitting in the kitchen getting sad
Looking at your pictures
Boy, How could you lie to me
Thought you would die for me
I'm not accepting another apology
After 3 years, Ima let it go
Can't standing around crying no more
Got your bags packed sitting by the door
I'mma leave your heart broken on the floor
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKG
I did you wrong, girl
Had a bunch of numbers in my phone, girl 
But we been in this relationship too long, girl
For you to be listenin' to your silly home girls
Better go on, girl
Now baby think about it 
Everything we do they gonna read about it 
Put it on a radio and TV outlet
Do you want to see your picture in that paper?
You know them haters
You hear that 808, the drum
That's my heart beat, I'm going numb
I said Rihanna, I'm feeling stressed
I'm going under cardiac arrest
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm standing by your bed
And so tempted to pull out your I.V
You're gonna be in the emergency room
I'm fighting with myself
I can't hurt you even though you hurt me
You're gonna be in the emergency room
Tryin to call a nurse but nobody can help you now
Let me see you try to live without me
Now where's your heartbeat? Flat line on the EKGTake off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my skirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work, did more than called upon
More than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? 
But it taught me
Before a decision, ask this question first
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Take off my cool 
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I've made make me a fool?
Or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, round of applause 
Take the abuse
Sometimes, it feels like they want me to lose 
It's entertainment; is that an excuse? 
But the question that lingers whether win or lose, is
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living
This is not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh , I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight, everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
'Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances I'm given, question existingTakin' shots in here, you want one?

Midair off of the cliff
Staring down at the end again
But then again, maybe we're finally
On the road that's headed away from all your complaining
Of hearing the same song
But baby, we'll hear it when I'm gone
It's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the sad song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
It was ours
But I'd do it again, holding hands with my friend again
But then again, maybe we gave our all
A song we'll never forget
Baby let 'em play it, maybe it'll save the world
They gon' miss hearing it when it's gone
But it's time to turn on the last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if we left every moment that we could spare?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear
You'll never know when the songs gonna play
The last song you'll hear is the one you made
Your song was beautiful
That's why I started singing it
But this song is our song, so it's playing until the end
Even if it's the last song
The last song
Oooh
The last song
Oooh
What if you wasted love and our love in time disappeared?
And the perfect song ends up being the last song you'll ever hear

I know you’re around like the ice cream man
I can hear you calling, whisper something in my ear
You're sweet like sugar, tell me what I wanna hear
I’m weak by your touch and when it’s melting on my lips
I run through my body when you lick my fingertips
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
 You the boss
You could be a professional, boy, you make a sale
I try to resist, but every time I fail
The one temptation that I gotta endure
The running through my body, now you’re knocking at my door
A thin little kiss and your call is really sweet
But the shawty that you’re rocking is nothing like me
You’re selling me a fantasy that I wanna explore
It sounds so good, spoil me rotten to the core 
Talk to me
Take care of my dreams
All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be
If words can speak
Then baby, sell it to me
Sell me candy, sell me love
Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
 You the boss
I wanna play, more than you know
So don’t you leave, and don’t you go

I wanna breathe you, lay on your shoulder
I wanna warm you when nights get colder
I want love, love, love

All I need is you beside me
It’s destiny, just let it be

Sell me heaven, sell me doves
What’s the charge? What’s the cost?
 You the bossRihanna this inspired me mamita
So you know Mr. worldwide had to check in
This beat’s perfect for me to teach the world a little bit more about me
Before you speak, listen
I always make it happen
I don’t believe in wishing or wishes or should've or would've or could've or can't or won't
So don’t, don’t come to me with that there
Epitome of irony, I’m a gentleman bastard
Burn me, throw me in the ocean, ya'll can keep the casket
I see who you not so let's see how long that mask fit
My whole life’s been a flagrant fail but somehow I still made the basket
Yeah they all tough behind the mic, I bet
Until they get they ass kicked
I’m a diamond in the rough I ain't cut right
And make sure when you cutting things that they're cut right
I don't floss, I don't rock ice, but if you listen and learn
Then I just might
Show you how I took my life from soft white
To playing cards with Rihanna at the same night
In Tokyo baby, let's ride
Now that’s what you call two diamonds in the sky
Shine bright, tonight you and I
We’re beautiful like diamonds in the sky
Eye to eye, so alive

Feels so good being bad 
There's no way I'm turning back 
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon

Just one night full of sin
Feel the pain on your skin
Tough, I don't scream mercy
It's your turn to hurt me
Yeah
If I'm bad, tie me down
Shut me up, gag and bound me
Cause the pain is my pleasure
Nothing comes better
Yeah
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say ah, ah, ah
I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones

Nothing new to say
Don't they realize
That it's so easy to see right through their disguise?
Makes me wonder why
When the whole world's turning left
It's when I'm going right
I need someone to let me be
Just who I am inside
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to?
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me
Just like me
Possibility
Got me trippin', thinkin' of what could be
Between you and me
Still, I need to know
Should I keep this feeling or let it go?
I can't wait no more
So now's the time to speak your mind
And show me what you feel
So tell me if you wanna take a chance on something real
'Cause a girl like me is just a little different from all the rest
And a girl likes me
Never gonna settle for second best 
Could it be a boy like you
That would give me anything if I asked him to? 
To take all my dreams and to make them true
Show me all the reasons that you oughta be, with a girl like me
Just like me

Yes to this yes, yes to that yes, to whateva you suggest
So please say yes
No, no, no
Haters gonna hate 
I found out much too late
I think I know we're a little hot now 
The truth leads to the lies
The heart ain't always right 
And I see that love is blind now 
Boy, you used to have my trust
Without trust, there ain't no us, boy
No, no, no 
You don't love me  and I know now

You don't love me, so let me go now

And I know  now
No, no, noThat's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile?
But you won't let me
You upset me girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't want to fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
]
And I hate how much I love you boy 
I can't stand how much I need you 
And I hate how much I love you boy 
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so 
You completely know the power that you have 
The only one makes me laugh 
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
]
And I hate how much I love you girl 
I can't stand how much I need you 
And I hate how much I love you girl 
But I just can't let you go 
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days maybe your magic won't affect me 
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Oh, oh, oh
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you

You hold my hand so tightly
Whenever we say goodbye
Standing by the door

Blow your secret open wide
So maybe if you say it 
Tell me what it is you like 
Baby, baby, don't be shy 
Maybe you can spend the night 
If you say it

Say it, that'll make it more clear 
I need to know how you feel

You should put me on
I won't shoot you down
Make you feel some kinda way
If you'll be honest with me
Put away your pride
I can see it in your face
You want me permanently 
Like how I whine when we dancing
I know how it happened
And I'm right there with you
But I won't be the first to put myself out there
The feeling is mutual
But I bet if you 
So maybe if you say it 
Tell me what it is you like

Say it, that'll make it more clear 
I need to know how you feel

Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven
If we go look together

And get it off your chest
Your eyes steady talking
And you're tryna fight it
But some things, baby, are not worth hiding
And we can find heaven

Say it Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die, we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
I'm thinking about everything that we've become, and I hate it
I thought we could make it, but I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures and the letters she sent
You had me thinking you were out wit' your friends
I'm so foolish, play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I, oh
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but this is what you said
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
Visions in my mind of the day that we met
You showed me things that I'll never forget
Took me swimming, in the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating, yeah
You think I'm playing when you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses and my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Yeah, yeah
Now I look back on the time that we spent
And I, see it in my mind playin' over and over again
'Cause boy, right now, you got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why, but you said
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
I guess it’s over indefinitely
But you and I know it’s not that easy to let go
Of everything, that we planned
And start all over again, hey
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won’t forget how you do it
My sweet baby, this is where the game ends now
Somehow
Wanna believe you and me, we can figure it out, oh
Ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Til we die
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
Gonna make me say, boy
I wish that you could hold me when I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to, you would phone me
Just like everything you told me
Boy, you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
We ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die
'Til we die
You used to say, "When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."
When we ride, we ride
When we ride, we ride
It's 'til we die
But I remember what you used to say
"When we ride, we ride
It's 'til the day that we die."

I know, I've heard it all
So don't you try and change your mind
So I won't be changing too, you know

Come, Mr. DJ, won't you turn the music up?I never should've waited so long to say
What I've always known since the very first day
Thought that you would stay forever with me
But the time has come to leave
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Hold, draw me close, close to my lips
Listen intently as I tell you this
Outside the world wages its wars
I'll rest in peace as long as you know
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
Promise you our love will carry on
Until you turn eternal, we belong
Before we turn out the lights and close our eyes
I'll tell you a secret I've held all my life
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you 'til the final goodbye
His respectful lips for the last time
And spell out the lyrics to love in the sky
It's you that I live for, and for you, I die
So I'll lay here with you
'Til the final goodbye

I'll never let my mama know
Only call him on my cell phone
Only see him after dark
I met him on the six train
Just the way he said my name
The brother had a lotta game
Had me open from the start
He scoops me up in his ride
Friday about a quarter to nine
So fly and so fine, and I'm so glad that he's all mine
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything
I know his crew's kinda shady
Sometimes it gets kinda crazy
But he treats me like a lady
Gives me everything I need
I don't care who's hating on me
'Cause every night, he's waiting on me
He's got mad personality, a side they never see
My friends tell me to slow down
But every time that he's around
My heart's on lock down
I feel love and I'm so proud
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama?
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me 
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything 
T-H-U-G in ya life, baby
One in a million, that's what you are to me
And I know your friends say I'm rough
But I still got the tender touch just to make you giggle and blush
But ya mom does not approve of us
She needs to be a lot more understanding
'Cause all I have for you is thug loving
And loving, that's all I'm giving
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorry
He's the one for me 
We'll be together from now 'til forever
I know it's the real thing
If you don't, whatever
And I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
I know it's meant to be
There's a thug in my life
How am I gonna tell my mama? 
She's gonna say it ain't right, but he's so good to me 
There's a thug in my life
And it's gonna cause crazy drama
I'm gonna see him tonight
I'm gonna give him everything 
Mama, don't worry, I'm not in a hurry 
I won't disappoint you, I won't make you sorryNa-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na

Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na
Na-na-na-na-na-oh-na-na-na-na-na-na-na
It's been a minute since I saw you, boy
Must admit, it's good to hear your voice
And I guess that I forgot just how you make me feel when you're around
See you haven't lost your sense of style
And you still could melt me with your smile
Can't deny that I still got these feelings deep inside
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Every time I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Still remember how you make me weak
How I fought to find the words to speak
I just can't escape the memories
I tried, but I just can't break free
Thought I closed the door on what we had
But these feelings just keep coming back
Didn't think that you could make me lose control like that
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize, I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Sweet lovin' is my ting
So you know mi got fi swing
That's why yuh request it again
Without a doubt yuh want to spend
And to experience it again
Because yuh love the way yuh felt back then
So make me light it up again
Reignite the flames again
'Cause I really miss 'dem days when we used to chill
Up on the hill watch the sun set in West Negril
Girl yuh Bajan beauty it a gimme di chill
Not to mention the way you are within'
It's funny how things could change, but still remain the same
Isn't love just a crazy game?
Baby, here I go again
I look into your eyes and then my heart remembers when
And I realize I've never gotten over you
Everytime I hear your name
It's like the sun shined through the rain
And I realize it's happening
Baby, here I go again
Here I go again
Baby, here I go again
Boy, I'm still in love with you, no matter what you do
We belong together foreverOoh yeah
Yeah, yeah
When you stand so close to me
I'm feeling butterflies
Is this the way that it supposed to be when I look into your eyes?
All you have to do is say my name
Just a stutter, more like butter
Since I met you, boy, my whole worlds changed
I can't hide this or deny this
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
A crazy little thing called love
My best friends tell me "Rihanna, what's got into you?"
I said "LeAndra, I can't explain these feelings I'm going through"
They tell me "Girl, it's not like you to fall this way"
I try my best to wear a disguise, but it's written on my face
Boy, you got me catching feelings
Got me thinking maybe you're the one 
I didn't understand the reason
That my heart was beating like a drum
I didn't understand the meaning
Then you opened up my eyes to
A crazy little thing called love
A crazy little thing called love
Girl, it's crazy It's amazing
It's the loving that you feeling
Put a tingle in your body every time you want a healing
Hey Rihanna

Boy, you got me catching feelings 
Got me thinking maybe you're the one

It's the beautiful, Miss Rihanna
Now this be the last time you did me wrong
No more layin' up in your arms
No calling, sayin' you want me back
I'm packin' my bags, what you think about that?
Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
And you can be mad at me all you want
I ain't comin' in, I'll be waitin' out front
Comin' out the door with your girlfriend
You did me wrong, boy, tell me where our love went
Stayed at home like a good girl do
But tonight, baby, you got me sad and blue
I just heard about the girl in your car, y'all kissin' at the bar
Got me cryin'
Oh, you got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Oh, you took my love
Now you got me like whoa
You got me hatin' on the club
'Cause you took my love
Why'd you have to take my love? Whoa
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh...
Now this is the sound of a broken heart
There's only one reason why we're apart
She never woulda made it to your car
If it wasn't for the club, I'd still have my love
I'd still have my love
We would still have us
We would still have us
I'd still have my love

You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—
You got her hatin', oh, you got her hatin' on the—Here we lay, face to face once again
Silence cuts like a knife as we pretend
And I'm wondering who will be the first to say what we both know
We're just holding onto "could have been's" that we should be letting go
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Was it me, or was it you that broke away?
What we were is like a season, love is change
And every time I think about it
It tears me up inside
Like the rivers of emotion
But I got no more tears to cry
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
Away
We can try to talk it over
But we've walked that road before
While our song is playing its last note
And we both know for sure
That it's time to close that door
It feels like you're a million miles away
As you're lying here with me tonight
I can't even find the words to say
I can find a way to make it right
And we both know that the story's ending
We play the part, but we're just pretending
And I can't hide the tears
'Cause even though you're here
It feels like you're a million miles away
A million miles awayBaby, baby, baby, baby, baby, yeah

Hear the music playin'
Let it take you to places far away and relax your senses
Just do what you wanna do
No need for questions
It's only for you
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun 
So real, so right
Can't explain the feeling
Like the sunlight brings to life new meaning
No need for stress 
Save that for another day
No second guessing
Just trust me when I say
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there 
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Forget about your troubles, it's alright
Let them go 'til we see the morning light 
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun, the sun 
And it's so amazing, oh, how you can't escape it
The movement takes you and never let's you go
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there 
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Forget about your troubles, it's alright 
Let 'em go 'til we see the morning light
Feel the beat as our bodies move as one
Come and dance to the music of the sun 
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Let it take you far
Come and dance to the music of the sun
It'll take you far away, far away
Come and dance to the music of the sun
Can't you feel the music in the air?
Close your eyes, let the rhythm take you there
Doesn't matter who you are or where you're from
Come and dance to the music of the sunKisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie
Emotions come and go
Who knows how the wind will blow?
There's so little in this world to trust in
Seduce themselves with lies
Some don't realize
They call it love, but it's really only lusting
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?
'Cause I'm caught between 'yes' and 'no'
'Cause when you kiss me
I feel everything that I've been missin'
I try to slow down, but my heart won't listen
And it's tearin' me all up inside
And when you touch me
I feel a rush, but I'm afraid that it might crush me
Should I put my trust in something I don't trust in?
I try to run, but there's no place to hide
'Cause baby, kisses don't lie
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Never don't lie
You can run if you want, but you can't hide
Telling you, it's the truth, don't you ask why
Kisses don't
No, they don't
Kisses don't lie
You whispered in my ear
But are your words sincere?
'Cause pretty words can cut just like a knife
You see, I'm nobody's fool
I play by my own rules
So please think twice before you step into my life
So you see you and me
We're getting close to the danger zone
Show me how, tell me now
Should I stay or should I go?

Ah, ah, a-ah
Footsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave 
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
 No, no
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted , haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, oohOne spliff a day keep my mind right

I blow tree everyday in my house, in my car, I love to blaze
Got the best smoke on the west coast, in LA 
Smoking bomb-bomb going dum-dum
Screaming one love got my L up, bout to roll a blunt
Take a puff-puff of the diesel
Hit the plug up till I run us a kilo
I'm laid back in a Maybach blowing zeroes
Up to the ozone gripping my solo I'm so gone so long
I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami
If you ain't puttin' my nigga then we ain't passin'
Light up my troubles then watch them turn into ashes

Wake up in the morning then I pray to Jah
Please give me mercy fi the ganja

I might catch a charge if the copper search me
Not one, not two, not three, not four
Who the fuck these narcos at my door
They want war, they want war
I make green my decor
Imma let these motherfuckers know who da boss
I might just bring a gram to the Grammy's
I might cop it straight off the boat in Miami

I saw you smiling suddenly
I can't get you out my mind
I got it bad boy, I can't lie
I want your time and your full attention
I wanna to talk to you
And not to mention good love that you give to me
I think about it constantly
No, I won't apologize for feeling like I do
It's just the simple facts of life
I'm crazy over you
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
I understand that you got your crew
But I've got something in mind for you
Make you lose all track of time
Guaranteed to blow your mind
I don't care what anybody got to say
Maybe they never had it quite this way
Let them talk and criticize
They all need to recognize
They might see I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
What I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way
I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you 
Every minute of the day
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing
This is crazy 
So amazing 
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope you're understanding
I'm not playing, boy 
I'm just saying, boy
They might seem I'm a bit extreme
To need you night and day
But what I feel can't be concealed
There ain't no other way
 I'm a selfish girl when it comes to you
Every minute of the day 
I'm addicted to what you're giving me, boy
It's killing me
When it comes to love, I'm not tryna share you
You might think I'm greedy, but I just don't care
I need you in my world 'cause I'm a selfish girl
Boy, you got me tripping
I didn't know what I was missing 
This is crazy 
So amazing 
I didn't mean to be demanding, but I hope your understandingWhen the sky falls and the earth quakes
We gon' put this back together
We won’t break
Sak Pase, my Port-Au-Princes
My Haitian Gods and all of my Princesses
Our condolences as you fightin' against this
We’re right by your side while we tryin' to make sense of this
Heavenly father help us see through these problems
And for those that's left, accept them into your garden
So here’s my theory, the country’s already starvin'
So we sacrificed many to shed light on all of them
God please pardon, I speak from the heart
It's the only way I see this tragedy befall on them
So let's get involved with them, hand to hand with them
Arm to arm with them 'til they get strong again
When the sky falls…
Can’t wait until tomorrow
Haiti a Mi Amor
Haiti, Mon Amour
Not gonna leave you stranded, alone, alone
Oh no
Learn from the past, New Orleans was flooded
So we know we just can’t rely on the government
We under the rubble again, here we go rumbling when
When we gon' catch a break, my friend lost his mother, and then
And then, Carline lost her uncles and them
Buried with no caskets, they just put covers on them
And the tears fall, and we fight back
Story ain’t done, it can’t end like that
Nah, not like this, tomorrow’s survivors gonna carry on your name
You live on inside us, your memory’s alive with us
You inspired us, to rebuild this country, you just guide us
It’s not the angels that are on their way
Its not the bells of Santa Trinita
The people waiting in positions vacant
For hands to help not just to pray
Haïti va s’élever
Tu vas te relever
Nous nous éléverons
Ensemble ensemble ensemble
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't break
We gon' put this back together we won't breakWhy do you call when I'm not feelin' you? 
Why can't you leave? Boy, just walk away

Made a promise till the day we die
I trusted each and every word
Never thinking that I'd get burned
Silly me, I believed in your fairy tales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Fool me once, shame on you
Fool me twice, now this song is through
The things you said, I can never forget
The things you did fill my heart with regret
But I'm still standing tall as I walk away
And you know that it's true when you hear me say
It's over, it's through
Ain't a thing you can do, boy
It's sad, but it's true
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips
Or ever will deceive these eyes 
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
No, I'm never gonna hear your lies 
So listen while I make it clear 
Incase you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
There's only time to say goodbye
Goodbye
No, baby
Oh, silly me, I believed in your fairytales
Boy, I thought that I knew you so very well
But you walked on my pride, all the tears that I cried
And it cuts like a knife
It's the last time you're ever gonna kiss these lips 
Or ever will deceive these eyes
Believe me when I tell you this
Baby boy, it's the last time 
I'm ever gonna cry these tears
I'm never gonna hear your lies 
So listen while I make it clear
In case you didn't hear
This time's the last time, there's no time to give it one more try
Ain't a thing you can do but wonder why
There's only time to say goodbye
Baby, goodbye
Cause I'm never gonna, never gonna cry no more
Goodbye, goodbye
OhhTook a chance
Rolled the dice on me and you
Opened up, let you in my world
Like a dance, started slow and then love took control
Swept away, so proud to be your girl
When you write a story much too fast
Sometimes a happy ending doesn’t last
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Remember when we said our love would last forever?
But then again, how are we to know?
There comes a time, that love will change like stormy weather
A sunny day will suddenly turn cold
Time will teach you all you need to learn
But there'll always be a first time you get burned
Oh, whoa
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
I don't regret a single day
Joy and pain along the way
A broken heart’s the price we pay
As sad as it may seem
Baby, can't you see?
It’s the way it’s gotta be
Now I know that love ain't meant to be a play thing
Now I know it’s not an ordinary, everyday thing
Now I know that when it's right, it's so amazing
When it’s wrong, you gotta let it go
Now I know
Now I know
Yeah, no no
Now I knowI rest my hand across your lips
Feel your breath by my fingertips
No longer can I alay what is right
But this love, it won't give up without a fight
I'd write a note and tear it up
There are no words that could say enough
I know I'm gonna hurt you when l walk out that door
But I swear it's gonna hurt me even more
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Wish I could see the dreams tonight
Wish I could make them turn out right
Tempted to turn back for just one last kiss
But my heart tells me it's better just like this
So this is how the story ends
When love is gone, you can't pretend
No matter who else I give my heart to
There's a part of it that still belongs to you
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye
You made me strong when I was weak
Gave my heart a voice to speak
You must've known this day would come
When the lessons are all done
All except for one, no
You taught me how to laugh
You taught me how to cry
When I gave up, you even taught me how to try
There's one more thing to learn before I spread my wings and fly
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
Goodbye, goodbye
Oh, oh
You're gonna have to teach me how to say
GoodbyeBaby, slow down
Just hear me out
There's something I gotta let you know
No need to push
No need to rush
You know you had me from 'hello'
When it comes to my heart, I don't play
Baby boy, can't you see the stop sign?
You're moving much too fast
Baby, love doesn't grow in a day
Just get it right the first time
Make this feeling last
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual baby
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Boy, can't you see?
I'm not tryna be the girl who gets taken for a ride
You take your time, and you will find there's so much more to me inside
And you say there's no need to delay
You're telling me to trust you
Boy, you know I want to, baby
But my heart, it's so recently break
Before we take this very far, show me who you really are
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Don't you know that it's getting late?
And I know what's on your mind 
I know this feeling is crazy 
It's mutual, baby 
But we don't have to rush something real
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Hey baby

And make this feeling last
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Don't you know that it's getting late? 
And I know what's on your mind 
I know this feeling is crazy
It's mutual, baby
But we don't have to rush something real
We don't have to rush it
Baby, if you're willing to wait, we can just take our time 
Our time
Don't you know that it's getting late?Something 'bout the way that you workin' me

        Another day another reminder that your not here with me
I watch the snowflakes falling from the sky then I get lost in memories
The time we tried to build a snowman, the time we tried to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul
But for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
Another tear, another regret boy, that your so far away
Can it be, that it was only last year we shared that Christmas day?
Remember when we took the sleigh ride, remember singing by the fire?
Theres to much that's in the daylight, I keep reliving you and I
Time to try to build a snowman, the time we try to count the stars
Its crazy how we didn't know that wed ever be apart!
I can hear the music playing
See the lights upon the tree
I can feel the joy in every soul, but for me its incomplete
And I try my best to play the part
But no matter what I do
No it just don't feel like Christmas, no it just don't feel like Christmas, without you
See I tried but it just ain't right, without youLyrics available upon release. Stay tuned!Here we go

As long as we’ve been together
You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
You and me, we go back to jump rope in grade school
Memories when you were trying too hard to play cool
I don't mind, I know that you've gotta go to your changes
Take your time, sometimes the heart rearranges
As long as we’ve been together
You’ve always been the one
Nobody knows you better
When all is said and done
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone 
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? 
Who ya gonna run to? 
There ain't nobody who can ever understand like I do 
So when you realize you need the one you said goodbye to
Look over your shoulder, boy, and you know who'll be there
You know I'm gonna be right there, right there
When your friends start to trip and you're losing your grip
And you can't find your way back home
When your world falls apart and you're lost in the dark
And you know that you're all alone
When you just can't deal and you need something real
Someone who'll always come through
Who ya gonna run to? Who ya gonna run to?
When there's nobody else in the world you can put your trust in
Who ya gonna run to?
And you find all the haters around ya that don't mean nothing
Who ya gonna run to?
Who ya gonna run to?Bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop, bubble pop

I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
Come get lost with me
I dare you to try-ey-yy-ey-yy-ey-yy
 
Bubble popLooking back, it's hard for me to see
Just how I coulda been so blind
Like an actor on a movie screen
You played the part with every line
Well, every story doesn't have a happy ending
Sometimes a flower doesn't grow
I hope you understand the message that I'm sending
But boy, I think you need to know
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda been, baby
My momma didn't raise no fool
She said play with fire, you get burned
You laughed at me, I laugh at you
Now it seems the tables turned
I must admit, I really thought you had potential
But I could not have been more wrong
I need somebody I can trust with his essentials
You had your chance, but now I'm long gone
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
Coulda been the one, baby
Coulda been the one
You played yourself, boy
And there is no denying it
It's just the way the story goes
You made your bed, boy
Better go and lie in it
But know that you'll be lying there alone
That I would give it all to catch you when you fall, boo
Didn't know just what you had, boy
Now it's just too bad, boy
You're a cheater and a liar
Went to play with fire
Boy, I hope that you enjoyed your fun
'Cause you coulda been the one
There's nothing left to say
Coulda been the one
Coulda been, shoulda beenBeen waitin' on that sunshine, boy
I think I need that back
Can't do it like that
No one else gon' get it like that
So why argue? You yell, but cha take me back
Who cares, when it feels like crack?
Boy, ya know that you always do it right
Man, fuck yo pride
Just take it on back, boy, take it on back, boy
Take it back all night

You are not from the land I swim from
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Please don’t insult my intelligence
My mindset is greater than your relevance

Can't stay long 'cause the money's on hold and I gotta pick it up like daycare
You know I gotta pick it up I don't play fair
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location
Who's been giving niggas admiration?
I don't really know
Fraud ass niggas who be like that
Men runnin' up behind another man
Crowd full of bros I don't wanna get to know
I got blood 
No time for the petty nonsense

Nonsense, nonsense
No time for the petty nonsense
Signing big deals in the conference room
Nonsense

Nope, your credit ain't shit
Four/five lots and my new whip still won't fit
Fuck are you to me?
Same hoes mad in the back ain't know who they wanna be
No time for the petty nonsense
Any bitch alive with a conscience knows
I'ma be around for a while now
Can't blame me if your nigga don't be giving you down time like he used to
Lately I been in  no bluetooth
I been in the cut getting C-notes
You be in the cut giving deep throat
Gotta pick it up
Gotta pick it up from the floor
Gonna make it hard for these hating ass niggas to ignore
Never give a nigga your location

NonsenseYellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It’s the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I’ve gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place

Who's got the most inflated ego of them all?
Thinks he can do a booty call
That thinks he is so lovable
That thinks he is the perfect man
That I shouldn't of ever let go
And that's why I let him go
The first thing he wants in the morning ain't you
It's all about him in the morning, baby
You got a boy like I had, using you
A boy like that is using baby
Let me help you understand the sexy grin from ear to ear
Girl, if you were inside his head
This is what you'd hear
Ayo, you gotta love me 
Bitch, I'm special 
I want everybody thinking that I got somethin'-somethin' they don't have 
You gotta love me

He handled me like merchandise
Hate to admit the down payment was his bedroom eyes 
Ay, then after he passed home base, he started to pump the breaks
My heavenly bliss destroyed
He flipped a U-ey in my face
I was the grand prize that he hardly had to chase
Said goodbye 'cause I coulda sworn i heard him say
You gotta love me 
Bitch, I'm special 
I want everybody thinking that I got somethin'-somethin' they don't have

And you can try to run but you won't get very far
And you can try to hide but I know where you are
Let loose, I see right through you
You got a hole in your head too
And I knew it the very moment I met you
So I hope you got your swagger up
You know just what I love
Gonna take a lot to work me up
I don't think you wanna do it right now
And not with me 
Don't start with me 
I got a, got a, got a attitude on me
And I don't think you really wanna run your mouth
'Cause I was feelin' watered down

        I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling, gahhlee
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?
I got to do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me
Why you ain't ever let me grow?
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
Cover your shit in glitter, I could make
CoverI've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
What now?
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
What now?Y'all haters corny with that Illuminati mess
Paparazzi, catch my fly and my cocky fresh
I'm so reckless when I rock my Givenchy dress
I'm so possessive so I rock his Roc necklaces
My Daddy Alabama, Momma Louisiana
You mix that negro with that Creole make a Texas bama
I like my Baby's hair with baby hair and afro
I like my negro nose with Jackson 5 nostrils
Earned all this money, But they never take the country out me
I got hot sauce in my bag, Swag
Oh-oh-oh shit
So-oh-oh rich
Eyes low, I'm so loaded
Eyes, pose bitch
Take it off
Wanna see you work like oh my god
And that thang is out I know you know
And you bounce like I know you know
Bitch, I know you know
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream big, I work hard, I grind til' I own it
I twirl on them haters, albino alligators
El Camino with the seat low, sipping Cuervo with no chaser
Sometime I go off  , I go hard 
Get what's mine , I'm a star 
Cause I slay , I slay , I slay , I slay 
All day , I slay , I slay , I slay 
We gon' slay , gon slay , we slay ,I slay 
I slay , okay , I slay , okay, okay, okay, okay,
Okay, okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, 'cause I slay
Prove to me you got some coordination, 'cause I slay
Slay trick, or you get eliminated
Me, Nicki M, I got too many wins
Pull up with them V twins in my engine
All this ice all around me like a penguin
I ain't talkin' bowlin' but I'm with the kingpin
I pull up with a nigga with a real big dick
That's shit so good, man a bitch came quick
I ain't ever have a beat that a bitch ain't rip
I'm fly every day but a bitch ain't trippin'
You be on that bull, you be on Scott Pippen
I be pimp walkin', I'm limpin'
C's on my bag so they think I'm crippin'
Every nigga in here wanna know what I'm drinkin'
Myx Moscato, niggas
I keep a pillow with me just because I'm tired of niggas
I'm with some flawless girls, they're pretty and they're thick
Bust it open quick, put that pussy on his lips, bitch
My beat low
Yazzzzz bitch
Let me see you get it no no no
Flexin I know that you with it
Pose bitch
Take a photo
, flick, flick, flick, for fucking sho doe
All you lame ass bitches is a no go
And if you with it go fuckin loco, loco
Oh-oh-oh shit
So loaded
Eyes low 
I am so lit
Eyes, pose bitch
Y'all make a Texas bama
When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, cause I slay
When he fuck me good, I take his ass to Red Lobster, we gon slay
If he hit it right, I might take him on a flight on my chopper, I slay
Drop him off at the mall, let him buy some J's, let him shop up, 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, 'cause I slay
I might get your song played on the radio station, 'cause I slay
You just might be a black Bill Gates in the making, 'cause I slay
I just might be a black Bill Gates in the making
I see it, I want it, I stunt, yellow bone it
I dream it, I work hard, I grind 'til I own it

El Camino with the seat low, sippin' Cuervo with no chaser
Bitches is softer than Al Dente,cut from a different kente
Tell em I'm the ninja, Weezy is my Sensei
So I call him Splinter, faster than a sprinter
Gimme my chopsticks, I'll have these rap bitches for dinner
This is for my gentlemen, in button-ups, and khakis
This is for my nigga, Seven Up, in Castaki
This is for my niggas, wheelying them Kawasakis
Shout out, to the Vackee's, Saltfish Ackees
Kisses to my fans, unless I'm feeling, kinda cocky
Winter Wonderland, is on my hand, it's kind of rocky
I am Nicki, Minaj, or Lewinski
Pump's on the clutch, right hand, on the 6-speed
Okay, ladies, now let's get in formation, I slay

Won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?
Cause all I ever have
Redemption songs
Redemption songs
Emancipate yourselves from mental slavery
None but ourselves can free our minds!
Have no fear for atomic energy
Cause none of them can stop the time
How long shall they kill our prophets
While we stand aside and look?
Some say it's just a part of it
We've got to fulfill the book
So won't you help to sing
These songs of freedom?

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? 
Tú me dejas
Te enfadas y después me vuelves a besar
Y así me haces olvidar 
Y no me acuerdo de por qué
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
Nadie me calma como tú
Y me doy cuenta que mi única verdad
Es que odio amarte tanto
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so 
Tú sabes el poder que tienes sobre mi
Y nadie más me hace reir
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
Y es que odio amarte tanto amor
Saber que te necesito
Y es que odio amarte tanto amor
No puedo vivir sin ti
Pero odio quererte así
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me 
And your kiss won't make me weak
Pero nadie, nadie más hoy me conoce tanto
Eso es un hechizo que tienes sobre mi

I looked up to the sky and there I saw a wondrous sight
A star was shining brighter than I'd ever seen before
And a host of angels sang to me, never heard a song so pure
They said don't be afraid, we bring good news to all the world
With great tidings of joy for every boy and every girl
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Oh yeah
As I went down into the town to see what I could see
Three mighty kings with golden rings came ridin' up to me
They said they seek the child who was born beneath the star
Of all the kings this one would be the mightiest by far
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see
Mary's sweet baby
And let our praises ring to the newborn king while he sleeps so peacefully
So peacefully
Hallelujah, Hallelujah, Hallelujah....
So wake up everybody, 'cause the blessed day has come
And ring the bell so we can tell the news to everyone
A child is born
On this holy night
And all the angels sing of the joy he brings with a star so bright
So come to see

With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella
You can stand under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
Under my umbrella
Ella, ella, eh, eh, eh
These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end

相處那麼長 相好那麼短
總是在親吻中善忘 討厭那快感
把錯誤都給遺忘
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
你的指尖擦過臉龐
就忘了爭吵的損傷 就像矛盾
都與我們的未來無關

Sex with me, so amazing
Vodka and water, and a lemon
And a few other things I can not mention
Oh-na-na-na-na
Five fingers on it 
Hit it like you own it, I’mma hit it like I’m on it
Straight shots of the blue dot
Baby, I’mma pick your poison
Oh-we, ah-yeah, you gon’ need it
I’m off that la-la
I’mma get it wet like jacuzzi
And sex with me, so amazing
All this all hard work, no vacation
Stay up off my Instagram, pure temptation
Sex with me, sex with me, sex with me
You know I got the sauce , you know I’m saucy
And it’s always wet, a bitch never ever had to use lip gloss on it
I’mma need you deeper than six, it's not a coffin
We’re not making love, tryna get nasty
Wrap up your drugs, come make me happy
Sex with me is amazing, with her it’ll feel alright
The sex doesn’t get any better, make it long, let it be all night
I know, I know, I make it hard to let go
Tonight, all night, I’m Monroe
Even if I’m aloneOooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
And stole my star
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la, la, la
You stole my star
La, la, la, la, la
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me
'Cause you really hurt me
No, you really hurt me

Ooooooooh, you really hurt me, ooooooooh
'Cause you really hurt me
Ooooooooh, you really hurt meI came fluttering in from Neverland
Time can never stop me, no, no, no, no
I know you've tried to
I came riding in on a pale white horse
Handing out highs to less fortunate
I do advise you
Run it back, run it on back
When you breaking it down for me
Cause I can't hear you, two times
Run it on back, will it ever make sense to me?
I got to do things my own way darling
Will you ever let me
Will you ever respect me? No
Do things my own way darling
You should just let me

Own way darling, own way....
Do things my own way darling, own way darling
Own way darling, darling...
When I look outside my window
I can't get no piece of mind
When I look outside my window
I can't get no peace of mind
Let me cover your shit in glitter
I could make it gold, gold
Heard you tryna sell your soul, baby
Word on the street, you run it low lately
I needed you to please give my reflection a break
From the face it’s seeing now
Ooh darling
Would you mind giving my reflection a break
From the pain it’s feeling now?

And I tried to buy your pretty heart, but the price too high

No clouds in my stones
Let it rain, I hydroplane in the bank
Coming down with the Dow Jones
When the clouds come, we gone
We Roc-A-Fella
We fly higher than weather
In G5's or better
You know me
In anticipation for precipitation
Stack chips for the rainy day
Jay—Rain Man is back
With little Ms. Sunshine
Rihanna, where you at?
You have my heart
And we'll never be worlds apart
Maybe in magazines
But you'll still be my star
Baby, ‘cause in the dark
You can't see shiny cars
And that's when you need me there
With you, I'll always share
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

These fancy things
Will never come in between
You're part of my entity
Here for infinity
When the war has took its part
When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other
You can stand under my umbrella

Come into me
There's no distance in between our love
So go on and let the rain pour
I'll be all you need and more
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever
Said I'll always be your friend
Took an oath, I'ma stick it out to the end
Now that it's raining more than ever
Know that we'll still have each other

忘掉在溫馨中帶涼
視你如偶像 忘掉這麼想最傷

Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I 
Love you beyond the reason why

And your kiss won't make me weak
最恨世上 講相知
得你能透視至此
大概這點心意 像咒語玩意

But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go

That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on?

Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bowStory of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererShine bright like a diamond

"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes"
Sometimes it helps
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Pull the trigger
And you can see my heart
Said I’m terrified
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the triggerShine bright like a diamond

Stupid in love
Let me tell you something
Never, have I ever, been a size 10 in my whole life
I left the engine running
I just came to see, what you would do if I
Gave you a chance to make things right
So I made it even though Katy, told me that this would be nothing but a waste of time
And she was right, mm
Don't understand it, blood on your hands
And still you insist on repeatedly trying to tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
Stupid in love
Stupid in love
My new nickname is "You Idiot"
That's what my friends are calling me when
They see me yelling into my phone
They're telling me "Let go, he is not the one."
I thought I saw your potential
Guess that's what made me dumb
He don't want it, not like you want it
Scheming and cheating, oh girl, why do you waste your time?
You know he ain't right
Telling me this, I don't wanna listen
But you insist, on repeatedly trying, to tell me lies
And I just don't know why
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
No, no, no
I'm not stupid in love
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupid
This is stupid, I'm not stupid
Don't talk to me, like I'm stupid
I still love you, but I just can't do this
I may be dumb but I'm not stupidWhatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
Please tell me
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out Baby put the work in like a champion

Once upon a time, somebody ran
Somebody ran away saying fast as I can

Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh
Oooooooh oh-oh oh-oh oh-oh
Once upon a time, we burned bright
Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
And stole my star

With a sunroof top and a gangsta lean
So if you feel me, let me know, know, know
Come on now, what you waitin' for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean
Got a ride that's smoother than a limousine
Can you handle the curves? Can you run all the lights?
If you can, baby boy, then we can go all night
‘Cause I'm 0 to 60 in three point five
Baby, you got the keys
Now shut up and drive 
Shut up and drive 
I've got class like a '57 Cadillac
Got overdrive with a whole lot of boom in the back
You look like you can handle what's under my hood
You keep saying that you will, boy, I wish you would
So if you feel me let me know, know, know
Come on now what you waiting for, for, for
My engine's ready to explode, explode, explode
So start me up and watch me go, go, go, go
Get you where you wanna go, if you know what I mean

Ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride, ride
Shut up and drive

Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? 
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you 
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
Now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing

Sex with me, sex with me, sex with meStory of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererI've been everywhere, man, looking for someone

Somebody ran away saying fast as I can
I've got to go, I've got to go
Once upon a time, we fell apart
You're holding in your hands the two halves
Of my heart
Ohhhhh, ohhhhh
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring
But no, you let me go

Now all we ever seem to do is fight
On and on
And on and on and on
Once upon a time on the same side
Once upon a time on the same side
In the same game
And why'd you have to go?
Have to go and throw water on my flame
Flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame
Flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame, flame
I could've been a princess, you'd be a king
Could've had a castle, and worn a ring

Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? 
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Take off my cool
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? 
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?
Chances of living, question existing
Who am I living for?

That's how much I love you
That's how much I need you
And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? 
But you won't let me
You upset me, girl
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget 
Can't remember what you did
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
]
And I hate how much I love you, boy 
I can't stand how much I need you 
And I hate how much I love you, boy 
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so 
You completely know the power that you have 
The only one makes me laugh 
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I...
Love you beyond the reason why
And it just ain't right
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
Said I despise that I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, girl
But I just can't let you go
But I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
That's how much I love you
As much as I need you
How much I need you
How much I love you
That's how much I love you
Oh, I need you
That's how much I need you

I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna be a murderer
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him, I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying

Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell

And we know it very well

I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererIn this California king bed

Pose, pose, pose, poseWhat now?
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
What now?
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
I just wanna scream 
I just wanna scream 
I just wanna scream 
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?And I can't stand you
Must everything you do make me wanna smile
Can I not like you for awhile? 
But you won't let me
You upset me, boy
And then you kiss my lips
All of a sudden I forget 
Can't remember what you did
But I hate it...
You know exactly what to do
So that I can't stay mad at you
For too long, that's wrong
But I hate it
You know exactly how to touch
So that I don't wanna fuss and fight no more
I despise, yet I adore you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
You completely know the power that you have 
The only one makes me laugh 
Said it's not fair
How you take advantage of the fact
That I... 
Love you beyond the reason why 
And it just ain't right, oh
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
One of these days, maybe your magic won't affect me
And your kiss won't make me weak
But no one in this world knows me the way you know me
So you'll probably always have a spell on me
Yeah
Ooh, oh, oh
Oh
And I hate how much I love you, boy
I can't stand how much I need you
And I hate how much I love you, boy
But I just can't let you go
And I hate that I love you so
And I hate that I love you so, soWe stay moving around solo
Ask us where you at, we don't know
And don't care
All we know is we was at home cause you left us there
You got your boys and got gone
And left us all alone
Now she in the club with a freaky dress on
Cats don't want her to keep that dress on
Trying to get enough drinks in her system
Take it to the tele and make her a victim
Patron on brain, ball player in her face
They shake the spot, she's just another case
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
He's staying with a flock of them, oh yeah
Got a girl at home but he don't care
Won't care
All he'll do is keep me at home, won't let me go nowhere
He thinks because I'm at home, I won't be getting it on
And now I'm finding numbers in the jacket pockets
Tricks calling the house, non-stop it's
Getting out of control, finally I can't take no more
He finds a letter on the stairs, saying this is the end
I packed my bag and left with your best friend, oh
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't be the reason, don't be the reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever
Easy for a good girl to go bad
And once we've gone
Best believe we've gone forever
Don't need a reason, don't need a reason
You better learn how to treat us right
'Cause once a good girl goes bad, we done forever

I'm not the type to get my heart broken
I'm not the type to get upset and cry
'Cause I never leave my heart open
Never hurts me to say goodbye
Relationships don't get deep to me
Never got that whole "in love" thing
And someone can say they love me truly
But at the time, it didn't mean a thing
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
Did it happen when we first kissed?
'Cause it's hurting me to let it go
Maybe 'cause we spent so much time
And I know that it's no more
I should've never let you hold me, baby
Maybe why I'm sad to see us apart
I didn't give to you on purpose
Can't figure out how you stole my heart
My mind is gone, I'm spinning 'round
And deep inside, my tears, I'll drown
I'm losing grip, what's happening?
I stray from love, this is how I feel
This time was different
Felt like I was just a victim
And it cut me like a knife
When you walked out of my life
Now I'm in this condition
And I've got all the symptoms
Of a girl with a broken heart
But no matter what, you'll never see me cry
How did I get here with you?
I'll never know
I never meant to let it get so personal
And after all I tried to do, to stay away from loving you
I'm broken hearted, I can't let you know
And I won't let it show
You won't see me cry 
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry
Cry, cry, cry

Chest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
My California king

We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars

My California king
My California king
My California kingI don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna be a murderer
Story of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
Our love, his trust
I might as well take a gun and put it to his head
Get it over with
I don't wanna do this anymore, woah
Anymore
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererYellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place

My name's Rihanna
I'm a soldier true and through
I know I'll make it through the storm
I really want you to realize
I really want you to put me on
I've been searchin' for somebody
To let me be all I can be
Music is my inspiration
It's the only thing I need
New on the streets
My name's Rihanna
So I try my best and pray to God
My dreams will all turn real
'Cause there's a fire burnin' in my heart
I hope you all can feel
To my music I'll be faithful
You know I'll give my all and all

You're making stayin' over here impossible
Baby, I'ma say your aura is incredible
If you don't have to go, don't

We're hand in hand, chest to chest, and now we're face to face

Take off my shirt
Loosen the buttons and undo my shirt
Stare at myself in the mirror
Pick me apart piece by piece
Sorrow decreased, pressure released
I put in work
Did more than called upon, more than deserved
When it was over, did I wind up hurt? 
But it taught me before a decision, ask this question first
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

Take off my cool
Show them that under here, I'm just like you
Do the mistakes I make
Make me a fool or a human with flaws?
Admit that I'm lost, 'round of applause
Take the abuse
Sometimes it feels like they want me to lose
It's entertainment, is that an excuse? 
But the question that lingers, whether win or lose, is...
Who am I living for?

Dear Diary, it's Robyn
Entertaining is something I do for a living, it's not who I am
I'd like to think that I'm pretty normal
I laugh, I get mad, I hurt
I think guys suck sometimes
But when you're in the spotlight everything seems good
Ooh, yeah
Sometimes I feel like I have it worst
Cause I have to always keep my guard up
I don't know who to trust
I don't know who wants to date me for who I am
Or who wants to be my friend for who I really am
Who am I living for?
Is this my limit?
Can I endure some more?

Question existingStory of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererOh yeah, yeah, yeah

        Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now
We got right now
So get up right now
'Cause all we got is right now
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now

'Cause all we got is right now
'Cause all we got is right now
So close, I can taste you
Ain't scared, I can take you
Can't fight the feeling
Got me fiendin'
You got me fiendin'
Something you wanted to do all your life
There's no more waiting, tonight is the night
And it can't be wrong, not if it feels this right
Turn it up
Scream it loud, yeah
Tomorrow way too far away
And we can't get back yesterday
But we young right now

Því í dag er sumarsól og gaman
Borðum saman grautinn
Því engin er þrautin
Ég er safi
Bráðum verð ég á kafi
Ég er með þinni mömmu
Og nauðga þinni ömmu
Springandi í augun þín
Læðan er svo sæt og fín
Stúlkan var þæginleg
Ódýr og hversdagsleg
Tindur orti vísur
Meðan ég elskaði skvísur
Oddur átti skó
Sem ég hjó
Hjól ég átti en ég dó
En mér er alveg sama, só
Ég hitti guð og hló
Safnaði saman bitch og ho
Benjamín átti nigga
En Krissi átti Sigga
Uggison pulled da trigga
Tindur got shot, that jigga
Blabiddiblablabla
Ég les dagblað
Moðerfokker, ég er laufblað
Sama ríma, hverjum er ekki drullu sama
Ég þig lama, lama
Ég fór út í búð
Og keypti mér snúð
Síðan leigði ég mér trúð
Og var ógeðslega smooth
Tíkin var heví prúð
Leiðin var löng og ströng
Nú er ég frægari en langatöng
Þetta er það sem ég söng
Leggöng
Löggan já fokk hún
Þar er engin brún
Ég stefni á tunglið, moon
Og verð kominn þar soon
Bitch, suck my diiiiiick
Tindur hélt hann væri cool
Frétti að hann væri fool
Bitch nigga go back to school
Mutha muthafucka oooooChest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seems like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
California dreaming

Maybe I've been California dreaming

We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
My California king
My California king
Just when I felt like giving up on us
You turned around and gave me one last touch
That made everything feel better
And even then my eyes got wetter
So confused wanna ask you if you love me
But I don't wanna seem so weak
Maybe I've been California dreaming
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me

My California kingI've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it outOh, oh, oh-ow
Yeah
You look so dumb right now
Standing outside my house
Trying to apologize
You're so ugly when you cry
Please, just cut it out
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Grab your clothes and get gone 
You better hurry up
Before the sprinklers come on 
Talking' bout' "Girl, I love you, you're the one"
This just looks like a re-run
Please, what else is on? 
Don't tell me you're sorry cause you're not
Baby when I know you're only sorry you got caught
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now 
Go on and take a bow
Oh, and the award for the best liar goes to you 
For making me believe
That you could be faithful to me
Let's hear your speech, oh
How 'bout a round of applause?
A standing ovation
But you put on quite a show
Really had me going
But now it's time to go
Curtain's finally closing
That was quite a show
Very entertaining
But it's over now

Hey, hey, heyOh, I didn't mean to fall in deep, but I’ve no regrets
You tried to push me down, you tried to keep me possessed
I gave you my heart, you took the key
But now I paid my debt, it's time I left
And I don't need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down
All it takes is one bold move to change everything
All it takes is loving you to forget, forgive
But I'm having some kind of breakthrough
I'm ready to live
I don’t need someone who makes me feel so bad
And I’ve just enough left to help me pack my bags
Yes, I have found something I thought I lost
I found me, I found faith, I found trust
You can't take this from me
Can’t you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down
I won’t take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
You can't take this from me
Can't you see I won't take this lying down?
And I can hear you when you speak your poison
Bitter words can't hurt me now
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying down
I won't take it lying downCome on!My California king
My California king
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
My California kingYellow diamonds in the light
And we're standing side by side
As your shadow crosses mine
What it takes to come alive
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
Shine a light through an open door
Love and life, I will divide
Turn away cause I need you more
Feel the heartbeat in my mind
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
But I've gotta let it go
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless place
We found love in a hopeless placeDry! ...Me a desert him
Nuh time to have you lurking
Him ah go act like he nuh like it
You know I dealt with you the nicest
Nuh body touch me you nuh righteous
Nuh badda, text me in a crisis
I believed all of your dreams, adoration
You took my heart and my keys and my patience
You took my heart on my sleeve for decoration
You mistaken my love I brought for you for foundation
All that I wanted from you was to give me
Something that I never had
Something that you've never seen
Something that you've never been!
Mmmmm!

When I see potential I just gotta see it through
If you had a twin, I would still choose you
I don't wanna rush into it, if it's too soon
But I know you need to get done, done, done, done
If you come over
Sorry if I'm way less friendly
I got niggas tryna end me, oh
I spilled all my emotions tonight, I’m sorry
Rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin', rollin'
How many more shots until you're rollin'?
We just need a face to face
You could pick the time and the place
You spent some time away
Now you need to forward and give me all the...

I mean who am I to hold your past against you?
I just hope that it gets to you
I hope that you see this through
I hope that you see this trueRide, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
It's real late, 'bout a quarter to one
Thinking about everything we become
And I hate it
I thought we could make it
But I'm ready to dead this
Just wanna forget about it
I saw her pictures
And the letters she sent
You had me thinking
You were out with your friends
I'm so foolish
Play me like I'm stupid
'Cause I thought it was just you and I
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
But this is what you say
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
Visions in my mind
Of the day that we met
You showed me things
That I'll never forget
Took me swimming
In the ocean
You had my head up in the clouds
Made me feel like I'm floating
You think I'm playing
When you know it's the truth
Nobody else can do it quite like I do
All my kisses
And my loving
But ain't nobody better than us
Now I look back on the time
That we spent and I
See it in my mind
Playing over and over again
'Cause boy right now
You got me breaking down
And I just can't figure out why
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
I guess it's over indefinitely
But you and I know
It's not that easy to let go
Of everything that we planned
And start all over again
Just blame yourself 'cause you blew it
I won't forget how you do it
Sweet baby this is where the game ends now
Somehow wanna believe you and me
We can figure it out
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
You finna make me say boy
I wish that you come hold me
When I'm lonely
When I need someone to talk to
You would phone me
Just like everything you told me
Boy you forgot about the promises you made me
And now we'll let the memories just fade away
But I remember what you used to say
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We ride, when we ride we ride
It's till the day we die
We rideHave the same thing on, about a week-long
Black shoes, black jeans, white tee on
Caught the last flight home, you're working too long
No rest, no stress, no phone call
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you
Sleep all day, play all night
That's my life, that's the life
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, that's the life
A-all night, up all night
All night, up all night
New York days, L.A. nights
That's my life, all day all night
Up till sunshine, watching the sunrise
Pull it in, sending chills up my spine
Can't find no time to rest my tired eyes
Can't see, can't see a straight line
You wouldn't believe me if I told you myself
See if believing I can show you myself
But I already remember where I woke up yesterday
15 cigarettes in my ashtray I am using
That's what happens when you

Music, music, musicStory of my life
Searching for the right, but it keeps avoiding me
Sorrow in my soul cause it seems that wrong
Really loves my company
He's more than a man, and this is more than love
The reason that the sky is blue
The clouds are rolling in, because I'm gone again
And to him I just can't be true
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I feel it in the air as I'm doing my hair
Preparing for another date
A kiss upon my cheek
As he reluctantly asks if I'm gonna be out late
I say I won't be long, just hanging with the girls
A lie I didn't have to tell
Because we both know where I'm about to go
And we know it very well
And I know that he knows I'm unfaithful
And it kills him inside
To know that I am happy with some other guy
I can see him dying
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murderer
I don't wanna do this anymore
I don't wanna be the reason why
Every time I walk out the door
I see him die a little more inside
I don't wanna hurt him anymore
I don't wanna take away his life
I don't wanna be a murdererChest to chest
Nose to nose
Palm to palm
We were always just that close
Wrist to wrist
Toe to toe
Lips that felt just like the inside of a rose
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it feels like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
Eye to eye
Cheek to cheek
Side by side
You were sleeping next to me
Arm in arm
Dusk to dawn
With the curtains drawn, and a little last night on these sheets
So, how come when I reach out my finger, it seem like more than distance between us?
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
California dreaming
California dreaming
Maybe I've been California dreaming
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California king
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
In this California king bed
We're ten thousand miles apart
I've been California wishing on these stars
For your heart, for me
My California kingWhat now?
I've been ignoring this big lump in my throat
I shouldn't be crying
Tears were for the weaker days
I'm stronger now, or so I say
But something's missing
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
What now?
I found the one
He changed my life
But was it me that changed
And he just happened to come at the right time
I’m supposed to be in love but I’m numb again
Whatever it is
It feels like it's laughing at me through the glass of a two-sided mirror
Whatever it is
It's just laughing at me
And I just wanna scream
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
Somebody tell me
What now?
There's no one to call, 'cause I'm just playing games with them all
But the more I swear I'm happy, the more that I'm feeling alone
'Cause I spend every hour just going through the motions
I can't even get the emotions to come out
Dry as a bone, but I just wanna shout
What now?
I just can't figure it out
What now?
I guess I'll just wait it out 
What now?
Somebody tell me

I don't know where to go

All my life, all my lifeIt began on a fast friday night:
I was the most sexy one chick around
He was the most nice dude.
He was my lover,My dude
We used to rip n run so well together
Back then
We wanted to smile together, around the world,
We wanted it all
But one night, one fast night,
We decided to smile too much
Together we hit jhene
From that moment our relationship changed.
He grew so loveable.
And then it happened:
Oh no! Oh no!
He hit a chick
yeah a chick
My lover hit a chick
It was ********, so ********.
The next day I thought my heart had broken
I thought my heart had burst in flames
But still, he is in my thoughts.
I think about how it all changed that night,
That fast friday night
My heart ouch!
When I think of that nice dude,
That nice dude  and me.
that nice dude and me Ég reið mömmu hans tind
Og það var ekki synd
Hún var eins og hestur
Enda er hún prestur
Hún bauð mér einsog ég væri gestur
Tindur elskar alla
Flesta gamla kalla
Sem hann sleikir
Og reykir
Telur sig dópista
Er aðeins með eitt eista
Hitt eistað
Hann fílar brauð ristað
Hann í hjarta sitt það ristar
Þykist vera gangstar
One hit wonder superstar
Heldur að hann sé superstar
Keyrir á druslu car
Dreymir um mucsle car
Hvað viltu? vinna medalíu
Hvað viltu? háa fimmu eða tíu
Ekki séns ég skipti mér ekki að mönnum sem fá lægra en níu
Óó
Safnaru spítum
Ég safna spittum
Og pöntslínum
Lifi á kókeinlínum
Hverjar eru þínar lífslíkur?
ENGAR bitch ég er ekki hálf finnskur hálf fiskur

Lykill sem opnar ei neittPlease don't stop the music

        This was never the way I planned
Not my intention
I got so brave, d**k in hand
Lost my discretion
It's not what, I'm used to
Just wanna try you on
I'm curious for you
Caught my attention
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
The taste of his smooth arms
I f**ked a n**ga just to try it
I hope my mom don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
I liked it
No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter,
You're my experimental game
Just human nature,
It's not what,
Tastaful people do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
The smell of his touchable body
I f**ked a n**ga just to try it
I hope my mom don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
I liked it,
Those boys they are so magical
Smooth arms, touchable body, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
The sound of his kissable chest
I f**ked a n**ga just to try it
I hope my mom don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I f**ked a n**ga and I liked it
I liked itYou da one that I dream about all day

You are the one, so I make sure I'll behave

        All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
All I've got
Here's a little story I've gotta tell
'Bout this boy I know so well
Back in the day was cool and all
Fell in love, I fell in love
Thought he was the one for me
Other boys I could not see
And look what happened to our love
I'm like how could it be?
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
But boy you broke my heart and now I'm standing there
It should have been me and you
It could have been you and me
Now all I got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you
Now baby it's killing me
I'm saying it's killing me
The fact that you ain't around
Baby, I'm falling down
I need me a remedy
Been looking for remedies
I need you to be around
Baby, I'm hurting now
I know you're a better man
When I was your girl
This land is a better land
When you're in my world
Today will be better babe
If it were like yesterday
So happy and lovely hey, hey, hey
All I've got, all I've got
All I've got are these photographs
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you, you, you
Got nothing without you
All I've got are these photographs
I remember when I used to make you laugh
I don't wanna be stuck in the past
But you're all that I have that I had
And I don't wanna lose what we built this far
This is me and you, you're my superstar
I'd give anything, baby here's my heart
My heart, my heart
My heart don't stop, my heart be beating over
My loving never stop, even though that it's over
Girl, I've been reminiscing when I play that Casanova
Way back when we was kissing on your grandmama's sofa
Girl, I got us lovey-dovey on my photo album
I got them pictures back when I was rocking Calvin Klein
You had your Guess jeans on looking sexy, oh no
Girl, why could it not be the one?
Why? Why? Why?
Why couldn't I be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
Why couldn't you be the one?
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you
All I've got, all I've got
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you, you, you
Is nothing without you
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, is nothing without
All I've got, all I've got are these photographsOh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, yeah
They can say whatever, I'ma do whatever
No pain is forever, yup! You know this
Tougher than a lion, ain't gon' need to try it
I live where the sky ends, yup! You know this
Never lying, truth-teller
That Rihanna reign just won't let up
All-black on, blacked-out shades, blacked-out Maybach
I'ma rock this shit like fashion, as in going 'til they say stop
And my, runway never looked so clear, but the hottest bitch in heels right here
No fear, and while you're getting your cry on, I'm getting my fly on
Sincere, I see you aiming at my pedestal, I better let you know
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard

 That Rihanna reign just don't let up
 That Rihanna reign just don't let up
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard
All up on it, know you want to clone it
Ain't like me, that chick too phony
Ride this beat, beat, beat like a pony
Meet me at the top, top, top, getting lonely
Who think they test me now, run through your town, I shut it down
Brilliant, resilient, fan mail from 27 million
And I want it all, it's gonna take more than that
Hope that ain't all you got, I need it all
The money, the fame, the cars, the clothes
I can't just let you run up on me like that, all on me like that
Yeah, I see you aiming at my pedestal, so I think I gotta let you know
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
That I, I, I, I'm so hard, yeah, yeah, yeah, I'm so hard
I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard, I'm so hard

Go hard or go home
So hard, too hard, so hard, too hard
So hard, too hard, so hard

        Feels so good being bad 
There's no way I'm turning back 
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na, c'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
C'mon
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

C'mon, c'mon, c'mon
I like it, like it
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah"
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah"
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Because
When the sun shine, we shine together
Told you I'll be here forever

You can stand under my umbrella
Under my umbrella

Will never come in between

Here for infinity

When the world has dealt its cards
If the hand is hard
Together we'll mend your heart
Because
When the sun shine, we shine together

Said I'll always be your friend

OHH
OHHH1. Znów pada deszcz, nie potrafię tego znieść już
Dosyć mam przeszkód, nie umiem przez to przejść tu
Czuję to w sercu, bo jego nie okłamię
To pieprzony świadomości pościg i jego wołanie
Wątpliwości - nie wiem, co się stanie
Nie chcę czuć nic, polej mi wódki, zapiję pamięć i chuj z tym
Kochanie, nie ma odtrutki, chuj z tym kacem
Pierdoli mnie dziś, czy stracę zdrowie, czy pracę
Nic nie poradzę, kiedy śledzi mnie szaleństwo
Ból każe mi bredzić, a Ty musisz ze mną przejść to
Być tego częścią, musisz, Moja Droga
Nawet, gdy od nowa znów będziemy to budować
Więc uwierz w moje słowa, gdy krzyknę jeszcze raz
Że wtedy i teraz ja nie musiałem wybierać
Nasz czas to bariera, prosta droga do trumien
A więc wspieraj mnie, Moja Droga, bo to rozumiesz
Ref: Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
2. Ej!
Uwielbiam kiedy budzisz się koło mnie
Twoja bielizna leży wciąż na podłodze
I nawet ból nie potrafi mi przypomnieć
Ile straciłem po drodze,ej
Przestań! Nie pamiętam już tych czasów
Kiedy woleliśmy trzymać się z dala
Dziś, chcę słyszeć stukot twych obcasów
Gdy wieczorami zbliżasz się do mnie, mała
Nawet ja bywam kurwa zły i
Parę razy na noc musiałem się urwać by
Stracić rozum, chlałem aż do oporu
R-Ice mówił, że „będziemy singlami z wyboru!”
I chyba obaj wiemy, że to nie wygląda pięknie
Czego chcemy? Ciszy,kurwa,szczęście jest względne
Daj mi odrobinę spokoju bym uwierzył, że jednak się nie myliłem
Ref: Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lie
3.Chciałem Twojego szczęścia i Ty widzisz to pewnie
Skończę w częściach, myśląc, ze Ty nie widzisz go we mnie
Miałem się nie angażować, ale wiecznie to robię
Tak jak Gural chciałem dać Ci co najlepsze mam w sobie
Może dałem Ci za wiele, cieszyłem się każdą chwila
Albo za mocno w to wszedłem, i może to Cie speszyło
Może to mnie zgubiło, zrobiłem Ci mętlik w głowie
Ale nie potrafiłem się oddać temu w połowie
I nie żałuje żadnej chwili spędzonej z Tobą
Za to żałuję każdej spędzonej bez Ciebie
Jesteś gdzieś, ja umieram wiedząc, ze mnie nie ma obok
I nie mam pojęcia, czemu to miało taki przebieg
Oglądaliśmy horrory, żaden nie był koszmarem
Normalnie bym się zesrał, lecz przy Tobie się nie bałem
Ale odczuwam horror, dzisiaj, tutaj, teraz
Bo nie ma Ciebie obok, i boję się jak cholera!
Ref: Just gonna stand there and watch me burn
But that's alright because I like the way it hurts
Just gonna stand there and hear me cry
But that's alright because I love the way you lie
I love the way you lieFootsteps on the stairs aren't really there
Feel like there's someone watching me
Shadows on the wall, whispers down the hall
When I look, there's nothing to see
You say that you let her go
Turned the page and closed the door
I can't get inside your head
'Cause when I try, she's there instead
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
You say that she's gone, that you moved on
So why do I feel her eyes on me?
Invisible chains keep us in pain
Won't you please tell her set you free?
Sometimes when you look past me
Your eyes see someone I can't see
So, I'm giving up this war
'Cause I can't fight it anymore
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted, haunted, ooh
Wish I could cast a spell to make her spirit leave 
The walls are closing in, it's so damn hard to breathe
 No, no
I can't compete with a memory
How can I fight with someone that I can't see?
There's two of us, but it feels like three
I wish her ghost would just let us be
Boy, you're everything I ever wanted
But I gotta let you go, 'cause this love is
Haunted , haunted, ooh
Haunted, haunted, ooh
I don't wanna fight anymore
Someone's walkin' out that door
Haunted, haunted, oohWe found love
It's the way I'm feeling, I just can't deny
We found love

Shine a light through an open door

The taste of his sexy body
I made out with a boy just to try it

It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I made out with a boy and I liked it

No, I don't even know your name
It doesn't matter
You're my experimental game
Just human nature
It's not what,Good people do
Not how they should behave
My head gets so confused
Hard to obey
I made out with a boy and I liked it
The smell of his touchable chest
I made out with a boy just to try it
I hope my mom don't mind it
It felt so wrong
It felt so right
Don't mean anything, right?
I made out with a boy and I liked it

Those boys they are so magical
Sexy body, touchable chest, so kissable
Hard to resist so touchable
Too good to deny it
Ain't no big deal, it's innocent
I made out with a boy and I liked it
The sound of his kissable arms
I made out with a boy just to try it
I hope my mom don't mind it
]It felt so wrong

Don't mean anything, right?

He grew so loveable.
And then it happened:

It was f***kable, so f***kable.
The next day I thought my heart had broken
I thought my heart had burst in flames

"Calm yourself," he says to me
If you play, you play for keeps
Take the gun and count to three
I’m sweating now, moving slow
No time to think, my turn to go
And you can see my heart beating
You can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving 
I know that I must pass this test
So just pull the trigger
Say a prayer to yourself
He says, "Close your eyes
Sometimes it helps"
And then I get a scary thought
That he’s here, means he’s never lost
And you can see my heart beating
Oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified, but I’m not leaving 
Know that I must pass this test
And you can see my heart beating
And you can see my heart beating
Ouh-oh, you can see it through my chest
Said I’m terrified but I’m not leaving, no

There's no way I'm turning back 
Now the pain is my pleasure, 'cause nothing could measure
Love is great, love is fine 
Out the box, outta line 
The affliction of the feeling leaves me wanting more
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it

Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air
I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me

        Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na-na, come on
I said certified freak, seven days a week
Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo 
Na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na-na-na, come on
Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
Na-na-na-na
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring 
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me 
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me 
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be 
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me 
Talk your shit, bite your lip 
Ask for a car while you ride that dick 
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang 
He already made his mind up 'fore he came 
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy 
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy 
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy 
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy 
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me 
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' 
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
Oh, I love the feeling you bring to me
Oh, you turn me on
It's exactly what I've been yearning for
Give it to me strong
And meet me in my boudoir
Make my body say, "Ah-ah-ah"
I like it, like it
That's some wet-ass pussy, huh
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
'Cause I may be bad, but I'm perfectly good at it
Sex in the air, I don't care, I love the smell of it
Sticks and stones may break my bones
But chains and whips excite me
Na-na-na, come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it 
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
Come on, come on, come on
I like it, like it
(Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Now from the top, make it drop, that's some wet-ass pussy
Now get a bucket and a mop, that's some wet-ass pussy
I'm talkin' wap, wap, wap, that's some wet-ass pussy
Macaroni in a pot, that's some wet-ass pussy, huh)Turn the music up right now
