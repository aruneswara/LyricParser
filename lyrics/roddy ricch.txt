I want a couple million without a record deal
Got 25 thousand on me, when I've been ridin' in a Phantom
Got all designer on me, bitch, I’m so fly it don't matter
I wanted to feel the V12 when I was ridin' in Atlanta
Been sippin' good shit all day, I'm damn near high as my Phantom
I got three bitches with me, they want the baguettes on their neck
Bitch, I was made inside the projects, I got Crip on my set
Nigga, I was really on the floor, then I woke up in a jet
Ain't never had to dodge no nigga, I just might cop Demon
I'm shoppin' at Neiman’s, ballin’ every season
Feelin' like I’m dreamin', shinin' every weekend
All they know is that I was broke, then I got a brand new coupe
Louis V's on my shoes, fuckin’ all my bitches by the twos
First time in V12, she was hangin' out the roof
My VVs ice cream, I ain't even have to scoop

Tennis chain, my neck on chill, I ain't have to go get no deal
Last month I spent a hundred thousand on the closet

Bitch, I'm ballin', 13 on me like I was Harden, yeah
Niggas know Ricchy, I'm lit, might take my ride through the 6

I'm a war baby, but I can't divorce the pavement
I'm a hood nigga that turned rich so I got Dior's latest
And you know I gotta stick to my roots, I still rock Jordans, baby 
It was hell in the projects, I survived the storm
Got brothers in the sky, they die 'fore they born
I know the worst conditions make a champion
Look at my ice, froze like a mannequin
I'm underwater like I'm swimmin' and panickin'
Body bags zipped up like a laminate
The only solution for the opps is to stay inside
How your niggas say they rock, but they don't slide?
'Cause we was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway 
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da 
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby 
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby 
Like the mob ties in Houston, we got rag ties
I pray the Lord forgive me the day that I got baptized
'Cause I'ma clutch the sticky every time a car passin' by
I don't wanna be Ricky or another victim to homicide
'Cause I know the soul never dies
I make the chrome-chrome fly
Bitch, I'm a wave, Roll Tide
Bullets at your face, Botox
My persona done got her tongue-tied
I was taught that a legend never dies
When it's time, gotta let the lead fly
'Cause I'm a war-war-war baby
Post-traumatic stress, I know the war changed me
Had to bend back but they could never break me
Had to slide
We was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da 
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby

'Member Pappy had the Mackie at the stop sign
Shit was too, too real
I got my Glock, and laid 'em down, nigga, you knew the deal
That's why I moved to the Hills, and I'm new to it

Got promethazine in my eyes, I'm cryin' purple tears
The streets left me cold-hearted, they hurt me still
Uh, and that's why I'm on tour, that's why my house a resort
That's why I got the four by four

Now I'm flyin' tall over the seven seas

I done got so high I might fall off the jet, woah
My AP got a skeleton, woah
And I still pull up in my section, woah

I wanna be here and I told my momma to pray for it
'Cause we was trappin' and baggin' down to make more

Sonic
I don't know why I keep sinnin', I do it without love
I'm just tryna find a baby
All these drugs inside my system, I don't know about love
I don't know the feelin', baby
I don't know, I don't know, I don't know
I just take it day by day 
Drivin' slow, I don't know where I'm goin'
I'm just tryna get home to my baby
You don't know about the feeling of havin' nobody
How you a shooter in your section and ain't got nobody?
When I was broke my main bitch left me for some Fendi
Once I got rich, she screamin' "Roddy, please forgive me"
All this pain inside my body, I lock myself inside the room
But I ain't cryin', I can't cry about it
If I ever said a bitch ain't made my heart cold
Nigga, I'd be lyin', but I can't lie about it
And you know winner, that's my slime, that's my slime 
I'ma die about it
Tryna get ready to go get the Rollie, when you buss it down, you holdin' down the town
Inside the Go Grizz
Icy, icy, icy, icy, icy
Icy, icy, icy, icy, icy
Left wrist look like a ice cube 
Right wrist, that bitch shine too 
Get your way whenever I slide through 
You so icy, baby, who you signed to? 
Ice you up and I ain't tryin' to 
Ice you up and I ain't tryin' to 
Ice you up and I ain't tryin'
Ice you up and I ain't tryin' to 
I put rocks all in the Richard Mille
One of the richest niggas in my city
Got twenty bad bitches, we gon' board on a jet
And I always keep the semi, can't afford the Patek, yeah
You want me to take you shoppin', don't you?
Want a gangster gangster rich nigga straight up out of Compton, don't you?
You gon' fuck me if I'm poppin', won't you?
You gon' call a couple of friends up and give me sloppy toppy, won't you?
She left her nigga for us, I was whippin' a foreign
Trapped a six in the morning, I got plenty warrants, woah, woah, woah
I got two chains on me like I'm Tity Boi
I got fifty on me, Rollie got baguettes, I'm a big boy
Left wrist look like a ice cube 
Right wrist, that bitch shine too 
Get your way whenever I slide through 
You so icy, baby, who you signed to? 
Ice you up and I ain't tryin' to 
Ice you up and I ain't tryin' to

That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
R.I.P. to Bankroll, Frenchie, all we wanted was the Louvre
Remember me and all my dawgs had to share the same clothes
That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
Air matts, suits with the Air Max sneaks
I've been movin' through the storms, I've been trappin' all week
But that's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me
I see my homies on the news again
Grannie told me, "Roddy, you gon' lose some friends"
Everyone knows I can't see the blues again
So I check my surroundings 'fore I move again
Late night lake, I ain't on my own
Two niggas watchin' for me, conference call on the phone
See, I just want to make it where I never need a loan
Ain't never had to hear the static on the telephone
A lot of niggas rap it, but I live it, dawg
Rather do the twenty-five, than be a victim, dawg
R.I.P. to Dopeboy and Keith, I really miss my dawgs
Please watch over Richy while I'm in the trenches, dawg
Apply the pressure then you know a nigga slide
Tried to kill Drew, so we had to ride
Niggas tried to plot on me but I ain't even mad
Either you know me for the music or you know me for a bag
Bust down, bust down, why these niggas hate?
'Cause I came from the bottom and I know these niggas hate
Now it's filet mignon and potatoes on the plate
My dawg really gone, he just waitin' on that date
Main bitch had gone, I said, "I be on the way"
Don't deal with it alone, I hit each and every way
'Cause you was with me runnin' the bank everyday
And she would go down if a nigga ask any day
A lot of times I ask why I go through it
But if you don't know the struggle, you won't know who you with
When my mom say, "Fuck the gang, get these racks and go legit
Go out and get the money, you ain't gotta be super Crip"
When I hop up out that money, McLaren, I'm super drip
New lane, never fond of a call, "Who's this?"
Took all of my dawgs to the mall, blew six
Nigga, you ain't know nothin', I've been on some new shit
R.I.P. to Bankroll, Frenchie, all we wanted was the Louvre
Remember me and all my dawgs had to share the same clothes
That's just how the streets raised me
That's just how the streets raised me

Walk up on a pussy nigga, shoot him dead in the chest

Rappin', made a name
Now I get paid for a stage, I keep a guitar with me

Bulletproof with a bar in it 
Go against it, it gon' be a hard ending 
I fucked and left, I hope it ain't no hard feelings 
Was broke as fuck, that's how I started drug dealin' 
Get some millions, it'll make a nigga love livin'

Heat makes him start burning like he was smoking a juul
Kick his ass out like a teacher at school 
Who been making all the hits 
Looking fresh with all the fits 
Rocking shit like its a jit 
Kicking shit like Jaden Smith 
I making a move then I'm counting up 
I'm constantly working I'm making me 
My work ethics perfect flipping these 
If a nigga is talking a bullet with take of his hat
I don't fuck with rats
I'm not here to chat
I'm here to get the new shoes
Here to spit you the truth
Here take chop a few dudes
Then take their girls to go screw
Not talking bout a remix
I swear I'm killing this remix
She lets a nigga come eat it
I gotta go get it
I flip it
I kill it
I'm in it
I'm in this for vengeance
'Cause these nigga tripping

I'm spitting and spilling all over this blank canvas

Feds pull me over, I ain't even have the work
Mom call my phone like, "You need to come to church"
I just pray to God, I don't ever see the dirt
Made that ass twerk , snakes on the bag and the shirt
Balmains on my ass and a skirt
Switched lanes, threw that ass, I ain't heard
Told my young nigga, "Go and get a bag," that ain't work
Planned it out, go and get it where it's at and disperse
Want to take a Benz on the road
Just in case I gotta drop a load
We was seven deep in the Sprinter van with the bag on me
You know I'm married to the bag, homie
Went out of state and got it on my lonely
I'm fightin' cases but I got it on me
I go to sleep with all my chains on

Feds pull me over, I ain't even have the work
Mom call my phone like, "You need to come to church"
I just pray to God, I don't ever see the dirt
In the Chevy coupe like '04 with the doors up
I'm a hood nigga, baby you ain't gotta put your nose up
Put you in Fendi slides, you can put your toes up
She gave me head in the Bahamas while I rolled up
Chillin' in the Maybach, we pulled up
Say my government name, I'm like, "Hold up"
Fell in love with the Gucci and the Prada
Big boy plates at Benihanas
Count a hundred racks, how you do that?
Pulled up in a Beamer, all black
Fuck 12, fuck a judge and a rat
He tried to run, put the shells in his back
I go to sleep with all my chains on
Rollie on me, sweatsuit and my J's on

Went to County from a bird stretch

I'm a war baby, but I can't divorce the pavement
I'm a hood nigga that turned rich so I got Dior's latest
And you know I gotta stick to my roots, I still rock Jordans, baby 
It was hell in the projects, I survived the storm
Got brothers in the sky, they die 'fore they born
I know the worst conditions make a champion
Look at my ice, froze like a mannequin
I'm underwater like I'm swimmin' and panickin'
Body bags zipped up like a laminate
The only solution for the opps is to stay inside
How your niggas say they rock, but they don't slide?
'Cause we was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway 
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da 
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby 
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby 
Like the mob ties in Houston, we got rag ties
I pray the Lord forgive me the day that I got baptized
'Cause I'ma clutch the sticky every time a car passin' by
I don't wanna be Ricky or another victim to homicide
'Cause I know the soul never dies
I make the chrome-chrome fly
Bitch, I'm a wave, Roll Tide
Bullets at your face, Botox
My persona done got her tongue-tied
I was taught that a legend never dies
When it's time, gotta let the lead fly
'Cause I'm a war-war-war baby
Post-traumatic stress, I know the war changed me
Had to bend back but they could never break me
Had to slide
We was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da 
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby 
Verse 3: Future:
Streets left me scarred, ain't no worries
Run my money up in a hurry
Thirteen strippers, James Harden
Money make you greedy when you starving
Monisha, Tamica, they vouching
Before I had anything, I was saucing
Before I had that Bentley truck, I was saucing
All these hitters, yeah, I pray you never cross them
These streets took all my soul from me
Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show
I know my niggas got love for me
And they filling up they nose
I know my Levi got love for me
She just want everybody to know
We was hoppin' out in broad day
Serving fiends in the hallway
Promethazine 'til the mornin'
Hope I don't wake up tomorrow
We was the type of niggas that would rob the robbers
I'ma make the choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da 
The choppa sing like la-di-da-da-da
Survived in the trenches, I'm a war baby
Had to slide on the sliders, that ain't normal, baby

Lost my nigga to a high speed chase, it's traumatising
I remember prayin' to God that I make it perfect timing
I got murder on my mind, cut these demons off
Cut these niggas off, cut these hoes off
If the rich man behind the door, she take her clothes off
Niggas try to ride the wave, this ain't Noah's Arc
I'm a self-made millionaire but I had a poor start
I was in the poor parts, ridin' with the blicky, blicky
I had to get my hands dirty, they got sticky, sticky
We tryna make the cornbread like it's Jiffy, Jiffy
My bitch got rose stones round her neck like she Nefertiti
Niggasas talkin' down on me, fuck the chatter
Realest niggas in the city, they mad at us
These niggas gon' politic on me just to get their status up
And I never needed a nigga, all I needed was my accomplishments
He ain't even pop the stick, lil' nigga why you poppin' shit?
Ballin' like I'm Scotty Pippen, the streets, I got lock on it
Found a wave and hopped on it
Down, ain't got no top on it
It feel good when you poppin', don't it?
These niggas can't be my opponents
I was sleepin' in the projects, going asleep to the sirens
Lost my nigga to a high speed chase, it's traumatising
I remember prayin' to God that I make it perfect timing

Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty
I been wakin' up to get the money, woah, woah
Got a bad bitch, her ass tatted, woah, woah
Givenchy to my toes, two twins, I'm fucking 'em both
I put her in a new AP, the water like a boat
I was down bad on my dick, where was you niggas at?
I know you turned your back on me just to get some racks
I seen you swerve back, 'cause I'm in the black 'Bach
New diamonds on me, fuck a flash, this ain't Snapchat
'Cause I been gettin' paid
Yellow diamonds on me look like lemonade
Got my baby mama that new Bentayga
Tryna get the dojo like a sensei, yeah
Rolls Royce umbrellas when I'm in the rain
I just mind my business
I got brothers that did the time, I ain't kiddin'
All these rappers just talk about it, I live it
Goin' up, I ain't got no sky limit, yeah, yeah, yeah
I put the new Forgis on the Jeep
I trap until the bloody bottoms is underneath
'Cause all my niggas got it out the streets
I keep a hundred racks inside my jeans
I remember hittin' the mall with the whole team
Now a nigga can't answer calls 'cause I'm ballin'
I was wakin' up, gettin' racks in the morning
I was broke, now I'm rich, these niggas salty*Lyrics from Snippets*
Let you know I'm missin' you

I'm into you and don't worry about what they say you do

        Lyrics from Snippets
Shawty wanna show me love, it was too fugazi, yeah
Now I can't feel the drugs, I can't even get lazy, yeah
How you lie to my face right in front of me?
I been blind to your slime, I don't even wanna see
Had to get my weight up, yeah, had to get my weight up, yeah
I can see the fake all on your face, hide behind the makeup, yeah
I don't wanna feel no more
But so, so far

        Sippin' on this codeine, my baddest bitch is on X pill
I want a couple million without a record deal
Got 25 thousand on me, when I've been ridin' in a Phantom Got all designer on me, bitch, I'm so fly it don't matter
I wanted to feel the V12 when I was ridin' in Atlanta
Been sippin' good shit all day, I'm damn near high as my Phantom
I got three bitches with me, they want the baguettes on their neck
Bitch, I was made inside the projects, I got Crip on my set
Nigga, I was really on the floor, then I woke up in a jet
Ain't never had to dodge no nigga, I just might cop Demon
I'm shoppin' at Neiman's, ballin' every season
Feelin' like I'm dreamin', shinin' every weekend
All they know is that I was broke, then I got a brand new coupe
Louis V's on my shoes, fuckin' all my bitches by the twos
First time in V12, she was hangin' out the roof
My VVs ice cream, I ain't even have to scoop
Got the whole universe in my ceilin', I'ma set the mood
