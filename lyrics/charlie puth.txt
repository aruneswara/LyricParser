Didn‚Äôt care if the explosion ruined me
Baby, I loved you dangerously
Mmm, mmm

Usually I hold the power with both my hands tied behind my back
Look at how things changed

Why are we looking down
On our sisters and brothers?
Isn't love, all that we got?
Don't we know everyone's
Got a father and mother?
The day we know we're all the same
Together we can make that change
Look around, there are too many of us crying
And not enough love to go around
What a waste, another day
Another good one dying
But I know that the world will change
The day we know we're all the same
Why can‚Äôt we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
Why can‚Äôt we just get along?
What a waste it would be to deny somebody
Of a chance to be theirselves
What a waste it would be if we hurt for nothing?
But I know that the world can change
The day we know we're all the same
Why can‚Äôt we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to each other?
We gotta make that change, yeah
I know we could break apart
We don‚Äôt have to go that way
Not today
Why can‚Äôt we just get along?
If loving one another's wrong
Then how are we supposed to
Get close to yeah
Why can‚Äôt we just get along?

If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo 
More than a friend zone 
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock
The moment she walks out that door 
I'm not pretending anymore
If your mother knew all of the things that we do 
If your mother knew 
All the things we do 
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew  all the things we do
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me 
If your mother only knew 
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore
If your mother knew all of the things that we do

NoI got a situation, this girl been stressin' me
Sayin' she better be the only one
My life is complicated, she's only 23
I'm not the guy that she's supposed to love
Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over
The harder she makes it to go
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work
The faster she takes off her clothes
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I'm not tryna fall for you
Girl, you gotta slow it down 
I can't give it all to you
Even though I want to
She knows just what she doin', she fuckin' with my head
Wrappin' her legs so tight around my waist
Two in the afternoon, but, we still ain't out of bed
No matter what, she always gets her way
Oh, the more that I tell her I'm not stayin' over 
The harder she makes it to go 
Oh, the more that I try to convince her this won't work 
The faster she takes off her clothes

Oh, you gotta slow it down, yeah, yeahI was just with you on your birthday
And I met your whole family
But on the way home
You kept looking at your phone
Couldn't help but ask, "Who is that, babe?"
And the way you said, "Nobody"
I knew the rumors
They were more than just rumors
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
Somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him
Now you're tryna tell me that he's only a friend
Can't believe I believed it
You were my girl
Lately you've been making excuses
And the stories ain't adding up
But I just go blind when you look into my eyes
Every time that I try to confront you 
There's always somewhere you gotta run to 
The warning signs
They were more than just warning signs
Maybe I should have noticed
You were just half in love 
Maybe I should have noticed
That I'm not the only one
'Cause somebody told me that you
Got another lover you've been giving it to
Can't believe I believed you
You were my girl
Somebody saw you with him

Late night when you need my love
Call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
I know when that hotline bling
That can only mean one thing
Ever since I left the city you
Got a reputation for yourself now
Everybody knows and I feel left out
Girl you got me down, you got me stressed out
Cause ever since I left the city, you
Started wearing less and goin' out more
Glasses of champagne out on the dance floor
Hangin' with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone
Late night when you need my love

You and me we just don't get along
You make me feel like I did you wrong
Going places where you don't belong
Ever since I left the city, you
You got exactly what you asked for
Running out of pages on your passport
Hanging with some girls I've never seen before
You used to call me on my cell phone

The kind that made me question my faith
Now I'm looking back just wondering where the time has gone
But I guess it's just the price you pay
I've already loved more than I thought I could love someone
I've already felt my heart break 
I've already fell so many times, but I got back up
But at least I did it all my way
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
Growing up in this wild city, you had to fight or run
Now you know why I'm not afraid, yeah
Maybe it's my recklessness that got me in trouble
But at least I did it all my way
I've been through it all
Yeah, I've been through it all
Yeah, you won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it all
Ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh, ooh-ooh

God only knows, I've been through it all
You won't see me crying if tomorrow never comes
God only knows, I've been through it allWhen I'm old and grown
I won't sleep alone 
Every single moment will be faded into you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
And I won't sing the blues
'Cause all I need is you 
Every single question will be answered all by you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
When we're old and gray 
And our faces changed 
There won't be a moment when my heart don't feel the same
That's some type of love
That's some type of love 
And every story ends
But we could still pretend 
Every single moment will be just as we had planned
It was some type of love
That's some type of love
When the world's on fire
We won't even move
There is no reason if I'm here with you
And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of love
I'll be with you
Give me to you, baby

And when it's said and done
I'll give me to you
That's some type of love
That's some type of loveTell me lies, like how you're better off without me
While the truth is written all over your face
Even in photographs together, you look lonely, lonely
When you were here, you never had to fake
And girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know
Does it feel, feel like you never gon' find nothing better?
Does it feel, feel like you're missing, 'cause I loved you different?
And the way that you can say you don't remember
How I kept you coming over every night
And the way that you can say you never wondered, wondered
If loving someone else is just a lie
Whoa, girl, I promise I'm not gonna bother you anymore
Soon as you hang up the phone
I just got one question that you might not be ready for
But I really gotta know

Another shot of Hennessy
I try so hard not to
Act like a dick when I'm 'round your friends
Mood swings up and down again
Hollywood Hills where we play pretend
No one happy, but they're good at fakin' it
Pop up in the party, show face tonight

I thought money was enough, it's just a temporary rush
I'll try to go find some other high
Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
But I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road
So much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind

I'm sorry that I'm not there to give you what you want
I'll think about us some other time
And I'm sorry that I can't be the perfect type of man
I'll think about us some other time
Don't know why I wanna make it even harder
I'm not the kind of man to take the easy road
I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind
I'm run, yeah, I'm run, yeah
I'm run, yeah, like my mind
I got so much to do and not enough time
Not enough time, oh I got
So much to lose, I'm losing my mind
I'm losing my mind, oh my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind
Nothing to lose, nothing to lose
I'm losing my mind, I'm losing my mind, oh my mindThinkin' back in time when I had you to lose
Those were the days, baby, you were the truth
And nothing you could do will ever change that
You riding with me, me riding for you
We followed our hearts, girl, forget what they do
But somewhere down the line, I left you hanging
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I‚Äôll never break your heart again
'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are
You know me like inside and out, how I feel
Nothing, more nothing less, you‚Äôre the real
I wanna take this time to thank you, baby
For you, I could climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Oh my friend
I‚Äôll never break your heart again
'Cause I, I will always love you
Baby, I could never judge you
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you 
Baby, I could never judge you 
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, are
So let it be known now
The queen on my throne now
It‚Äôs you at all times
I‚Äôll never reject you
I‚Äôll love and respect you
'Cause you‚Äôre my lifeline
Only thing on my wish list
You love and forgiveness
For that, I will climb
Mount Kilimanjaro a thousand times
Why would I fight it?
I know that it‚Äôs right when you‚Äôre holding my hand
I knew when I saw you
That God was just giving me a second chance
I‚Äôll climb every mountain
And scream at the top of my lungs that I‚Äôm yours
You know that I‚Äôm yours
'Cause I, I will always love you 
Baby, I could never judge you 
I would take you as you are, are, are, are, are
I, I will always love you 
Baby, I could never judge you
I'll take you as you are, are, are, are, areMmm, mmm, mmm
Somebody said they saw you
The person you were kissing wasn't me
And I would never ask you
I just keep it to myself
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
I think about it when I hold you
When looking in your eyes, I can't believe
I don't need to know the truth
Baby, keep it to yourself
I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
And if you're creeping please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Did he touch you better than me?
Did he watch you fall asleep?
Did he show you all the things that you used to do to me?
Then you're better off that way
Baby, all that I can say
If you're gonna do your thing
Baby, don't come back to me
Oh, oooh, oh
Baby don't come back to me, yeah
Oh, oooh, oh
No I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
'Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
If you're playing me, keep it on the low
Cause my heart can't take it anymore
If you're creeping, please don't let it show
Oh, baby, I don't wanna know
Oooh, ooooh, oooohWell, I get a thrill from down my spine
When I see you hittin' me up
Feelin' so electrified
Like the heat of a million suns
You know just one touch can keep me high
And I think I'll never come down
'Til a couple days go by
And you're nowhere to be found
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
So I tried to shake you out my head
Tried to dance with somebody new
But you got those lips so red
And that smokey voice you do
So I know it's pointless anyway
'Cause there ain't nobody else
That could light me up so bright
And break this crazy spell
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry
If I wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll come back around
Wait a little longer
Then maybe you'll be ready now
'Cause I would wait forever
For you to fall back into my arms
So come on
Up all night
Up all night
All the things that you said to me yesterday
Playin' over in my mind
It's a crime
It's a crime
How you're reelin' me in with the games you play
Then you hang me out to dry

Then you hang me out to dryOhh, ooh

But they don't really understand the masterpiece I've found
Those girls be wonderin' why I haven't been around
And if they haven't figured out, I bet they hear me now
There's no words to express

So...
Smile when you're talking to me
I don't wanna know your real pain
Long nights, I don't know your real name
Soft kiss when the yellow cab came
Til the next time when the sun fall
And my thoughts roam and the love calls
For your soft tone and your sweet talk
And your dial tone when you're not bothered
Hoping feelings never get brought up
Conversation never get broad
Still blind by the street lights
Never gonna let another man cross
Yes, I understand
Baby, loosen up your pants
Staring at me from your knees
Birds and the fucking bees
I'm just a sucker for a cold-hearted lover
You make me suffer, you make me suffer
Don't keep me waiting
You should come over
Don't make me suffer, don't make me sufferWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't love anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore, like we used to do
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight the way I did before
I overdosed

Will you promise me I'll always have a kingdom?
'Cause I, I have it all
But you're taking everything I ever dreamed of
Oh, woah
I'm scared of you now
For putting me through this hell
Saying
Oh, woah
I'm feeling the doubt
A feeling I know too well
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'm gonna end up losing everything
If I don't
Breathe a little
Then I'll end up being my own worst enemy
If, I had a choice
I suppose I'd have to do it all over
'Cause when, I hear your voice
Part of me just wants to be a little closer

Or just let you go?

When he says you're beautiful
Or is he full of shit?
How many times would
He say goodbye?
All he ever seems to do is make you cry
Do you still think of me
Every single day?
Cause our life was comfortable in every way
There's no place that I'd rather be

You're taking off your blouse and I'm watching you
In front of your mirror, you turn the curtain down
I couldn't be any clearer what we're gonna do now
I wanna see you riding and grinding and
We're gonna get it right we're colliding
We're gonna have to keep quiet tryna keep it down
You're tearing off my shirt for another go round
For another go round
For another go round
I gotta have you now, just can't take it
I wanna put you down when we're faded
And at the top of your lungs, you'll be screaming my name
And we've gone too far to go the other way
I'll pick you up and lay you on the kitchen counter
Said you couldn't do without it, I'm okay if you're about it
Down in every direction, got me hypnotized
I'm hallucinating, going out of my mind
For another go round
For another go round
For another go round
It's like every other evening, let me see what you can do
Yeah, I got all this paper, let me throw it all on you
For another go round
For another go round
For another go roundStole my heart and I fell for you
Always knew I'd come back for you
Time with you is not wasted time

But they can‚Äôt turn your bright star dark
They'll try to hold your spirit down
Couldn't do it then, can't do it now
They'll try to tell you who to be
But they can't change the way you feel
Can't tame a wild heart
You are free, free
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free , free 
They'll try to tell you where to go
Try to put chains around your soul
But they could never hold you back
'Cause you w–µre built too strong for that
Can't tame a wild heart
Free as th–µ grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free 
Oh, no one's ever putting out that fire inside
Feelin' free's the only way you feel alive
With the wind at your back, running fast and free
Free as the grass that's right under your feet
Free as the sky underneath your wings
Free as the wind and the river flowin' to the sea
Free as the feelin' they can't take from you
No walls can keep your heart from your dream
Free as just knowing that you were born to
To be free, yeah , free, yeah 
Free, free, free
Oh, freeThis goes out to the most beautiful girl that I saw just the other day
She had me slipping and she had me falling for her right away
This goes out to the one and only Miss Mysterious
The thought of being next to her has got me so delirious
Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?
Yeah, is she out there?
'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way
Girl you got me love sick and
Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever feel the same?
Never been acquainted
I just need to know your name
Girl I just need to know your name
Before I saw your face I never in my wildest dreams
Thought that true love was actually real
'Cause you shine way brighter
Than anything I might have ever thought that I could feel
I give it all everything I have even though it's all so new
'Cause I want you in the worst of ways
Can you make my wish come true?
Yeah, is she out there?
Is she out there?
Just tell me if you're out there, if you're out there
'Cause you're all that I need
In every single way
Girl you got me love sick and
Your beauty is to blame
If you knew how I felt
Could you ever feel the same?

Don‚Äôt listen to what people say ‚Äòbout me and you
‚ÄòCause they just don‚Äôt know anything ‚Äòbout what we do
Baby we‚Äôre the ones they‚Äôre all jealous of
Don‚Äôt listen to them
‚ÄòCause right now baby, it‚Äôs just me and you
Yeah, me and youI should have told you how I really feel
A little in advance
Then I would‚Äôve had some time to go and work it out
I think I‚Äôve lost my chance
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you‚Äôd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face
Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you‚Äôd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn‚Äôt say it first
I‚Äôm done playing these games
I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm about to say
I won‚Äôt tell you goodbye with my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mind
No, no more nights
Drink until my loneliness
Up till two A.M
No, no more waiting
Pacing 'round the bar
Hoping that you might walk in
For the last three years I just hid it so well
Hoping that you‚Äôd figure it out because I never could tell it
Straight to your face
Never have I ever woken up in a cold hard sweat
From a dream wondering
If you‚Äôd ever say "goodbye"
If I didn‚Äôt say it first

Ooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooooh
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
I‚Äôm done playing these games
I can‚Äôt believe what I‚Äôm about to say
'Cause I would rather die than feeling this inside
Tricks played on my mind
No, I would rather die than just tell you goodbye
With my love left behind
Kiss me before I fucking lose my mindCharlie
You know what it is
When you hear that, heh!
Montana
I'll admit, I was wrong, what else can I say, girl?
Can't you blame my head and not my heart?
I was drunk, I was gone, that don't make it right, but
Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies
Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, baby
Ooo-oh 
Ooo-oh 
Oooh-ooh-oh
I'll admit, it's my fault, but you gotta believe me
When I say it only happened once, mmm
I try, and I try, but you'll never see that
You're the only one I wanna love, oh, yeah
She said "Boy, tell me honestly"
"Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies"
"Baby, I just gotta know"
How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me

Ayy, Montana
P-p-pull up to the club in four Lambos
Shorty tryin' to rip off the door handle
If you ain't known that, you know now
Shorty Olivia when it come to scandals
T-top down, t-top down
Fell in love with the pennys in the top down
Shorty tryin' to creep and I can't stand it
Creep, creepin' through the window like what man
Talking to herself goin' crazy
French vanilla got us both going crazy
I-I don't know what you thought
I don't wanna hear I'm sorry, my fault
How long has this been goin' on?
Montana
How long has this been goin' on?
And you' been creepin' 'round on me

You've been actin' so shady
I've been feelin' it lately, babyCan't wait for this to be, this to be
This to be over
Cause I-I can't take‚ÄÖone‚ÄÖmore day
Can't wait‚ÄÖfor this to be, this to‚ÄÖbe

I'm losing faith and my-y patience
Oh oh‚Åüwoah

Oh oh woah
No no no no no no no no noAll of you
You could do so much better
What you got now it's not enough
But you
Let it go to your head now
Hope no one have calls your bluff
Every single word that I hear you saying
It's just another lie to cover up your feeling, baby
It's got to be worst so don't walk out the door
I know just what you been missing
Let me love you so right
Girl, your body I can ignore
We'll be running with the night
Like it's 1984
Oh you
Wish you would give me something
You would've leave me with nothing at all
But you
Leaning right on the edge now
Knowing that I'm there to break your fall
Every single word that I hear you saying
It's just another lie to cover up your feeling, baby
It's got to be worst so don't walk out the door
I know just what you been missing, yeah
Let me love you so right
Girl, your body I can ignore
We'll be running with the night
Like it's 1984
Queen of a castle
Destined to catch her fall
Seems like a dead game
Before she was born at allThe stone thrown at your window
It's telling you to get up and get up and go
And to climb down the shakers of your house
To the back of my Chevy and no one will ever know
We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if we can't find one backseat's gonna be our bed
Oh Melanie I don't believe
When you tell me that
You're seventeen and proud
'Cause you said it so loud
It's not right to hold you through the night
You put up no fight when I put words in your mouth
Oooh, yeah
We drive around November with one light out
They try to pull us over go right ahead
We'll still drive around to find a place to sleep at
And if we can't find one backseat's gonna be our bed
She ripped off the grass and threw it on my face
I pushed her over laughing right away
She said the moonlight makes the windows in your eyes
Kiss her inside out with no goodbye, bye
I remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
It's not right but oh I can't fight it anymore
Do you remember waking up in the middle of the night
On the brick shear highway
Oh it's not right yeah
I can't fight it anymore
I can't fight
I can't fight it anymoreLyrics from Snippet
I feel like my heart is bleeding
Can't make up my mind
Tell myself
But now‚Äôs‚ÄÖnot‚ÄÖa good time
I‚ÄÖknow  'till I give it‚ÄÖone more 
I won't need you
But, now‚Äôs not a good....
Lately, I've been thinking 'bout if you're worth it
Or do I just stay and play the game
Because ninety-nine percent of the time I'm hurting
The other one makes it go away
This toxic love, we've been going through
Like deja vu
But 
I feel like my heart is bleeding
Can't make up my mind
I know
The deep Okay
This is a song about how I used to get really scared around girls
And it goes like this

Won't you please let me
Back to your heart?
Won't you please let me 
Back to your heart 
'04, seventh grade
High top Adidas and I thought I had game
But it turns out that I didn't and I learned the hard way
When I walked up to this girly and I asked her "What's your name?"
She said "Don't, stop! Why are you talking to me?
You're the new kid in town and you look like you're three
And it's easy to see by your pale-ass skin
That you're always home alone, McCauley Caulkin"
I need consultin' for all of my fears
'Cause I didn't have another girl for four more years
And they gave me every one of their gracing chances
Paid no attention to all their advances
But freshman in college I found my first love
And I took her out to dinner and I thanked the gods above
But when she went to give me a kiss had a pain in my stomach
Too much food, had to vomit

Won't you please let me
Back to your heart
Won't you please let me 
Back to your heart
Mike Ballz did it, oh!
Oh damn
These girls all assessing me
In a line-up, but they ain't selecting me
I'm too obedient and missing one ingredient
I need a little L-O-V-E up in this recipe 
But they say "nice guys finish last"
So I gotta be an ass if I win my class
Nah, nope, I just can't do it
Maybe they'll be feeling me now I that make some music
Maybe not, I'll go right till I'm famous
Flaunt all of my swag, I'll snag me at A-list
Hey, Taylor Swift, are you feeling this?
Give a rapper a chance
Somebody make sure that she's hearing this
But I'm for real, shit, I just need a chance
Seventh grade girls were laughing at me when I ripped my pants
I'm no Brad Pitt or George Clooney
But I'm a real dude that can make your life feel like a movie

Won't you please let me 
Back to your heart 
Won't you please let me
Ladies, this your chance
Put up your hands
Wave 'em side to side
Let's ride
Yeah
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Mike Ballz, baby
It's Charlie Puth, baby
It's Mike Ballz, and Charlie Puth 
We're chilling up in that booth
But it's not really a booth
'Cause it's just in his living room
It's right next to the kitchen
Yo, Charlie, what you dishing?
Do you watch the dishes 
'Cause you got some dishes in your sink
That sucks
Wash your dishes, son
Boom!Well I‚Äôm crying and I‚Äôm dying
‚ÄôCause I really thought that you would be the one
And I tried to stand beside you
But it was over way before it had begun
I like to think it‚Äôs all okay
And one day you‚Äôll come back and stay with me
Come and stay with me
But now you‚Äôre gone 
And I don‚Äôt know if I can carry on 
I don‚Äôt wanna hear no love songs
And I don‚Äôt wanna see you at all
‚ÄôCause I can‚Äôt afford to have my heart break again
I just thought that maybe you‚Äôd change
But you‚Äôre still the same, the same, the same
As you were back then
I‚Äôve had enough 
Enough of you 
And I won‚Äôt let you break my heart again
Lately, every day now
I go to bed and sleep my life away till four
‚ÄôCause I don‚Äôt know 
What it feels like 
To not wake up and run a mile right to your door
You‚Äôre still gone
And I don‚Äôt know if I can carry on 
I don‚Äôt wanna hear no love songs
And I don‚Äôt wanna see you at all
‚ÄôCause I can‚Äôt afford to have my heart break again
I just thought that maybe you‚Äôd change
But you‚Äôre still the same, the same, the same
As you were back then
I‚Äôve had enough 
Enough of you 
And I won‚Äôt let you break my heart again
Why you gotta break my heart again?
And I can‚Äôt keep holding on 
I don't wanna hear no love songs
And I don‚Äôt wanna see you at all
‚ÄôCause my heart‚Äôs gonna break again
I‚Äôve had enough 
Gave it my all 
Just thought you changed 
But I was wrong
And now that you‚Äôre gone 
You can‚Äôt break my heart again, again
Can‚Äôt break my heart againWhat am I supposed to say?
I wanna look you in the eyes and tell you‚ÄÖit's‚ÄÖokay
But I can't,‚ÄÖit hurts to know
At the end‚ÄÖof the day, all I can do is hope
Hope to my core
'Cause I don't know anymore
Thought that heroes don't fall out the sky
That was before you got sick
Before you found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now
Every night, every day
You were fighting but you never showed it on your face
I don't know, what I would do
Baby, I would be so lost if I ever lost you
Oh, in my dreams
There I used to see
From a distance, I'd watch you fly
That was before you got sick
Before you found out
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
Let me take your place right now
I wanna hold all of your tears
And use them all to wash away the hurt
I wanna save you from your fears
Just to get you back the way you were
Before you got sick
Before when everything was perfect
But now it's all upside down
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right now
Oh, if God could grant me one wish for today
I would take your pain
I would take your place right nowMh, who knew it
I'd have to see you as a threat
Now I just wanna see you less
MTV, I'll be on the Next, uh
Yeah, I ain't try to place no blame, ooh

She said we'd be better off friends
Now that would make no sense, mhmm

Maybe I'm tellin' myself that
But there ain't nothin' that'll change that
What good would it be, if I knew how you felt about me?
It could've been right but I was wrong
Only think 'bout you when I'm alone
Part of me that cared inside it's gone
And I know, that I can't, get caught up
We could've been
And we tried to pretend
Every now and again
We don't dream about, don't think about what
We could've been
Though I'm holding it in
'Cause I know in the end
You dream about, I think about what
We could've been
We could've been
We could've, damn I‚Äôm facing the bottle

 Oh these instagram models

She‚Äôs leading me on the round
That‚Äôs perfect but closing down
I‚Äôm crying day you gone
Ain't taking it no more
Ain't taking it no more
She‚Äôs so good at playing cards
But the minute she brings you joy
She‚Äôs showing you the door
Ain't taking it no more

She‚Äôs situated on her roof
Now so tired of waiting her turn
And I ain't tryna go home
Can't take this no more
Ain't taking it no more
And I never believed it would actually happen
Your body's so tempting, my sweetest distraction
Lets get down on the floor
Can‚Äôt take this no more
Can‚Äôt take this no more

Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, heyMy baby left me yesterday
Packed her bags and went away, yeah
High heels on the carpet
Took my keys and craved her name into my car seat
And that's the last one I let push me around
I said it before but I mean it now, eh
Get me out this city
I just need to clear my mind
We left this evening
Give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, off
When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all
We'll have it all
One shot, one shot for my sorrows, oh yeah
Power up the white noise, maybe I'll forget her deep into the morning
And right inside this yellow house
I'm reading CDs on the couch
But it's better than being stranded
Nothing but myself, my studio apartment
We left this evening
Give 'em twenty dollars for some gas in Boston
Grab a bite but now we're taking off, we're taking off, off
When we got to Melrose, fifteen nights of April
We just drank our sorrows, talked about the day we'll have it all
We'll have it all
I don't think I'm sleeping tonight
Something 'bout my stomach doesn't feel right
What you left in my chest on the left side
Where your head-- nah, fuck it
Time to take a drive
Night skies got me feeling like Bruce Wayne
'Cept all I got is a pocket of loose change
Head and heart got me thinking that I'm too strange
Well maybe I'm different
Word to two chains, two lanes
Drift grip the wood crane
Lookin' at the exit signs, but it's your name 
On some purple rain shit, feelin' like Prince
Gotta go and change my name chiz, same shit, ain't it?
Yeah, I know I don't seem complacent
Got enough on my chest but my heart's still vacant
And I can't take it
My love is unreciprocated
I've been through enough without ever gettin' the payment
But it's harder to heal than it is to endure
There's only so much that the liquor can cure
And all that liquor that's poured gave you a head of a tornado
Of every memory that had you trippin' before
All that Christian Dior denim, Louis Vuitton leather
Led 'em a late night, safe flight and good weather
Ain't enough to make me feel better
Ain't enough to make me forget all those nights in early December
I think I was dreamin'
But now I know I ain't been sleepin'
And some of these days, these feelings stoppin' me from eating
The pit of my stomach is heavy
I guess that's how it feels when you start to forget me
I apologize for not caring for myself
I've never known anything else than putting myself after everyone else
And that fucks me up, it's true
These late nights really are new
And there's so little I can do besides drive
Lay awake think about where you lay in the night
And fantasize about us living life in paradise
In a warm place where we never really have to die
But life ain't kind, we can't live fantasy
I just need to hear that you're maintaining sanity
Cuz it's more important to me that you're doing alright
Than the fact that I'm not sleepin' tonightIt's 10 p.m. and I am missin'
My seventh song for December 2nd
My mind's gone blank
I cannot think clear
About the lyrics
For this damn song here
How do people have the attention span
To go and do this?
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits
It's 12 A.M. and I am so screwed
Looking up at people falling on YouTube
Getting so bored to the highest degree
This must be so easy for Kenny G
How do people have the attention span
To go and do this?
Two hours in this chair
I might as well call it quits
Another sappy love song
My listeners will be pissed
I would seriously pay someone
Right now to go and help me with this
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics
I suck
At writing lyrics
How do people have enough
Motivation to go and do this?
Feels like a day in this chair
And I haven't written down shit
Feel like I'm running out of ideas
For all these pieces
And every time I try to get done
Procrastination increases
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
This is the chorus line
Da-da-da-da-da-da-da
I guess no lyrics here sounds fine
As long as I have a catchy melody
And some nice chord changes
So you won't see that
I suck at writing lyrics 
I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
 
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble
 
Nothing but trouble
 
Nothing but trouble
 
I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble
Nothing but trouble
 
I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
 
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble
 
Nothing but trouble
 
I'm facing the bottle
For all of my problems
These Instagram models
Are nothing but trouble
 
She's going away now
I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models
I said they're nothing but trouble
 
 Picture perfect memories
Scattered all around the floor
And I reaching for the phone 'cause
I can't fight it anymore
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
Another shot of whisky
Can't stop looking at the door
And I was wishing you'd come sweeping
In the way you did before
And I wonder if I ever cross your mind
For me it happens all the time
It's a quarter after one
I'm a little drunk
And I need you now
Said I wouldn't call
But I lost all control and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
  
Yes, I'd rather hurt than feel nothing at all
It's a quarter after one
I'm all alone and I need you now
And I said I wouldn't call
But I'm a little drunk and I need you now
And I don't know how I can do without
I just need you now
I just need you now
Oh, baby I need you now
    Where you think to go now, sexy lady?
You make it so damn hard to leave
Love the way you've been doing it lately, ooh
Love the way you back it up on me
Ey
Your body's craving the attention, no disrespect to you
I really wanna ditch, let's get together
So we can take a little rendezvous
Eh
She said
You know where to find me hey
You know where to find me work work
You know where to find me
Wanna see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Tryna do a little less conversation
Tryna cut right to the chase
Oh
This big beat bumping 808 drum
Tonight we're goin all the way
Oh
Your body's craving the attention, no disrespect to you
Ohhh
I really wanna ditch let's get together, hey
So we can take a little rendezvous
Eh
She said
You know where to find me hey
You know where to find me work work
You know where to find me
Wanna see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
Let me see you drop it, drop it low like they did it in the 90's
You know where to find me

You know where to find me...Lyrics available upon release. Stay tuned!I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble
They're nothing but trouble
These Instagram models, they're nothing but trouble
You got the world thinking you're a star
But you, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girl
I'm facing the bottle for all of my problems
These Instagram models are nothing but trouble
She's going away now, I'm going full throttle
All these Instagram models, I said they're nothing but trouble
They're nothing but trouble
These Instagram models, they're nothing but trouble
You got the world thinking you're a star
But you, you're not who you say you are
I'm dying, dying, dying, girlWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
If you're looking into her eyes
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymoreMatthew says to bring it back
The five dollar footlong
Better choice for Matthew
It's back
Sandwich emojiGirl sitting right down here
Where it's not so crowded
He sees you looking but he's not doing anything about it
Baby you're looking
In the wrong direction
'Cause this friction between us
Is just straight perfection
Oooh oooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Oooh oooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we-we-we-we were in the dark  woah
If we-we were in the daaark
Daaark
We were in the dark
Dark-dark-dark-dark
She's spending every other night alone
'Cause all them other guys are blowing up her phone
But she really doesn't know
How good it could be
If she rearranged her plans
And made them with me
I'm not into pressing by butt?
But your sexy little body has got me stuck
And I know there's something that I miss
But before I go on, let me tell you this
Oooh oooh
We don't have the time
Just put your lips on mine, fine lady
Oooh oooh
Don't you be going very far
Just think of all the crazy little things up in your mind that we'd be doing this minute
If we were in the dark
If we-we-we-we were in the dark  woah

Ooh, yeah baby
Wanna have you to myself

We-we-we-we were in the darkSo I heard you found somebody else
And at first, I thought it was a lie
I took all my things that make sounds
The rest I can do without
1, 2, 3....
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
C'mon baby
This ain't the last time that I'll see your face
C'mon baby
You said you'd find someone to take my place, place, place
Oh, I just don't believe that you have got it in you
'Cause we are just gonna keep "doin' it" and every time
I start to believe in anything you're saying
I'm reminded that I should be gettin' over it
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else, yeah
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
F... that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause we're never alone
Get someone you love?
Get someone you need?
F... that, get money
I can't give you my soul, 'cause
I don't want your body
But I hate to think about you with somebody else
Our love has gone cold
You're intertwining your soul with somebody else
I'm looking through you
While you're looking through your phone
And then leaving with somebody else
No, I don't want your body
But I'm picturing your body with somebody else
Oh
Somebody else
Somebody else
OohI said this time next year
I'ma be the one who do
Everything and more you said
I couldn't do
This one is for you
This time next year
I'm gonna be stronger
A little bit taller
Top is my only view
I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
'Cause this time next year
I'ma walk down these halls
And show my face for the world to see
Gonna see me
And I'ma call every girl that turned me down
And tell 'em now that
I'm just too busy
'Cause I don't have the time
And it's funny how my so-called friends
Who've always left me alone
Are suddenly running into me
And blowin' up my phone
I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh baby
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Oh, look at me now
Woah, this one is dedicated
To all of the people
Who said I would be nothing
Just look at me now
Look at me now
Look at me now
I'm kickin' in the door now
Better get out my way
Never really saw me comin'
You left with nothing to say
This' for everybody
Who've always put me down
I hope you open up your eyes
And take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me now
Take a good look at me nowMidnight, lock all the doors
Keep playing that song all day
Just the sound of the traffic
The patron of you switching lanes
San Diego, Hard Rock hotel
Wondering why I came
I said I'll try not to think of you
If you say you don't feel the same
Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
Feels like the end of the world
Right in this new poor town
Oooh, I should have kept quiet
Yeah, I should have shut my stupid mouth
The long table
The boomerang
Traveling way down south
And it's ironic 'cause it's probably the last time that you see me around
Oooh, oooh
Ooh, you're reluctant 'cause you know I'll leave you nothing to see
Oh yeah
Oooh, oooh
I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches me
I said I'll be self-destructing when your beautiful corruption touches meWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

But I just can‚Äôt help writing about you
And I know this may sound cheesy in a lot of different ways
I swear all of the things I say are true
She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because
You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I‚Äôll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could
So give her your attention and it‚Äôll turn into something
Good
Well, I was walking down MacArthur Park
Just to find someone
Who steal my heart
But it seems like the classmate  love your face
And if the way that you talk
And the way that you walk
Had a  between in something of mine
I‚Äôd sure give up the weller in a day
She walks down that small gray highway all by herself
And makes me feel the sort of way that I have never felt
Because
You can surprise me with words that excite me

You can surprise me with words that excite me
I never find those words to say and I‚Äôll never know what makes me feel
This way
Today
But if I try I could
To others, to others, to others
I‚Äôll let your heart decide for you
And walkin‚Äô and talkin‚Äô with her like you should
So be good to her
And it‚Äôll turn up to something very goodWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore

Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I get home from work, you get home from work
You on the phone though, can't put it down like it's a curse
It's the worst, all I want is time with you
But it's hard to find, a few minutes that align with you
I get inclined to decline that you're mine the truth
Is in the lines, I design in my mind - the booth
Is where I find - I can rhyme & release the flow
Of the pain obtained while being alone, don't wanna know
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain

That we don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I Don't know where you've been
But I know You've been lost
Covered in frost bite, I'm up all night
With a beer and a cross, sitting across
From an empty vessel
Sad shell of what used to be
& I'm confused as to who you really are anymore
How'd we lose what was you and me
All your fluidity turned to acidity
Visibly hindering ability
Like you wanna get rid of me
And I'm not really sure that you're into me, anymore
Which is injuring me even more
Why'd you lock your love up in a drawer
Cutting and stabbing my heart to the core
You just ignore, so
We don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore 
We don't talk anymore, like we used to do 
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for? 
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to do
I miss you
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's giving it to you just right
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brainLyrics From Snippet
Baby, why
Tell me why
Can‚Äôt you just make up your mind?
Quit messing with my‚ÄÖhead
You‚ÄÖcan‚Äôt say you‚ÄÖhate me
Then call me when you‚Äôre‚ÄÖhurt
Baby, you know that‚Äôs not how this works
No, that‚Äôs not how this works
You can‚Äôt walk away
Then come back to what we were
Baby, you know that‚Äôs not how this works
No, that‚Äôs not how this works
NoWe don't talk anymore, we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore, like we used to
We don't laugh anymore
What was all of it for?
Oh, we don't talk anymore
Like we used to
I just heard you found the one you've been looking
You've been looking for
I wish I would have known that wasn't me
'Cause even after all this time I still wonder
Why I can't move on
Just the way you did so easily
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If he's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame
That we don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
We don't talk anymore
I just hope you're lying next to somebody
Who knows how to love you like me
There must be a good reason that you're gone
Every now and then I think you
Might want me to come show up at your door
But I'm just too afraid that I'll be wrong
Don't wanna know
What kind of dress you're wearing tonight
If she's holding onto you so tight
The way I did before
I overdosed
Should've known your love was a game
Now I can't get you out of my brain
Oh, it's such a shame

WoahLyrics from Snippet
After all this time
I, I realized you were holding me back
Yeah, I used to be so nervous, you're out the door
And every day was hurting me more and more
How can I be something predictable
I can't believe I thought you were wonderful
Now I'm gone, like you were 
After all this time
I, I realized you were holding me back
Ah, I was so blind, now I never mind, you w–µre holding me back
Girl, and I just got my man up ther–µ 
And I just got this out my chest 
After all this time
I, I realized you were holding me back What you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
You say you're leaving
Well, if you wanna leave, there ain't nobody stopping you
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please"
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
]
Tell me what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
I never cheated
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
I won't beg for your love
Won't say, "Please" 
I won't fall to the ground on my knees 
You know I've given this everything 
Baby honestly, , baby honestly 
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me

Oh, I think it's best we stay, stay away from each other
'Cause we can be just occasional lovers
Even though I love the pain
Even though I wanna stay
It's best we stay, stay away from each other
Here's something that I never thought that I would say
To a person who is beautiful in every way
But you love me too
 the more, baby, the more, baby
Yeah
Oh I, had plans for our whole life
Now I'm thinking,  God I don't know where I'll be
But I guess it's just not the reality, so
Think it's best w–µ stay, stay away from each other
'Cause w–µ can be just occasional lovers
Even though I love the pain
Even though I wanna stay
It's best we stay, stay away from each other

With a million red lights on the strip
That night, I come to your door
You‚Äôre the one I‚Äôve so desperately missed
Do you remember always staying home with me
And watching friends
Well I‚Äôd do anything for that again
Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
Don‚Äôt leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you‚Äôll feel the same way
Tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone
Ooh~
In my fantasy, I see you next to me
Every night, every day
This empty room feels so strange
Wanna stay, here with you
Go all the way, this afternoon
You caught me with nothing to say
Do you remember when I‚Äôd always
Lie with you til‚Äô 3 a.m
Well I‚Äôd give anything for that again
Come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
Don‚Äôt leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you‚Äôll feel the same way tomorrow
If you see me calling your phone
Oooh
Oooh
Oooh
Ooh, baby
So come spend the night here with me
Up in Boston
Don‚Äôt leave me here all alone
And I wonder if you‚Äôll feel
The same way tomorrow
When you see me calling your phone
When you‚Äôll see me calling your phone
Your phone
When you see me calling your phoneTell me, Mr. Connor
Just tell me
Um...

Who went and threw the best party last night
That was me, me, me, me, me, me

And on top of the roof
And all over the TV screen
And everybody was like:
"Oh my god
Charlie Puth
You sure know how to throw a party, dude"
I'm the coolest motherfucker
You can hear it in the song
And I don't even need to kid

That you found a girl and you're married now
I heard that your dreams came true
Guess she gave you things I didn't give to you
Old friend, why are you so shy?
Ain't like you to hold back or hide from the light
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
You know how the time flies
Only yesterday was the time of our lives
We were born and raised in a summer haze
Bound by the surprise of our glory days
I hate to turn up out of the blue, uninvited
But I couldn't stay away, I couldn't fight it
I had hoped you'd see my face
And that you'd be reminded that for me it isn't over
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Nothing compares, no worries or cares
Regrets and mistakes, they're memories made
Who would have known how bittersweet this would taste?
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Never mind, I'll find someone like you
I wish nothing but the best for you two
"Don't forget me," I beg
"I'll remember," you said
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts instead
Sometimes it lasts in love, but sometimes it hurts insteadBluebird, sweet bluebird
How you remind me of a girl
Who took from me my world
She stole every heartbeat
But I'd like to say I gave them first
To save me from this curse
Bluebird, sweet bluebird
Outside my window with nothing to say
But sing of better days
But those days ain't coming
Feel like just running away
Running away
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking us apart
It's best stay we apart, best we stay apart
Bluebird, sweet bluebird
It seems like years since you've been here
Since the day you disappeared
Though my heart's still aching
I know you're safe where you are
Wherever you are
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is
Breaking both our, breaking both our
Breaking both our hearts
Though I'd rather hold you close
I've just gotta let you fly away
Bluebird, fly away
My baby
Oooh, oooh
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking both our hearts
She's flying south again
Oooh, oooh
I'm on the run and I
Don't wanna be without her never wanna doubt her, no
But if holding on is breaking us apart
It's best we stay apart, best we stay apart
OoohI've been trying and there's no denying
That girl you've got my heart falling so fast
My mind's racing, you've got me wasting
My days were endless till I see you pass
And I'm like
Baby did I catch your eye?
Can I see you tonight?
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone
You don't wanna take it slow
Forget it all and come home with me
Take my hand girl, we'll cross this land till
We find a place that we can all our home
Trust in me and I'll set you free
Babe I'm never ever leave you feeling cold
You got me like
Tell me I'm the only one
And I'll see you tonight
When the lights go out
You know it's going down
The music playing is all we need
When we're all alone

Oh, this is what you wanted all alongGoing on a date
I really can't be late
Gotta get some flowers
After I get some food
God, I really needed that
But I'm already late, oh, crap!
Have to come up with an excuse
After I get more food
I'm fifteen minutes late
She's really gonna hate me
I better call her now
Oh look, a bakery!
This really isn't good
I need to get her a gift
Oh, perfect, I can get her one right there!
Thirty minutes late
My chances aren't great
 if she wants
After I fight in this battle
I'm putting my foot down right now!
Forty minutes late
No more pit stops
I gotta make it, oh
Putting the key in
Gotta step on the gas
Total concentration
I'm almost there
Now I'm at her house!
Ooh, Charlie Puth, you dumbass
You showed up three hours late
She couldn't wait anymore
"Hey Charlie, wanna hang out?"
Yeah sure, I'll pick you up right now
Charlie the dumbass slept through his alarm
Then stalked his friends on Facebook
And then went to an office party
He doesn't even work in an officeThis song
The footlong
Is the five dollar footlong song
Just for youHello, ladies
I may have had to use a pitch bender to make my voice sound lower than it really is
But I just wanted to tell you that.. that
I am so hot, hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside, outside I'm bound to start a forest fire
I'm so hot that in cold weather
You're gonna wanna take off your sweater
No need for hats and gloves
Charlie Puth is gonna warm you up with his love
What the hell's a fireplace?
If you're chilly you will really want me in your face
Fishes were cold-blooded at one time
But that all changed when I went for a dive
Halle Berry and the sun have got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty
Did I mention that I
I am so hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside I'm bound to start a forest fire
"DJ, turn me up"
Is something someone said who is not really hot
In comparison to me, who is dripping with hot
Man, I can't help you with something that you're not
Sunburned people and polar ice caps
They all hatin' on me
But alligators, Jersey Shore Guidos, and photosynthesis
They all got my back, bitch
Emma Watson and the microwave ain't got nothing on me
I'm a lot like baking cookies except there's no need to preheat me at three-hundred-fifty, oh!
Um, oh yeah
I am so hot, hot, hot
Nothing can cool me down
Yeah, no one's got a swagger like, swagger like, swagger like me, baby
If you think you're hot, hot, hot
You better step aside
Yeah, 'cause when I step outside I'm bound to start a forest fire
I am so hot, hot, hot

You just want a--
You just want attentionAw yeah
What?
I have a little story to tell you
And it goes like this
I was walking down the street, bitch, walking down the street
Walking down the street with shoes at my feet
But then I saw a glimpse from the corner of my eye
I saw this smokin' hot broad walk by
I said, "Yo baby, what's up?", She said "you talkin' to me?"
"Well, duh, there's no one else on the street"
"You're coming back to my place" This how it's gonna be
But then something hit my face
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna mack this bitch?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosher
The next day, nothing's new
Sitting on this seat like I always do
Saw them other bitches walkin' my way
"Man‚Ä¶ I need a bagel"
Eating at the deli with my bagel and jelly
While I'm observing the trees
Gosh, how did they get so green and plump?
Wait, what just hit my face? Oh my‚Äî
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Can't you see I'm tryna eat my bagel?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
Who threw this pickle at me?
I tried to keep calm, tried to gain my composure
Bitch, this ****'s not even kosherLyrics from a snippet

Promise there were no feelings involved, mmh
She said, "Boy, tell me honestly
Was it real or just for show?", yeah
She said, "Save your apologies

How long has this been goin' on?
You've been creepin' 'round on me
While you're callin' me "baby"

Ooo-oh 
BabyYou sing yourself to sleep at night
Melodies behind closed doors
I'm over by the corner
Listening to you from the second floor
I open up the curtains
To hear the thunder and the rain
We dropped off all the flowers
To wash away the pain
Wanna go with you anywhere, anywhere
Wanna go with you anywhere
I'm sorry I kept you waiting
I have no excuse
There's no room for debating
Why it took so long to get back to you
But these tangerine dreams will not go away
I build them right up and mold them out of clay
They just give me company
Now I take everyday with a deep breath
'Cause I found out the hard way when he left
Suffering silently
These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth again
These last couple days I haven't been myself
'Cause I know I won't be seeing you on Commonwealth again
Commonwealth againHe's such a nice boy, so well-mannered
He's so much better than the last one you‚ÄÖbrought‚ÄÖaround
Please and thank‚ÄÖyou, everything matters
I'm gonna make sure‚ÄÖthat she knows I'm the best she's found
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Sneak out the window, bed stuffed with pillows
I'll be waiting in the car right around the block
Back of the Benzo
More than a friend zone
We've been hiding since the time they forgot to knock
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew
All the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
If your mother only knew
The moment she walks out that door
I'm not pretending anymore
If your mother knew all of the things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do

Wanna fall
Fall so far

Fall so hard
And I call it magic
And I call it true
Still believe in magic
Yes I do

Tired of this conversation
We didn't come all this way
To touch a little, kiss a little
All‚ÄÖnight‚ÄÖlong
You wanna hear‚ÄÖme say it
I know I kept‚ÄÖyou waitin'
Just a little, just a little
All night long
Can't stop
'Til‚Åüyou're‚Åülyin'‚Åüright here next‚Åüto me
I should‚Åüstop
But I think I'll do it anyway
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official
Don't we look perfect, baby?
Let's take this further, baby
Just a little, just a little
All night long
If I was your boyfriend, I
I'd be givin' you all my time
Not just a little, just a little
All night long
Can't stop
'Til you're lyin' right here next to me
I should stop
But I think I'll do it anyway
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever want to be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official
Hold on, you're makin' me, uh
Hold on, you're makin' me, no
My girlfriend
Hold on, you're makin' me, uh
Hold on, you're makin' me, no
My girlfriend

I had to do it anyway, I had to do it anyway
Baby, would you ever wanna be my girlfriend?
I don't wanna play no games
This is more than just a phase
Baby, would you ever wanna be my girlfriend?
If you want it, let me know
We could make this official
Ooh
Hold on, you're makin' me, no
Hold on, you're makin' me, uh
My girlfriendI took her out to dinner
I thought I'd had a winner
And what happened next came to a surprise to be
So I walked her to her front door
Waiting for what I had hoped for
But then she hugged and said goodnight to me
As I took my bad, stepped off that porch, I saw a friend of mine
She stepped closer then grabbed my hand and met me eye to eye
That's when she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!
So I took her down to the shoreline
The weather that day was so fine
And not to mention she looked pretty good too
And later at the movies, romantic comedy
I hate those films but for her I managed to get through
I walked her to her front porch as we said our goodbyes
As I desperately tried to say something she put her finger on my lip and said one more thing
She kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know, that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!
It's nice to know that she cares enough about me
I never saw saw this coming, and my heart's constantly drumming
And whenever she's around I'll never ever feel the same
About that other girl's name
Because she kissed me and knocked me off my feet
Never have I ever felt this way
I was lookin' for a girl just like her, and I think I've found her
And I'll always let her know that I will never let her go
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!
Whoa! Whoa! Whoa! Whoa whoa!Dodaj mi testeru da seƒçemo la≈ænu idilu

If your mother knew all the things we do
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things we do
Next time that she sees me

'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
If your mother knew, she'd keep me so far from you
If your mother knew all the things that we do

Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all the things we do
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Next time that she sees me
She gon' act like she don't know me
'Cause she knows all of the story
Now your daddy wants to kill me
Do, things that we do
Do, things that we do
If your mother knew all of the things that we doOh-oh
Doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo doo doo
Doo doo doo doo
I ºm sitting here alone again
Waiting for you to come see me now
As time passes by
In the blink of an eye
I know I ºll get to see you somehow
You are sitting home another night
Waiting for someone to hold you tight
Time passes by
So quick indeed
This time you ºre slipping away from me
It ºs been a long, cold, hard winter
It was a long, drawn-out spring
You took no wrong when you saw nothing in me
But our love was something nice to see
We were sitting alone on the beach
Letting all the sand between our feet
As time passes by
Blink of an eye
Amazing how things ain ºt what they used to be
Ain ºt what they used to be...
It was the shortest summer
The fall was so abrupt
Thought you ºd be happy with the way things were
But I guess it wasn ºt enough
I am outside sitting, writing this song
You could have guessed that all along
Time passed me by
So quick indeed
And you ºre the only thing that I ºm missing
I wrote this song all last night
Tried to make the lyrics fit just right
But I ºm still having trouble with this very last part
But I know it ºll come from my heart
But I know it ºll come from my heart...
Doo doo doo doo doo doo doo doo dooWhat you thinking?
You think that you could be better off with somebody new
You say you're leaving
Well, if you wanna leave there ain't nobody stopping you
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please
I won't fall to the ground on my knees
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, baby, honestly
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
I never cheated
Deleted everyone 'cause they made you uncomfortable
These accusations
I can't apologize for something that I didn't do
I won't beg for your love
Won't say please 
I won't fall to the ground on my knees 
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly, , baby, honestly
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
Oh, tell me what you've done for me
Tell me what you've done for me
Oh
You know I've given this everything
Baby, honestly
Tell me what you've done for me
I lie for you, baby
I die for you, baby
Cry for you, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
For you, baby
And only you, baby
The things I do, baby
But tell me what you've done for me
But tell me what you've done for me
But tell me what you've done for meAm
Yeah, maybe I'ma get a little anxious
Maybe I'ma get a little shy
'Cause everybody's trying to be famous
And I'm just trying to find a place to hide 
All I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
I don't even know how to explain this
I don't even think I'm gonna try
And that's okay
I promise myself one day
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
Maybe I'ma get a little nervous
Maybe I don't go out anymore 
Feelin' like I really don't deserve this 
Life ain't nothing like it was before 
'Cause all I wanna do is just hold somebody
But no one ever wants to get to know somebody
If you go and look under the surface 
Baby, I'm a little insecure
And that's okay
I promised myself one day
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am 
That's just the way I am 
Baby, that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all 
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
Am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted
I am, am, am
Yeah, this is what you wanted
Oh, this is what you wanted all along
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
I'ma tell 'em all
I'ma tell 'em all that you could either hate me or love me
But that's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I am
That's just the way I amIt's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
Why'd you have to leave so soon
Why'd you have to go
Why'd you have to leave me when I needed you the most
"Cause I don't really know how to tell you
Without feeling much worse
I know you're in a better place
But it's always gonna hurt
Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
How do I breathe without you
I'm feeling so cold
I'll be waiting right here for you
Till the day you're home
Carry on
Give me all the strength I need
To carry on
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take
Will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend
And I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
We've come a long way from where we began
Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
When I see you again
See you again
When I see you againWhen I look into your eyes
It's like watching the night sky
Or a beautiful sunrise
There's so much they hold
And just like them old stars
I see that you've come so far
To be right where you are
How old is your soul?
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
And when you're needing your space
To do some navigating
I'll be here patiently waiting
To see what you find
Cause even the stars, they burn
Some even fall to the earth
We got a lot to learn
God knows we're worth it
No I won't give up
I don't wanna be someone who walks away so easily
I'm here to stay and make the difference that I can make
Our differences they do a lot to teach us how to use
The tools and gifts we've got yeah we got a lot at stake
And in the end, you're still my friend
At least we didn't intend
For us to work we didn't break, we didn't burn
We had to learn how to bend without the world caving in
I had to learn what I've got, and what I'm not
And who I am
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up
I'm still looking up
I won't give up...
I won't give up on us
Even if the skies get rough
I'm giving you all my love
I'm still looking up

        Look, Charlie...
We know that you're cute and you got the keyboard going too that cool but listen
I'm a female and your a male
There's certain lil difference you gotta understand like
Men play those mental games
Women deal with the pain of magazines, instragam, all the social pressure, to look like someone else but still hold your shit together like, wow it's kinda funny
Beautiful girls on Instagram tryin make like
Kylie Jenner sayin "love yourself" before she goes to run off and get some doctors "help"

        Ooo
Girl I really trusted you
Tore my heart right into two
I was gonna marry you
Til I‚ÄÖcaught‚ÄÖyou with another‚ÄÖdude
Fool me once, you fool me‚ÄÖtwice
All you did was tell me lies
Should've taken their advice
Now my heart is cold as iceI'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to save me
This all‚ÄÖor‚ÄÖnothing really got‚ÄÖa way of driving me crazy
I‚ÄÖneed somebody to heal, somebody to know
Somebody to have, somebody‚Åüto‚Åühold
It's‚Åüeasy to say,‚Åübut it's never‚Åüthe same
I guess I kinda liked the way you numbed all the pain
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I'm going under, and this time, I fear there's no one to turn to
This all or nothing way of loving got me sleeping without you
Now, I need somebody to know, somebody to heal
Somebody to have, just to know how it feels
It's easy to say, but it's never the same
I guess I kinda like the way you help me escape
Now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
And I tend to close my eyes when it hurts sometimes
I fall into your arms
I'll be safe in your sound till I come back around
For now, the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
But now the day bleeds into nightfall
And you're not here to get me through it all
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved
I let my guard down and then you pulled the rug
I was getting kinda used to being someone you loved

        I heard you slam the door
And fall right to the floor
You kept on crying
That look upon your face
Doesn't cover up
What's under lying
Seeing you like this
Makes me wanna die
We lie beneath the stars
Just two foolish hearts
Familiar faces
Now I lie here all alone
Sitting by the phone
There's too much space here
Oh baby, come back and stay with me
Cause it's not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause it's not over
To me, to me, to me
It's never over to me
My heart
Is your's
For yesterdays and for taking it
My heart
Is broken
You're all that I need
Just don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Don't forget about me
Oh me, Oh me
Cause letting you go hurt me
Cause this is not over
Please don't say it's over
Cause this is not over
To me, to me, to me
Never over you and meI see the people all the time
Counting all their dimes
Walking around living one big lie
I bet they all go far
Driving those rented cars
Going around in circles hoping that you'll see them
You say you're quintessential
You say you're something special
But it's time to move on
And get on with your life
Everybody 
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else
I hear them talking everyday
The purchases they made
Hiding their faces with those fake designer shades
They say their doing well
But they should take a look at themselves
Theres gotta be something in their life they know thats missing
You say you're quintessential
You say you're something special
But it's time to move on
And get on with your life
Everybody 
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else
        
Everybody
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
It's not all about the wealth
And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else
Everybody
You got, you got to love yourself
It's not all about the wealth
It's not all about the wealth
And everybody
You can't put your life up on the shelf
Theres nothing else :

When I see you again
Dang, who knew?
All the planes we flew
Good things we've been through
That I'll be standing right here talking to you
'Bout another path
I know we loved to hit the road and laugh
But something told me that it wouldn't last
Had to switch up
Look at things different, see the bigger picture
Those were the days
Hard work forever pays
Now I see you in a better place 
Uh
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride

Oh, I'll tell you all about it when I see you again
When I see you again
(Aah oh, aah oh
Wooooh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh)
Yeah
First you both go out your way
And the vibe is feeling strong
And what's small turn to a friendship
A friendship turn to a bond
And that bond will never be broken
The love will never get lost
And when brotherhood come first
Then the line will never be crossed
Established it on our own
When that line had to be drawn
And that line is what we reach
So remember me when I'm gone
How can we not talk about family when family's all that we got?
Everything I went through you were standing there by my side
And now you gon' be with me for the last ride
So let the light guide your way, yeah
Hold every memory as you go
And every road you take, will always lead you home, home
It's been a long day without you, my friend

Doo doo doo doo doo
Right next to you
Next to you
You're the kind of person I remember seeing before
Your pretty face is one that I'll always adore
You have the eyes that'll close whenever you kiss me
Because love makes us whatever we want to be
How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With, you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're in front of me
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
When I saw you on that richside on that one particular day
I was really hoping and wondering if you'd ever look my way
So I got up from my seat but you had already passed me by
If only I got there earlier and not lost in your eyes
How do I breathe?
How do I sleep?
With, you not beside me
You're all the things I could not see
But now they're in front of me
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
I'll promise one day I'll be
And maybe one day you'll see
That you belong to me
Baby, baby
I don't know what to do
And it only helps when I'm sitting right next to you
Sitting right next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
Yeah, no matter what I do
I wanna be next to you
When I'm right next to you
Right next to you
