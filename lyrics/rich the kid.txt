All of my niggas keep straps 
Spend three hundred on a napp 
They sucking, fuck the whole trap
Bitch, you know my pockets fat 
Quavo walking Warren Sapp 
Takeoff buying only Act 
You niggas sipping just to act 
Bought a Bimmer, wrapped it matte 
Got a shooter, peep hole out the back 
Never been a minority 
Take the pot and Chuck Norris it 
You niggas looking unfortunate 
Different types of babies like a orphanage 
I hit my money in the storage

Whip the pot nigga, whip it hard
AK make a nigga Hit The Quan
Gas bag like I own the farm

100 round drum and that stick
Pull up, roll the windows down and I hit
You cuffing that bitch and she loyal to dick
Chasing money, I can't lay with no bitch
Murda Gang, we don't play with the beef

Fucked her on the floor, can't fuck up my sheets
Offset!

The judge tried to sentence a nigga
Fuck a partner, my .44 my nigga
Stuck in the pickle, grinding from a nickel
Trapping in trenches, two bricks in the rental
I'm crazy I'm psycho, it's 'bout to get physical
Run a circle 'round the plug, that's a pick and roll
Feds watching so I walk on my tippy toes
I'm rich as bitch, I want in on that lick
I'm not romantic, my bullet gon' kiss
Get in that pot, get the work in your wrist
I was born with the gift, got the fame and the grip
Hop in the jet and I take me a trip
Geeked out on codeine, I sip and I sip
Jump off the stage, I might jump out the VIP
I'm covered in money, covered like a quimp
I'm smoking on cookie, not smoking on piff
Don't talk to the police, not giving out tips
That ain’t that boot, that molly look too clear
I don't care what you heard, I jump straight in my Lier
Standing in the kitchen, cooking fish fillet
Run up my money, I stash me a Wraith
Don't run up on me nigga, pump your brakes
I feed you the .223, dinner plate!
Run up on me nigga, catch a slug

You know we got the straps up in the club
I don't fuck with you, you a dub
21 Gang, we got weight

Pull up on a nigga, we'll take
Headshot a nigga, leave him in a lake
Round table with the Migo Gang and the Slaughter Gang, we on break
Bitch too skinny I don't want her, fuck the bitch, the bitch might break
I got a hundred round drum on that K
I keep that bitch with me, you know that bae
Never let a nigga know where I stay
Have a nigga staking out where you stay
I get that cash, I ain't got time to play
Hold up that choppa, this mask on my face
Shoot out the doulie then pull off in the Wraith
Curious George, got bananas in K's
Pussy niggas turn to preachers like Ma$e
Finna slide to where I keep me a K
Juvenile hit a nigga with tre
On Tenwood, post with that K
WOO!
Whipping a brick with a frying pan
Made a 100k with a broke hand
Trapping down with the desert eagle
Actavis all in my 2 liter
Finessing the plug for a whole thang
Rollie all white like the cocaine
I got a freak with a nose ring
Cut that bitch down like I'm 2 Chainz
Walking around with a 100 thou'
I'm actually rich, you just talk about it
Pull up with choppers and air it out
I empty the clip in your mama house
Hit a jug for the work, still serving
Get rich or die trying like Curtis
I roll with a brick and she nervous
Pull out the Wraith when I'm flexing on purpose
I started trapping in first grade
I put the lean in a lemonade
I pour a four, got a fever
Dab school, I'm the teacher
Riding scrap with the nina
Big balling, no bleachers
100k for one feature
Bad bitch, she no keeperHa!

She ride this dick like a bikeI'm sorry, mama, but this money, that's what made a nigga
Grew up too fast, I feel my problems startin' chase a nigga
Sometimes I wish I could home so you could save a nigga
We different breeds, so I can see that's why they hate a nigga
My brother, I wish you can see everything I accomplish
I wish you was here see everyday I'm stuntin'
I wish I could show how we came from nothin'
I'm sorry, mama, know this money here done made a nigga
Now I got all these goddamn hundreds, still can't change a nigga
Back then, they said I wasn't shit, now they want take a picture
I was tryna save the money for some blunt and Swishers
I was tryna make a fifty, turned it to a milli'
They ain't think I was gon' make it, but them niggas silly
Damn, I wish I could have brought all of my brothers with me
When we was tryna pay the bills, you wasn't starvin' with me
But I done ran the money up, I bought a Benz for mama
These hundreds might drive me insane, all these damn commas
Gotta watch my back and keep these fuckin' heater on me
Got my neck and wrist a freezer, better not creep up on me
I'm sorry, mama, but this money, that's what made a nigga
Grew up too fast, I feel my problems startin' chase a nigga
Sometimes I wish I could home so you could save a nigga
We different breeds, so I can see that's why they hate a nigga
My brother, I wish you can see everything I accomplish
I wish you was here see everyday I'm stuntin'
I wish I could show how we came from nothin'
Like how them Bentleys whippin' out, we spendin' cash night to mornin'
I think about you every time, I know this all you had wanted
These bitches steady out here lyin', they just can't keep it one hundred
I'm tryna stay from 'cross state lines so I won't run it, I punt it
I hope for good times with my mama 'cause we still be at odds
I went to jail and came back, and bitch, I'm still livin' large
Duck from that iron, we slung some back, but take it all up with God
Know once I'm gone, I can't come back, I'm thinkin' 'bout my lil' boy
But it ain't much that I believe, I just, I can't see
Use the smoke to take the pain, it's back-to-back but I can't breathe, I just
And this image I hold up, it make it hard to see my needs, I just
Every day I'm thankin' God but it's still hard to heard my needs, but, um
I'm sorry, mama, but this money, that's what made a nigga
Grew up too fast, I feel my problems startin' chase a nigga
Sometimes I wish I could home so you could save a nigga
We different breeds, so I can see that's why they hate a nigga
My brother, I wish you can see everything I accomplish
I wish you was here see everyday I'm stuntin'
I wish I could show how we came from nothin' 
We came from nothing, that's the reason they can't understand
They say my partner killed his partner for a couple grams
Fresh out that bottom, country boy, I'm finally at the top
They told me, "Boy, go chase your dreams and don't never stop"
While pops in prison, mama busy, I jumped off the porch
Grew up too fast, young wilding man, not knowing I would blow
Running with Chance, writing raps, that was my thing, too
Until I seen Twan and them came through in Mustang Coupes
I've been tryna get some sleep, so I've been sipping syrup
Remember Brock brought me to his block and let me serve
He told me leave from 'round this bitch and go and shock the world
I came home from off a tour, he was dead on the curb
I'm sorry, mama, but this money, that's what made a nigga
Grew up too fast, I feel my problems startin' chase a nigga
Sometimes I wish I could home so you could save a nigga
We different breeds, so I can see that's why they hate a nigga
My brother, I wish you can see everything I accomplish
I wish you was here see everyday I'm stuntin'
I wish I could show how we came from nothin'Made 100 thou in my trap house

Money to blow and got money to waste
Money to count and got money to make
Young rich nigga, put a stack on my plate

Throw the judge a bankroll to trim down the sentence
And if he was shooter you'd know he's no witness
So much gold, think that I was from Egypt

Free all my niggas, don't play with your freedom
Fifteen hundred cash for the first one that beats us

Gettin' to the check, can't stop 
Too much drip, please don't slip, bitch, I'm ballin'

Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink
So many racks like the bank
Passed out on the four out the pint
Walk in the trap and it stank
I told that bitch cut on the sink
Told mama I would be rich forever
Now I’m riding in a Masi, rich forever
Niggas hating then I bought a bigger bezel
I be staying on the stove like a kettle
Play with the keys like Zaytoven
In the trap, wrists moving, J’s smoking
She from overseas, Rolex get away
Maybach pull up, get in it
Let your main bitch fuck and then I drop her off
In the Goyard ballin’, no basketball
Fuck 12, said a nigga free Gucci
Have your bitch wipe me down like Boosie
I be in Hollywood swerving
Like the president, back of the Suburban
They been hating on me but I run it up
Everybody been waiting on the Trap Talk
I broke my wrist, 360
This bitch so hot, saddity
You was just mad ‘til you fell off
I was getting money out in New York
Fucking your bitch, then I leave her

I been chilling where the trap at
Bad bitch with a accent
She see em, where the racks at
They say I wouldn't, but I did that
I might pull up in a new Jag
Knew the money would change me
Look at my chains, my diamonds they wavy
Bitches they tried to play me, now these hoes asking for babies
My whole life changed all in one year
In the kitchen made a brick disappear
Lot of ice, whole block in my ear
It took a lot of hard work to get in here
Police they say they have evidence
Free my niggas, that's irreverent
Taking trips out to Beverly
God said I was heaven sent
Wake up and I gotta go get it
Rich nigga I done ran up a million
You can ask me how I did it
I'ma tell you go get it
I been counting up daily
Coupe going crazy
Looking at my diamonds they wavy
I knew that the money would change me
Still in the hood with a trap nigga, bitch wanna ride like a bicycle
Bitch I got rich and I'll never change
Came in this bitch with the Migos gang
I'ma make your ho do the dishes
High class trap nigga in the Fisker
Real shit, I'm living like Diddy
New York right now smoking cookies
Made a hunnid, when you see me I'm flexing
What the hell I ain't do no texting
In the field getting pints outside Texas
Sipping syrup in the morning, no breakfast
I heard they said I'm a superstar
All of my trap got them burglar bars
Came from the hood now I'm switching cars
Thanking the lord that I made it far
Wake up and I gotta go get it
Rich nigga I done ran up a million
You can ask how I did it
I'ma take over again
I been counting up daily
Coupe going crazy
Looking at my diamonds they wavy
I knew that the money would change meTrap
You know what I need
You know Rich had to get 2X on this muthafucka
Racks!
Cash
Gang!
Woo
I might pop a perc and just go crazy
Fucking on your bitch like I want babies
Diamonds hit like Rocky bitch I'm famous
Walking with a hundred bitch I made it
Leaning and tripping on two pills
Sippin' on pints of the double seal
They told me to stop but I'm sippin' still
Yo hoe putting up but she know the drill
Momma' said be patient
I had no Mercedes
I was on the block I trapped that rock, like back in the 80s
Just know that I pour up a whole pint
Like fuck it I'm back on the dirty Sprite
I'm catching the plays like Jerry Rice
My young niggas killing might take your life
My teachers said I couldn't do right
Pull up in Porsche and it's all white
I'm all in her head like fucking lice
Play with the money you pay the price
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it
I need my money on time, each and every dime
I just want a bag with the cash in it
Just need a bitch that can dab with me
That's a draco nigga
Full of them peso niggas, I pop out the cut like Fredo nigga
And these police niggas, better watch 'fore a nigga put a case on niggas 
And these feds on me, feds on me, talk on a payphone nigga
And I fucked off of Adderall, IG hoes, I done fucked them all
Last plug ain't fuckin' wit me, 50 pounds I done tore them off
Chiraq is a mad city, no act, gotta keep red wit me
New car, do the dash silly
Quavo, do the dab with me
Go Hard, Chanel or Goyard
Free 9, bring him home with no charge
Fake frames, take those off
Designer, designer, designer shit
Chiraq and Atlanta shit
Robbed his ass while you panicking
Fresher than a fuckin' mannequin
I blew him back on that fast shit
What you need? I just want a bag with the cash in it
In the kitchen with no dishes but some bad bitches
I just want a bag with the cash in it
How we living, go and get it adding up them digits
I just want a bag with the cash in it

But I got them workers so they pay me
I got all these bitches like I'm pimpin'
And your baby momma' now she drippin'
Walking around with a lot of cash
Rari' I ride with a paper tag
Momma' she said that I'm living fast
I need to slow down but I do the dash
Put my wrist in it when I'm whippin' up
I got your bitch she gon' cook it up
Fuckin her all on the furniture
She don't speak no English a foreigner
Bitch quit playing I'm dangerous

I don't even know her name, no, keepin' secrets that's a choice, choice
Real commas on the jeans, jeans, bad bitch in Céline, 'line
They only call me when they need me, I've been livin' out the dream, dream 
No we don't argue with opps, we spinnin' that block and we takin' that shot
They tryna throw me in that box
Plenty bitches in the penthouse, on the thirtieth floor 
Dior bag for my main, she stay askin' for more 
A lotta blue ones, it's on me, my pockets choke
Show her the racks, racks, promise that she gon' fuck 
Sneaky links with these bitches but we never fallin' in love, no 
House in LA with the view, I put your bitch in the tub
Hunnid K for the crib 'cause we just livin' it up
I got a G Wagon , I got a Rolls Royce 
They know I was flexin' on 'em , I did it with no choice 
She don't fuck with no broke boys , she let me fuck on camera like porno
Y'all niggas just talk, y'all makin' no noise 
Young nigga rockstar like Pink Floyd Where you want to start,  been waiting
If it’s wings on that ass, don’t you want to get it
With them hands to the maker 
You don’t understand, if you’re fly we’ll take you
Dancing on me
Why you want it, dancing on me
I won’t leave
All I know is you’re right here for me
In love with a stripper, leaving the trap and I’m bringing the Benji
The bricks in the engine, drink in the kitchen
Cuffing a ho but your bitch come up missing
But fuck all your feelings She dancing on me, cause my chain on Guwop
Nigga so icy
Feels good to be rich in a rari
Came up from the bottom, my pockets so stuffed
[Rich The Kid
She working, I know she deserve it
Red bottoms, she run with the burkin
Remi and Persian
Young nigga I ride in the maybach with curtains
I’m gonna  ass, while throwing that cash
And she whipping that Jag
All I know is you right here for me
Back then I was broke but now that I’m rich
Me and your bitch, we making a flick
Young rich nigga, I’m in love with the trap house
She a fool with it, the way that she climbing that pole
She know that I’m famous bought momma a bentley I finally made it
Hurricane, the kitchen they doing their thang
Pick up my bitch from the border
VVS diamonds, it looks like the water
She done dream  about red bottoms, know she got em
Hundred bands cash in my robbins
All the hoes want a young rich nigga
In the back of the Bentley I’m countingTold my bitch quit shopping she ain't listen

See I might pull up to Lenox and valet the Fisker drop bands on my ladies
I been thinking 'bout them M&M's lately, how many bands can you get for a baby? 
She got a shoppin' problem, and I got a dabbin' problem
The mansion it came with commas, we set a new trend and we start from the bottom
Never slippin', dab is always drippin', and my roof is missin', and the  missin'
Cartier clear frames, bitch I got good vision, pocket rocket in the club wearin' 
Bathing ape, Maybach drake
My youngins eat OG Flippa cut the cake
I do not discriminate I hit every race, addicted to lean fell in love with the taste
I spend a whole 20 then pull out some more, I used to kick doors out a Honda accord
Hit a missionary til' she gets sore, and when we count condos we count the whole floor

Red BB belt 'cause I'm a bloody stepper
So many artists leave a stain on whoever
I'm starting to think I should just go
We ain't been getting no better
Tell me a lie, I blow the brains out the reverend
Inside my cup, I see the devil
'Cause the demon always come out me all of a sudden
Inside the bank, it's a been a murder scene
'Cause whеn I walked out, they had blood on that money
I'm talking somеthing beyond the sky what I'm gon' aim for
Pull up on the side, let that thing blow
Tryna heal my pain with that drank, but it's gon' take my soul
 swerving in the range like he can't go
Hundred mil' coming, all this fame old
Soon as you changed on me, you turn to ash like charcoal
Lose feelings through the night, I'm starting to think my heart broke
Know they give me love, see they switching up
That thing getting old
Caught 'em breaking in, I'ma kick doors, we live a big code
Kickstand, sliding in, oh, and my wrist froze
She run down, I left her, I don't know where she go
Sanitary lifestyle, I'm making sure that casket closed
That 40 on me right now, I step on the bitch on my own
Clear the scene, time to leave, leave it, oh overload
Could barely breathe, get off lean, too much lean, time to go
They gon' count me in anyway, the fuck you tryna tie me for?
The RT wait, I dubbed the eight 
Red BB belt 'cause I'm a bloody stepper
So many artists leave a stain on whoever
I'm starting to think I should just go
We ain't been getting no better
Tell me a lie, I blow the brains out the reverend
Inside my cup, I see the devil
'Cause the demon always come out me all of a sudden
Inside the bank, it's a been a murder scene
'Cause when I walked out, they had blood on that moneyI put that bitch in red bottoms

Momma told me my life was just too bizarre
All my diamonds on water like mi amor 
Rollin', rollin' and I need some water

Told the bitch, better not look at my fucking cup
Boy, that boy been a lane, he ain't  up

What the hell she was thinking? I can't kiss that 
Why she ask me where the hell I got my wrist at? 
Why the hell a hundred-thousand in my backpack?

Why these bitches think that we can come in contact? 
This is my drank, this ain't cognac 
You ain't get a milli, why you sign that? She never seen a nigga in a Phantom
My diamonds blinding, Ray Charls, they can't understand it
Pull up in that whip, ghost come cash
Young nigga flexin with them racks
I pull up in ghost, I'm buying my bitches all over the coast
I'm doing the most, the Phantom came with a Rolls
The Rollie came with a coat, no joke
Bitches give me the throat, after they give me the 
I'm dressed in designer, my pockets is full of designer
My niggas is savage 
6 gold rings, call me Michael Jordan
I'm draped in Ferragamo, white 
She never seen a nigga in a Phantom
My diamonds blinding, Ray Charls, they can't understand it
Pull up in that whip, ghost come cash
Young nigga flexin with them racks
I'm nasty, pull up in a ghost like Casper
In the Rari when I wanna go faster, got your girlfriend calling me master
 nigga way out of the country
1 2 3, I can turn your hoe to a groupie
Pull up in a ghost like Casper
Young rich nigga 
She never seen a nigga in a Phantom
My diamonds blinding, Ray Charls, they can't understand it
Pull up in that whip, ghost come cash
Young nigga flexin with them racks

        Plug walk
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
You can't reach me
Space coupe like E.T
It's the plug tryna call me
I was up trappin' early in the morning
Ooh, on the wave like a du-rag
Pussy nigga callin' for his boo back
Plug walk, Gucci on my shoe racks
Walk up in the house, where the stove at?
'Til I ran into the plug  'til I ran into the mud
I done ran into some racks, I done ran into your girl
Why the plug show me love?
I done came up from a dub
Plug walk
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walk
Big ol' Bentley, it's a spaceship
Call me on my phone, I don't say shit
I make money when I talk
I'm a boss, take a loss
I could introduce you to the plug
Bitch, this ain't no Henny in my cup
Stayed down, now the racks up
She gon' let me fuck, ass up
Plug, I stuck kis in the Louis V
Fuck 12, I’m a G, ain't no stoppin' me
And my wrist is on overseas
Rich nigga, you can't talk to me
Plug walk
I don't even understand how the fuck my plug talk
Pick him up in a space coupe, I don't let my plug walk
New freak, had to cut my other lil' bitch off
50K, you could come and book a nigga for a plug walkVersace

Wrist, ice cream
Pull up flexin', any bitch gon' fuck me

Old money, real dusty 
Overseas countin' foreign cash 
To the trap for another bag 
Christian Loub's, red bottom swag 
YSL on me  
Fuck them niggas 'cause they hatin' 
Got the Lamborghini waitin'

Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot
Dolce and Gabbana on my flip flops
I don't do no relaxing
Run up the bag, get the cash in
Fendi, am I drippin' or I'm splashin'
12, they can't catch me when I'm passin'
How you got a check and went broke again?
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em
Off-White with the Gucci, I might mitch match
When I fuck her, you can get your bitch back
What the hell she was thinking? I can't kiss that
Why she ask me where the hell I got my wrist at?
Why the hell a hundred-thousand in my backpack?
Why these bitches think that we can come in contact?
This is my drank, this ain't cognac
You ain't get a milli, why you sign that?
She wanna fuck, I decline that
Look at my bitch, she a dimebag
Look at my pinky, it's a waterslide
Rich Forever, come and see the money side
Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot

I don't do no relaxing
Run up the bag, get the cash in
Fendi, am I drippin' or I'm splashin'

How you got a check and went broke again?
Bitches wanting clout and I ain't kissin' 'em
Since I first got them hundreds, I've been flippin' 'em
I flip the money, got my check up
I'm flexing up, but I'm no wrestler
Blue cheese pockets got the extras
I stack the money up like Tetris
How I got two-fifty from my neck up?
How I made it from the hood to a Benz truck?
Bitches wanna fuck, I got them lined up
How you with the gang but you ain't signed up?
Pull out my dick, tell her kiss that
She just want a nigga with a big sack
Pull out the choppa, we in combat
Touchdown on the plug like a lineback
Ayy, we can fuck lil' mama, I can't lip lock
Gucci, spent a hunnid on some new socks
Coulda bought a crib, bought a drop top
I can't love a bitch, trust no thot
Never bring a freak to your spot

Run up the bag, get the cash in
