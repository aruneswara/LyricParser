Thin, lil' bitty waist, I'mma go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tippin', stop the bill
If I come in here one mo' night, I'm gon' need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife
]
The last girl was pretty  but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy  but she couldn't do the thangs you do
She could dance  but nothin' like the way you move
I used to want her  until the day I saw you 
I'm a grown ass man I thought I seen it all
Doin' all that on the pole and didn't even fall 
And right then, I knew exactly what it was
 I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper, she really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She take me for a joke when I say it
I'm in love with a stripper, gotta get her, I, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club, I'm in love with a stripperYay-ee

Shawty, don't chop me, shorty don't screw me
Yeah, yeah-yeah
Have you ever seen
A dime-piece all alone at the bar?
Bar— Bar
Straight out of a magazine
And you just wanna let her know who you are
Are— Are
So you say, "Let me buy you a drink or a lil' conversation
If that's what you wanna do"
Do— Do
Then she says, "Club is about to end"
Then you say, "Why don't you come to my crib?"
Then she says, "I can't leave my friends"
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
And— And— screwed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been screwed
Screwed, screwed— screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed

Shawty, —ewed —ewed 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty— Shawty, don't screw me
Shawty, don't chop me 
Don't— Don't screw me 
Have you ever been in the V.I.P. room
Of your favorite strip club?
Club— Club
And you got a shawty all on you, kissing on your neck
Makin you feel like she's so in love
Love— Love
Now you done got you a couple drinks
And you're feelin like it's 'bout that time to cuddle up, oh, ooh
Up— Up
Then you say, "Shawty, what's really up?"
She takes a big sip out your cup
Then, she says, "That'll be sixty bucks!"
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed 
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed 
You've officially been chopped— 
Now— Now— Now, shawty why you actin like that— like that?
Like, all you ever really wanna do is just doubt me 
Ludacris, can't— can't live without him
But even mo' I bet you really can't live without me 
You— You must've flipped your wig 
You gotta be out your mind 
I'll chop— chop— chop you, screw you— screw you
Out of your— Out of your spine 
Backbreaker , put you over my knee
Put you on punishment, woman, and I'll spank you 
Have you praisin the Lord like, "Thank you—
Thank you— Thank you— Lord, I wanna thank you!" 
But have you ever met a woman that'll lead you on
And steer you wrong instead of please you? 
Have you singing this song, 'cause all night long
She did nothing but flirt and tease you? 
Well, I gotta admit that I have 
Put one in the air, sit back, and I laugh 
Shawty, why you insist on doing me that bad? 
Probably 'cause of the amount of booty that I've grabbed 
Coming back to haunt me
So instead of being put into submission and subdued
 Guess what, dawg?
Hahaha! L—L—L—Luda!
Now, you've officially been chopped and screwed
Screwed— Screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed
And —ewed —ewed, chopped— screwed— screwed
You've officially been chopped and screwed
And— And— screwed, chopped— screwed— screwed

Screwed, screwed— screwed, chopped— chopped and screwed
You've officially been— and— and skrewed

Shawty, don't screw me 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty, —ewed —ewed 
Shawty— Shawty, don't chop me
Shawty— Shawty, don't screw me
Shawty, don't chop me
Don't— Don't screw me— me—me-me-me
Me—Whoever thought a young'un' from a city full of rattlesnakes
Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
Seven heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga; I couldn't count on the NASDAQ
Coming home from school, I had tears in my eyes
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Now, I got enough hats to give away
It's better days, I refuse to have flashbacks
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
Nobody believed, so nobody would walk me through it
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Said they praying for me, don't we all got needs?
'Til I walk in the room, and they all just freeze
And they all look relieved, like, "Shit
If Faheem made it, now, we all got cheese"
Nah, homie, that ain't the way it work
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
Now, they going crazy 'cause I made it first
See, homie, I just made it work
It's a cold world, ask my old girl
She feel my pain, and I ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
Got that keyboard off the road, brought in the house for me
He coming to my shows, hanging in the crowd for me
Man, I still love my niggas
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
I still rep the 850, yeah
I got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
Don't get me wrong, I ain't saying I stayed the same
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
That's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopefully only great things
Traveling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
Then, one day, I look at my reflection
And realize how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realize I can make an impression
But good Lord, this is fuckin' depressin'
And good Lord, I got some fuckin' questions
I think it's time for some motherfucking confessions
Wake up call, wake up call
My answer to every question was "Fuck y'all"
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said "I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"
Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
Til' Molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
Now I'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
That liqour go to hittin', I'm in here reminiscing
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail?
'Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to Hell
They feel like I owe 'em something 'cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me $300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
'Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
But now I see 'em, and I can't even take iit
Cause he walk up to me and say:
"Boy, I knew you was gon' make it"
And like, "Motherfucker, do you not just recall?
I needed help, and you just left me sittin' on my balls"
That just wasn't the right life
So I told him bullshit, to have a nice life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like nigga, how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
Fuck you bitches, I did what I did
Now, I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
But now, maybe my life is too sweet
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
Deep, I was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
Like crabs up in the bucket, but y'all just got defeated
And all these bitches, all just want my semen
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
Now, they got they hand out, asking me to give it up
And every time they ask me for something
They say, "Now, you know that I ain't never asked you for nothin'"
I got loss, I got loss
Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
Drinking every kind of liquor, then that Molly got swallowed
I know I fucked up 'cause I'm a grown man
So now, I'm thinking like my old man
He said "You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"
Now, I see my niggas just want me to win
But I won't have 'em if I keep disrespecting my friends
They been through it, say they know the feel
So all I need is a trip up to StoicvilleDrink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
Drink with me, drink with me
 
Drink with me, drink with me

The red light I got stopped there I could tell 12 by only
Showed 'em my paper like "Go on nigga", you got the wrong nigga but
On my momma, and on my dad

Racks, fuck ones long as money stack
Been on tour six months, I'm back
Lost weight but my pocket still fat
Niggas just be talkin' cause they got lips
When I put up them choppers niggas get flipped
Hit 'em in the head, stomach, then I reload my clip
I dunno what y'all done heard

Just ask these niggas in the streets
Who had failure to make payments?

That leap of faith'll get you thrown off of the roof, nigga

But you look like Wayne, you sound like Wayne, we gettin' catfished?
Callin' me a has-been when the only thing I have been
Is everything they haven't been
Looking like my mannequins
Somethin' like some amateurs, I call 'em Tunechi Scavengers
I need to sue they managers
All these lil' robots, do they even include the batteries?
Kiss my gluteus maximus
This ain't that and that ain't this, feel like I been cloned, dawg
I just cut your song off, that shit sound like womp-womp
I just cut some me on, that shit lit like neon
Grammys on my shelf
I know some bitches that deserve they panties on my shelf
But they didn't have no underwear
I'm on a planet somewhere else, on a Xan and somethin' else
If these rappers is my sons, as a parent, I have failed
I'm the G.O.A.T
I don't even fuckin' write, but one motherfuckin' quote
Is better than everything you ever motherfuckin' wrote
That's true, she got a G.O.A.T. tattoo
I got a G.O.A.T. statue, you gotta quote that too
From the G.O.A.T. mouthOoh
She got you doin, what you won't do
Now you're sprung and I told you
S-P-R-U-N-G
Now you see

Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

That's got me doin things I said I'd never do 
And I can say I'm amazed
The way you put it on me, how you got me chasin you 
And I could care less, I could give a damn
Cause see you my ride or die
You're a down ass bitch who don't take no shit
Keep it real though and still look fly
Real talk I'ma tell you out the whip
It ain't yo' face and it ain't yo' hips
It's how you roll my weed and lick dem lips
And, when I dip shawty you don't even trip
You give me rubberbands for my grip
You the fly bitch steppin up out my whip
I'm your nigga girl we like "This done"
And when the hook say you got me like dat dere I'm sprung
Oooh she got me doin the dishes
Anything she want for some kisses
I'm cookin for her when she gets hungry
All she do is actin like she want me
She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other 'ronies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leavin quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin everythang with me
When it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. 
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
I'm sprung.. 
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
You do 
So we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin' what I want to
With nobody tellin' me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin' so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin' kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her
Now I'm leavin' quickly
Before she come and try to get me
And I'm takin' everything with me
Well it all come down to her
I'm sprung
Dog she got me!
Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you

Got me doin things I'll never do
If you ain't been, I'm tellin you
You do 
You do 
You do Wayne, I'ma hold you down on this rap shit, mane
Ha, once again it's on
My respect level now is unheard of
Niggas was laughin', now they wish they never heard of 'em
Now they gon' learn to respect me, bruh
I lick a shot, 9 millis get burned in their retina
Have that lead come out the back of your head
One word is what I said, click clack and you're dead
Put one more of them claps in the back of your leg
I hit ya arm, leg, leg, arm, head
Damn, if you was just a virgin to Pain
Just think of me as the R&B version of Wayne
But since he doin' the same thing now it's no difference
Ice grill, hood niggas put your dentures in
He so sweet make her wanna lick the singer
So me and Weezy gang bang her
Pullin' on my roots, I had to hang her, whip her
Tallahassee dick her, I'm back on the map
'Cause he rap, he sang, and he do, his thang
And he does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, it's T-Pain
Bang, bang, yeah
He rap, he sang he do, his thang
He does, we does everything you wish you was
It's T-Wayne, alright, bang, bang
Weezy, oh, oh
It's the white cup dranker
Baby I'm a trapper turned rapper turned sanger
Darlin', suwoo to the bangers
And if you want beef, I'll cook that angus 
Thank God I'm famous
'Cause a lot of these ballers'd be around here chainless
But I made bling bling, yeah, ching, ching
And these sorry-ass rappers make a nigga wanna sing
I'm in love with a stripper
And I send shots like the bartender
And I'm like bitch, ain't me, get in line with the rest
'Cause even the best say Weezy the best
Okay shawty, you ain't messin' with  a Li'zane nor Wizane
Just a Lil Wayne and a whole lot of Pain
You know what I'm sayin'? Like
I'm mind rockin' models with a bottle, if you can't swallow
Shut up, bitch, gargle, that's the motto, holla
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, baby
He rap, he do, he does
Everything you wish you was, it's T-Pain, babeI'm in London, got my beat from London
Boat, boat
Boat, boat
It's G-Eazy, ALLBLACK and Offset Jim
I could spend a milli', got a check 
This is not a Rollie, this an Audemars Piguet, nah
Diamonds sparkling, jumping out the neck 
I don't do commercial, got the Goyard on the jet, nah
I can spend a milli', got a check 
This a Richard Millie, this not the new Patek, nah 
Water, floodin' out the new baguettes
That's a big flex, I'm just shitting on my ex, nah 
Off the dribble, I've been tryna keep it civil 
But it's a lot of shade that's gettin' thrown, they sentimental
They see my bank triple, meanwhile, they money little
Two bitches on both sides of me, I'm Malcom in the Middle
I could spend a ticket on baguettes 
Instead I spent 90 out to Paris, private jets
Just to fuck, that's expensive sex 
Had a session, I had to get back, another 90 to LAX
I be out here , I be tucked off 
Let's go to the bathroom, I'm trying to get sucked off
Took a leap of faith, she was a jump off 
Paparazzi in my face, bitch, fuck off 
I could spend a milli', got a check 
This is not a Rollie, this an Audemars Piguet, nah 
Diamonds sparkling, jumping out the neck 
I don't do commercial, got the Goyard on the jet, nah
I can spend a milli', got a check 
This a Richard Millie, this not the new Patek, nah
Water, floodin' out the new baguettes
That's a big flex, I'm just shitting on my ex, nah 
She keep trying to suck me, I told her, "Not now" 
She threw me the keys to the 'Rari, I'm out here acting out 
I cherish these moments when I'm bent, off Stillhouse 
I was in Dallas, Texas full of planes, so I pulled the stack out 
Went from sweatin' the blade, now the stu' is the trap house 
Treat the bitch like full 12's and blew her back out 
Been loaded as fuck this whole year, it's a money high
Smashin', dashin', trappin' in fashion, I was on the fly
Take watches, chains, reins, had to kill his pride 
Going back and forth to the A, like I'm doing suicides
I don't know Richard Millie, and I don't know Roll Tide
But I am knowing how to get this cash, po-pimp or die, ayy
I could spend a milli', got a check 
This is not a Rollie, this an Audemars Piguet, nah 
Diamonds sparkling, jumping out the neck 
I don't do commercial, got the Goyard on the jet, nah
I can spend a milli', got a check 
This a Richard Millie, this not the new Patek, nah
Water, floodin' out the new baguettes 
That's a big flex, I'm just shitting on my ex, nah 
When that bag touch down, I feel like Mitch 
Touchdown, touchdown, I don't throw no picks 
Diamonds in my mouth, 'bout half a brick 
On the road, doing shows, still get you hit 
Trap nigga, trap nigga, and that's no cap 
Velcro, velcro, I'm always strapped
Mailman, mailman, I got that bag 
Got everything these niggas wish they had
Spent my backend all on packs, it ain't no cappin' with me 
Every nigga with me got it, ain't no lackin' with me 
Bend that corner on 19th and see what's happening with me
Bitches say I'm Hollywood since I've been fuckin' with G-Eazy
I could spend a milli', got a check 
This is not a Rollie, this an Audemars Piguet, nah
Diamonds sparkling, jumping out the neck 
I don't do commercial, got the Goyard on the jet, nah
I can spend a milli', got a check 
This a Richard Millie, this not the new Patek, nah
Water, floodin' out the new baguettes 
That's a big flex, I'm just shitting on my ex, nahAhhhhhh
Take a sip of this
Ayyy, yeah, let's go
Ahh, ahh
I want you to feel this beat baby 
One more time, let's go!
Feel it, ahh

 Gotta get missing!
You ain't gotta kick me out 
I'll get out my own house 
But you still need to get your shit together, girl
Gotta get us back to the way that we used to be back in the day
Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me, all we need is therapy like
 Get the hell up out my door
 I don't need your sex, I'll masturbate
 You can go to hell all I care

Can't do it, shawty, can't deal with you, babe

But I know I cannot stay 
'Cause you still gotta get your shit together, girl

Shawty, you ain't gotta be scared of me, all we need is therapy like

Just to talk, just a thought
I'ma get a girl with a ass just as soft
You swear men dogs like Reservoir
And I was Mr. Pink
Remember those nights on the kitchen sink?
I was choking you in a good way, good way
Now, we in the streets, and I'm choking you in a hood way
When the cops come, what I could say?
You know how all that gossip is
Next morning: Bossip, Perez
Any girl I take out, MediaTakeOut, I need a break now
Before I break now, ah-ah 
Show me your Janet Jacksons if you nasty
You said you want to cut my nuts off like Jesse Jackson, classy
Ooh, why she say that? Ouch!
Bitch! Give me back my couch
On that same couch, casting
Now listen to T-Pain' ass sing
 Get the hell up out my door

 You can go to hell, all I care
I can't do it, shawty , can't deal with you, babe 
Can't handle the pressure of you 
Can't do it, shawty, can't deal with you, babe 
Can't handle the pressure of you

I hit it man, roll it and... oh you got one? Aight
Let me hit that shit man
You can knock, on my door but ain't, nobody home
I might be there, but I'm gone cause I'm stuck off a zone
I'm "Half Baked" like the guy on the couch, I don't get high I'm a grouch
So I puff, on my line and be out
I call my road dog, pick me up with weed, let's hit the road dawg
You blew it with a hood rat, the fuck you break the code for?
God damn I think that I'm high, too much haze
But I, see my ghost pass within the blink of a eye
And them ghetto niggas, know how it feel
I smoke more than a buildin on fire roll more than the wheel
I get stuck like a car in the mud, and blow my greens out
And call my nigga T-Pain to borrow some buds
And then choke, 'til I think I'mma cry, or I think I'mma die
Nah dawg, I just think that I'm high, shhh
See I ain't ever smoked befo'
So I'mma take two hits and I'mma blowwww my mind away
I never thought I'd be gettin high today-ay-hey-ayy
Now it's on me again so I take another pull - hooooo!
We in the Cadillac, floatin like the ocean
Suddenly everything was movin in slow motion
So I take another hit, and try to relax
I'm beatin on my chest, CJ beatin on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm 'bout to die
But I got it, I got it, WHOA~!
So I passed the blunt, it came right back to me
But I know that this smoke is still runnin through me
I don't think I'mma ever open my eyes
My homeboy said, "Why?" And I said cause
I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I think that I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Dawg I feel like I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
I really think that I'm high-iiiiiiigh-iiiiiiiiiigh
Shit, God damn
DAMN~! Please stop by the sto'
Cause my, mouth dry and I done ran out of Ho's
Oh, them Little Debbies got me lickin my chops
But I just, want a drink and Newport shorts in the box
Maybe a Swisher Kaing or three, I seen fine behind
That want to hang with me, long as I bring the weed
I said cool, I'mma ride on through
Thirty minutes later we was getting high in the room
And then I, take another hit, and try to relax
I'm beatin on my chest as God is beatin on my back
Somebody help me I think I'm 'bout to die
But I got it, don't touch me I got it, OHH~!
I passed the blunt and it came right back to me
But I know that this smoke is still runnin through me
I don't think I'mma ever open my eyes
My homegirl said, "Why?" And I said that

{*coughing and breathing hard*}
Weavin y'all
Oh I'm high as fuck dawgI didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounded like a train
We made a movie
And I was so proud of my address
Repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on the Chevy
Cause every song was like
Nappy head, smoke, drank, Tallahassee, what's up?
Moon on Wednesday, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
"Work hard, play hard"  "Money over everything"
Cowboy hat and a hubcap for the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasy
I represent that 904 
And every weekend you can catch me in the runnings
And everybody who know me know
That I rep the Win Squad
And them niggas getting money
Them niggas used to say
"There go Young Cash tippin' in that Ace 2"
T-Pain call my phone, telling me to come through
But I don't care cause never ever did I dream
That Teddy Pain would grow up and now we makin' millions
Got enough money to take care of our children
And I don't care, cause we came from nothing
And most niggas ain't loyal 
My dog came back for me 
He got me off on XRC
When I was still movin' keys
When a nigga went to prison
Everybody turned their backs on me
But it's cool
Young Cash gon keep it GHey
Woo, sup girl?

Hahaha, sop you up with a biscuit, haha
Lately I been tryin' to stop lyin'
But I'd be lyin' if I said that I wasn't blinded by that ass, girl
And I would go to hell as well
If I said you didn't smell like Victoria's Secret when you passed, girl
And the plaid skirt you got on
Lets a nigga know you just might have some class, girl
So you gotta have you some brain
And with all due respect then you got'sta pass it to Pain, uh
Got'sta pass it to Wayne
And if Wayne pass you on then he pass you to Mack Maine

If the love don't, don't end with love
So with you I'm gon' begin with love, yeah
And really I don't be goin' out like that no more unless it's to shop
But with you I wanna go to the top

'Cause everybody try to buy that bitch from me
But I will never sell, hell
Mids and highs and 4-12s
24 inches, chopped seats, complete with the Pirells, yeah
Inside got baby blue 'gator scales
Even on the bottom of the seat, you can see the 'gator tail
My shit hard as a turtle shell
Plus I got a mothafuckin' motor that'll make them tires yell
When I was 11, dawg, I learned 'bout my Chevy, dawg
I burned the Pirellis off, convertible, take it off
Believe my leather stayin' soft
That's why I'm at the start line, 'bout to take it off
Heavy Chevys, heavy, heavy Chevys, man
A'ight, see?  You gotta learn, big bruh

And I love that bitch so much, tomorrow I'ma wear the fan belt
Speakers in the bed sound like I got band help
Beatin' down yo' block, leave you with a damn welt
I used to have a '64 a few years ago
I had that bitch on three wheels on one of my old videos
Now I got a honey SS, I call it Cheerio
But my neighbors call it, "Please turn down the stereo!"
Now cut that hoe up louder
24 karat gold pipes on the low Impala
See Pain, I knew a lil' somethin', but thanks for the lesson

In the spirit of Chevys
Heavy Chevys, heavy, h-heavy Chevys, man
I'ma switch to T-Wayne and take it back
I said, a long, long time ago
I can still remember how that music used to make me smile
And I knew if I had my chance, I could make the people dance
And maybe they'd be happy for a while
Oh, but February made me shiver with every paper I deliver
Bad news on the doorstep
I couldn't take one more step
I can't remember if I cried when I read about his widowed bride
But somethin' touched me deep inside the day the music died
So bye-bye Ms. American Pie
Drove my Chevy to the levee but the levee was dry
And them good ol' boys was drinkin' whiskey and rye
Singin' this'll be the day that I die, day that I dieShe got a booty with a motor in it
Look at how she wind it
Shaking, popping, got my soda fizzing
I want to get behind it

StudioThe world keeps spinnin', with or without me
And I know, that's hard to believe
And now I'm in a box, with nothin' around me
Cause I found, a girl that'll get on her knees at ease
And all the while, I'm knowin' that my homies will clown me
Cause I fucked her - and didn't have a rubber on me
It seems I had to find out the hard way
That the girl, that I found, in the crowd, she had H-I-V
And now she next to me like
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la 
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la 
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la 
La-la-la, la-la, la, la la, la-la-la
One, two, three, four, five, six million ways
To leave, this whole wide world, so cold
Stuck on my ass, I been drinkin' for days
And I got the nerve to put that Bonneville on the road
Got that thang on me, and a couple kilos
A bag of ecstasy, and a pound of that dro
But I guess, I had to find out the hard way
Cause I done came, to the End of the Road
And now I'm in the mirror like
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la 
La-la-la, la-la, la, la-la-la, la-la, la

I've never been a big fan of December
The nights get cold
Nobody there to take care of me
Nobody there to tell me that they love me
And nobody knows
But we were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, all day
And now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
In this crazy world, we all deserve a second chance
Don't back down, don't back down, not now, not never
What's your agenda, I never claimed that I wasn't a sinner
Bless my soul

I might drown in all these haters out of control
We were born and raised in the days
Where you couldn't even pay to get away from the pain
And that's where we live, permanently
But now we get paid to be slaves of our very own grave
And I say it every goddamn day, "That's no way to live"
No, not for me
I've been called the murderer, killer
I've just played with the hand that they deal us
I've been called a loser, an outlaw
Shut down in my very own backyard

Runnin' in place and can't make no ground
I keep tellin’ my dawg to make they own sound
Put them O's down, the police comin' and it's over now
Yeah, havin' that pack ain't where it's at
Put your city on the map, and leave that bitch behind your back
'Cause them niggas gon' start hatin' all the sudden
And if they can't find you, they make examples out your cousin
What the fuck is goin' on with niggas?
Somethin' wrong with niggas
You make that cake and can't feel safe in your own home with niggas
But if you can't stay out that place, then you belong with niggas
And you gone raise that lil baby to be a grown lil nigga
Supposedly, we all should be destined for the same fate
Tryna impress all these niggas just to save face
Bigger guns, bigger whips, we in the same race
Then we end up in the same place
Yeah, yeah
Man, I swear that I got one up on these niggas
Bling, blow, put that gun up, fuck these niggas
Use that second chance to make a better plan
Be a better man or it's whatever, man

Bling, blow, put that gun up, fuck these niggas
Use that second chance to make a better plan
Be a better man or it's whatever, man
Swear my grind was hard as I hustled hard
Prayin' for these blessings, gave it all to God
Ain't nobody have faith in Betty grandboy
Pain made a phone call and now I'm headed north
It's shame my own city hate to see me shine
Bitch, I'm focused on these millions, we need every dime
NappyBoy to the death, I'm talkin' dotted lines
Got everybody lookin' froze like a broken spine
Knew my time was comin', all it took was patience
Actions speak louder than words, so now they really hatin'
Business over bullshit when we at the occasion
And you know we 'bout them chips like a trip to Vegas
Made it out the hood but still love Ty
1700 forever, RIP to Jah
Made a vow to my son that I would never stop
And if I ever got a chance, I would never flop

Use that second chance to make a better plan
Be a better man or it's whatever, man

{Alternating between T-Pain and Young Cash every two bars, starting with Young Cash}
Cash in the vert, Pain in the Bugatti
15's in the bike kickin' like karate
Pussies get wet every time I say "shawty"
Chevy tall like a flyin' carpet, Teddy Abu Dhabi
Louis on my feet, Kanye West's
Aim for the head, boy, no need for the vests
Teddy protein, bitch, put it in yo' breakfast
I'm fly as fuck like I was related to the Jetsons
, who wanna ride with me?
Nine in my Levis, skinny jeans won't fit me
Everyday my birthday, this young nigga gifted
Seven-figure nigga still reppin' 850
Now I'm at the mall, no money, don't trip
Pain got a car the color Whoopie Goldberg's lips
Plus I got a gun the color of yo' girlfriend tongue-ring
They be like, "Them Nappy Boy niggas is on something, this shit bumping"I gotta talk to my lady
I don’t know why, but lately
Seem like she don’t love me no more, love me no more
She flipped the script on me, one-eighty
Oh, now  baby, why you acting like that for? Like that for?
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out what did I do?
Or is she cheating on me and she’s falling in love with du'?
But she talk to me in a week, and I’m losing my mind
But if she don’t care about commitment
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind if I commit love suicide
If I commit love suicide
She won’t mind
We need to talk, really really
Kill this relationship quickly
This ain’t gonna work no more, work no more
Go 'head and walk, get the hell out
Me and you, we done fell out
I don’t wanna hurt no more, hurt no more
She got me thinking about it
And I’m tryna figure out where I went wrong
Cause all she do is party, party, party
In the club rockin’ all night long
I be going insane, shawty jump around like she House of Pain
Type to have you thinking about blowing out your brains
Gettin' the gas, lightin' the matches, then your whole house in flames
Yeah, I’m tripping I suppose
Knowing I ain’t supposed to be tripping on these hoes
Knowing I could have any bitches doing shows
If I scream “Who is that?” watch the bitches hit the floor
They say that I’m the dude
The girls think I’m trippin’, they say that I’m a fool
Missing all the fun, stressin’ over you
Got me so disgusted, I don’t know what to do
Now I’m on the edge, feeling terrible inside
The way I feel is too unbearable to hide
Got me jumping off the cliff, middle finger to the sky
Screaming “Fuck you and I”
She won’t mind if I commit love suicideWelcome to epicness, I’m so dope and it’s effortless
Yeah I’m tryna brag and boast
If you looking for the shit nigga step in this
Disa my ting, hoes in back room kissing my ring
Ready for the day, hit me with the Visine
Getting to the money, counting up the ice cream
Me a baller boy, she with me, you better not call her boy
I'mma pass her round to all my boys
Cause she want the nuts like Almond Joy
Yeah, price tag don’t matter
If it ain’t about money then it’s just chit chatter
Bank account steady climbing up the ladder
You can literally see all of my pockets getting fatter

The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole 
Look at the laffy taffy when she pop, she roll 
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video you get the popular role 
In the V.I.P. they get a little lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear, telling me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on your nipple like Pac-Man
She freaking she licking she rubbing
Then she pulled my dick out and start sucking
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home

She took me for a joke when I said it
I'm in love with a stripper
Got it real hot, gotta get with her

Got it real hot, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper
Uh, yo I'm Pimp C
I'm a P-I-M-P, tricking ain't in my pedigree
It really ain't bout no square love
It's strictly cause she paying me
She be wantin' lay me but I can't do too much of that
Cuz even though yo ass fat, freaking off ain't where it's at
But I can show you how to get out there and get it
You love yo daddy I know ya with it
That's why I got love for you
Cuz you get out there and do what it do
Workin my piece and work the pole
Break the trick you gotta pay to roll 
Get the money break 'em off 
And we in the Benz and we scratchin' off
It was love at first sight when I've seen that ass shaking
And 'bout fifty dollars later it was love in the making 
You simply won my heart when I saw the way you work that pole
And when you bent over you had my wallet in a choke hold 
I saw you in your birthday suit and baby it was fate
When you give me a lap dance its like we gone on a date 
But I feel like ya cheating on me when I see you dancing with other guys
I'm runnin' low on ones, I can't lie I'm in love baby
I'm in love with a stripper

I'm in love with a stripper 
I must be the first man to ever fall in love with a 
Gonna bow down on my knees and ask that ass to marry me
That booty makes me forget about any chick I freaked with in my past
Cause we got a lot in common: she's a stripper, I'm a freak
Made me wanna grab it, I got a habit, I gotta have it
You can call me the man of steel, cause that ass is just like a magnet
Damn! You got me so in love 
Can't stay away from this club 
Everytime I find myself rolling up on them dubs 
I've been around the world
Seen booty all the time 
I never seen a booty that's so pretty so so fine
 Coming down the pole
No secret why I'm cause girl you keep my donk on swole
When it "drop drop" when it "pop pop" and when it "hop hop"
Baby, the way you doing that thing don't you stop stop
I want to stick it, want to kiss it
If I could I'd put my whole damn head in it
Cause I'm in love with a stripper

She took me for a joke when I said it
I'm in love with a stripper
Got it real hot, gotta get with her
I can't stay out this club
I'm in love with a stripper
I'm in love with a stripper, I need to get some stripper counselin'
Cause I'm the first one in the front row when they make a stripper announcement
I think I'm falling in love with the one with the most ass
Thin, little bitty waist, I'm go and buy that bitch a Volkswagen
MJG, pimp tight, no mo' tipping stop the bill
If I come in here one more night I'm gonna need Dr. Phil
But I'm a G, I'll step back and tell them bitches outright
Ain't no way I can turn a stripper to a housewife
The last girl was pretty, but she wasn't fine as you
She was sexy but she couldn't do the things you do
She could dance but nothing like the way you move
I used to want her until the day I saw you
I'm a grown ass man I thought I'd seen it all
Doing all that on the pole and didn't even fall
And right then I knew exactly what it was 
I wanna fuck the baddest bitch in the club
I'm in love with a stripper
She really think I'm playing, I'm playing
She took me for a joke when I said it
I'm in love with a stripper
Got it real hot, gotta get with her

If I could change the world
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change, if I could change
If I could change the world, the world, the world, the world
Ooh there would be no more wars
Opportunity knockin' on doors for us, for us
Nobody ain't known each other
Buddies turning into lovers for us, for us
Oh when the moonlight turns to sunshine
Everybody waking up to abandon dreams 
Cause everybody need what they want
But don't want what they need; let's talk about unity
Changing the world!
If I could change the world 
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe 
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change , if I could change 
If I could change the world, the world, the world, the world
If I could change the world
I order for the line to be erased that the border this day
This day, everyone deserves an opportunity
There be no new world order
If nobody wouldn't never got slaughtered that way
That way, that means so much more love and unity
Daughters will be close to their mothers
Sons will be raised by their fathers today
Today, a good family ain't nothing greater
Races crimes, hate crimes will never exist, I'll turn everyone into a Hershey's kiss 
And we can eat away our fear , ooooh
If I could change the world 
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe 
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change , if I could change 
If I could change the world , the world , the world, the world
There would be no self hate
We will all have to love everything about ourselves, so we can love everyone else
Nothing would hold us down
Because we'll all walk around with a smile and never frown and that will remove those clouds
There'll be no more self-loathing
Everyone will know in their hearts that they just fine and that's when the light's gonna shine
Everyone will understand
In order to have some peace you must believe, believe the best in you
Believe I can change
If I could change the world
Oh, I would be the sunlight in your universe 
Oh, you will think my love was really something good, baby
If I could change , if I could change the world
If I could, if I could change the world, the world, the world, the worldBitch

Been drankin' a little bit
What you wanna say, girl? 
What you gon' say, girl? 
Gon' and tell the room, girl 
Listen, bitch
They call me M.C. Boombox
'Cause when I got a bitch I just boom box
Send her home with no shoes and two socks
Keep the shit real like The Boondocks 
So call me Teddy McGruder 
If her nigga act up then I'ma let out the Ruger 
I done ripped this bitch up, call me Freddy the Kreuger 
She won't go to sleep, she stay up watchin' me on computers
Damn, she infatuated
Fell in love with my swag and how fast I ate it
But it's not out of the norm when I bring the dick storm
All these bitches be so fascinated and they say 
Yeah bitch, what you tryna say? 
What I had you sayin' all day? 
I got a bitch from New Orleans she said, "Aw yeah"
Said, "Yeah bitch, I know, that's what they all say"One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga
Better duck nigga, unless you got a bulletproof truck nigga
Cause you the only one throwing money in the club
You the only one that’s gone be stuck nigga
Your ass out of luck nigga, tryna stunt but you’re stunting too much nigga
And my face just way too pretty
So I ain’t tryna punch niggas
What’s up nigga?
Everything cool right now but it could go left
So I don’t trust niggas, no niggas, I don’t even trust myself
It get deeper, mama said y’all niggas don’t give a fuck till the crew hot
And I believe her
One of these days you niggas gonna try to take me out like 2Pac
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga
I done laid in a niggas bushes 3 whole days and 3 whole nights
Just served that boy a whole thing but I got to get my shit byke
I got trust issues, I don’t fuck with you, nigga might be them federals
So I serve a nigga then rob a bank, hit the strip club then blow a check at Follies
 nigga on G code, since serving out the trap out the peephole
Got a sawed off shotty and an automatic weapon
On the couch sitting there like it’s legal
And no nigga, I am no Migo
I’m a Florida nigga and you can get your issue
And I don’t even trust you niggas in my dreams
So you know a nigga still sleeping with the pistol
Like that!
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga
I’m ahead of my time, and everybody late
Ain’t nobody real, everybody fake
I’m a diamond in the rough man, you just fugazi
Smoke can't stand me, Ludacris hate me
Nappy Boy shit, we make bread
Cut a nigga off like T-Pain’s dreads
If Cash don’t like you, I don’t fuck with you
99 percent of these boys fuck niggas
And 99 percent of these rappers nowadays is gay
On the low they probably fuck niggas
And that’s where you lost me
Before I trust niggas I’d rather take prescription pills from Bill Cosby
Two words for you, blucka! blucka!
Clique tighter than pants on Thugger Thugger
Then get robbed, see them killers in the masks
You ain’t on this song, got a bullet for your ass like
One day niggas gone learn not to fuck with me
The heater on my side, I’ll burn me a fuck nigga
Fuck nigga, I got trust issues, I don’t really trust niggas
You only got one life to live, might as well turn up nigga.

You ain't going to get your ass pumped dude, ain't nobody trying to look for you my nigga. You can say gay things but not be seen as gay. You don't gotta say, 'No homo.' You ain't gotta say, 'I want a hot dog, no homo...' Be comfortable with your manhood. We know you fuck bitches my nigga

I think the radio is getting more gay-friendly. I don't think urban music is getting more gay-friendly because if that was the case, Frank Ocean would be on a lot more songs. I know niggas that will not do a song with Frank Ocean just because he gay, but they need him on the fucking song and that's so terrible to me man...

You gon’ either buck down
Or you gon’ get fucked up
It’s Kill or be killed
Get buck or get fucked up, nigga
1-2-3-4-5-6-7-8-9 Hit 'em one more time
Follow my Ghetto Commandments
Nigga, first of all 
I’m the first and last 
You just the first to fall 
I’m just the first to blast 
If you’re gonna curse us all, 
Then I’m gonna have to curse yo ass
Then leave you in the park
Underneath a bunch of dirt and grass 
I’m the only me, 
But I’m the first to bust 
And you’re the first victim, 
Quenching my thirst for blood 
Trust me homie, you don’t want to go to work with us 
I’ll turn you hook to ashes
And turn your verse to dust
Tell me what’s the difference between love and lust?
Cause I love the love 
But I’m in love with lust 
Walk up to your bitch and tell her I would love to cut
And when them devils come up
Leave the crack in the crack of her butt 
Make her lay down in a back of a back of a truck 
And when she come up like a squirrel
She just asking for nuts 
24s on my Caddy I’m just askin’ for putt 
So when you come up to my trap you’re just asking for us
They say thou shall not talk, 
Thou shall not speak, 
Thou shall bow in the presences of a G 
I spray mace in a bad boy’s eye
Leave his shit all puffy so
Thou shall not see 
Thou shall not smile
Thou shall never show his teeth
I'll paint thou art thou, thou shall repeat
Thou shall not 
Bitch I said don’t talk
Shoot you in your ass and stab your feet
Now how you’re gonna walk?
I’m sick in the head, I piss in the bed
Hop up out the ocean and I leave the fisherman red
So much blood on the set, the cops hollerin’ out “soo-woo”
Bitch I’m from New Orleans, you know I know that voodoo
IPod blastin’, 2pac yeah hit ‘em up
Chow down, spit ‘em up
Black bag, get ‘em up
Call the chef tonight, were having sinners for dinner
Ain't no wireless in the hood, so I ain't talking about Twitter
When I say
The run around, the rap around 
You talk, then you walk, me I’m shaftin’ down 
See me and the pigs, we don’t fuck around 
That snitching in the hood, lemme’ break that down 
They do theirs, we do ours, understand me?
I’m blued up, crippin’ with my family
And we don’t give a fuck about the
POs, the COs, cause we know
If we goes
Then we go
We do time, then parole
Now I’m back on the black at night shift
Stack on the top I’m cockin’ it
Back in the block and you know I’m cooping it
Shoebox full of money with a sock in it
And we celebrating the ghetto by popping it
So no champagne or crystola
Machine guns and pistolas--
Blaw, hood shit
Like that? Game over 
See in my hood we crip, or dip
So follow me, follow me, follow me, follow me

They see the Sean John coats tag
They see my wife hoppin' out the Lamborghini with the Coach bag
I'm gettin' paid for nuttin'
Sittin' back, drinkin' lemonade, chillin' in the shade; I'm stuntin'
Makin' hits when I graze the button
Go ahead and put them two baby seats in my Escalade
It's nothin', I'm gettin' money
Learned from the past and the future
Learned not to never stab a nigga that'll shoot ya
Even though my pockets gettin' fatter
I'm still gettin' Tallahassee love, and that's all that matters

I've been there, and I've been back
But somethin' here, always brings me back

I call it me being the bigger man then you think I am
I got the money, money and the cars, cars and the clothes
And unless I want to let it all go
I just gotta be more careful x3
Yeah, and you already know I feel
Shit, I almost forgot how good the lies feel
'Cause when you think you're on top if the world
You come to realize your standing in some high heels
So that Nuvo got me popping shit
And even worse nobody around me is knocking it
'Cause they don’t say what's on their mind
Until I say what's on mine, and now they trying just to stop the shit
Cause to them it's just the ego
But I'm a straight shooter so they call me for the free throws
Now most days rocking hard with the chicos
But I still got a nine and some green like Geno
And in order for me to live right, I gotta change
But after five years of being hated on I got deranged
I live good, but homie I ain’t got the range
I make the 6-4 go up and down like the stock exchange
Okay, they say my girl look regular
But having a bad bitch don’t make you better bruh
And she don’t diss me like your bitch ass
She’ll let me fuck your girl and even help me spread that bitch ass
And you want me to fuck the best girl
But the model hoes get sideways like a s curl
And I don’t get attitude I get respect
'Cause she was with me three years before I got a check
So I can keep my girl and live happy on the boat
Or a freaky fine bitch that’ll have me going broke
But I'll never leaver her, 'cause she a go-getter
Even if she go to Hell, I'mma go with her
And you bitches hating on her because she light skinned
But look at the fucking industry that I'm in
I'm the only artist with dark girls in my videos
So a bad attitude and a dick is what I give you hoes
Alright, so lets talk about the Jay shit
Some days I wish that I ain't never say shit
And Diddy said there ain't no excuse for what I did
But I felt like he was knocking the same shit that feed my kids
I do music 'cause I need it to make my world spin
So when you down it, it's like you dissing my girlfriend
And Jay one of the only niggas I hear bringing it
So I didn’t think that he would even entertain the shit
Because entertainment is see through
But if you really feel like I'm dead, then nigga me too
I ain't trying to write your rhyme
But you could’ve skip one DJ
And all you had to say was "T-pain, we cool."
But by all mean don’t take it as a diss or hating
I just want to explain my side of the situation
So if you knew just how much respect I had
You know I'm a real nigga when I say...my bad
Yeah
I'm just a real nigga man
I don’t sugar coat nothing
Anything I say I stand by it so
You can hear my reasons and you can think what you think but
I'm gonna be a real nigga regardless of what's going on
You know what I'm saying?
Revolver, coming at you man

You gotta be kidding, that big dog with that small cat
I'm the dean, I got a permanent hall pass
So when you see me in the hall, you better haul ass
F-F-F-Fall back, all my watches is wrong
3 hours late to the Grammys, you can watch me at home
My 808's a gracious taste like a Glock to the dome
Ten thousand dollar suit, you think I was mocking Capone
These people hate the truth if you don't believe in that
Then why the paparazzi don't give a fuck where I'm eating at
Cause you know real niggas ride and wack niggas hate
So then you realize

But what they can't see

So what makes you so different? Is this what you deserve?
I've been eatin', I've been eatin', I'm not ready for dessert

Praise the Lord, nigga; you got me!

'Cause that's the same number I've been seein' in your phone lately
My brain was at a million miles an hour, baby

You should've just told me you wanna split up, huh
Ooh, we gotta talk when you get home, baby

Somehow this is my fault 
I didn't say shit when I saw what I saw 
Yeah, girl, you can't deny now 
Even your daddy know that you got you a side jawn, goddamn
How could you keep this from me?
I can't believe I told you that I love you

Your mama and your daddy ain't shit
When you see 'em, tell both of 'em I said fuck 'em, yeah
Oh, how does it feel to know you took it too far? 
I kept it real, now I'm callin' this shit off 
You broke the seal, now you're lookin' real lost
I had a feelin' you was doing somethin' stupid
Why'd I let you move in?
Why would you do this?
Somehow this is my fault

Your mama and your daddy ain't shit
When you see 'em, tell both of 'em I said fuck 'em, yeahSee once upon a time there was a girl
That fell in love with a boy
And he watched the news while she was cleaning his shoes every day
See I wish we lived in a perfect world
Cause for this boy and this girl
Their relationship sucked, they never ever made love
They barely talked to each other
But you would think they were the perfect couple
Not knowing that they both been living double
They go out to eat and every time that they meet they'd get along
Sit down and then they talk and even smile
Cause nobody knows all the while
At the end of the night they gonna get in a fight when they get home
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could , if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could
See once upon a time there was a man
Who was in love with a lady
They went on morning walks and they would talk and talk
'Bout how they are happily married
One day that man went on a ride
And had a girl in his passnger side
Then the lady saw him and she tried to call him
But she ain't get no answer
She leaving voicemails, texting
Cause all she can think about is him and the girl sexing
The best thing to do is follow him to the spot
And she gon' kick the door in if he like it or not
So the lady , went crazy 
She said, "How can you do this to me baby?"
She told him to go 'head and stay with the girl he with
But he better pack his shit when he get home
And that's why I, wish that I could live in a fairytale
Cause everyday would be so good
But when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I could , if I could
And I would kill myself if I could
Cause when it comes to this love thing
I'mma shove-over
And I would kill myself if I couldOkay

Before the rumors spread and make their way 
I thought I'd be a man and tell you first
But I know it's going to hurt
Baby please let me explain 
It happened all the sudden out of control 
She had my heart and would not let it go 
I'm not tryin' to say that it was okay
Or that I didn't do it
But I gotta tell the truth 
With my right hand up
 It's time to man up
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way
Baby  would've never seen her walkin' down the block
I probably would have not, pulled over and asked her
If she needed 
But I noticed she had makeup on her eyes
Then she started to cry
I said baby, please explain 
She said her man put his hands on her
He was outta control 
And she really need someone to hold and not let go
And then she looked into my eyes just like you do
Then I imagined she was you
Now I gotta tell the truth 
With my right hand up
 It's time to man up
Baby believe me when I say
You don't wanna find out the hard way
Baby now I wish that I, was a magician and I
Could make all of this disappear
And baby I wish that I, could go back in time
And trust me baby, we wouldn't be here 
But you've been so good to me, how could I do this to you?
And I never meant to hurt you, how can I prove it to you?
I'm just tryin' to say what's been on my mind
Cause it hurts you
I gotta tell the truth 
With my right hand up
 It's time to man up

You've been looking for love now, in all
In all the wrong places, I know, I know

I crash with bad times I'm run in bad luck
I'm down to my last 3 dollars and nobody wanna holla when you sitting on the bottom
I need new shoes and my baby need bottles
Anything for that change I be out here for a throttle
Riding and broke and tryin' to come up on this game
It's over the love of the green I be bosted on the scroll with them dough finge late night
Fried jay Glock super hot like a bench pipe
I tried to turn the other cheek but they gon' kick me on my creek if I laid another week
So I picked up the phone and called the dope man and tell them that I need my supply
So I can get back to what I used to I got a hole in my pocket like a fruit loop
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
There's only 25 cent of a hundred I know
And I had so much money before
But now there's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
Sang it with me there was a hole in the ground
The most troubling hole that you ever seen
But I had so much money before
There's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
Here I roam for one more
Sometimes I feel like I'ma never get apart from broke
And keep a job so back to the streets to go
Worry about the rent tryin' to get up out this hole
I'm tired of living this life so this time I got my mind made up
No more bullshit and time to man up
I'm tryin' to have a better life
Big nice house for the kids and the wife
And get my mama that benz and get my sister that jag
And get my brother that donk and get my daddy that lamb
'Cause I'm tired of being broke tired of living hard
Tired of worrying about gas money for the car
Sometimes I wanna let go but I got a gang control
And get a grip and never let go
Straight forward it's time it's time to get dough
It's a hole in my pocket where my money should go
9 to 5 just went to hell
Every cousin I got is in jail
I know,  I gotta do better 
Time to get off my ass, get this money but not too fast
'Cause I know that it's so possible to burn a hole in myLook at you shawty
Look at me
Look at you shawty
Look at me
All that ass girl you gotta give me something
How you fit all that into them leggings

Girl, I know your nervous, but it ain't no time, like showtime
No, it ain't no time like showtime, come on girlLadies & Gentlemen these are my hang ups
Let me explain
It’s kinda hard not to be a dick
But y’all these pussies round here they looking for the shit
And by God they found ‘em burried under the ground
Thinking ’bout what he has done thinking
If he keep doing it one day the money will come
One of his sons can get it done if he wanna become
That son of a gun that leave ‘em home when he wanna get drunk
Then he come back and slum back on that hole that he bring
And you can use shit but drop your head in fucking disgust
This underdog shit has to stop
‘Cause if they had an ounce of respect a half a cup
You fucking admit that every song that I smashed you then dropped
And you’re carrer would’ve been done bitch like it or not
I came to take my crown back it’s about time
So you about facing I’ll be about mine
Every nigga that shined on me has been outshined
I’m ripping new assholes and snatching out spines
It’s kinda hard not to be a bitch when everybody tryin’ to fuck you
Then use you when they need you then do their best to duck you
But since nobody called or answer emails
Tell ‘em to kiss my ass and spare me the fucking details
‘Cause ain’t no such thing as the best next thing
Unless you talking about how this is better than 3 rings
And niggas catching on like damn he ain’t wrong
These niggas is getting Grammy’s from makin T pain songs
Yeahhhh, and you can blame it on that
And if you got something to say then you can lay it on wax
‘Cause I ain’t disrespecting I’m just pissed off a lil bit
I put in all the work and you gettin’ all the attention
And when they do their speeches T-Pain they never mention
That’s how niggas automatically get on my shit list
So in conclusion I’m actually a nice dude
And to my real fans excuse my shitty attitude
It’s kinda hard to please everybody
And keep yourself happy and your kids asking
We ain’t got no money left daddy?
And you say yeah, but it fell into the wrong hands
That’s some hard shit to say when you a grown man
But I’ma get it motherfuck excuses
Plus these niggas thought they finally got T-Pain to chuck the deuces
Here they walk into my studio and play their fucking music
I play what I been doin’ they tell me it’s fucking stupid
Then they leave and tell their security I’m fucking losing
And all them young fire beats was too fucking confusing
They can’t keep up with me I’m classified as a nuisance
And next time that I see them they say they got new and newer shit
But they sound just like the shit I showed them the first time
With way less music and way worse rhyme
So this my farewall I’m sorry for the fallout
I’m cutting my phone off I bet you niggas call nowYeah 
We gon' win and I put that on my life 
Diamonds everywhere, I put that on my wife 
Handle that, go tell that bitch talk to me nice

And both ate at one time, and said what's on our mind?
I'm thinkin our relationship was a fable
A fairytale to me, that's just how it seems 
Even when I heard that you was cheatin I was faithful
And would do any God damn thing that you would say too
I tried to talk and you walk away
Right out of my face, right out of my place, but
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place
That's just it, girl
You just don't know how much I love you now
That you walked out of my house
That's just it, girl
It'll be another day, be another way
To get you right back in my place

You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Here's a little story that I got to tell about a young motha'fucka that done went through hell
He started off in Tallahassee, Florida
Hoping that somebody would save him from the boredom
He started making beats for the locals, stacking bread
And joined up with the clique called the Nappy Headz
The money came slow, but the hate came quick
Talking behind his back, like "Pain ain't shit!"
He was going out of town just to put it on stage
Blind to the fact that he wouldn't get paid
Slept in the car, clothes in the back seat
Twenty dollars to get them hoes in the back seat
Got tired of that, then he set some goals
Hoping this rap shit'll get him some gold
Oh, never thinking of what he 'bout to be
Then six years later, everybody copy me, ya see me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
One faithful day, he said fuck it
Hopped in the Chevrolet bucket
Then he went to Mickey D's, got an application
Nowhere was just where this rap will take him
So he gave up, took the paper home
Four dollars an hour, that's paper hoe
But he ain't too grown, so he got no bills
No condos just enough to make it home
Then all ring-ring on the mobile phone
Area code said "404"
"Oh yo this Akon what up nigga? Man, yo shit sound good"
Shut up nigga! Click
Just leave me the fuck alone
And somebody better quit playin' on my fuckin' phone
And then he said "Naw, this is what I'm 'bout to do
Have everybody copyin' you, ya see me like"
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Took tens in the bucket man fuck it I'm taking my black ass to the ATL
And I'm a make it there in three and a half hours even if I gotta go through hell
Now I can't tell that this is the kind of tours that I should be making all by myself
But Imma commit suicide if I see another untalented nigga on the Best Buy shelf
Well, hooked up with Akon and Boubacar
Sat down at a pizza parlor
It's kinda hard trynna explain who you are
When you showed up getting off the market
And so I showed them niggas a couple DVD's CD's
Showing the shit I did on TV
Cause I sucked at basketball
But this is way better after all, see me like
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me?
Woah! Hell, you copying me!?
You-you-you-you copying me? Ayy, it's for all my cats man
Have you ever been in the club and have a chick run up on you
And kinda tell you to buy her a drink homey?
I mean, it ain't what I can do, it what I will do~!
And attitude is everythang, y'know what I'm sayin?
I mean, a chick who ask for nothin'll get everythang
The chick who ask for everythang'll get nothin
Pain, why don't you talk to these motherfuckin broke bitches for a minute
Would you?
You may want a man with some consideration 
Determination  a lil' conversation 
And you might want a man who just ain't straight up nasty 
From Tallahassee  you're far too classy 
So you might want a man who's got a job  car 
Clothes  jewelry  girl that just ain't foolin me to you 
Do you  think that I'm that easy shawty?
It can't go that breezy shawty, find another dude cause it ain't me
Put you in the Range, buy you expensive thangs
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
No way, no how, uh-uh
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
Ice out all your fingers, take you out and make you famous
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
No way, no how, uh-uh
It ain't me, babe, it ain't me, no, it ain't me
I know you thought you had a sugar daddy plan to treat me like a herb
Take my money cause I'm attracted then kick me off to the curb
Dine in fancy restaurants eating expensive hors d'oeuvres
How I'm gon' let you get it all like that without the big lip girl that's my word
And if you wanna ride, then I just can't let it slide
If you plan to get me for all I got you could start by spendin the night
Otherwise let me see yo' head get small less you're here to make the head get tall
If not go on get lost cause that ain't me 
Hey, shawty look so good so she think I should throw dough to her like it ain't nothin to it
Get you whatever you like, I could but all I be givin you tonight is just wood
Hood, to my heart I do it, huge and yo' attitude just blew it
So rude that yo' mentality's distortin yo' reality
Actually the more you speak make me think where I'd rather be
I don't care if you hidin me cause I won't sponsor shoppin sprees
It's lots of freaks that I could be showing my generosity to
Boo, stop it please, I ain't that guy, you ain't that fly
Got yo' head up your ass that's why all you ask for is all I deny
I do for you what I decide and I can buy all kinds of things
Go places, spend all kinds of dough, my kindness is no blindness though
T-Pain, where you find this ho? Ha ha, I know what you want me to do 
Wait a minute
Shit might take a minute
All my niggas go work, let it cook let it bake a minute
Swimming in the money, my crib got a lake up in it
Indoor pool, outdoor pool, all my bitches getting naked in it
I'm rich bitch, spend a milli make a milli
I need it all to come back I know I can't take it with me
But I don't give a fuck about that, if anybody trying to make it with me
Meet me in the mahfucking bus out back I got hoes and they shaking in it
Chopping on 'em put it in the bag first then make money
Chevrolet squatting on them put that bitch in reverse clean that for me]
Who that call the coppers on me I'm the boss I ain't done shit and my hands clean
The chopper get whopping on them, shit'll wake the neighborhood up like caffeine
Wait a minute, let a youngin get a 60 seconds
Still with my niggas and we flexing
Snakes on my shoes like westerns
Sheesh, sheesh
Its like  with my every step
Payback but he never left
 you could use my help
 we still autotune it
Its the resurrection if it wasn't there
Dead presidents poking out the denim
They pissed me off now I'm shitting on them like they were toilets we've been working 
 Yo!
Young Fyre
Over the guts
Let's go in brah
Yo
Suicide doors, naw that was last year
Got suicide hoes butt-naked under my cashmere
Drinking full throttle, pulling half a gear
Two-wheel drive on these niggas, Cavalier
Wait till I crank it up, wait till I spazz hard
Then ain't nobody gonn' accept you like a MasterCard
Now ain't that bizarre, you say you from the hood
But nobody believe you so you try to pull the bastard card
Naw that shit don't work in this society
The game got potential but it's lacking the variety
Fans getting bored they don't even wanna buy CD's
Nigglas ain't selling so they blaming it on piracy
Argh! I'm too hard for the club seats
UFC submission hole I get em off me
The niggas in Tallahassee saying I'm off Glee
But the hoes say I'm sick, cough sneeze
Yeah, Birdman, you already know
You understand me?
YMCMB all day everyday
All we do is get money like we do it
Grind hard hustle 24 hours ain't no sleep when we do this shit
Ain't no care about sleeping
Ain't no clubbing cause we bring that to the studio
Ya understand me?
Just manifesting this game, getting more money than niggas ever been
Pennies for my thoughts, dollars for my words
Hundred for the hook, one fifty for the verse
Cause bitch I got kids and they want Louis Vutton shit
And the Gucci wallet to carry crayons in
So discounts is a thing of the past
So is CEOs tryna put a thing on my ass
These record labels mad cause they know they can't get me
Cause I don't do threesomes, you can't fuck with me
Nappy Boy ooh wee that's the trademark
And this year I just plan on pulling my face card
Niggas concentrating on keeping they face hard
But I'm a fuck around and take away they face guard
Until then I'm a keep delivering hits out
And keep on playing stupid till niggas figure my shit out
I can't speak on the bus but when the word finally get out
I'll fill a swimming pool with the soda niggas a spit out
Ya understand me, lots full of whips
Bottles and bitches
Ya understand me pocket full of money
Ya understand me G4's and hoes nigga this how we living

YMCMB all muthafuckin' day
Last but not least I'm too cold to have hot rhymes

Hitting licks with a gun
Waving so many four-fives you'd think one of my hands was missin a thumb 
Got the whole industry on his knees
Record execs trying to steal my blow pop before I get to the gum
Uhh yea I'm everywhere that you won't be
So there's ain't no use trying that hating shit on me
Cause I'm gone speak, Nappy Boy everybody put your hands in teamwork on 3
Get to the money, hit the flea market and blow out
Something for your kids and niggas think you trying to show out
The only time I show out is when my record on replay
Hop out that Bugatti in some mother fucking PJ's
Bitch
Now who want it?
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program
I got bitches doing splits, hoes doing back bends
And niggas feeling awkward like a white dude with black friends
My Cadillac swims, Greg Louganis
If she ain't fucking me I kick her out quicker then Liu Kang 
Do not fuck with him you don't want him
Cuz its a chance I might bust like and old condom
Yea, Its not as safe as you thought it was
My bass hit hard like it's a safe in my boxing glove 
Uhh you should have got on and ran off
Jump out the window and pray to god you land soft
Keep talking shit and fuck around and piss my man off
And he gonna pull out something that can probably shoot your hand off
Thats hysteria having ?rigery? He getting shot in his frame I'm changing the scenery
He keep talking like he is that grown
And somebody gonna have to photoshop his limbs back on mother fucker
Yea, haha
Now who want it?
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking program
3rd time Pizzle
Pardon my expression I'm just so disgusting
Bitches got me stressin' I sex em then fuck em
Then I make look to the music for a couple weeks
The say money talks come hear my Gucci duffles speak
But luckily, you niggas fuck with me
So I'mma auto-tune the whole world and take it up a key
I keep it snuck on me
Thats why your girls said she felt something else where my fucking belt buckle be
I'm too raw for the meat market
That's why it takes no time to get the beef started
Teddy Pain I'm harder then some fuckin Caridnals
They say I'm broke, bitch is you fucking retarded?
I'll turn your whole click into half a man
I drop bombs, these niggas think I'm from pakistan
He spitting fighting words, so we have to fight
But most of you pussies ain't worth dick, hermaphrodite
Shit, now who the fuck want it!?
Holy shit mother fucker god damn
That's what they say when they see me in my lam
I'm back in the streets and I'm bringing my fam
All of these wannabes know who I am
Haters got a problem with me and my man
But they get missing when its time to go ham
I'm on the grind and I won't stop for no man
Better get with the mother fucking programMan I got way to many cars to let the hatin' get to me
Especially when I know you ain't gone bring the shit to me
So on and so forth, I'm so on and so forceful
Young Fyre kick drums, leave a print of a horse shoe
Everywhere I go, my shit getting played cause
I ain't in the hood, I stay in the rave clubs
Keep using them big words that I don't understand
I take it as disrespect, then turn your face to a cave cuz
Now that's stupid from a couple aspects
But so is rollin' up weed with my publishing checks
You don't think Nappy Boy is the clique, or T-Pain is the shit
You must be snorting on some fucking anthrax
Now that's old school white shit
My tongue wearing skinny jeans, my flow on that tight shit
Love from a nigga is the only thing I might get
Everything else, I got; if not, I'll buy it, now try this
I surrounded by so much hate
Ain't gone let another take my place
I'm sick and tired of all these lies
Ya'll niggas ain't felt no painHeh
Oh oh oh
Yea yea
Oh oh oh
Yea yea
Oh oh oh
Yea yea
He he
Don’t nobody wanna live right no more

You can ask Big Meech

When I crush rappers careers they get left inna depression
You betta stand clear when the mic's in my possession
And I bust every year cause that's my obsession

Yeah
Je rentre à pied pour écouter la nuit
Autant celle du crayon que ma face, elle est défoncée la mine
Elle m'attend sous les draps je m'interroge sur ce qu'elle a mit
Je lui murmure que j'aime comme elle s'habille, comme elle se déshabille
Elle me repousse encore, elle se sert de son corps pour réussir
J'utilise ma réussite pour me servir de son corps
On garde la mise en scène, elle finira le cœur en miettes
À se dire qu'c'est p'tet pour ça qu'les pigeons l'aiment
Toute la nuit en studio, j'ai dû y écrire, y boire mille vers
De vive voix j'lui explique mille fois avec mille verbes
Que si je rentre à cette heure-çi c'est pour ne pas avoir à m'y lever
Elle répond pas, à travers le combi elle filtre
Elle déprime, pot de Nutella, sweat Abercrombie et Fitch
Oumar m'a dit pour le bien de ta carrière, gère tes meufs
Mais j'vis en marche-arrière, elles déforment tout c'que j'dis une sorte de super T9
Yeah, Dixon attend d'autres histoires, d'autres dunes 
Dixon est une espèce nocturne

I’m diggin’ in ya coochie while we listenin’ to Gucci on a rap songMan it’s too many angels around me to be worried bout your evil plans
We make mistakes but that’s just what it takes to be the man
I sacrificed the rest of my life just to feed my fam
They upped the price, and I rolled the dice out of either hand
I didn’t get the memo, nobody told me the plan
The N or the O, what part didn’t you understand?
Hundred grand, I’m finna go honey ham
Looking at these Uncle Toms point fingers like Uncle Sam, fuck em man
I’m on fire, I am too hot for you light burners
I might hurt you, my music slap you like Ike Turner
Sit back and listen, I might learn you a thing or two
I ain’t just saying fuck a nigga, look at what my finger do
You can tell I been drinking coffee with no cream
My life is a movie and you ain’t made it in no scenes
They been sleeping on me and they still ain’t having no dreams
But if you tryna rest I hit you with lyrical codeine
Lay down, relax
Lay down, relax
They say get in where you fit in
So everybody tried to make their space too small for me to fit my shit in
But that’s cool, I ain’t tryna fuck your operation
Fuck the initiation, what’s my obligation?
And if I got to do something out of the ordinary
Being part of your organization is sort of scary
I’m not tryna be one of them dudes that’s always a thug
Becoming a part of the haters that are starting to love
Uh, open your eyes and smell all of this money
You might suddenly realize you did all of this for nothing
My spatula game will flip that shit that you fabricating
Turn the track on and I’m back on, and now you’re back to hating
I’m infatuated with bringing that shit up out a nigga
It ain’t really a benefit if you gone doubt a nigga
You acting like your style fell from the sky
Good news is you got it from a hell of a guy
Lay down, relax
Lay down, relaxLamborghini dreams, bitch I mean what I say
Do it for a purpose, you just here by mistake
Put that lobster over here by that steak
If you looking for some hits, I got ten on the way
I ain’t fucking with these niggas, I’m an industry virgin
Penitentiary flows, reinventing the cold
Listen to these niggas venting they soul, getting they hoes
Fuck her dead raw then leave that bitch in the cold, woah
I probably shouldn’t be doing this while I’m pissed off
Cast told me get in this bitch and just get my shit off
Boy I been off the chain, I decided to let the pit off
And as far as autotune, its’s my dick you niggas can get off
We winning though, Nappy Boy bicentennial
It’s all about principalities when you fuck with the principle
So take notes or let that motherfucking pencil go
Pizzle though, Nappy Boy, bitch I’m invincible
My nigga this is business, so don’t take it personal
If you don’t have my best interests, then you’ll be the first to go
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record
It’s the same old thang
I don’t sweat them motherfuckers, I just keep it 100
Do the same old thing
If you ain’t got me, I ain’t got you, I don’t give a fuck about you
And you bout to see all of the shit that I can do without you
I’m a monster, I defeat crews
Get on my diet bitch, see food, eat food
Like you got to question what I do it for
The ball in my court, what you shooting for?
What you think I’m rapping writing, singing, and producing for?
I be handling that shit that you making excuses for
Let’s keep it G and I can move on
Keep it cool holmes, keep your shoes on
Drop dead gorgeous, I get my crews on
You ain’t heard about Teddy Pain, turn the news on
Zoom gone, out the general vicinity
If niggas act like bitches then bitches is getting finicky
Nappy Boy, homie can I get a witness
You don’t want to end up on the shit list
My nigga this is business, so don’t take it personal
If you don’t have my best interests, then you’ll be the first to go
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record
It’s the same old thang
I don’t sweat them motherfuckers, I just keep it 100
Do the same old thing
I can hear them all talking, sounding like a broken record

Let me show you what a down south nigga is
Grits and eggs, tits and legs, thick as bread
I ain't know how you was but I figured it

Tattoos from your ankle to your white wrist
Drop a top so far in a white whip
Dark chocolate bar, you can bite this
See, life is a movie
Keep running from your feeling, you'll eventually fall like a white bitch
And I know you wanna do me
I ain't trynna be nasty
I'm way too fly, where's my kite, bitch
My bad, I ain't trynna be cussing
No disrespect, that's just how I does it
Blue Bentley, rims with the buttons
Lets go get some food or something
Girl I go to go
If you not busy baby

But they know it's all my fault
'Cause now I'm sittin' on this airplane and I'm crying like a baby

Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
And that's why we all paid this hard-earned money to get packed up in this Thunderdome
I'm like "What is wrong? For Pneumonia?" cause, man, I spent my whole check
To hear you talk about yo' life and how you got my check round yo' neck
We want that monotone, monotone, yeah, yo' album live and all
To be honest, I ain't think that you were performing live at all
And God forbid you do it right or how it ought to be sung, nah, nah, nah
But I guess, if yo' shit was gonna be monotone, I coulda just
Saved my check and listen to yo' songs at home cause let's be honest
I could throw my iPod on and the place'll go stupid
And I'm lookin' at you, kid, like "I wouldn't let you on for nothing with that bullshit you just did"
But you just laugh, throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song like
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witness
 
I'm gon' see you on my way up and see you on yo' way down
Cause right now, I'm just another nigga in a hype crowd
And you don't even know that I been plannin' yo' demise
So I'll advise you keep yo' eyes on the prize cause I'm on the rise
Yeah, we want that monotone, monotone
Oh, you better than the peons? And at the end of the night
You gon' find a bitch with a switch you can pee on
Oh, you one of them niggas, huh? You laugh cause it's funny
And I'm one of them niggas like 
But I done it, made it to the front row and you don't wanna look at a nigga
I'm making eye contact like a nigga got on five contacts, I want my $99.95 back
You hide in the back cause you tired, out of breath and shit
You better be glad I paid money, I woulda been left this shit
Motherfucker, you got fans and we got out motherfucking hands up for everything that you sayin'
And we wanna be appreciated, I borrowed 20 bucks, I'mma eat the aided
So you can at least say "Hey, shit", I'm tryna be like you for my three lil' babies
Jerome and Tanik' and Casey but you looking at me like I need to face it
Fuck my situation cause you just laugh
Throw money, watch the bitches scatter
Cause it worked before so why not follow the initial pattern?
So, while you on vacation, I'll be at home, alone
In my mirror with a brush and a comb
Singing that ol' independent song for what?
Man, man, man, I wish I was you
Or at least on yo' level, man, I'd diss the shit outta you
I don't know if you work tonight, shit, that ain't my business
But I swear I'm gon' make it, I got God as my witnessShit, at some point, niggas gotta grow up

Oh, you got to do better, she wanna be alone forever, oh no
She wanna know
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
You been there too many times, she know something's wrong
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
And every time that you go, you stay way too long
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
There's too many strip clubs, too many strippers
When you get back, she go through your phone
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
Probably getting your dick sucked, who you done picked up
When she know you did something wrong
How many times you gon' go?
Oh, oh

My bitch my shooter, my hitter, yeah
Peer pressure make me feel less of a real nigga
And that's as real as it get
Iridescent diamonds in my ear done shiny

She don't belong in the bleachers
Bitches be trying to starters
They go to pressing me harder
Hoping I come through and slaughter
They wanna ride it like I was a Caddy
While calling me daddy like I was the father
Honestly speaking, I'm unimpressed
Thotties will come with a ton of stress
When you connect in the mind, your body, and soul
It makes for some greater sex
If she ain't your homie, your lover, your friend
You might want to go get your feelings back
With the seal and back
Imported my watch in a coniac
I keeping it real, you niggas living on lies
I look her right in her eyes
I done came up on a prize
I gotta stay on my jog
I gotta grow and evolve
People will play on your weakness
Look at what happened to Rome
If you ain't got your shit together, then you can't let her know what's up
Oh, you got to do better, she wanna be alone forever, oh no
She wanna know
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
You been there too many times, she know something's wrong
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
And every time that you go, you stay way too long
How many times you gon' go to Miami?
There's too many strip clubs, too many strippers
When you get back, she go through your phone
How many times you gon' go to Miami?

Couldn't go to the funeral cause I couldn't see you in the coffin bro
My last image of you, you posting in your new chevy
Camaro bit really smoke in it but you would let me
Oh my god swear to god your daughter's your spitting image
When your daughter met my daughter what a wonderful feeling
As long as the good lord ables me to get money
Put it on my daughters your daughter will never go hungry
They say they could die young if that's not false
And that explains why my homeboy's life's lost
'Cause he was a good nigga fuck ceremony
Rest in peace to trevor martin but my nigga wasn't a hood nigga
No he didn't deserve no bullets in him
I thought he was gonna live a bright hall
Them pussy could've killed him
Instead they took your life along with your sneaks
Devil u I p went in peace
Lord forgive me but why you doin' this again
You just took my big brother when I was in the pen
But how much pain can a grown man take
But I gotta keep pushing 'cause god don't make mistakes 
The doctors told me you was gone and I couldn't believe it
Your vital laying down but your soul in with jesus
I'm on my hole in your grind telling me come back
I told her let go 'cause wherever you are you got my back
I almost lost it when I seen that herse at the church
Shit hurt I can barely get through this verse
And I ain't rich but me and you know I ain't paper chasing
So I'ma try my best to make so that your daughters grace so
We saw the vision for the win squad together nigga
I guess it kinda drove you from heaven was better nigga
Jimmy me and you will always be your mort decoy
And wash the blood of my enemies off my hands
Tears coming down my eyes wishing for better days
Exclusive jay I know you in a better place
Never will be forgotten as long as I'm alive
You was a good dude in everybody eyes
Always on the grind you hussle hard
My prayers go out to your family from my heart
Thank you for being a friend thank you for being my brother
And I'ma do my best to look out for your daughter
No more pain god get the devil off me, and let me be free
All this stress is a mess that I don't need
Hunger games do your best or you don't eat
And my dog gonna be forever winning

Cause I'm in love with her she's in lust with me
I can't go on without any control
She's got a grip on my love, superho
And mama told me there'd be days like this
She didn't tell me this woman would have my heart in her fist
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye
I know that I'm looking kinda like a fool
And I tried to get away
Tried to get away but no matter what I knew
Man she keeps on pulling me back to that hell she calls her home
The way she's treating me deceiving me I'd rather be alone
She put the wool over my eyes
Get away, get away I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I said goodbye
If there's anything I've learned
It's probably nothing at all
And this woman will still be the death of me
She's got my heart , my mind, my body and soul and all
And I heard through through the grapevine
She's working on the rest of me, good God!
I tried and I tried
She put the wool over my eyes
No matter how I say goodbye
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
I know it's a man out there going through the same thing
Let me hear you say
Wool over my eyes I ain't worried bout nothin 
Ha

NAPPY BOOYYYWaves upon waves keep me down
And I can't get to the top
But when I get there I'll still be nowhere
Cause I ain't find the one I love
And if I make it out
Then we shouldn't talk about how you left me
Just how you left me
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
Drowning again, yeah
You should see how good it would be
To come drown with me
Days upon days I've been floating
And you don't care if I die or not
But when I'm deceased I hope you will be
Dying next to me in my watery grave
And before we go I just want my baby to know
How it feels to be
Drowning again in your loveI feel so much better
I know I said I'll never, ever drink again
But now I feel like I never had before
I get out on the floor
And show them what it's for
Can I get that 'Tron? Can I get that Remy?
Can I get that cold? Can I get that Henny?
Can I get that margarita on the rock-rock-rock?
Can I get salt all around that rim-rim-rim-rim?
Can I get that
When I walk up in the club I hit that
Shawty, wanna break me off like a k-k-k-Kit Kat
Get a couple bottles and a couple models and I wanna sip that
'Tron, when I'm in the zone
Can I get that Henny when I’m already in it?
Can I get that margarita when I’m chilling with a mamacita?
I'ma see you later on tonight
I know, I said I should stay in my bed
I’m in a club instead party-rocking with my baby
So now I’ll never say never, she’ll leave me if I let her
That’s why I gotta keep her on the dancefloor and tell her
I feel so much better
I Know I said I’ll never ever drink again, again, again
But now I feel like I never had before

Things ain't looking good
Seems like there's nowhere to go except where I am right now
Trying to get up out this hood
Need to go somewhere I know, some people showed me how
To make things better, I know its possible
Even in stormy weather, it feels good to know
You wish everything was up and up
But its going down down down
Down down
It might seem like I don't care enough
That's why I don't come around round round
And I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there
I keep my ass where I'm supposed to be down there 
]
Now enough is not enough
I ask myself what I'm doing here still
I can't believe its this hard to leave the ground
When that is all I sing about, my god
But who is gonna save me now?
]
All the sudden everything went southbound
And don't nobody wanna open up their mouth now
Cause they don't wanna offend their family or friend
I guess it all just depends whose fault this shit really is, right?
Who invented this way of doing things?
My mind racing, I feel like I'm doing 2 a day
Understand this what it take for a man
To stop him from fucking up whenever his leg is up
That's what's upHello!
Oh, yeah
You ready baby
Ya see me like, do they love Teddy Pain in the street? 
Field mob in thi' bitch 
Young Fyre
Lemme hear you say Kang
K-a-n-g, Kang
Okay, lets go in
Teddy Pain is the name, bitch don't get it confused
All you lames in the game have never spit on a dude
Tell your dame to get a swimsuit and come get in my pool
She nodded once and now we working on 
I pull up on you with the quick fast, style on yo bitch ass
You niggas ain't holding weight the rap game been drinking SlimFast
See i go ham sandwich on everything i do
So when i put it down, all you pussy niggas can say it's 
Da bad mon flow, niggas like whatsagan
Fyre dropping fire, ain't no need to turn the water on
So gimme a bitch with enough ass to put some butter on
And imma drop that shit that'll make a nigga feel guts all when it cuts it off
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous
K is nothing new to me, so hate on, hate on
My eighty-year old twin sisters, same ol', same ol'
It's clearer than unicorn having glitter but six
With a fairy, skiing down that double rainbow
Range Rove, no shoes, the truck got the bare feet out
No more Ramen Noodles, like a dike I go and eat out
I'm bald headed, but still Nappy Boy is the click
Like game in sex, we the shit on a stick 
My Chevrolet Camaro's high yellower than that nigga Drake
Rims blacker than Wesley Snipes, I'm sitting on blades
Like a barn on fire, I'm burning heavy hay
And Smoke stands for smoke, loads'a kush everyday
If I'm lying, I'm down, I'm the bidness
Throw me in the jungle with a lion, Imma kill it
Die hard nigga, call me Bruce Willis
No time for fake shit, homeboy I'm the realest nigga
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
You can't see me, no, I'm too dangerous
Too dangerous, too dangerous
They ask me what happen with Field Mob, I say two different egos clashing
Like Andre 3K and CeeLo's fashion
Got micro-smoke dose responds with so outrageous
Ya girl say Shawn Jay, ya smoke my favorite
I got her up in MySpace, smoking my grape kush
She follow me like I'm Twitter, then I poke her like Facebook

Feels so good baby... yeahLook at him spittin' rhymes, look at him hittin' dimes
Travelin' all around the world. world, uh
Look at him hit the stage, look at him rip the place
For grown women and little girls, girls, uh
But at the same time, he's doing the same thang
Remember 05, well this the same Pain
But every time the rap game go down the drain
The Louis Vutton jewelry box allowing him to change lanes
I'm here to change things, but they don't like diversity
Until they ask to let somebody write a verse for me
But I say hell naw
Fuck them niggas and they Benz, tell em I don't see em like Patti Labelle draws
I wanna make a living, and niggas want me buried
So I told Dex to put me in the pet cemetery
So I can come back out of the dirt and truly thank him
And tell em how Jesus introduced me to Ben Franklin
You basically empowered
Most of us that have it
The holy goal with no man has ever gone before
He has, He has, He has giving us a stiff
And the average human being does not care
How hard is it to make it? And ya fuckin respect it
It seems like you just get in this shit to get rejected 
And in some cases I done caught my damn self
Hating on another nigga just because he gettin' sweaty
Uh, this shit is hard as it'll ever get
It's like waiting to fuck a girl that you'll never hit
And every time you walk out the bitter with blue balls
Then go and waste your money on making your Chevy too tall, damn
The life I live is full of public secrets
And I'm the blame even if they didn't fuckin see it
A modern day Frederick Douglas, how can you believe it
Like Sadatay, Pootie Tang use the belt to beat it
Man, if you wanna lose, then nigga go 'head
But ain't nobody ever goin say Pain got a slow head
Unless I'm in the dressing room getting me some slow head
Fucking with a seven or like seven of a co-ed's
Uh
... did his own crew
Everybody wants to get his old crew rich
And then they want the other lil people never get a piece of the pie
And that can only go for the cracker, that go for you niggas that think that y'all big too
I understand this, that's right you niggas and crackers can't stand me
You niggas must know that I know you can't do nothing if you broke
Listen to me young people, old people too, mostly black people I'm talking to you
You can't do nothing if you broke!It was December 6 Times Square Manhattan
Teddy wasn't ready for what was about to happen
He thought today was goin be a good day
He thought that every man in the world looked at life in a good way
Woke up and took a shower brushed his teeth while he singing
Somebody was talking bout him cause his ears was ringing
Thinking, he finally made it
Doing something that'chu didn't need good grades in
Housekeeping came in say "do you want me to clean your room? " He said "naw"
But as I feel shawty I clean for you but I'm cool
So he went downstairs
Put the white shades on and let down his hair
Cause he was big but he didn't know
People did dig him though when he dress like he did in that E-40 video
Huh, it's time to hit the radio station
It's all he been wanting he been patiently waiting
Yeah, plus he was bugging out
Cause the next day his very first album Rappa Ternt Sanga was coming out
Damn, he was so exuberant
Half fame and didn't know what to do with it
He went and got a fresh fit from Belly Bone
Black T-shirt prokeheads New York fitted on
Ready to get it on
He so crunk and reckless
And Brianna called it said it dumb with the necklace
Now he walking New York gym up
Ready to hit the club later on and go get bin up
Cause at 12 O'clock it's bout to be on
All that first album nervousness he had was about to be gone
And he ain't need a stunna kit
Just his cause cap with the letters NYPD on the front of it
Cause he ain't never seen it, he ain't believe it
He thought he never seen it if it wasn't on TV and shit
Now he finally got a lil bread
Seven dollars out his pocket police hat up on his head
Errbody giving em salty looks now
Errbody try to insult and put him down
But it went in the left and out the right
All he know is nigga we going out tonight
Then the sun goes down and the moon comes up
The blunts go round errbody getting drunk
Ready to hit the club get on stage snatch a mic or two
Three single under my belt
I feel like I can do anything
Let's go and get the chain from Game
I got visions of letting that bitch hang from the stage
Hit the Diamond District, and what a sight
It's a T-Pain chain that'll light up the night
Now I'm happy than a mug the chain big as a bitch
I done finally made the switch from fake to real shit
And I ain't have to work to hard
I got a baby girl but I ain't have to work two jobs
I'm just doing what I believe in and show 'em respect
Now I'm bout to put somebody salary around my neck
But Game told me not to take it out there
The rogues ass niggas a take it out there
But shit niggas I got security
Ain't nobody taking my jewelry
Pause...
Take two
Walk out the Avianne store with a mean mug
Team tough TP clean up with his brand new ice
Can't tell her nothing like Yeezy
Please believe be easy and yeen ain't gotta ask him twice
Cause you can see how good he feel good as he walked in the spot
Seem like he was the only one that knew he was hot
But he had the biggest chain on so he ain't give a fuck
Just give him a bottle and a muhfuckin' cup
Drink and celebrating his album droppin
Not knowing niggas in the club was plottin
So we kept on shinin, blinding muhfuckas
Letting niggas know that he was high as a muhfucka
Flossin, put his chain up in the air
If a nigga couldn't see it Pain stood up in the chair
Now niggas is getting mad and they want what he got
Shit nigga thinking he ballin he thinking he hot

Everybody put your hands up and come on, let's
Celebrate that a young nigga on that jet
And he own them whips

"Come fuck me, Pain" is what that big black ass say

Family couldn't handle me so I go smoke up
And go right back at sleeping dream about bringing my folk up
Without the chocker, oh oh
Was I even ready for the hand I was dealt
Was I even ready to the man that I be felt
Gotta get on my grind let me tighten in my belt
Spit this shit from my heart make the microphone melt
I grew up in the area where ain't nobody scared of ya
But when you hit the club niggas watch and niggas scared as fuck
Don't nobody wanna be here but they ain't got no choice
And er'body wanna be heard without a voice
If you don't speak up I can't hear over these speakers
I did what I had to do and I'm rocking double rolls royce
But I wouldn't have it if it wasn't for the streets
And these motherfucking beats
Man I held it in for too long I miss my city
And all the motherfuckers that used to be cool with me
I was born and raised
Made in pain, lost in the game, insane
In the streets dollar after dollar I'm spending
I never can forget out the beginning
Cause nigga I was born and raised
Made in pain, lost in the game, insane
In the streets
I never worked a 9 to 5 what do it feel like
I run these streets getting money crutching that street tight shit
So listen close cause all I tell is the ghetto stories
Cause niggas die for nothing so that stick is mandatory
Cause in the projects is no love, no heat, no rub
Ain't tryin' to be doctor and no lawyers just more thugs
And they ain't tryin' to buy the kids books just more drugs
Tell them their future ain't right, they be like "so what? "
But who am I to try to point the finger
Cause I done sold everything under the sun that y'all niggas can think of
And no regret all because the streets saved me
But Lord knows this ain't the road that my mama paved me
You get tired of looking over your shoulder
You get tired of your mama crying over and over
You gotta take the bad with the good though
Yeah I made it out, but I'm still in the hood thoughTold her I was going to Miami

Get upIf I didn't have diamonds in my chain
That Chevy horn sounding like a train
We made a movie
And now I'm so proud of my address
We're repping Ridge Road deep down
Four doors on a Chevy
Cause every song was like
Nappy hair, smoke, drink, Tallahassee, what's up
Boom, know what it is, nigga fill the truck up
We don't care, look at all these Cadillacs on 20s
And every song was like
Work hard, play hard, money over everything
Cowboy hat and the hood cap or the chain
We don't care, started from the bottom, now we're here
Seems like yesterday we was drinking Crown Royal
We ain't really give a fuck
Now they try to hate on us
And I just party on my bus
Let me see you get loose, girl
Everything is on me
So, nigga, come through
Let me live that fantasyWe would always have the ability to start off right, right
By the end of the night we end up in a fight, whoa
Girl you said you’d never leave me, but you might
This time, this time, this time...
We was doing so damn good for so damn long
But as you can see something went terribly wrong, whoa
I been through this so I can stay strong
This time, this time, this time
Separated, separated
Separated, separated
Cause yesterday was cool and the day before
But tomorrow there will never be no more of
Separated, separated
We would always have the ability to pull it back together, gether, gether, gether
And you was always down for me, you ain’t give a fungress to whatever, ever
But now you’re here telling me that you deserve better
This time, this time, this time
Hey, and now im sitting here in the dark with nobody
And I don’t wanna be alone I need my shawty, shawty yeah
Cause luxury means nothing without the luxury of loveWhoever thought a yungen' from a city full of rattle snakes
Was ever gon' make it out the grass patch
7 heels had me looking for a better deal
A hood nigga I couldn't count on the Nasdaq
Coming home from school, I had tears in my eyes
They was picking on me and wouldn't give me my hat back
Now I got enough hats to give away
It's better days, I refuse to have flashbacks
Nobody thought I knew what I was doing
Nobody believes so nobody would walk me through it
But nobody achieved what I achieved
If only somebody could have just seen what I seen
Said they praying for me, don't we all got needs
Til I walk in the room and they all just freeze
And they all look relieved like shit
If he made it now we all got cheese, nah
Homie that ain't the way it work
Especially if you ain't even put in a day of work
Now they going crazy cause I made it first
See homie I just made it work
It's a cold word, ask my old girl
She feel my pain and I ain't even tryin' to make it hurt
And my daddy proud of me
But he got too much pride to say it out loud for me
Got that keyboard off the road boarded in the house for me
He coming to my shows hanging in the crowd for me
Man I still love my niggs
The only thing that I ask is that they hold it down for me
I still rep the 850 yeah
I got it tatted on my arm, it ain't goin' nowhere
But motherfuckers will say that you changed
And they the ones that wouldn't last a day in this game
Don't get me wrong I ain't saying I stayed the same
But I guarantee that I will never succumb to the fame
That's some bullshit, and y'all know that ain't me
But I'd rather grow up than to stay eighteen
Life goes on and hopfully only great things
Travelling the world and seeing shit that I ain't seen
Then one day I look at my reflection
And realise how I been actin' and how I been dressing
I realise I can make an impression
But good Lord this is fuckin' depressin'
And good lord I got some fuckin' questions
I think it's time for some mo'fuckin' confessions
Wake up call, wake up call
My answer to every question was fuck y'all
All I need is this 9-11 to fuck broads
I just need to find a seven with enough flaws
My last album ain't do numbers like I wanted to
But that was God tryna ask me what I'm gonna do
He said "I hate to put obstacles right in front of you
But you gotta learn to get out of what you're goin' through"
Hurdles got jumped, mountains got climbed
Til' molly came and put a fuckin' wall up in my mind
Now I'm in the crib trippin', complainin' and bitchin'
That liquor got hittin I'm in here reminiscing
How many niggas told me I was gonna fail
Cause I got a list of niggas that can go to hell
They feel like I owe em something cause they know me well
Calling me a sellout cause I won't come back and smoke a L
The same nigga that told me I had a hit
Charged me 300 to put it up in his mix
Now suicide lookin' better than hittin' the lick
Cause the whole time they knew that I was livin' out my whip
But now I see em, and I can't even take a it
Cause he walk up to me ans say boy I knew you was gon' make it
And like Motherfucker do you not just recall?
I needed help and you just left me sittin' on my ballsâ
That just wasn't the right life
So I told a bullshit to have a nice life
And all them girls yellin' at me from in front of the moon
Like nigga how you just gonna go and get a white wife?
Fuck you bitches, I did what I did
Now I'm running round my mansion doing shit with my kids
But now maybe my life is too sweet
Like I woke up in that Bugatti and went right back to sleep
Deep, I was dreaming, y'all niggas was scheming
Like crabs up in the bucket but y'all just got to feed it
And all these bitches, all just want my semen
The star collecting checks and ball up in the season
But ain't nobody give a fuck when ain't nobody give a fuck
Now they got they hand out asking me to give it up
And everytime they ask me for something
They say "Now you know that I ain't never asked you for nothin'"
I got loss, I got loss
Credit cards got swiped, money got tossed
Hundred after hundred, dollar after dollar
Drinking every kind of liquor then that molly got swallowed
I know I fucked up cause I'm a grown man
So now I'm thinking like my old man
He said "You wanna make God laugh?
Then look up in the sky and try and come up with your own plan"
Now I see my niggas just want me to win
But I won't have em if I keep disrespecting my friends
They been through it, say they know the feel
So all I need is a trip up to StoicvilleHmm
Bore bore bore
What do we have here?
Uh! Perfect!
It's
Been a long time coming
Now baby
I'm officially yours
I've got so much love to give
In my heart I know you see
You won't believe
The things
I've been
Through to be right here
I almost died just to get to you
I'd go to hell
And to hell again
I'd badly go back and forth
From the mountain tops
From door to door
Let the whole world know
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before
I was official....
Officially yours
Oooooh look up further no more
Now baby im, officially yours
Now listen to me, HEY!
Time after time
I told myself to stop this
But you take control over me
Oooh, you know what to do
And it's working
I guarantee it
Please believe it
Go from the mountain tops
Door to door to door
Let the whole world know
Baby I'm officially yours
What was I doing before
I was official....
Officially yours
Oooooh look up further no more
Now baby im officially yoursUh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey
Uh, uh, uh, uh, uh
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me 
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be 
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID 
That's me, baby
That's me, baby
Time we back into this one of a kind spirit
We remembered in the time, we the skies and the limit
Bitch, I'm barely in my prime, this ain't half a division
Got so much shit on my mind I'm mentally in a prison
I'm a man on a mission until I'm out of commission
And when we speaking, they listen
Keys for my kingdom of wisdom
Man, my mommy was tripping, thought I'd be bringing in children
Instead I brought in a million, new home and a ceiling
My empire keep rising, enterprises is building
But the stacks keep on piling, I'm never losing the feeling
My life on autopilot, the world is making me numb
I put my phone on silent just so that I could be one
Knew the day would come when I was finally here
Show the kinger stone, this went a couple of years
I ain't got no fears, now that we made that clear
Let's put one in the air, I'm taking over from here
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me 
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be 
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID 
That's me, baby
That's me, baby
Time to let the dumb fucks have it 
Uncut, somewhat magic, e'rything about the come up was classic
We'd run and cut classes, gun tuck habit
21 Savage and the drummers on some trap shit
Wait, fuck fame I laid a little back
Feel I was ahead of my time, they ain't saying that
Bad bitch calling her Snoop, I make her take a cab
She gon' doggy style all night, she hate laying flat
Yup, to me it sound like a win-win
Group text, you chicks free and get a win-win
Back to my legacy, it's longevity
It's ten bathrooms in a mansion that I never see
Shots come my way, that's my speciality
If they ever said my name, it wasn't said to me
Plus, I never half-ass in the game
When both Joe's is badass you get pain
Hey
I am when the rich get old and the young get cold
And it ain't no holding back, that's me 
I don't know how long I got left
So I'm showing these niggas how cold I be 
I can get in yo' vein and move up to yo' brain
And take over your whole ID 
That's me, baby
That's me, babyT-Pain is working on a comeback plan. In April, Pain—real name Faheem Rasheed Najm—started by cutting off his signature dreads and revealing the title of his fifth studio album, Stoicville: The Phoenix. The album title signifies his “happy place,” or his moment of Zen where he can go and nobody will judge him. Given the talks of the Tallahassee native being on a hiatus, he’s using his free time to perfect his craft and explore his roots again. The fans won’t have to wait much longer for his rebirth.
“I went off for a little while trying to reinvent myself and try to do different music and stuff. Everybody was saying that you need to switch it up,” Pain tells XXL on the phone while on the way to the studio in Atlanta. “That was the Revolver album, and it didn’t do as good as I wanted it to. People like familiarity. People like to know what is happening. It was only right that I go back to what made me the T-Pain I am today.”
Pain’s referring to “Up Down ” featuring B.o.B and produced by the purveyor of ratchet, DJ Mustard, which he released in August. The twerk-ready anthem—the first official single from Stoicville—is a return to form; with his trademark Auto-Tune vocals and lyrics about the strip club, T-Pain isn’t afraid to venture back into his comfort zone.
Right now, T-Pain is focused on putting the pieces together for the album, slated for 2014. “This is really going to be what’s on my mind and what’s me,” he says. “I’m doing this album like  Quentin Tarantino makes movies. Everybody always asks Quentin Tarantino, ‘Who you make movies for?’ He don’t make movies for anybody. I make movies for myself and hope to God that there’s somebody out there like me.”
T-Pain isn’t your typical rapper-turned-singer. Throughout the mid-2000s, he gained massive success for guest appearances on hits like Kanye West’s “Good Life,” Jamie Foxx’s “Blame It” and Flo Rida’s “Low.” His solo songs, too, were instant party-starters and catapulted him to the top of the hip-hop food chain. These days, Pain has to fight to reignite his hot streak, mainly because a certain Auto-Tuned crooner/rapper has dominated his lane. Rumors have circulated about his alleged feud with Future, but Pain’s more concerned about how rappers have used the technology he studied and popularized for the mainstream than any hip-hop beef.
“I changed music completely, so it is good to see that, but it’s terrible to see how horrible everybody sounds with it,” Pain admits. “I studied my craft, and I make sure I know how it works. I know where it comes from. I knew how Auto-Tune got invented. I studied the technology of it. Everything. Then I used it. But everybody else is slapping it on their voice and saying they got a smash.”
His frustrations with Auto-Tune are just a small part of the larger picture. Next in Pain’s rise to prominence is a methodical approach to making music, while being mindful of what is truly missing in the game now. Pain hopes to bring more diversity and feel-good records with Stoicville. “I want to get back  when people were actually moving in the club. You go overseas, they still play every goddamn song from the ’90s,” he says. “We come over here, just shoot a nigga, and kill a nigga. ‘Fuck this. Fuck that. I’m a dope boy.’ Goddamn, dude! Not everybody  singing this shit.”
T-Pain’s strong opinions about today’s landscape only fuel the fire for his second coming. He lives in the studio, laying down infectious hooks for anyone who requests them. He is returning to rapping again, confirming that there will be multiple rap songs on the album. And he has decided not to drop a mixtape in order to have a full body of work that’ll leave a lasting impact. Everything is going according to plan—even his new career goals.
“I want to make it like everybody else,” he says. “I don’t think I made it yet. Until I get to Jay’s status, until I get to Diddy’s status, I don’t think I made it yet.”
Until then, T-Pain is out here grindin’.Now I done got a lil older, flow got colder

But I'm feeling really nasty today, I got a cup of that patron and I'm slightly gone 
So I zoom by these niggas in my Lamborghini, I don't give a fuck what knid of bike he on

And when you climb on top of me, I hit rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom 
We hit the city, we in my drop
The DJ wicky-wicky, she gettin' hot
She dancin' by the speaker, that booty pop
She feelin' that bottom, bottom, bottom
I'm gettin' jiggy, I cut a rug
Niggas give me daps, bitches give me hugs
She got me thinkin', I'm in love
In love with that bottom, bottom, bottom!
Left cheek, right cheek, make that booty work
Shawty I ain't playin' with you!
And then you go "Dutty wun, dutty wun", all dem go berserk
You know exactly what we gon' do
All kinds of touchin' and rubbin', some of the lovin' that you never had
So let me get a rubber out this Gucci bag
We gon' do somethin' that make your daddy mad
Now, baby put your hands up and say yeah
It's like a sin on top of a sin what I'd do to you
Over again and over again, you ain't gotta move
And when you look into my eyes, I got to go harder
And when you climb on top of me, I hit rock bottom
She can't leave me alone, rock bottom Symphony crack!
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Let me get this right let me get this clear…
Settle one more game, we gonna prove we’re as best this year!
Start right here, start right…
Right here in front of our folks, in front of our fans
Some of them…
…play no game, watch me do my thing
Bring it down like Wu-Tang …want my name?
..all the way, turn up, turn next
..off in this bitch
I’mma cute dog take what I see!
All shit, get a seat, light a Cush, can hear that shit!
Smoke… nigga, so… smell that shit!
Everybody lay it down, come on…
Everybody in the …come on…it’s your thing!
Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
…drop this beat, drop this beat!
From that gunshot straight ...
Country music got me rapping, I know why
You’ve been this shit since I was a child!
Hola, hola, what you got to say?
That the haters brought me back and.. a major way!
Best believe it for you…
Guess my people cut the crap an they’re saying:
Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
Now get your…
Or maybe if you’re ... some of us right here
Then none of these would matter
And...wouldn’t have to make a song with all these
Flutes, clarinets, trumpets and trombones
My drum shit is led by Louis Vuitton
Louis shoes, Louis drum sticks, and Gucci…
Who you think you’re fooling, you’re not fooling me son!
… favors, we ain’t doing you one!
Here some advice! ... an we’ll talk negotiations
If you’re hasting, we’re not pacing, we’re take it…
Understand, this corporation is more like a congregation
And come up with compilations that will have you make…
Chorus:
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!
No you can’t…
I bet your game ain’t better than mine!Uh, uh, uh, uh

Man my shit be going off!
Everybody wanna see me, they call me, and they text me, then they tweet me
Man my shit be going off!
What it do? Where you at? I’m coming through
Man my shit be going off!
I tell them not to bother me, don’t bother me, instead they calling me and calling me
Man my shit be going off!
7:45 on a weekday
I can rent a G5 with a week's pay
I be dizzy, I be stressing
Leave a message with my butlers: Benjamin or Felípe
If I ain’t got your number locked in
You can be expecting a text that say "WHO DIS?"
And we’re about to make this party rock shit
Put your name and your e-mail in this bitch and let's DO THIS!
Man my shit be going off a lil' bit
Texting me 911, I ain’t no officer bitch!
Saw a picture in my contact she offer the dick
If I don’t feel like talking she get a cough like I’m sick 
"You sleep boy?
You tired? You need something to eat, boy?"
You know how much this data plan cost!?
I guess it cost to be the boss
Man I lost my phone a couple days ago
No contacts I lost like 80 hoes
Way to go
But I'm just waiting on the right call by nightfall I'ma get me some fellatio
Fuck the ratio, I got my cellphone
Ain't no hoes in here, I take my ass home
I be waiting on it
I keep them Androids hating on me. Team Apple!
They say the blacker the berry
BBMing bitches tell them start packing for Paris
We gon' be there for a while, how many bags can you carry?
Or just throw 'em in the back of the Chevy
Don't even try to call me unknown
That's how you get hung up on
That number better come across
Especially if you trying to call a boss
Off the chain, off the Richter, off the scale
Off the meter when a diva dyin' to meet me, hit my cell
On the regular my cellular be jumping like a trap house
Even since I bought a crib and brung the 'Lac out
They act out but now I'm falling through to blow their back out
Text me, don't address me when I got this cash out
Call it how you want it but not collect
I don't stress over pity texts, I'm about this check
In the meantime I'ma scream down, chopper blaze
Leave your number at the beep cause I'm probably getting paid
Pistol on this plate, you can be about it, I never read about it
Most of these haters do me favors when they tweet about it
Hating on the blog cause they broads love my music
Asking for a follow just to DM that they choosing
Then I hit 'em with the digits just to keep 'em flip and moving
My cellphone 808 booming{*distorted*} "Where is everybody?"
"Don't stop now..."
"Don't stop now..."
Heyyy, yeah
I don't really wanna do nothin today
Just wanna do you tonight 
And the only way that I'll be satisfied
Is if I do you right 
I want you to feel it  comin 
Stronger  longer 
If fuckin you ain't the right thing to do
Then I can't get no wronger 
I'm pullin  hair 
Slappin derrieres 
All you gotta do is say {"Don't stop now"}
And I won't, I promise this
I'm gon' be the dominant one, I got you bitch
Squeeze that pillow, bite that shit
Ohhh, it feel good, don't it? 
Tell me that you want 
Shorty call me daddy {"Don't stop now"}
Don't stop it  stoppin
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't stop it  stop it
Don't, don't stop now
Girl, I don't really know what else I can say
But baby girl you look tight 
And I'm sittin right here lookin in your eyes
And they're tellin me everything you might like 
I want you to feel it  comin 
From a bigger  nigga 
I'm not what you're used to fuckin with 
I'm a little bit thicker

I'm in the club dropping twenty-four stacks
Cuz I'm in love and that's a well known fact
Like, yeah she know what she doing
If a nigga chillin' with a stripper then he never go back home

I'm in love with a stripper
You wanna know where Twista be on fifty
T-Pain invited me to Magic City
I'm about to have some fun 2001, in these pocket all my e-fizzles with me
I like the way mama get up on the table
I like the way she pour the honey in her naval
I like it when she smack her fatty and open it up in front of me
I wanna touch it but I ain't able
The one leg she can shake at the top of the pole
Look at the Laffy Taffy when she pop, she roll
I wanna get her in the bed right after they close
When I do a video you get the popular role
In the V.I.P. they get a lil' lap dance
Come and grind on the willy of a black man
In my ear tellin' me the shit a nigga like to hear
While I nibble on ya nipple like Pac-Man
She freakin' she lickin' she rubbin'
Then she pulled my dick out and start suckin'
All because I be the Twista
Even though T-Pain told me shorty was a freak
I asked her can I take her home

She cuttin off all my homies
Even all my other ronnies
She ain't even my main lady
See I been thinking 'bout it lately
Man she really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...
But now I'm leaving quickly
Before she come and try to get me...
And I'm takin everythang with me...

But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gone do
And I'm feeling so free...
With nobody but me...
Now I can handle all my business
All my fellas can I get a witness
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...

All night, all night

Do flirt
Soon as I see her walk up in the club 
Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs 
Sometimes when I'm with my chick on the low 
And when she's wit her man looking at me, damn right 
So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause 
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause 
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her
Then don't bring her around me 'cause 
Now swear to tell the truth
And the whole truth
When it comes to hoes I be pimping like I supposed to
Rolling like I supposed to
Shining like I supposed to
In the club, f***ing with honeys like I supposed to
I don't understand it when a n**** bring his girlfriend to club
Freaking all on the floor with his girlfriend in the club
And wondering why all these players trying to holla at her
Just soon as she go to the bathroom, n**** I'm gonna holla at her
A dog on the prowl when I'm walking through the mall
If I could man I probably would flirt with all of you
Yeah, yeah homie you say she's your girlfriend
But when I step up to her I'm gonna be like, "cousin"
Believe me man, this is how them players do it in the chi
And plus we got them playerette flirters in the chi
Now the moral of the story is cuff your b****
'cause hey I'm black, handsome, I sing plus I'm rich and 
Hey homie, if you ain't getting no money
You better keep her away from me your dig
Well if you love you girl
And wanna keep you girl
Don't be walking up and asking me to meet you girl
Because I'm well enough a flirt when I speak to girl
She winked her eyes on the slide
I've seen you girl
Better treat your girl right
'cause another man will
Better eat you girl like another man will
'cause you leave your wife
And I see you wife
That be for real
How long you think that's finna be you wife
Well I'm living the life
You just getting it right
Your old lady look at me
'cause you ain't hitting it right
She probably used to like you
'cause you're the bitter type
That's until I came along
And put some dick in her life
Wanna see how that a** looking thick in the light
I noticed she was checking me
And digging the ice
And if I get that tonight
Better hit that twice
I can even make her mine
If I hit that price
You know smack that thing
Sit that right
Up on that dresser
Yeah that's right
Pulling on her hair
Like we getting in a fight
Yeah I know it's kinda tight
But it'll suit 'er just right
So if yo girl sexy
And she test me
Don't be upset g
'cause you might catch me
Trying to catch a glance up her skirt
The McLaren in reverse
Then if I see her and I like her then I'm a flirt
Let's go y'all
 pull up to club
All the shawties be like 
Then I be like girl you know just who I am 
Say I done fell in love wit a stripper you all
All I do is flirt with her, and I get them draws
And I don't need no help, I got it down pact
Teddy paine was born to flirt now you can't down that
Now I'm flirt with her whether I'm in or out of town
That's why they call me teddy bend her a** down
I be like como se llamas little mama? mi llamo pain, what is your name?
I'm feeling your vibe
And I'm hoping you feel the same

He's mad 'cause I'm looking but I already f***ed her
I got these n****s mad 'cause 
Soon as I see her walk up in the club 
Winkin eyes at me, when I roll up on them dubs

So homie don't bring your girl to meet me 'cause 
And baby don't bring your girlfriend to eat 'cause 
Please believe it, unless your game is tight and you trust her

It's the remix
Now if you walk up in the club
With a bad chick
And she's looking at me

While you buying her drinks 
Acting like you 
Stunting like you

She be calling me daddy, and I be calling her mommy
She be calling you Kelly, when your name is Tommy
I don't know what you all be thinking
When you bring 'em round me 
Let me remind you that I am the king of R&B 
Do you know what that means?
That means if you love your chick
Don't bring her to the vip

Snap Ya FingersThe night time, the moon light
And here am I again
Living through every moment
Of how we used to be, yeah, yeah
The night time, the moon light
Is breaking through my pain
Leaving me where I'm happy
And keeping me in a dream
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Uh, wings, dreams
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
The sunrise, a new day
I'm waking up again
All alone with my memories
I keep thinking about you
The sunrise, a new day
It's nothing else but pain
I will wait for the sunset
To talk to you, in my dreams
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Daytime, the sunlight, I will never love again
We try to work it out, so many different ways but
We can never be friends
When the sun goes down and I think about you
How we used to be, then it rises again
And I loose a friend, and here I am again
Waiting on the moon of dreams
Take, take me back, take, take me back
Bring, bring me back, bring, bring me back
Like a wounded bird in the lonely sky
I just can't forget that I used to fly
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreams
Like a frozen tear on a shaking lip
Left alone with fear and it hurts so deep
Take me back, take me back, to the moon of dreams
Bring me back, bring me back to the moon of dreamsInstrumentalI got my big box full of Kleenex 
And the lights down low
Video already preset

They said I should go out more

The only reason I be goin' out for is to meet a girl from a porn video
Regular girls don't excite me
They don't , they don't know what they're doin'
I'm over here just excited
Don't give a fuck if they don't like me, I wanna see that booty
I'ma cut the phone off, won't y'all stop callin'?
'Cause all I need is some pretty good weed and a mother fuckin' 
I've been thinkin' about it and I need more love

I've been too busy on my laptop lookin' at PornHub
I got a  
Headphones on , door locked with the chair on it
 laptop dirty and the keyboard got a bunch of hair on it
They say they got some thots in the living room
And I'm like, "I don't care, homie"
Call me when Melrose Foxx is in the living room and I'm already there, homie

She gets turned off and I'm like, "Yo', listen, we just-, you know, the camera actually is a-, is gon' compliment you"
Baby, why you trippin'?
And I mean, porn is like... porn is what we do
Animals do it, we do it

I'm a racing car passing by like Lady Godiva

See I been thinkin 'bout it lately
Man! She really don't deserve me
All she wanna do is hurt me
So I gotta get away from her...

Pitbull, T-Pain, girl this a G thang

If they try to stop what we got, come on mayne!
You like the blood in my veins, the air in my lungs
Bottom line, mami, I'm sprung 
Wooo
Oooh so we went our separate ways
It's been a couple of days
But now I'm doin what I want to
With nobody tellin me what I'm gon' do
And I'm feelin so free
With nobody but me
Now I can handle all my business
All of my fellas, can I get a witness?
But I'm feelin kinda lonely
On top of that I'm kinda horny
And I gotta get back to her...

I ain't never been a sucker for love
Never even had a gilrfriend 'til I started fuckin with her
Ain't never even knocked her down
And she hooked on awards tryin to lock me down
With one flick of the tongue I was sprung
And we didn't get done 'til fo' or five in the mornin
She had me deep in the zone 
You get a brand new wardrobe but baby you ain't goin home
The new Jag and all the Louis bags
Chanel and Excata straight from Belle Harbor
I told my homeboys I'll holla
I got plans for a date, my girl want steaks
And she prefer Benihana's 
We can go from Monday to Sunday, don't even matter 'bout the money
I'm stuck on her, never shoulda let her suck on it
Shoulda hit her up and sent her home the next mornin
She got me doin, what I won't do
Got me sprung and I told you
You don't agree with me
In the end you'll see that
She got you doin, what you won't do

Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
All this music got me going crazy
Can't even concentrate on my family 
Plus I gotta go thru all this family hatred
I don't know why everybody's hatin me 
Even one of my homeboys thinking that I'm bangin his lady
I don't know why he would think that outta me 
To all the nappy headz I got you baby
We bout make it yes indeed 
I work a nine to five shawty and they think it's funny
And how they feel that my stress don't count homie
I hit the beat like a cop when I hit the block
Because my baby's gotta eat, I ain't gon never stop
I see them laughin at me fo cuz my pants red
And my do' won't shut and my car's shabby
But I see the future man like I'm nostradamus
And in my heart all I see is a future star
But in my brain ain't nothing but these notes man
But ya'll don't feel my stress ya'll don't understand
The next step is my pistol and it goes down
Wiggle it out fat boy just calm down
And sing this song, and sing that song
Cause god gon make a way for me to get my hustle on
Going thru a lot, sittin on the block now
Thru a lot, slangin out my drop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, I'm hittin on the cops now
Thru a lot, wishin they would stop now
Thru a lot, nobody's helping me whether they see it or not
Going thru a lot, thru a lot, thru a lot

Cause u was short, brown skin, and you had ADAT...
And then I heard your voice come out, I unballed my fist
I can't remember too much after that but I remember this...
The sound that you made was sweeter then watermelon
If bein beautiful was a crime then you a felon...
You was right next door so I could see you anytime
Dinner time, spring, fall, summer, winter time...
This tha episode: boy meets girl, then girl meets world
Lil' bored, then boy and girl have lil girl
Then the girl grows healthy, year after year
People wanna hear her talk so she makes it a career
And girl makes daddy happy
Cause now people know him
They b hollerin out his name an he don't even know him
I wanna thank you for everything that you gave me
Cause baby you are, baby, baby you are, baby, baby you are...
You are my lady...
My everything, my baby...

On top of that I'm kinda horny
And-and I gotta get back to-to her-her

Designated driver take the keys to my truck

Honies in the street say, "Monty, yo, we made it!"
It feels so good in my hood tonight
The summertime skirts and the guys in Kani
All the gangbangers forgot about the drive-by
You gotta get your groove on, before you go get paid
So tip up your cup and throw your hands up

Now let me tell youa lil story about this young rappa man see from the heart and the start he had a passion man rappa producer a whole stack things but then one day he said yoyu know i man has to changeYo, what's up, everybody?
This is Lil' Jen, aka MC Gelfling!
I'm about take you on a little journey!
Raise up your glasses, y'all
And get ready for the story of the Dark... Cris... tal!
Once upon a time, in the distant land of Thra
There was a huge-ass super-sized bottle of Cristal
Living under three suns, all the peeps were having fun!
They were clinking and drinking, Cristal for everyone, but then there was a drive-by
Oh, snap, hit the deck! It was the Skeksis in a Lexus with a tech!
Bond got wrecked, it split two different races to two different places
The Skeksis headed West with their creepy dead bird faces
The UrRus waited on the East Coast for all their help to come
They were a bunch of Mystics who liked to sit around and hum...
Aw, yeah, that sounds good right there
In step, the prophecy, there's no stopping me!
Gelfling's gonna help things, pretty soon we'll be poppin C-R-I-S to the T-A-L
Full throttle, fix the bottle, and break that spell!
The whole world is ugly; no one's sipping on bubbly
Want to get busy, but without the fizzy, the ladies won't love me
I've gotta save the land of Thra; I hear a foreign distant call
Gonna wreck me some Skeksis and go get that Cristal
I went to Aughra and got that cracked up shard of Cristal
Then I met Kira and Fizzgig, he was a little fuzzy ball. 
Jumped on a Landstrider, rode to the castle, faced off with the Skeksis. Man, those dudes are crazy assholes!
I put the cracked shard of the bottle back into the right spot!
Now the East and West Coasts got back together, and this joint is f***ing hot!
Yeah, this party's a blast, Cristal's flowing fast
I'm thinking I wanna get up in Kira's ass
We're all having a ball, so there won't be no last call
West and East, squashed the beef! They're all drinking Cristal
But the people still coming, and the Mystics still humming, they go...
That's the end of the Dark Cristal

In my head waitin for the perfect time to
Drop that bass on you
What ya think about it?

I know you like it
You can't do nothin but ride wit it 
Why is my hand touching your leg

You think it's cool 
You think it's cool so do I
Now if it's one thing I gotta do to you
I'm not leaving out this room until I
But what if I go down
And further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
To your belly chain--sike 
But what id I go further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
And further down
Make you say my name
Twice
Now you can try to find it if you wanna
But I'm tellin ya babe
This feeling is uncontrolable
And this is the first time for us
So trust

That high 
Take your clothes off
Go 'head and show off
What you got
Look at that pretty face on ya
Slim waist on ya
Girl ya make wanna 
Shit
Excuse my language baby
But all I can say is
Shit
Nah, we don't need it
It feels so good without it
I think it's bout that time
