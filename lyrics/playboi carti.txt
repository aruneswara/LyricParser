Switchin' shifts from the alley to corner
See them cops at the block and yell right out
We don't put in, we out here with two jobs
You ain't trappin', you best have that pipe out
40 Glock with the stick and the light out
Roll the window down, stick this bitch right out
Nigga talkin' like he sick in this cold world

Internet got the world tryna fight now
All these tweets get a fucknigga hype now
Disrespect me, I'll go to you right now

Lay a fucknigga out if I like how
Livin' nights on that block, I couldn't lie down
Interrogations and I'll put that lie down
Still keep them choppers where we go

Never had the time to play until the neighbors leave
Trans fool bitch it's time to skate
Tram to the devil it's the only time life makes sense
Fuck with the zombie you'll get redder than a white bitch
It's like my world is the residence
Life can be so pleasant when you living that shit reckless
Living that shit reckless
Corduroys on a golden boy
Supreme team with gold blings
Signatures on they wings
Parachute bags, brass knuckles and knick knacks
Pockets full of cheddar and empty dime bags
Rollin up the hash with the fellas
Higher than ever

Zombie Gang to the other
Thats my brother JC
Just raised from another
Thats my nigga though we bringing bitches to the condo

...:
But you didn't have to cut me off 
Make out like it never happened and that we were nothing
And I don't even need your love
But you treat me like a stranger and that feels so rough
No, you didn't have to stoop so low
Have your friends collect your records and then change your number
I guess that I don't need that though
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Now you're just somebody that I used to know
Verse:
Now and then I think of all the times you scrеwed me over
But had mе believing it was always something that I'd done
But I don't wanna live that way, Reading into every word you say
You said that you could let it go, And I wouldn't catch you hung up on somebody that you used to know
