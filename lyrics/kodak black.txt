I might take off on you peons and go away to Venus
I'm a star so I put a neutron on my pinky

I gave it all I could give
I made it hot at the crib
I kept that fire at the crib
Where you gon' go when you dip?
How I'ma know who for real?
I pour a four in a fifth
You already know what it is
I keep a pole in the whip
'Cause a lot of these niggas out here envy me
It ain't no ho in the clique
None of my dawgs got fuckboy tendencies
I don't even show no sympathy
Sipping on Hennessy, got me bending sideways
Everything on me drippin', you niggas can't ride the wave
Nigga run around with the juice, nigga come spill your drank
I done earn my stripes now I'm tryna go get me some real rank
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious
And it's like every song I'm on, I be calling my spirits
I put my Hublot on rocks
I put Moscato on rocks
Where I’m from we don’t say opp
Shoot at an OV, shoot at a cop
Shoot at the police, shoot at your top
I made a million off socks
Free all my niggas who stuck in a box
Locked up and watching the clock
Locked up, they fighting with locks
Locked up, they swinging they knifes
I can't be living this life
No more Bacardi, alright
I don't want Cardi so I'ma pour Henny on ice
My vision is vivid, told you I'm really a menace
I'll show you I'm destined to get it
I be outside with the glizzy
Toting that fire, I be trippin'
I just might die how I'm livin'
Ain't take no bath, but I'm drippin'
Niggas ain't catching me slipping, ayy, yeah
I make you laugh when you with me
Know that my swag is terrific 
Ain't seen my dad in a minute
But I can't be mad, I got millions
I just pulled up in a lemon
Thuggin', so fuck your opinion
I'm thuggin', so fuck how you feeling
I'm calling my spirit
Readin' through my third eye 'cause I got tunnel vision
Had to open my mind, then I opened a Benz
It's like you gotta sell your soul for them to pay attention
Fuck all that playing, now I'm grown, I put my heart in it
I had to get down with that chrome to show them niggas I'm serious

Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
I just pulled up in the Benz
It was just me and my mans
Fishbowl, no tint
Scooping your hoe and her friends
Won't take that bitch to the movies
Ain't got no love for the groupies
Seat back while she do me
She get wetter than Jacuzzis
She on go like a green light
She get ran through like a red light
If the head right, then the bread right
Shawty know I be there every night
Rollin', rollin', whip A1 like steak sauce
Zero to sixty, I take off
Can't see me, looking like Ray Charles
They tell me slow down, I'm goin' too fast
Young nigga, I just wanna do the dash
I'm so reckless, hope I don't crash
'Cause I'm ballin', like the whip stolen 
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
All big bankrolls, I got no hoes
I just left my girlfriend, I'm in love with the Ghost now
She's full of emotions and now she's my old bitch
'Cause my 'Rari knows how to ride, when it goes down
And my watch on froze, watch it glow, when the lights out
If it's hot or cold, we gon' still bring the bikes out
I jump out a Rolls-Royce and I hop in a Lamb' now
When I push the button, they like, "What the fuck is that sound?"
Damn, I'm the man now
Only pulled up in this whip, so I could stand out
Bought a icy ring and told 'em it's no handouts
Started up a label, 'bout to make a band now
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
I'm looking at you haters through my rear view mirror
I'm sliding in some shit you see in Fast & Furious
I'm switching lanes on 'em, but I don't got no gears
Shawty say she wanna ride, but she don't know how to steer
They paid me for a show, but I didn't even appear
They say, "Kodak Black, you drive like he ain't got no fear"
They say, "Kodak Black, you act like you ain't got no care"
I say my car got a horse like I'm in a marriage
Pull up in a 'Rari, I, jump out with your shawty
Driving like a crash dummy, speeding to that cash money
Money all in my head, if I wreck I'm dead
Shit, I'm driving, that no cracker wouldn't even get behind
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last 
All these horses in my car got me going fast
I just wanna do the dash, put my pedal to the gas 
Going so fast, hope I don't crash 
One false move, that could be my last I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
‘Cause I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
I told my mama we gon’ be fine
So I’m up all night way after sleep time
I’m just thinkin’ ‘bout Lil Kuda
Gave my dog a dime
He put a buckshot in a nigga’s behind
No daddy so I grew up to the street life
But my son, I’ma keep him in the beehive
Scheming on a heist, I need to change my life
Been geekin’ all night, I’m going senile
With two niggas toting three 4-5’s
I seen a nigga play gangsta, then he broke down
Lost a lot, lost his mind in the courthouse
I’m on XXL, I’m in New York now
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewind
I keep thinkin’ ‘bout my niggas
I think I need a jigga
I would keep on falling victim
Lost up in the system
Miss my brothers and my sisters
Damn I miss my lil one
I know sometimes I be tripping
But I just miss my niggas
I got codeine in my liver
I gave the judge a piece of me
I’m too street for the industry
But I think that’s where I need to be
‘Cause verbally, mentally, and physically I keep that heat
Me and my brother fit in
We smoking one with PnB
Niggas say they fuck with me
But lowkey they be easin' me
Bitches don’t mean shit to me
People tryna sentence me
How a youngin’ posted on the street, gon’ call it Sesame
1K ‘til the death of me, don’t put your life in jeopardy
I done gave the jails too many years
Years that I won’t get back
And I swear I done shed too many tears
For niggas that I won’t get back
Yeah I got niggas in the graveyard
Niggas in the state yards
I swear not a day goes by
That I don’t think about the times
I wish that I could rewindDamn girl, you so fine, I had missed you
I thought I was never gon' see you, dawg
Shit crazy
At times I thought a nigga wouldn’t ever see ya
But now I'm back out here and I won’t ever leave ya
I was wilin' with my strap, I was totin' ninas
You know I pull up in the jag I want you in a bimmer
Tell my momma you my one and only girl I need ya
Tell my baby, you my lady, I just wanna please ya
I be pullin' on yo hair when I be stroking deeper
I know you don’t like that smell when I be smoking reefer
You my favorite alphabet, they just wanna be ya
I remember poppin' checks, runnin' up the meter
I can take you to a place you thought you'd never go
I can do some things for you, you thought impossible
Man sometimes I just be thinkin' I won't ever make it
Cause I be goin' through a lot of situations
I'ma keep it real with you, girl I'm infatuated
I'ma show you that I love you I will never fake it
I remember drinking lean, living like the matrix
I always see you in my dreams, I love to see you naked
Girl you know I'm from the streets, yeah I'm a project baby
Wonderin' would you stay with me if I don’t ever make it
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil' trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubble
I'm forever your lil' hustler
You so bad I don't want to see you fuckin' with no busta
To see your face again It got me captivated
Keep it real with me what you been doing lately
I need a jump right in that pussy, I feel like a virgin
After you drop that neck I'm gonna drop some verses
I ain't seen you in so long it got me feelin' nervous
I'm sorry for leaving you, ain't do that shit on purpose
Girl I miss you, I love ya
And I can't wait to touch ya
Girl you know that I just wanna kiss you and hug ya
Hold me down when I’m gone, I got in a lil' trouble
But one day I be home and together we gon' bubbleInstitution

I don't know when I'm coming home, that's how I really feel 
I know it's gettin' to you bad, you probably shedding tears 
You hearing rumors, they saying I caught eleven years 
I hope you understand 'cause it's the life I live 
And this what come with a street nigga, girl, that's what it is 
I'm in this situation, but could you love me still? 
'Cause I won't change on you, even if I get a record deal 
I'ma rip my heart out my chest, put it in this envelope 
They got me way in Virginia, with these Virginia folks 
Without my mama and my brothers, girl, you all I got 
And could you send me some pictures? 'Cause that would mean a lot 
I'm wondering what you doing and where the hell you at 
And when I do get back, I hope you where I left you at 
And if they send me to jail, would you send me a pack? 
I'm in here writing raps , I'm in here gettin' fat 
But one day I'll be back, they can't hold me forever 
Okay, now write me back , I'm waiting on your letter 
I'm missing you, I'm like what you doing?

You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run away
Baby I won't up and leave you straight
I got your back forever I'ma make sure you straight
It's like I'm feeling you more and more every day
I'm asking God is this a blessing he just sent my way
You looking gooder than some cake I call you Anna May
Got her on her tippy-toes like she balleray
She heard I'm creeping with some hoe called Valarey
She thinking something going on she say I'm acting strange
Red Bull I'ma keep you up under my wings
I ain't saying I'm a vet but I'ma keep you tamed
Yellow baby love to squeeze her like lemonade
Running all around my mind like a skating ring
You the golden one you caught my eyes had to make you mine
Say you the chosen one you genuine you be down to ride
I'm so tired of people telling you I'm doing things
I need you to stop accusing me of playing games
I been down this road before but this don't feel the same
Cause every time I hold you close it's like you ease my pain
You been riding for so long I hope you never change
Just ride with me down this road it ain't no switching lanes
It's like I'm feeling you more each and every day
I ain't letting you go don't you run awayI'm God-sent, I know I’m God-sent
I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God
I'm God-sent, like He sent me up so I can relay these messages
Like He use me as his vessel, like He use me as an instrument
Tryna locked me in a box, they hate how God just keep on blessin' me
They locked me in a box, I pray to God this ain't my destiny
I don't drink no lean, I’m sippin’ on holy water like this my medicine
I'm a livin’ testimony, every album like a testament
Everything I went through made me who I am 'cause he be testin' me
So I'm breakin’ bread with all my fam 'cause I don't take no ecstasy
I done sacrificed my niggas 'cause none of my niggas see the best in me
They want me slingin' metal like the Devil, but I'm Heaven-sent
My brother, my mother them addicts fuck my daddy 'cause he neglected me
I'm 20 years old, but I act like I been here before, like I'm a veteran
He speak this shit through me like I'm a prophet, but I'm a reverend
Put my blood, sweat and tears in all these lyrics 'cause this my Exodus
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
I'm dyin' so I can live, so I can live, I resurrected it
Ayy, blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
I just shot a nigga, now I can't sleep
My brother, he just washed me down with bleach, oh
Project baby, snotty nose, head peezy
Now everybody 'round the world tryna be me
Miss my niggas, hope they see me on the TV
I'm on Instagram showin' off my VV's
You won't understand that this wasn't easy
I been walkin' 'round with my head peezy
Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
Mama, I fell victim to the streets, I'm sorry
I'm in middle school; sellin' weed in the hallway
I was skippin' school, got in beef, started robbin'
Jackboy, that's my G, we like Batman and Robin
God, I know you lookin' out for me through the darkness
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
Stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', baby
Blood in my eyes, I'm goin' blind, oh
I'm stuck in these streets, feel like my life froze
I've been runnin' these streets, got me dehydrated
I've been livin' so crazy, feel like I'm dyin', babyNow, Minister Malcolm, the thing that I thought might be good for starting it off is to talk about one of the most pervasive beliefs in the general society about the Nation of Islam
Talkin' to you like talkin' to myself
'Cause it ain't no gettin' through to you at all I swear
And I've been thinkin' 'bout you since I came to jail
I've tried to reach out to you, but it was to no avail
Guess it ain't nothin' else to do when we outgrew each other
We hard down beefin' like we never knew each other
Top off the coupe, no bikini, became our life now
I'm sippin' Bellini, livin' that lifestyle
And that is that it is an organization dedicated to the use of violent means to attain its goals. The question I have is, how true is this, and why do you think it persists in society?
Poppin' pills, poppin' pistols, I put my mic down
I almost lost my life that night, I was on a bloodhound
They tryna tell us put the bikes up and the guns down
X was tryna buy a bike then he got gunned down
X was tryna change his life, but he got burned down
X wasn't ridin' with no pipe so he got gunned down
Listen, do as I say, don't do as I do
Nine out of ten, it ain't gon' end up lookin' good for you
Have never at any time been guilty of initiating any aggressive acts of violence during the entire 33 years or more that the honorable Elijah Mohammed has been teaching us. The—
If I wasn't rich, you wouldn't be pullin' up to my funeral
First they kissin' you, huggin' you, then they suin' you
If it was me, it was you, I'm wonderin' what you would do
I just pulled up on your mama, homie, she beautiful
Yeah, gotta keep the strap, can't let you latch all on me
I got married to the game, she put these racks all on me
Now I got diamonds on my ring, look like a matrimony
First they screamin' my name, then file a lawsuit on me
You would hate to see me reach my full potential
You want me robbin', poppin' Mollies, poppin' pistols
I'm goin' to college 'cause to the youngins I'm influential
Thought it was Congress, they ain't know this was a Presidential
They ain't know that I was intellectual
You tryna change your life, but they won't let you
I know they know I'm special, why they playin' with me?
You talkin' jewels, I'm droppin' jewels, you see the difference
Coppin' jewels for your dawgs, they don't appreciate it
Everybody gon' say you fake when you make it
Back of the Maybach with the tints so you don't notice me
When the money bring the fame, you can't even roll in peace
Guess all the pain that I went through had to be the recipe
I stood tall through it all and brought out the best of me
Ayo, dismiss all them charges, that ain't my destiny
Everything I said, I stood on it, I got integrity
G.A., I put my hood on it, I bring the 'jects with me
You need security by your grave so you can rest in peace
Tide
Charge of violence against us actually stems from the guilt complex that exists in the conscious and subconscious minds of most white people in this country. They know that they've been violent in their brutality against negros and they feel that some day the negro is going to wake up and try and do unto as them as they have done—do unto the whites as the whites have done unto usAyy, I'm just going through one of my old pads and shit, you know what I'm sayin'?
You know, a nigga so versatile I don't even need no auto-tune and none of that shit
I could sweep the flow up, the melody
Like I could speak to all her fans through every genre
I fuck wit this beat, tough though, ya heard
Helluva made this beat, baby
Everything on my path for this
I swear to God, dawg, I never imagined this
I remember I was out there on my savage shit, carjacking shit
On my snappin' shit, trappin' shit, ratchet shit
Seem like I lost more than I ever gained
Ain't get nun out these streets but pain
Ain't get nun out these streets but hard times
'Cause in these streets ain't nun but hard times
Tell C.B. I say wassup
Tell everybody I say what's happening
Tell E-Pimp I said shoot me som'in
Tell them boys I said stop flaggin'
Tell my momma that I'm comin' home
Tell the world that it won't be long
Ask my hoes wassup with they phones
Tell 'em I'm away but I ain't gone
I said boo bear what you wanna do
Once you slide, imma follow through
The stand took a nigga up and through it
Lil Dash told me, Kodak don't do it
Tell my son that I love his ass
Tell 'em I can't wait to hug his ass
This for the niggas who got all that time
Now they trying to give them numbers back
A nigga shot my cousin four times
I heard through the wall my brother doubled back
I just bumped into this super jit
I'm hollering at Lil Fam through the vent
I'm letting you know I do this shit for fun
Tell me go then consider it done
Shoutout Petho and my brother blood
My nigga C-Lo he just caught a thug
I'm shooting cee-lo in a nigga ass
They hit a nigga for his whole bag
Tell them boys I said stop crabbing
Send it even if I never asked
I knew I should've told my lil nigga DJ to chill
But I can't tell him shit he doin the same shit that I will
I'm thinking bout how would it be if we ain't get on them pills, if we ain't never chose the streets and picked up the steel
I'm thinkin' bout how would it be if we stayed on the field
Like I ain't even have to rap, 'cause I got other skills
At nights we ran down with them sticks and got them automobiles
And we was jackin' cars and shit 'cause it wasn't hard to steal
Like doin bids and seeing it come, but this the life I live
But I know that this my last one, something gotta give
Seem like God, got me paying for all the shit I did
'Cause I slowed down a while ago, switched up positive
The rough was just enough for a nigga fell in love with the thrill
But before he forgive me I gotta pay for it still
And I done did so much of shit that I ain't proud I did
But when I took rappin' serious I threw the towel in
But Lord you say you gon' forgive me, so forgive me then
'Cause I done picked the Bible up and read Corinthians
I'm still young and I got a lot to experience
I guess the first time in my life I felt this serious
I gotta lil boy now and I wanna be there for bruh
The feeling he give a nigga I ain't never felt this way before
And you can look into my heart and see that I'm forreal
That I done resulted in a metamorphosis
God, you know my destiny 'cause you gave me this gift
You the one who put this breath in me to make me spit these lyrics
You done gave a nigga a chance to pay my momma bills
You done turned me to a man unlike my daddy is
No this ain't over, I got some more to spit
That was for the real niggas
I got some shit for the hoes
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
She nothing like you, she different
She nothing like you, she magnificent
She intelligent, she love me better than you
Better than, she love me better than you
She made me happy, she made me smile
She brought me up, when you let me down
Could you hold the title, it come with a life
Could you hold the title, you don't have to lie
Could you hold the title, could you play the role
You can't hold the title, baby let me know
Could you hold the title, could you play the part
Could you hold the title, till death do us part
Could you hold the title, hold a nigga down
Could you hold the title, tryna figure out
Take you out to dinner, stick this dick in your liver
I'm fuckin' your head up I'm playing these mind games witcha
I'ma suck that pussy good, then you ain't gon' hear from a nigga
I'm fuckin your head up with all these extracurriculars
I can fuck Virgin Mary, 'cause the game so unordinary
Had plans on gettin' married til they had me on solitary
You left me here stranded, I'm feelin' abandoned
You got me so hurt right now I need me a bandage
Transgression
Show you your corner, who gone stay solid and be down for you
When you really want 'em, when you really need 'em
When them people playing with your freedom
When a nigga shit on me one time but I be tryna get even
I'm tryna get equal
I'm iced out riding with that heater
I'm in that Thunderbird, I'm sliding with that Desert Eagle
Tell me who my people, show me where my folks at
Who gon' ride for Kodak?
Who gon' up and shake on me?
Who gon' jump the gate on me
Pillow case that thang on it
In case he tryna lay on me
Changed my address
But karma she know where I stayed on it
But that bitch better come correct she know that I stay on it
I ain't sleeping so forget about coming creepin' late on me
Got the 12 gauge on me
I got the 38 on me
I got the MAC-10, I used to have the baby 'K on me
I bought a Xbox but I don't play on it
PS4 but I don't play no games on it
The beat over got so much to say on it
My heart cold put a glacier on my wrist
I'm forever abnormal
I know I wrote this shit longer than a average rapper
Ya'know I'm sayin glee
But you got me fucked up
I be damn if you don't let me keep ridin' this shit boy
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I'm pulling scams, identity theft
Don't buy my album, 'cause I don't care
I be damn if I don't find a way to make some cash
I be damn if she come over and she don't get mad
Be damned, I be damn if she think she gon' get a bag
I be damn if you get me and I don't get you back
187 you screw me and you get nailed
I wrote this in the cell, free my niggas who ain't tell
I be damn, I be damn if I  go out without the heat
I be damn if I take that nat nat out to eat
Boy you ain't livin' like that you know you ain't in the streets
Even my ho can get whacked, I be strapped when I be sleep
I be damn if you niggas come run up on me
I just called my woo man, told him pray over me
I be damn I be damn if I don't come home in a week
I be damn I be damn thinkin' a young nigga sweet
I be damn if she don't call me soon the molly kick in
I be damn if she don't tell she gon wanna turn up again
Yo bih gave me a key, put me on her lease
I'm standin' at the feast til they bring in me a beast
It's too much weight on my shoulder so don't tell me hold up
Feel my heart gettin' colder turning to a polar
Reppin' Broward County Florida, I'm from out the nolia
Project baby a lil Haitian from the ugly cornerOff top, chargin' extra for a rock
Finessin' all I know, that's how I grew up on my block
How you think I filled my shoebox up with knots?
Was thuggin' on the block, I ain't wanna punch a clock
I was gettin' bands while ya mans was gettin' hot
Sold my .22, he the reason I bought the Glock
Pop, one false move ya get shot
Catch me slippin', going with a smile like I'm Pac
Just want a bone, I'm a dog, nah I'm a beast
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you tear up the sheets
'Cause when I drop this dick, bet you come back for more
I'ma come back 'til you suck me 'til ya throat sore
Aye, aye, aye ho nigga
Might just make you my bae
Just playin' hoe, come let me nut in yo' face
Nigga play with me I'ma knock off his face
Call Draco and Tae, they gon' let that bih spray
Gang, snipe 'em, bang bang
No drive-by, this personal, hit you close range
If we really beefin' why you put it on the 'Gram
If we really beefin' why you ain't thinkin' 'bout ya man, or ya fam
Can't catch you, they gettin' blammed
Easy to touch you, I don't gotta use my hands
Easy to touch you nigga when you got them bands
Nigga be hatin', lowkey he just a fan
On my block with the Glock, run down on a opp
Was a jit when they tried me, try me now they gettin' shot
Anybody try me now, on God they gettin' popped
Fuck nigga run up, swear yo' life gettin' robbed
Make a pussy nigga wish he went and got a job
Hit his ass with that rara, I'm a shotta
Free smoke, no ganja, Mad Max ya
Re-rock ya for actin', deserve a Oscar, boy ya fake
Real fragile, they be quick to break
Turnin' state, they jump on ya case, trap you in the gates
I know niggas doing time who ain't got release dates
Spendin' most of their time plottin' on a great escape
Niggas hate, guess all the loyalty been misplaced
This not a race but I chase the cake like I can't wait
No more dirt where I lay, so I stay outta state
I ain't tryna rack out so I stay out the way
From the draco to the .40 put respect on it
Aimin' at his head, he might have a vest on him
I'm from the Noya where a donk sit on Forgis
Ya gotta keep a .30 if ya ballin' like Curry
Sippin' lean, it got my vision blurry
Sippin' lean, got me movin' like a zombie
Got me reminiscin' when they tried to hide me
Throw away the key so they can't find me
Yeah I'm on my grimace, mezanmi
Let the Glock pop and I pop molly
Stopped sellin' rocks cause I love robbing
Whole life you been on the block grinding
Yeah, you just wanna pop free molly
That's the only reason you 'round me
No, you cannot get on my IG
This a selfie, stop tryna get by me
Let me out the cage, now I'm in ya broad jaw
Cool cat, I'm a mut, I'm a raw dog
I know all you niggas thinkin' I'ma fall off
I just took a lil' break, y'all need to calm down
We be strapped in ya city like it's our town
In the field, straight fonk a nigga outta bounds
How you snap a play then call timeout
Blitz ya runnin' back, knock the whole line out
Yeah, once the pressure on, you can't call off
Nigga hopped on the phone and brought the cops out
I don't sell drugs so I don't come out
I'm posted in the cut with the sawed off
12 gauge on me, I ain't pump fakin'
I'ma serve foolie like the lunch lady
I ain't catch 'em dancin' in the cut lately
Trust me, I ain't come to throw no ones baby
I'ma dump when the thump make ya jump, shake it
Grab the pole, strip a fuck nigga butt naked
And you ridin' police escort safety
I was in the gym, now I got court cases
Nah, you don't want beef, you don't want ham
Nah, you don't want me, you don't want nan
You don't ya whole meat knocked off ya cranium

Fish scale or molly, it's the same name
Murder by the stains, which gang you claim?

Fucked that junkie behind the dumpster for some cocaine

Thirty golds in my mouth like I'm Stephen Curry

Tried to leave me in the cold
These streets took my conscience from me
Now tough love is all I show

I was in that cell, he told me that I’m gifted
I don't make it in the booth, then I'ma make it in the kitchen
I’m special with the mic, special with the whippin'
I ran out of money, had to pay attention
All the people that was 'round me, they ain't have my best interest
You ain't have my best interest
You lazy with yo' loyalty and yo' position
And now I gotta execute 'cause you don’t listen

So what's wrong with turnin' that hoe into a princess
Yap, I can turn that hoe into a model
Scoop her in the Bentayga, no more Monte Carlo
If she ain't in a coupe with me, I want nobody in it
Bendin' corners wit' ya and my windows ain't even tinted
Babe, don't call me ese but I love it when we kick it
Fuck that he say, she say, it ain't nobody business
They ain't gon' like it, they ain't gon' like it
They ain't gon' like us, they gon' wanna fight ya
And I don't like people but I think I like her
I done let that hoe inside my heart now, wanna wife her
If I wife her I'm going Steve Austin with the ring
There's a stone cold diamond on her finger and it bling
I'm 'bout to cut off all my friends, I'm 'bout to cut off all my kin
Man, that pussy be pullin' me in, I thought it was a one night stand
I thought it was a one night stand like the lamp on my dresser
So she a lil dirty heifer, but this girl special
Thought it was a fling, thought she was a fling
I've been havin' dream lately, she might be my main
'Could you be my main? Could you be my baby?
Lifes gave me lemon, wonder could you be my main squeeze
Damn I fell in love with a nat
But every sinner got a future, and every saint got a past
So I ain’t even finna hold her accountable to that
'Cause baby see you ride, yo, that lil' bitch, she got my back
Baby she be ridin', that lil' bitch, she got my back
And when we ride, yo, my 'lil bitch she hold the strap
My nigga startin' cryin' when we went out in scraps
My babe more real than you, she one thou, keep that shit a stack
I don't throw no money, took my bitch to the club and threw some racks
Man with the plan, master mind my crafts, no more shootin' craps
I ain't no dog but call me Ken with the Ben, fucking on a brat
My lil bitch a brat, I hate how she act
But I love how she act, that my lil diva
If you keep it up I'm put you on a TV-show
I was just trynna rap, you turned me to a singer
Found my focus back, turned me to believerCan I, baby? 
Can I, baby? 
Can I, baby? Can I, baby?
I hope you ain't nothing like my old friends 
Or any other women that I had 
I know I'm better than your ex-boyfriend 
Or any other niggas from the past 
Can I take you where I learned the game from? 
Show you why I act the way I act 
Lately, I've been on a fucking marathon 
Running to the motherfucking cash 
I'm liking how you make a brother laugh 
Can I come and get you in a Jag? 
Then, hit it in the backseat of the Jag 
Baby girl, I know you like my swag 
Before I turn the lights out
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I?
I'm just so excited that I'm free
Sometimes, it be feelin' like a dream 
Can a young brother get some sleep? 
Lately, I've been working over 3 
Mama told me, "Son, I never hear from you" 
Cook something, you don't even eat 
Mama, I'm just trying to make a mil' for you 
Put you in a condo on the beach 
Before I turn the lights out 
Can I, I told you before you turned the lights on
Can I, ayy look
'Fore I turn the lights out, tell me who the fuck you want to be
Can I?
Why they just can't let a nigga be?
I've been busy, I've been doing me 
Have you thinking I've been with the Zoe pound 
Me and all my niggas come in deep 
On the ground, young ten toes down 
I can put a nigga on his feet 
I caught the Audi, then I ran the check up 
And, I ain't even been out here a week 
Got my shooter playing hide and seek 
Just in case you niggas try and creep 
Everybody wanna be your friend now 
Better watch the company you keep 
Everybody got they fucking hand out 
See you eating now they want a piece 
Oh, that's Kodak Black whom I've been hearing bout' 
He the hottest nigga in the streets 
If you love me, love a nigga deep 
When you see me, what you really see? 
To everybody else, I was a sour guy 
But, I be treating you a little sweet 
I'm so close to showing her my real side 
Show this girl another side of me 
I think we've been getting along real fine 
You love it when I hit it on the beach 
I've been working hard, ain't got no spare time 
I can't even party on the week 
I'm just trying to see where your head at 
When you grow up, what you wanna be? 
Run up on a nigga, where the bread at? 
I be going ham for the cheese 
I just wanna see all of my niggas home 
They can't wait to get back on the streets 
I just talked to Jackboy on collect phone 
He told me he ain't trying to take the plea
Can I?  Baby
Can I?  Baby
For my niggas, I'll swim across the sea
Can I?  Baby? 
Can I? Baby, Can I?  Baby
Can I?First day out
Gave my mama hundred racks
And bought a iced-out AP watch
And bought a Cuban links just to match
That was voodoo, that was magic
Nigga be cappin', I just be laughin'
That was God, nigga was fastin'
And hidin' K2 in my mattress
Smokin' Tunechi in my cell
That was my twelfth time going to jail
That was my second time going to hell
And back for real but I prevail
Canary yellow diamonds in my bracelets
Same color as my lady
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy Mack
And go half on a baby
'Bout to hit her with no Jimmy
Have her walkin' like a penguin
Still finessin', still be poppin' fraud finagling and wangling
And a brand new two-door Wraith
I coulda bought it but I just rent it
Got a brand new big old chain
Got so much sauce I don't need no pendant
Paintin' pictures when I be spendin'
I'm poppin' flo-rhythym on all these women
It's my birthday, just turned 20
And I just went to go see the dentist
Put some stones all in my gold
Know you niggas thought I was gone
Know you niggas thought I wasn't comin' home
But guess what, bitch I'm home
On probation, but I still keep that chrome
Crack a nigga dome
(On probation but I still keep that chrome
I'll crack a nigga dome)
Traded my AR for a sniper, traded my Draco for a TEC
Traded my Rollie for a AP but I coulda got a Patek
And I coulda got a Corvette, and I coulda got me a jet
And I coulda got me some sex, but I only got me some neck
Traded my ex bitch for a check
I'm takin' codeine with the x
I wanna buy my brother the world
But since I can't, I'ma get him a Lex
Ayy ayy, I'm a Israelite my diamonds is real ice
I had to sacrifice to be here, that's how I'm with you tonight
I had to run down with my big Glock 9 to feed my appetite
I had to go through hard times and dark times for me to see the light
Ay, I remember pourin' honey on my rice
Ay, I remember havin' no money, I was livin' in shacks
Ay, you got me fucked up if I'ma go out without a fight
Ay, this my first day out, I'ma live it up tonight

It's getting hot in here, the block be hot, no not Nelly
You can keep the Rari, I'd rather have a Chevy
I don't want no head, lately I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly
She walked up to me, I was by the bar, she like hello
She rolled up on me, I was rollin' up my cigarillo
No, I don't fuck with Grabba leaf, I'm breaking down the elpo
I'm always smoking loud, I can't keep it on the L-O
Girl, I don't like the way your booty flop, it's like jello
And now I'm rockin Robin Jeans, remember wearing Ecko
She say she just came to chill, look, bitch, this ain't a Getty
I told that bitch get outta here, act like you never met me
I'm up the road, I'm lurking for them books, no library
Lil' niggas state-to-state, I get more cake than lil' Debbie
No, I can't save a ho, I'm no neighborhood hero
Keep that shit 1K, I can't be fuckin' with a zero
My name is Kodak but you know that already

I don't want no head lately, I've been getting becky
I just want the bread, keep the peanut butter jelly
Boy, I need that green, bought my green, no asparagus
Lord forgive me please, cut the money, I just cherished it
Hit a mean lick, I took that money and I buried it
She get on her knees, O-M-G, that's embarrassing
I don't need no record deal but you gon' hear my record still
Me and DJ on the pill, we spinning like a ferris wheel
Oh, that's Kodak Black, who they be talking 'bout, that's the nigga
First I had to grow to be the man like a caterpillar
Once that jit was old enough to thug it, he was thuggin'
He just found a strap now he cut you like it's nothing
I use to pour fours, now I pour a whole dozen
Bumped into Lil Wally in the hood, hey cousin
My name is Kodak but you know that already
I don't want the wap, baby, I just want the fetty
Polo to the socks, homie, this ain't Perry Ellis
Let me get the raw, I'ma ball like spaghetti

Yeah life ain’t fair but it’s still good though
It’s a blessing just to be here
Everything 1K
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K
I woke up in the morning on a cold slab
How the hell I’m in a damn cell
I’m in jail taking cold baths
I went down the wrong path
Lil boy don’t go that way
You prolly won’t last
Before I had the fame I had the name
I earned my stripes like Adidas
Sliding base like I’m Derek Jeter
Growing up with no father, it’ll make you evil
How he gon’ learn to be a man when you ain’t never teach him?
Youngin’ can’t even read but he totin’ the Desert Eagle
Look how she left, I bet she told you she won’t never leave you
The same nigga was hating, I turned them to believers
I done made it through the rain and I ain’t called FEMA
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face
Everything 1K
I probably thank God ‘cause without him who is me?
He unlocked my cell when they threw away the key
Jailbird, I was caged in, he came and set me free
I was just on the news, now I’m on MTV
Hurting ‘cause your people ate and you ain’t get a piece
Now you’re taking from your people plate ‘cause you just tryna eat
Grinding for a mil and I ain’t talkin’ ‘bout a combo
My mama need a crib, I been thinking ‘bout a condo
You nothing when you down, it’s crazy how people treat you
Come around now, you can’t even hit the reefer
I pray for all my youngins who done took the same route
Brother from the same struggle, cut from the same cloth
I know you’re money hungry
Can’t wait ‘cause you ain’t eat all day
And you gon’ lose your mind if you don’t get a plate
I understand the ups and the downs, street niggas gon’ relate
It’s a struggle man, I’m with you all the way
This for all the soldiers fell victim to the system
Everyday that goes by they so close to losing faith
I gotta thank God for everything
It’s a miracle how you’ll wake up and your dreams right in your face

I say my prayers and tote my thang, I know they wanna kill me
Wake up in the morning, ain't got none' to eat
I had to man up to get on my feet
I go to Bay just to fuck with KD
Can't even swim but I'm deep in that sea
Got my first gun and I ain't pay a thing
Since I was young I've been slanging that heat
It be some massacres right on my street
It be some massacres right on my street
Remember they ain't gave me shit when I ain't had nothing
They want my spot but fuck them niggas, I'm focused on money
On everything, she say she love me I know she don't love me
3Three ain't round for to watch me, think I'm feeling something
My momma told me stack my M's, told me watch my homies
But I ain't listen Joe got shot, and he told on me
My uncle told me they ain't right, all them niggas phony
Can't lose it all for somebody who don't care about you

This fame it ain't immortally
I ain't finna go switch oversea
Ain't no money controlling me
Black boy gave me a throwaway
I kept that shit, I ain't throw it away
Ten bands for the Jaguar
When I wrecked that shit, I remember that day
Been up, I been on my back
Now I'm up like an insomniac
Remember I made my first stack
When Wally had that Pontiac
Went to jail and I came back
Went through hell and I came back
Was in my cell, recreating myself
I died, and then I came back
Wondering where my partners at
Ain't write me and I acknowledge that
Snoop had me selling powder bags
He ain't even give me a dollar back
Later on, started sneaking shit in my pocket like it's contraband
Finessin' had me lookin' back at my profit, I had seven bands
Me, Mark, Greg, Tracy went up the road, hit for eleven bands
Project Baby, Taliban
It's Kodak, run and tell a friend
It's for my mama, she love me
She just want the best for me
Told me I should be in the booth instead of posted up on the ugly

And once a nigga make it, they gon' wanna take it
Money don't change ya, but it do drive ya crazy
Lil' nigga out the projects, they rootin' for the baby
Even when you showin' love, they still gon' wanna hate ya
If I tell you how I feel, can I fuck?
I gotta see if the pussy good before I cuff
I'm really in the field so I need someone to hug
I'm out here like for real so I be needin' a little love
All you gotta do is grind

Ain't no time to chill
Ain't no time to vibe
All my people wanted me to sit my ass down
But I been on go since I got off my behind
Everybody wanna shine
Nobody wanna grind

Niggas ain't even showin' ya love where ya from
Them people took my 40s, so I'm about to go buy a pump
What if the trolls roll up on me right? Should I run?
Can I take you out to lunch?
I just wanna get you full then get all in your stomach
I just made shawty tell a man that she done
Lately she been tellin' me she love me, should I run?
I'm gone, I'm done
I shook and went describin'
I'm not a bad kid, I just didn't have no guidance
Fuck a home run, you boys be runnin' in houses
Robbin', connivin', wylin' and burglarizin'
Can I ball? Can I chill?

A wise man can play a fool but a fool can't play wise
Unless you judge me by my cover you can't read between my lines
I'm a street poet, poetical genius
Y'all need me, believe me
They ain't know that I was intellectual
Tryna change your life, but they won't let ya
I'm in Detroit right now
Just hollerin' at my nigga Wiz
I was hollerin' at my boy, he say he feel like he gon' die soon
Had to pray for him because he need it more than I do
How can I tell my people that's exactly the way I feel?
But I know that I'm blessed, so I won't give a bitch that idea
Runnin' from the Jakes, I was posted up with a 9 mill
Got me jumpin' gates, I got credit cards in my high heels
All my niggas fake, that shit kept comin' out like diarrhea
Syko on my line, I'ma pick him up, he in Liberia
Wiz, he just whipped up a brick and he ain't put no noodles in it
Told him I just caught me a fish, so don't put no tuna in it
They know that I'm baptized in blood, I let my soul sing it
Runnin' round wildin', I'm childish, I ain't got no home trainin'
Talking to my lil' boy, I promise won't let them boys kill me
Lookin' at my lil' boy like, "Father, don't let them boys steer me"
Nigga tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Niggas tried to trap me, I saw it, they say that boy slippery
Young nigga stickin' to the code, 'cause I don't condone snitchin'
I ain't goin' out like that rapper, I won't do no tippin'
Willie said my name on the TV, that boy a bold witness
On the news he T.I.P.’d me, that boy got no feelings
Suwoop put the pole on lil' buddy, they said The Game strippin'
Old heads ain't hittin' on nothin', I say them boys kiddin'
I want all the smoke out the stove, but I don't even roll Phillies
How the hell you callin' me out when you know I don't listen?
How you try and put me in timeout when I ain't Big Boy children?
Nigga waitin' on for me to fall off just like that boy Gillie
Said they ride for me 'til the wheel fall off, I be like, "Oh really?"
How you tell me what came out my mouth, you don't even know Nipsey?
Tiny, that bitch ugly as hell, I don't even want Piggy
I can't beat you niggas at talkin', give me a long sentence
Know I keep the pole and I ain't no ho, I know some Rollin 60s
And I'm thuggin' all on my lonely, but I keep some Zoes with me
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion, and I ain't even know it mattered
Jump right on my live and record me, everything I say be Platinum
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
Special kind of nigga, they know me, they want my name slandered
My head right on the swivel, I'm focused, they want my brain splattered
How the hell you cancel a nigga, and I don't even smoke tobacco?
Mute me when I voice my opinion, and I ain't even know it matteredI'm livin' like "catch me if you can," you know?
This the amazin' true story of the youngest and most darin' conman

My daddy don't ever see me, I ain't no devil's seed
I don't remember his last time checking up on me
Why you drop another album in a week?
I'm a wolf but I be dressing like a sheep
Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan
Popping monkeys, popping bottles, make me swing
Who the fuck you walking in and out my dreams?
I know I'm smart, you make me do some crazy things
Monkey on my back, let a nigga be

'Bout everywhere I go, I gotta bring the ski
No face, no case, live everyday like Halloween
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets

I'd trick so much individuals for a treat
K Boogie with a Hoodie, best believe
It's hot he got the hoodie on to hide the heat
And he got so much tricks up his sleeve
All the nights I had to mask up on the scheme
My subconscious got me fighting in my sleep
I can't forget about it I see it in my dreams
I'm kicking in your door, but I don't want no sweets
I'm giving you what I came for so I can leave
You know I'm serious don't you feel my energy
No this not a joke, everybody on they knees
Don't try to buck jack, you get buckeyed back
Gemini, woke up on the wrong side of the sheets

Put on my monkey suit and go orangutan
You ain't gotta be scared just respect a nigga please
I'm starting to think my cranium got a disease

Don't need no friends I gotta big family

Glock 23, it's in my jeans
You playing freeze tag but I got that beam
Sorry baby I lied, you was just a fling
I don't love ya, I just wanna get in yo jeans
Tricked her for her treat, tricked her out her panties
I can't get romantic

I can hit it from the back, ain't got to hold my breath
All these hundreds on me got me startin' to look like a scammer
All that ass she got back there startin' to look like a pamper
Pull up on your ass with a bag just like I'm Santa
Plug name Julio but he don't play for Atlanta
The only millionaire you know that wear Dope Boy Ree's
You ain't never fucked a nigga that had this much cheese
I'm just tryna run you crazy like they tried Kanye
Treat you like the mailman, make you come once a day 
Have you ever made love to a real hitter?

Your last man bought you Bebe but I'll buy you Givenchy
Biggest thing he ever did for you was take you to Chili's
Keep a bank in my pocket, call me Plies Fargo
Sex game undefeated, think I'm a hundred to nought
I don't go nowhere for free, if you got a check, I'll go

Kodak Black-
Kodak Black-
The nineteen-year-old Pompano Beach rapper-
-is reportedly back in jail after he was arrested today in Broward County, Florida
Real name is Dieuson Octave, changed his plea from not guilty to no contest
Mr. Octave, do you accept your plea?
-in the two terminal cases that have put his musical career on hold
-troubled rapper found himself back behind bars after violating the terms of his house arrest
Yeah
You know I'm a hot boy, but I ain't never lose my cool
The streets on fire, that's why I'm ridin' with my tool
1800 block boy, I'm quick to give a bitch the blues
I was already sentenced, before I came up out the womb
Streets done already sentenced me, before no cracker could
And I wonder why, when I'm just so fucked up out the hood
And I wonder why, these niggas be hatin' on a G
When I'm the same lil' nigga, who gave you niggas a chance to eat
I had to do that time, could nobody do that shit for me
When I was doin' that time, ain't nobody do that shit with me
I miss my nigga Cool, I know right now he prolly sleep
One day at a time, ten toes down until you're free
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef, had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day
They gave Lil' Marcus twenty-five, that's my man 
Remember hittin' licks and runnin' up them bands 
They gave Lil' Greg sixteen years in the pen 
For all my niggas locked up, I'm goin' H.A.M. 
They gave Lil' Ceelo twenty years, free my nigga
They say Lil' Tracy gettin' out this December
I dropped fifty-five bands from my hand
They done let me out, so now I'm goin' in
Before he go back, shoot it out with the police 
So that mean he goin' to court in these streets 
He goin' to trial right there where he stands 
For everybody did me wrong, I want revenge 
Dyin' in a cell's every street nigga fear
I give everythin' back to have my nigga here
I give everythin' back to have my nigga with me
I already know I had to beef,  had my nigga with me
I ain't tryna see the pen', I'm tryna make a shape
Neighborhood hero, I'm the one gon' save the day
Chosen one, my folks depend on me to make a way
I do it for my nigga locked up doin' day for day
This my motherfuckin' album
Paintin' pictures man, lil' Kodak, you already know thatAy boy you don't need no more of that oil boy, that's enough lick for you boy
You ain't my nigga boy you be throwed off that random boy, murk him off that oil
He was just steppin' out to the little party
End of the night ended up with a body
Big booty bitch way bigger than Mizhani
While he heat kool with the whip like Desiigner
Why I hit the top to go back to the bottom
Now I got a lil one, I shoulda wore a condom
But now I'm happy I didn't wear a condom
Cause that lil nigga right there my blessin'
Three days after I lost my grandpa
Some told me to go take that test
And it came back mine
That boy mine, the people say 99.9
How you gon' pull up and crash the party?
I'll put the slug in your ass little buddy
How you gon' steal from your lil nigga?
How you gon' act like I wasn't with ya?
I can’t  do everything by myself
But I ain't gon' be outchea askin' for help
How the hell you gon' act like a housewife
When you know everybody know you a body
Got me a pistol, I got me a shotty
I be posted up in the yo like Gotti
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
How you gon' send a nigga like me to college
Every time he step out he booted
Every time he step out it's a movie
Toting a toolie, I'm rollin' a doobie
I'm stickin' and movin', I'm burnin' and lootin'
Ain't got time for you lil niggas
Ain't got time for you lil bitches
Show me you different, show me you different
Show me you different girl, show me you different
How you gon' act like I wasn't there
How you gon' act like a nigga ain't care
I was on 1800 block all day
Nothin' was easy, had to get this shit the hard way
But I maintained, never complained
I'm true to the game, ain't never been a lame
Nigga I crewed up when I was nine
Got in these streets ,fell in love with the grind
I love the hustle
All of them nights I sacrificed, it only made me tougher
All of the trials, it made me wild
And tribulations, it made me wise
Tell my child don't fuck with them guys
We ain’t from that side, won't ont with them guys
I can't deny he got my eyes
I can't deny cause I'm not that kind
He don't even cry but he prolly might whine
I'm the jit on the school bus sellin' dimes
Why you gotta wish bad on your little whodie?
Put your ass on now you actin' all spoiled
Why you gotta talk down on your little homie?
Grandpa dropped middle of the testimony
Grandma died, guess he was gettin' lonely
Why I go HAM? Cause I don't eat baloney
Nigga you a phony, how you gon' act like you real?
How you gon' act like you trill?
Why you got the flag? A nigga already know the deal
How you gon' turn around and squeal?
Look at me leanin', I'm poppin' the seal
Look at my lips as I'm poppin' the pill, damn
Everybody acting like they my people
I don't fuck with you, I don't fuck with you neither
Woke up today went and copped a new Bimmer
Cuz a nigga got tired of the two-seater
I don't hear evil, I don't feel no evil
But I still walk around with the Desert Eagle
I just got me a referral from the teacher
Bitch I'm a Zoe, I don't do pledge of allegiance
Fuck you, lil' ho, lock my door if you leavin'I asked the Lord to send me a sign
I thought that I was blind
'Cause I ain't ever see the sign but the sign showed after time
And when I finally realized, it was too late to rewind
Guess I was just waiting on that sign
So I got up and went out on my grind
'Cause I used to cry 'cause ain't no food in the house
Seein' all the older niggas, man, they used to shine
Used to have the pretty girls and I just hoped that they was mine 
Hypnotized, I was just nine
Black boy robbed a nigga right in front of my eyes
Rapping killed time, the years flew by
'Til I got old enough to run up on you with the .9
The light man, we became friends
I see him so much, he cuttin' off the light again? 
I know his name, co-workers and his kid
He ain't comin' in the work truck, he comin' in his van
The more my stomach growled, the more I wanna lay a nigga down
Take yo' shit and make 'em cry
Mama got robbed in July, I watched her cry
So I don't care about yours 'cause they ain't care about mine
But look at me now, they told me, "Settle down"
PBL charges got me waiting on trial 
Oh, so you know now?
The sign read "Never know until you find out"
The things I found out
But they don't understand what goes on in my house
Ain't no love if you broke
'Cause if you're broke, they treat you like a bad joke
They don't even wanna laugh wit' you
When you shittin' on 'em, you can make 'em do anything
They'll even wipe your ass for you
In this world full of fame and pretty girls
It can make your mind swirl
But you just gotta think, the devil, he gon' play
Get in your brain, have you runnin' in them banks
But now, I just want the world to scream my name
Don't even club, I'm the reason why they came 
Takin' people shit, I'm the reason for they pain
Baker Act, I'm all the way insane
Poking houses, goin' crazy 'bout them chains
Them Cuban links and them rings
It's deep, the sign, I couldn't see
Man, look at me now, I'm gettin' weak
Damn, look at me now, I can't sleep
Oh, look at your boy, I can't eat
I'on think, ain't never think
All for some money, I might blow it all in a week 
But it's Kodak, you niggas know that
I'm 'bout whatever and I'll hit a nigga like a road rat
But fuck that, right now, I'm chilling
Slow money 'cause fast money will get me sentenced
I was in it, they say I'm a menace
Say I'm sleepin', and when I wake up I'll be in prison 
I'm chilling, this how I'm feeling
Give me a deal, give me mill' so I'm finished
Forget it, I'm still willing
To mask up and hit yo' granny for a penny
They say I'm stupid, say I'm foolish
Kamikaze, Baker Act, but I know what I'm doing
Fuck school, everybody on the campus
I did it so I'm ready for all of the consequences
Hard to trust a nigga, do I know you?
They hate lil' Kolyon, so paranoid, might have to blow you
Fuck a friend, family too, I'on know you
Bastard child, hey daddy, I'on know you 
Mm-mm , mm-mm
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain 
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain
I feel pain, feel pain
Just got to maintain, maintain
It's gon' change, gon' change
It's gon' rain, gon' rain

Suckas can't see me, but they damn sure feel me
They say, "Gucci Mane gone, the rap game ain't nothin'"
Soon as he left, the coke price start jumpin'
Walk around the club like I walked around the yard
Nigga I'm the trap god, you tryna look hard
I'll never ever ever ask the police to protect me
Never ever ever let a rapper disrespect me

She wanna wake up with my wand and put that ass to sleep
I don't bleed Kool-Aid, baby, I bleed concrete
I ask God to give me wisdom, help me spot a leech
I be talkin' money, tell that ho; "kapeesh"
Tell that ho to sheesh, love is for the weak

All I want is money, all she want is meBroward County, 954, we here, I kicked the door down
'Nolia boy shit, 1800 block, ugly corner, tied, gleeful
I was hopin' that you'd ride for me the way I rode for you
I wish my boy was here to see the man that I grew into
And I know if I'm feelin' like this, it gotta be mutual
But it ain't they business tellin' them the shit we surfaced through
Yeah, I won't never tell the world the shit I did for you
Even though you lied on me, that's cool, as long as you know the truth
I don't even feel the love be real no more, so I keep my distance
Remember I ran me up my millions, you was in your feelings
Even that time you shake my hand and you don't even grip it
But if I put that shit on blast, they gon' say I'm trippin'
I'ma just follow my intuition and I'ma keep on livin'
I wonder sometimes if you wishin', shit could've been different
Right now I'm cheffin', it's too late, I'm doin' my thing right now
I ain't lookin' down on you just chillin', I'm on the plane right now
I know you miss me, but don't worry, I'll never forget you
Even though you switched on me and it hurt me, I can't hold that 'gainst you
Takin' everything in me and it's burnin' for me to forgive you
You still my whoadie, still my dirty, but I ain't fuckin' wit' you
To create my future, I had to revisit my past, revisit my pain
But I won't never let you back in, we can't rekindle that flame
When he got stuck on and you blamed me 'cause you know I did it
Couldn't call on you when it was raining and it killed my spirit
All the shit you said, you tried to shame me, tried to kill my image
Even though you know me since a baby, and you know I'm with it
You know I'm serious, steppin' on niggas like I ain't even got no feelings
I'm in my cell right now, I'm wishin' shit could've been different
I ain't droppin' no names no more but nigga, I hope you hear it
Can't take nothin' back, it went like that, so nigga that's what it is
Everywhere I went, I took you with me, every show I did
Ain't say your name in all my songs no more, can't waste my lyrics
I said I was comin' home, they said, "No you isn't"
I'm a real nigga, so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'
I remember throwin' rocks, now we goin' to prison
When I got my first Glock, kept that thing with me
You was with me on the block, thuggin' real silly
Jumped in the game, then I popped, then you went to switchin'
I tried to give you niggas shots, but you niggas missin'
Soon as Lil Yella got knocked, niggas went to snitchin'
I done been through a lot, shit you never didn't
I had to pop a nigga top to make that boy feel me
Crackers had me in the box, thuggin' every minute
Young nigga, see about me, I'ma show you different
All my life, throwin' rocks at the penitentiary
But now my watch got rocks, no more drug dealin'
And now my top gon' drop, I'm in a new Bentley
Heard foolie got shot, I wonder who did it
You my dirty, you and me, we made it from the mud
I been wishin' shit could've been how it was
'Bout you, I swear to God I would've took a slug
Down to kill a nigga 'bout you, and it's all love
This shit ain't about a stripe, this just what I'm used to
I'm down to throw away my life, throw away my future
'Bout street principality, no flag
Man, that soldier-like mentality automatic
I'm jumpin' out the pink-G truck with the ratchet
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy 
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy 
Z's up 'til I freeze up, lil' daddy
Gleefully, that's how you present that shit the right way
You know what I'm talkin' 'bout, Broward County, 954
You know, we don't represent, we don't re-present
We present it once and that's what it is, that's how you step
Can't take nothin' back, went like that, so that's what it is

Tell you one thing you gon' ask another question
If I tell you how I feel you gon' take advantage
Yeah I know you read the text but you ain't get the message
I speak in codes it ain't for you if you don't understand it
Think what you want to think you could keep guessing
Why should I even tweet when all you finna do is 'at' it?
If I tell you 'bout myself I'm finna go to stressin
Cause I might go to ventin' and I'ma start reflectin'

Fuck it, y'all just wanna hate me anyways

Yeah, I love you, bitch, but I ain't finna say it
I'm rich, but I'm ridin' through the project
I'm not even supposed to be here, I'm on house arrest
So, how you finna say "I forgot who raised me"
When I'm takin' chances knowin' this a violation
If you love me, you'd understand my situation
'Cause you already know I'm on probation
Everybody tellin' me they miss the old me
But how the fuck I'm finna change and be the old me?
I'm still the same nigga I'm evolving though
I kept goin' back to jail like a revolving door
A nigga steady seeing more so I elevate
Say go back to the Kodak of the first mixtape
Everybody tellin' me I need to change
But then y'all gon' complain when a nigga change
Bossed up you sayin' lately he ain't been the same
Fuck it, y'all just wanna hate me anyways
Fuck it, yeah, the money gettin' to my brain
Yeah, I think I'm all that with this big chain

You know it's free my nigga Cool, I hope he win the appeal
I lost my niggas, it ain’t been the same
Everybody say that I changed, say I ain't been the same
They don't even know I'm feelin’ pain
They don't know how I feel inside, traumatized, criminalized
But yet I'm idolized, I swear to God sometimes I wonder why
It got me brainwashed, lil' ones off the same block
Remember I had to slang rock, remember I let them thangs pop
Damn, I just wanna raise my son, wish it could've been how it was
Sometimes I wanna grab my gun
Sometimes I don't be wanna hear none
I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
My boy got shot, you put the blame on me
You say you know I did it
I can't even act like it ain't faze me
That shit hurt my feelings
My cousin got hit up, say he saw me jump out with the Glizzy
Why you had told them people you made me? Boy, you know you didn't
I hit that lick in Maryland, I bought my mama a Honda Civic
The hardest thing I had to do in life was leave you
I was showin' you love and had you feelin' like I need you
I'm drinkin' this alcohol right now, I wanna see you
You made me go hard in this shit, I'm motivated
Why you had gave up on the kid when I was jaded?
Now I've been drinkin', gettin' faded
Thinkin' 'bout how you played me
Thinkin' 'bout how you did me
I be clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, baby
Clutchin' on my fire, you never know these days
Gamblin' with your life, you gettin' close to the grave
Sorry Lord, the Devil got a hold of me, lately
Knew I shouldn't have never let you close to me, babyOh, my bad, I thought that was a freebie
Skrt-Skrt, then I skeet-skeet
See me when you see me
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt
Look, I ain't finna fall for anything, I know my worth
And I ain't finna let you ride my wave because I don't surf
It'll go down any second, you better stay alert
I'ma eat that pussy for breakfast, save room for dessert
I woke up and straight applied pressure out the gate
Nigga, you can't walk a mile in my size 8's
I'm tryna understand why all these niggas hate?
Because I be in my own lane, I'm tryna motivate
I wish I could hold .20 in my .38
But round here we ride 30's fuck them 28's
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrt
They say them youngings take something real quick
Lil' nigga I be thuggin, quick to scheme some shit
Baby jump on my dick, I'll run in your shit
I will jump in your shit
I will go in your shit
And now I'm understanding all them people phony
But I can't believe my people put them people on me
I'm geekin', I ain't going to sleep I'm on a monkey
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
Leave me alone, I'm rollin'
My nigga kick your door in, love to kick a door in
I don't wanna go back to scopin', wanna go back to pokin'
I guess I gotta pay for all the shit I did
I guess I can't forget that I was hitting licks
I jumped straight to size seven, I skipped size six
I'm tryna get up out the 'jects, I can't stay out this shit
Gotta stay out this shit
Gotta stay out the mix
I'm tryna keep everybody happy but I just end up hurt
And Lord knows that I'm blessed but sometimes I feel cursed
Took Wayne Head off this earth, then put him in the dirt
Took Cheezy Purp off this earth just to put him on a shirt
And when that .40 burst that shit like firework
So why they call you Kodak Black? You smokin' purp
I get right in that skirt and then she squirt, squirt
I jump right in that coupe and then I skrt, skrtYou know what I mean? Young niggas got a lot of paper

Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma stop cryin' 'bout me
Momma don't worry 'bout me
All you gotta do is love King
I hope y'all see what I be thinkin' 'bout
I'm smilin'
I just smile just to cope now
But I'm wildin'
I swear to God I'm tryin'
I'm tryna slow down
My people tellin' me to slow down
I fell in love with the fourth pound
You would think I'm with the Zoe Pound
Shoutout to ATL
But where I'm from we won't say "12"
We say "Tro-down"
The raiders out there just rolled around
All my niggas gettin' rico
All my niggas gettin' rico
He ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
Promise he ain't tellin' 'cause he G code
He ain't gon' tell ya if he know
If you 'round me

He a zombie, he Zoe
A zombie on earth, I'ma Zoe
I brought hell on earth for these hoes
You my heaven on earth, you my hoe, baby
You my old lady
All them hoes hatin'
Well fuck what them hoes say
We rockin' Gucci with Dolce
Love my ol' girl, love my old lady
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm thinkin'
But I don't pop molly
I'm freestylin' don't mind me
I don't know what I'm sayin'
My chauffeur don't like speedin'
I like the Tesla better when it drive me
I can sit back on IG
I ain't gotta look up when the light green
I'm on the i- on autopilot, my bitch ridin' me
Cruise control
I thank the lord I ain't lose my soul
1800 nights I done sacrificed
Triple cross like Jesus Christ
You ain't understand me I'ma tell you twice
I'm ugly corner, even when I die
I'm wonderin' if you love me like I
I'm wonderin' if you thuggin' like how I be
Head first, is he runnin' right behind me?
Nah, fuck that, you better be runnin' right beside me
It's like everything that I touch, it just be fallin' apart
I can't leave my past behind me
I wanna know what's goin' on in the projects
I wanna slide and go see what it look like
Remember Pop hit a lick on a four wheeler
E Murder, almost lost his life on a dirt bike
I seen a cracker to my left so I turned right
I lost my re-up money tryna shoot dice
My niggas leavin' niggas stank for some hood rank
You ain't got no street cred, ain't got no Woo stripes
Thinkin' 'bout my niggas and my family
They the only ones that understand me
Pop the clutch, fishtail on the banshee
The Devil sent me a blessing
My dreads like devil horns, they don't know that I be on my damn knees
Forgive me lord, forgive me lord that I fell for it
Forgive me lord that I fell short
I'm dressin' plain in the airport
Bust a nigga brain if you care for it
Young nigga what would you do for it
Her boyfriend smokin' Newports
Just put my baby momma in a new foreign
'Bout to write a book, no Dr. Seuss, boy
I got stories like a news reporter
Like a book, put my momma in two stories
I'm postin' in the hood 'cause the school borin'
I'm smokin' Cherry Pie, I don't smoke Spice
I would never tell you about my old life
Sniper biker
Pop a wheelie on the Raptor
I got snakes in my closet, I'm a rattler
And I keep body bags for a rapper
Hidin' from my past, got me runnin' from a cracker
Lil' Kodak they just wanna see you captured
I'm snappin' and I'm flashin' like a camera
You don't know the meaning behind it
You don't know the reason I'm like this
Sincerely me
I'm feelin' this beat
To all my niggas in prison, if you listenin' right now, I miss youIt's like fuck it, I'm just misunderstood
That's the story of my life
I don't like talkin' to you, niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you, niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I keep this tool on me like I done turned into a mechanic
I'm a fuckin' CEO, I don't need no damn manage
I don't like no interviews, see y'all don't speak my language
We can't hold no conversation, you don't know what I'm sayin'
She say she wanna know the real me, bitch I am it
Tell the blog "correct that shit," 'cause I ain't from Miami
I don't even speak code, when I do, I'm misinterpretated
I don't even need no surfboard, I'm too fuckin' wavy
I ain't take my meds bitch, 'cause I ain't fuckin' crazy
Say you thuggin' a lil' too hard, life you livin' dangerous
They don't see potential, they say I'm a project baby
Just 'cause my dad so goddamn selfish, he ain't wanna raise me
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic
Say slow down on all that thuggin', think about your family
I'm on 18, I'm slangin' like I'm Peyton Manning
My bitch just told me to be more gentle 'cause I'm too demanding
They say that all my demons seeming, but I'm not satanic
And I keep her back wet but shawty ain't Hispanic
I see you in peripheral vision through my Prada lenses
No point in goin' to school if I'ma keep on jumpin' fences
The block too hot and that's the only reason I'm on campus
It's a pandemonium ridin' panoramic
Once they let me out of jail I went back to the dentist
I snapped my golds out and flood my gums with VVS's
Yeah, you listenin' what I'm sayin' but you don't get the message
Did so much dirt I wonder how I still be gettin' any blessings
I don't like talkin' to you niggas, y'all don't understand me
Poppin' rhythm when I talk, it's like I'm speakin' Spanish
I'm so different from you dudes, I am not organic

Gotta prove everybody wrong lookin' down on me
When I'm flyin’ like an eagle
In the streets where I call home, this is where I wanna be
Do I gotta go to jail so I can find a lil' peace?
Could you be the one I call on, will you answer when you sleep?
Could you be the one I call on?
I ain't never gotta rap about the diamonds on my neck
I'm searchin' for my soul, hope you know where it went
Is it cold like my heart, could it take me where I've never been?
I'm never really happy, smilin' when it’s never meant
I’ve been searchin' for my soul, my heart

New year but ain't a damn thing changed
Still in traffic, road runnin', switchin' lanes

Roadrunnin', tunnel vision, I been speedin' with no limit for it

First they wanted me to win, I had all the support
But once I won, they don't love me no more
'Cause they wanted me to win, but they ain't want for me to get this far
They say "No, no I ain't mean for you to get that far"

About to come back down with 20 Gs 
I be sippin' codeine, kickin' flavor
I got baby bottles full of lean
Girl, you be on my dick 
I think it's the Cuban on my wrist 
Got her goin' through the bank line
Now I'm slidin' in the Audi A5 
Free Lil Cool doin' that time 
Freeman with the stick, he doin' fed time 
I'm ballin' like the Knicks

Smokin' gas but your whip on E 
She find out you a lame, now your bitch on me

That money got me geeked 
I'm in Miami runnin' with my heat 
Ratatouille, boy, I'm comin' for my cheese 
Thought it was Thanksgiving how I stuffed it in my jeans 
In science class high as hell 
I'm floatin' off that loud, I feel like Tinker Bell 
Now she don't wanna leave here 
Girl, you gotta go home, you can't sleep here 
No cardio, I'm runnin' up a check 
Leave you where you stand, my niggas dumpin' on the set 
Girl, you can't be calling me this late 
Lil' shorty wanna see me everyday 
On molly and a double cup 
Two pieces on me just like Reese's Butter Cup

Boss your life up
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her
See, Imma drink a pint, lil momma damn, she got nice butt
Then you can come and tie lil momma down, you could wife her
If you got them bands, then she might fuck
I'm in Fort Myers with G1 sellin' white stuff
I had to hit that lick, it's a gamble everyday
I here you gotta take a risk
How else you think I wrapped the Cuban link around my wrist?
Now I'm bendin' corners, I got forgis on my whip
Cashed out, nigga, I've been racked up ever since
Movin' short on them bills, now I pay my momma rent
Remember sellin' dope to my next door neighbor then
Knock, knock, ain't nobody home we breakin' in
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her
Boss my life up, it wasn't nothin' else to do
You should try it too, you should run a check or two
I'm tryna make it out, you could be successful too
Ain't tryna make it out? Then sorry I can't hang with you
Girl I can't hang with you, lil homie I can't mess with you
I'm bout my cheddar, you should go get you some cheddar too
Go get you a check or two, that what you better do
So you can free yourself a lil bit, when you steppin' through
I had to boss up, I had to cut some people off
To be the boss, you gotta learn how to take a loss
Bible on the dash, road runnin' with the cross
Goin' up top, touch down like Randy Moss
I had to run a check up, I had to boss my life up
Like, where I get these bands from?
Like, where I get that ice from?
I stayed down long enough, and then I came right up
What else you think a nigga used to stay up all night for?
What else you think a nigga used to stay out sellin' white for?
I'm in love with the guap, while lil momma think I like her]
Project baby, I might need some fuckin' similac
I'm in too deep, your boy deeper than a rap
Imma just let my soul bleed on the track
Check your resume, and you ain't livin' like that
You the main reason why your dog got wacked
I'm only for the cheese, you a freeze, you a rat
You the main reason why your dog got trapped
Before I ever chase her, I'd rather chase the yacht
Street nigga after paper, I ain't playin', Imma snap
Livin' in denial, juvenile back to back
Hit your house, throw all the gold in a pillow sack
Nigga take your chances, whole lives, shootin' craps
We just hit a lick for ten bands, it's a wrap
I'm a section 8, taliban with the strap
Molly Santan, beach sand in my cap
Yeah I could pass the weed, but I ain't pass the FCAT
And probably playin' sleep, cuz I ain't tryna text back
They found the contraband in my mat
I had to sneak a pen in my cell to write a rap
I'm extortin' niggas, want dinner and snack
Told em' Imma split em' if I see em' eat that
I'm vibin' in the booth, I just kick my feet back
She ride me in the coupe, had to push my seat back
I watched my dog shape back, just to relapse
I'm blowin' on OG, you smokin' green crack
I just got a slow leak in my tree wrap
That head got me lockin' up, call her beeswax
Better keep your Smith and Wesson, you might need that
357, E told me "keep that"
Keep your boy well protected like a knee cap
Knock, knock, bang, bang, where the cheese at?
Glock pop, bang, bang, where your keys at?
Don't you say a damn thing, and I mean that
Ran 'cross the power after Cool got snatched
I was on the I, when the coupe caught a flat
That's the same night when SuWu shot Black
I wasn't even there to tell you if we shot back
*Gun Shot*Tide
Glee, gleeful
This how you step, right here, look
I be slidin' 'round with my firearm, I gotta keep a weapon
I be ridin' 'round everywhere, I dare one of y'all lil' niggas to test me
I keep on drivin' 'round, got me goin' through all these transgressions
Shootin' niggas and foolin' 'round, won't let me see my blessin'
I be slidin' 'round with my firearm, I gotta keep a weapon
I be ridin' 'round everywhere, I dare one of y'all lil' niggas to test me
I keep on drivin' 'round, got me goin' through all these transgressions
Shootin' niggas and foolin' 'round, won't let me see my blessin'
I did everything the streets told me was cool to do
Now I'd rather prove it to myself before I prove to you
I never tell, put me in jail, put me in any dorm
And I can make it through whatever, I'll weather any storm
Say park the Wraith outside the prison when I EOS
My mama told me 'bout you niggas, I swear she know best
My bitch did a whole bid with me, that's my baby
Now sure enough I blowed up, she 'bout to have my baby
I swear it feel like yesterday, I was just in the county
When me and Snake was talkin' 'bout how we was in the projects
When we was on the ugly corner, we were poppin' Molly
How we be bootin' up on niggas when they actin' rowdy
Sniper Gang, I hate how I can't have my niggas 'round me
We love each other so much our energies just keep collidin'
We down to suit up any moment, we be too excited
And free Lil Cool, it's been a minute since we reunited
My nigga Pee just caught a body and he still fightin' it
I hate I fell in love with thuggin', I give my mama anxiety
I love Lil DJ like a brother, you play with him, I'll kill you
Lil' Jackboy shoulda just been my brother, I swear I love that nigga
I don't even need your love no more, I got a leather heart
I do my own time, I don't need no nigga to take no charge
I couldn't even get a letter from you and that was your gun
You ain't send me nothin' or ask no boy, "How your lil' brother doin'?"Be what you wanna be
This love right here stings
She yellow like Bumble Bee

I'm talkin' 'bout off white fur, that's somethin' up my sleeve
I don't wanna watch you leave me, I don't wanna see you go
I'd rather them poke my eyes out than to see you go
I don't wanna watch you leave, bae I wanna plant a seed
Baby I sold you weed, baby we could grow a tree

You can pull up on a nigga just to keep it real or somethin'
Chill or somethin', spend time with a nigga and you keep it trill or somethin', yeah
Shawty there make my head change, I'ma put her in a red Range
She was there when the feds came, fuck her and I made her hair swing
Pull up on her in a new Vs, with the 2-3s and my Gucci

This love right here stings, she yellow like Bumble BeeI'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame?
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me
I'm trying to figure out who want to see me winning
I already know resentment brings envy
I'm a business, man, I'm a fucking business
So I can't be up in the penitentiary
And I just wanna be able to tell who really with me
Is she for me or is she just playing with my feelings?
And I don't want to but I gotta switch up
'Cause you niggas want to have me locked up in the system
Even though that's who I am I gotta change my life
I'm getting so much money now I can't be slinging iron
And, girl, when we hooked up you said you gon' ride or die
So I'm assuming that you dead 'cause you damn sure ain't riding
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same
Are you in it or you in it for the fame?
I'm trying to figure out who love me for me
I went to jail 12 times, I'll never go again
Even though I said the same thing my other bid
Everybody stopped fucking with me 'cause I keep going in
And I'm feeling like Ben Franklin my only friend
'Cause that nigga kept it real stayed in my pocket
He was with me when y'all weren't fucking with me in the projects
Is you in it for the fame or do you really like me?
It's hard to tell when I got five mil' in the Breitling
I know you don't want to but you gotta change your surroundings
'Cause them niggas don't want to change all they know is violence
I'm a sniper, you know all my niggas move in silence
I'm trying to balance out my life, I'm doing mathematics
I'm getting so much money these days
It's hard to figure out who love me for me
Trying to balance out every thing
I'm getting sabotaged every way
You don't want to but you gotta change
It's going to hurt you trying to stay the same

God just hear my prayer, I just know I'm alive
Every mornin' when I wake, I hit my knees, and pray
I'm so thankful, I learn a new lesson everyday
I was schemin', runnin' wild, and then I caught a case
I was locked up in a cage, that's when it all came to my brain
Keep your head up, Kodak, get out there, just do your thing
Get your bread up, Kodak, you ain't got no time to play
I was fed up, lost a lot, but never lost my faith
Cause there's reason's, I go through what I'm goin' through today
Had to tell myself, "Kodak, you don't bubble, you in trouble"
Had to tell myself, "Fuck my friends, cause all I got is my brothers"
Then I told myself, "Fuck these hoes, all I need is my mother"
Cause I realize, that I wouldn't be shit without my mama
Please forgive me Lord, know you understand that it's a struggle
Just a lil boy, in these streets, got caught up with the hustle
This for my two brother's, all we got is each other
I would be nothin' without em, that's why I love em
I gotta stay pure, I gotta stay positive
Imma step up to the plate, won't run a way, like my father did
Try to put my nigga on, but he didn't stick to the code
I ain't tryin' that shit no more, I'm just gon' keep my focus on
I gotta keep movin' forward, I can't get caught up in my ways
I been lost out here like pacman, feelin' like I'm in a maze
Steady leanin' off promethazine, I ain't got no medicaid
It's destined I'm gon' see my blessings, gon' be better days
You wasn't worried bout me then, why you worried bout me now?
Thank the Lord for what I got, cause I use to wear Fila
Niggas tryna box me out, been up, but I've been down a lot
Everything is temporary, don't get comfortable in your spot
You could be droppin' your girl at work, he'll be runnin' up in your spot
My niggas locked up, watchin' the clock, I can't wait until he drop
Counting bricks up on the wall, when I talk they drop the wall
You should want me to excel, why you wanna see me fall?
I been coughin' all night, it done really got severe
They say I should get it cured, before it get even worse
So they gave me cough drops, but I'm drinkin' cough syrup

Wolve stripes got my rifle everythin' I did before
No peroxide, but I'm sitting in the cut
With my cousin Popeye at the top
It's just us
I'm jumping out the Wraith
Remember riding on that bus
I shook my old bih because all she wanna do is fuss
I need gratitude, Im on a different latitude
If you run up on me then I’ma bag a dude
Gratitude, and you know I’m straight dumpin' it
Got all the cheese
But I ain’t talking ‘bout government
I was hollering at the jitterbug
He said you wanna rap too
He said you wanna have plenty love
Matter fact he in the booth with me
I don't fuck with E-Murder
He almost died on that 250
But you know I still pray for him
I'll still load up and go spray for him
I don't wanna hit the chain gang but been in and out
I'm 19, but I was a baby when I jumped off the porch
I quit basketball just to thug the fucking block
I was jacking cars going to juvenile in and out
You would think I do construction
I was out here selling rocks
I was in the rap game, but i was still on the block
I was sitting in a cell when Enale got shot
That's my cousin
Swear to God it would have been different if I was out
My nigga Wyjib died, it took a lot not to cry
I was in cell reminiscing about all the times
We was out her kicking door in
We was out here on the grind
You would pop a xanax, quick to pop a nigga top
Call a nigga polka dot we will run up in you spot
Like a nigga tying shoes, tie that paper into a knot
I rep 1800 block, ugly corner Sniper gang
I rep 1800 block, 1800 block, ugly corner
Sniper gang, I rep 1800 blockSwimmin' in the money, I done turned into a sailor

Red beam on ya nose like Rudolph

My only goal is to keep courage and to make it out the bottom
Oh I was raised by the Chinese store
Even though I ain't Chinese though
Right by there is my Y and the corner store
Diamond grills guarantee you see all the hoes
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition
The only thing I worry bout is how my grandma doin'
I'm doin' good, I'm stayin' healthy, now I'm makin' music
I'm gon' strive to success and I'm gon' try my best
I'm 14 and already thinkin' about death
Damn I was raised by the dead end
Where fake ass niggas always tryna fit in
Ambition
I'm young and ambitious
The dreams that I have, I'ma dream of madlib it
I can not caught no feelin's when no one else feel it
I cannot play my cards with no dealer to deal it
I'm just livin' with patience
Dedication and greatness
How can I be good when the hood so-so my validation?
I wish my grandma was still here to watch me grow up
I wish four clippers still here to watch me blow up
I guess things never go how you want it to
So I don't wanna be the man, I'm goin' to, uh
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to start off your dreams but it's harder to finish
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition
I was raised by Wale and them
Get on the beat and let it breathe like oxygen
Every time they do things I follow them
But in a while a lil nigga gon' inspire them
Yeah, I even seen real niggas bail
Seen one got these beads reppin' like a Nextel
Same ones hollin' that they won't tell
Now you think you real cause your motherfuckin' phone tell
Swear these niggas think I'm in that stinker than a skunk tail
Swap my phones now my eyes liftin' like a dumbbell
Niggas sell their soul just to get a fuckin' record deal
So tell me how you fuckin' real?
My momma told me do me but just don't never steal
But I do it anywhere just to keep my pockets filled
They say one day I'm just gon' run up in the wrong house
And a nigga gon' come around and blow my brains out
Deadbeat daddy, grandma gone, that's all I know
They like me in the city, called Pompano
Grandpa was a player, he was with another woman
I just look 'em in his eyes and I see me right through him
I swear my throat hurt from tryna swallow my pride
My daddy fuckin' his god-daughter, she just 25
They got 3 kids and there's one just 5
That means he been fuckin' with her since I was 9
I just opened my eyes and let my ears listen
Friends ain't friends, lil nigga pay attention
Swear my only friends J-Crack and Lil Raw
Man we go back like Al Capone and cigars
And I know that some niggas don't want me to succeed
I just look past it keep balanced stay on my two feet
Got to watch my back cause niggas play keeps
My uncle looked at the weed, he ain't even got money to eat
And God damn, I swear my life crazy
Other people peep my swag, now they think I got a gammie
I'ma live my life
Man you never know, I might die tonight
But God with me
And I ain't gon' leave this world on no plain mission
That's my ambition
I was raised where the thug lay
Where the little niggas die but I'ma maintain
I'm okay, don't worry bout me, I'm in God's hands
I just hope that the world understand who I am
Ambition
Easy to talk about money but it's harder to get it
Uh, they gon' hate me for my ambition
Yeah half my life spent tryna find somethin' to do with the time we got. The time we got is spent tryna find somethin'. And look I heard behind every destined man is a surprised woman, I just gotta stay humble even though I'm hungry. I thought to myself being with no ambition, you ain't livin'See there's pussy niggas everywhere
Gutter niggas everywhere
You niggas 'bout that shit or whatever

I was fucking with you strong, what's the issue?
What you wanted? A lil song or a picture?
You say somebody hit your phone like it's pressure
So we'll just fuck it dog, I thought that we was better
What you wanted? A lil shoutout, a lil publicity?
If you asked me I would've did it with no resistance
You made a diss song and now you in your feelings
Runnin' around telling niggas you wasn't dissin'
Yeah, you niggas bout that life, but we more realer
Every time you pull a play, we pull one bigger
Yeah, you niggas 'bout that too, but we some lunatics
Man you niggas should've thought before you do the shit
Tried to shoot a video on my corner but we shoot the shit
If you a bitch then tell the media that you a bitch
I don't tweet, I tell that nigga pull up, bring some food
All my zombies in the projects will devour you
And it's easy to keep the tool but you don't know how to move
And you niggas ain't strategic, and you moving loose
My nigga caught him at the wrong time with the .22
Yeah, he let the .22 go, but it's a .22
I ain't specifically talkin' 'bout you Heffer
You niggas ain't got no balls, ain't got no testicles
You niggas pussy, ain't got no balls ain't got no pelvis
'Cause if you was a man you wouldn't be jealous
Y'all done brought it to a whole other level
Niggas getting kidnapped and getting let go
Niggas only did that just to scare you
To tell the truth, if I was there you would've been dead, bro
And I feel like it's a blessing I'm on house arrest, bro
'Cause you niggas already know a nigga head first
My cousin just got hit up and it fucked my head up
I was ready to rock and roll, come find my heavy metal
I ask my people "Why you move my gun when I went to jail for?"
This house arrest might be a blessing, might be better
What the hell happened to that 187
On another note, you niggas should've knew better

The only way you talk to me is about some cheddar
I'm swimming in the pool with my Beretta
I been learning moves dancing with the devil
Damn I heard you ain't wanna let the Draco spray
Why the hell you even got it anyway?
I don't even know why niggas 
You should've came with bloods, you just wannabe

When this shit gon' end? I get out, you go in, it's crazy
Silence keep cloudin' me
Hands on my heart, it's soundin' like it's poundin' like the beat
Time never mattered

Constant conversations with my lady, she gon' hold it down
My nigga, he just got out of the gram, he got locked up again
I be feelin' like it's my fault that he right back in
He just wanted a lil money, and I knew a way how
I told him to pack his bags, we goin' out of town
And shit, I knew the best option for us to stay down
But fuck all that, we young niggas, we need it right now, man
Shit get crazy, when you in these types of places
Shit don't even feel the same no more, everybody changin'
It's amazin', when you make it, made it out your situation
And surprise everybody, you should see these niggas faces
I done took a lot of losses
I done caught a lot of cases
Had to cut my nigga off, man I just couldn't shake it
Used to treat him like a brother, but that nigga so shady
I hate it, but this the life of a project baby
I'm here, and I'm plannin' on blowin' this year
Disappear, into spirit, wrist shine like chandelier
They tellin' lies like Pinocchio, they don't even know me though
But they wanna ride for me, they ain't even rode before
Rollin' like a roller-coast, backwood, I'm rollin' dope
Told my future bright, yesterday I read my horoscope
I remember, I was in a jam, they said "it's over for"
Young nigga, addicted to them bands, I'm bout to overdose
Institution, this that project music
Paper chase, on the interstate, stick and movin'
Throwin' rocks at the chain gang
Out here tryna slang Caine
Asked God to forgive a nigga, but I just do the same thing
Cause I'm still on the same shit
And I'm still with the same clique
My girl is still around with me
I'm still with the same bitch
I'm still on the same strip
I'm still on the same corner
Now a young nigga smokin' crip
Remember I used to slang zona
I get in the booth and spit that fire, I put that flame on you
Rollin' off a monkey girl, come let me put this thing on you
Your niggas ain't your niggas, catch a charge and they gon' sing on you
They gon' turn the state on you

Boostin' up my ego, made me go my hardest
Took me out the PJ and put me in a mansion
Break my pill down three ways, made me feel outstandin'
Panamera these days, used to ride the banshee
Louis Vuitton these thots, I trap out the spot
Hermes belts and drapes, keep my doggies straight
Kodak buyin' a Wraith, soon as he beat the case
All I know, identity theft, I buried all the credit cards
G1 had me in the kitchen, sellin' hard and doin' fraud
Took me out the 'jects, now I'm flyin' private jets, nigga
'Member snatchin' chains, I got my own around my neck, nigga
I caught five kidnappin', but I ain't no babysitter

Spread the cheese with your people, gotta feed the squad
I bought my mama and my brothers, them another car
At first I was playin' with this shit, but now I'm goin' hard
It's like my baby mama feel like she the superstar
I threw away the Fossil watch and bought an Audemars
Was in the 'Yota, now I'm ridin' in the luxury car
I was off the chain, now a youngin' on the charts
I was ridin' Suzuki, ayy, now I'm actin' boujee, ayy
Now I'm coolin', foolin', I'm just 'bout my music
No more shootin' cee-lo, poppin' wheelies on the Banshee

All my niggas behind the wall
All my niggas, they in the pen
Or they in the grave
Flyin' in the dove, nigga, fuck a Wraith

Jumped up out the womb like my daddy the devil
My son jumped up out the womb like his daddy the devil
Life's been better
I thank the Lord life's been better
Ever since I dropped up outta school, nigga, life's been better
Since I ran out with the tool just to get me some cheddar
Had to jump out on a fool, whacked him, teach him a lesson
Lil' nigga, I ain't sparin' you, so I don't need you to spare me
I had jumped up off the porch headfirst, I was ready
'Bout that fetty, take a nigga ass away from his family
To hear my nigga tell it, man, that shit damn embarrassing
Go back to hittin' licks, got me thuggin' in Maryland
Smokin' gas, got my tank on 93 supreme
Smokin' gas, drinkin' oil, no kerosene
Had to fill all my guns up with blackheads
Fill my guns up with diamonds, so I run the biz
Fill my gums up with diamonds, look like gingivitis
All this money got me lookin' like Illuminati
He done caught his first body, swear he did enough
You can't tell him nothin', feel like he a real thug
Even in the rap shit, I get real love
But how you knowin' real love when you ain't got a feeling?
What you know about trust when you not feeling?
I came up, now they pay a nigga top penny
Birdman tryna give the kid a couple million
Before Atlantic Records signed me, I was gettin' chicken
I was scammin', I was plannin' on the same dream
I got tired of baloney sandwich, no canteen
Got tired of PB&J, noodle casserole
I drink the coffee with the Molly, no Adderall
I guess someone not different than him after all
Stayin' focused on the cheddar, I be spazzin' now
Why you think they call him Kodak Black? I be blackin' out
These niggas want me in the box like I'm Pacquiao
Losin' all my niggas, started drinkin' alcohol
I jumped out the womb like my daddy the devil
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm clever, yeah
I walked up in the building like I'm young and I'm special, yeah

My nigga died to tell you the truth I ain't even care
I got some shit to say so call the engineer
You niggas be saying anything, you feel my pain through your ear

My trigger finger itching got me busting in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting in my crib
Trigger finger itching got me busting hoes in my crib
I was a ghetto child, wanted to be down with my peers

Sorry I already made my mind up for real
Lowkey I be vibin' cause my family need me here
But god I gotta keep the fire on conceal

Okay I ain't gonna keep talking about my mama
Everybody round me got a body or they wanna
Everybody round me caught a body or they gonna
Nigga would you rather go in or you go under
I was riding for these niggas before they rode for they selves
Plus they know that lil zoe he gone go and he don't care
You can't tell me nothing, I'm clutching on Glock 27
You can't walk up on me I don't want you standing in my square
Ain't paranoid nigga I'm sensitive about my square

When I lost nigga I was losing by myself
So damn right I'm in my new whip and I'm cruising by myself
Y'all don't love this beat stop this music man I swear
You don't stop this music I'm gone keep killing it I swear
And I'm saying anything that comes to my brain cells
Feed my niggas locked up in the main jail
Fighting cases nigga facing PBL
Eating PB and J everyday waiting on some mail
I'm freestyling when I'm vibing so don't stop me I don't care
My nigga tried to send me a kite I swear to god he got his mail
First forty-eight my nigga told on himself
At school telling everybody the news before they rang the bell
Hey let me just stop right here you namsayin', my nigga told me I got the game in a headlock and shit right now, so let me let it go before they suffocate to death. I'ma let the beat breath a little bit, goddamn I ain't give that bitch no room, no space, no air

You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Lately, watching you, watching me
Look into my eyes, tell me what is it you see?
Lately, watching you, watching me
Angry, watching you, watching me
I've been thuggin' for so long tryna bypass
I be doin' so much wrong, I see my life flash
Through the pain, I persevered and I ain't even shed a tear
Overcomin' every obstacle like I ain't got no fear
And don't you know it wasn't easy, ayy
What you thinking when you see me? Yo
Even when the sun goes down, I'm up tryna keep my family straight
I just be holdin' it down and every real nigga gonna gravitate
Every day ten toes down, I swear I ain't never goin' down this way
My nigga, I'm not your man, you don't know me, I ain't from 'round this way
Go hard, I'ma die when I sleep
Go hard, I can sleep when I die
Tryna find a piece of my mind
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried

Angry, watching you, watching me
Eh, ever since I came up, yeah, I've been
Living like tomorrow ain't gon' come
Switching girls like my heart can't go numb
Pedal to the floor like I'm on the run
All this shine, all the rain gotta glum
Gotta get mine or it's back to the slums
Back to the crumbs
I don't feel the pain, I need a little luck
And I puff my herb and I sip my drink
'Til my words get slurred
I work that bitch 'til she work my nerves
And then move on to the next city like "word"
What I do is none of your concern
I take my shot, you can wait your turn
Every single thing I got I earned
'Cause every single loss is lesson learned, yeah 
You're the reason why my back is turned 
Only took one time for me to learn
I won't say a thing you don't deserve
I won't do a thing you don't deserve 
I x you out, what for?
Because survival's my only choice
I'm living life like I know it's short
Oh, it's a miracle to find remorse
You can look me in my eyes and tell I'm tired of trying
Look me in the eyes and tell that I've cried
Plenty rockstar scars, I'm not tryna hide them
Remember those who win, not the ones tired

Mama, I know
Sometimes I act crazy but I'm still your baby
The projects made me like this, you can't blame me
Mama I'm still your baby but the streets corrupt me
I'm sorry I fell in love with guns, I fell in love with thuggin'
I'm clutchin', I keep that Colt .45 everyday like Tony Dungy
I shoulda just listened to what you said but I don't really like instructions
I don't be wantin' to hear nothing
'Cause I was lookin' up to my cousin
They was in and out of jail, that was all I seen
So I knew what I wanted to be as a youngin'
Mama said she hate my stubbornness
Why I gotta be so grumpy
When it comes to anger don't rush it
You gon' end up in a dungeon
I hate my attitude but I love him
'Cause I don't really be with that fuck shit
Mama I'm fried, I be just tryna vibe
I ain't really trying to get impulsive
Sittin' back sippin' on Hennessey
Niggas tryna drain out my energy
Ain't no bad vibe in these premises
I can feel the vibe you envy me
Tryna stay level-headed keep my head straight
But the devil he don't want to see me go the better way
Deep in my heart lookin' for the love I had
My heart was gold but these dirty streets turned it black
I was a good lil' nigga life turned me bad
Can't show sympathy, I might get whacked
On probation but I know I got to stay strapped
Went on a lick geek, I forgot my face mask
Went on a lick geek, turn up on a nigga ass
When they let me out VA, I had 30 stash
Poppin' fraud 'cause this rap shit wasn't bringin' cash
Always takin' care of my mama 'cause she all I had
You would think a boy roller bladin'
How I skated so much ramifications
I coulda got draft to the Patriots
NFL, run up on me get deflated
Drop some but I caught a lot of cases
On route, goin' up top on a safety
I pray to Yahweh could you save me?
Lately, I been goin' back crazy
Maybe if you be my lady
I might stop all this ragin'
Baby could you be my lady?
I just been sittin' here thinkin'
Wonder if you could be my lady
I be goin' through some phases
I don't want to know new faces
Everybody 'round me changin'
I was just talkin' about this to my partna them
I just gave a pussy-ass ho a compliment
Thought she was a thousand, I just start to like the bit
Nine dollar bill that ain't real she counterfeit
My nigga I was so close of wifin' it
I ain't brought it in, she's triflin'
All along she was just a bodit bitch
She a slimy bit, she a grimey bitch
She conniving, she a sloppy bitch

Perpendicular my perimeter, all these acres like a farm
And I'll be honest, I'm the G.O.A.T., I was born right in the barn

On a pill, holdin' on a seal
On a pill, rollin' off a hill
I'm on a pill, I need xan for real
You turn me on, I love them sexy heels

'Cause I ain't get this money on purpose

I be countin' money just to add it up
In my mama name, but it's my car
When you street, in a day you just might fall
I ain't never lackin', no, not at all

I was raised in a dope hole, posted on the stroll
Put a nigga in a choke hold 'fore I sell my soul
Can't keep these bitches off me
Now my bitch think I'm trippin', got her trynna stalk me

Ridin' olo with the Nina, I don't know no nigga meanerYeah I said so, so who drove him?
That shit crazy, man
Who drove him to the hospital?
Cause I'm in here trying to make a love song and shit
Like I get this bad news
I just got the call before I heard the beat
They just shot my dog like why it had to be
But it ain't getting to me, cause nothing can't get to me
Cause that's what the streets owe us, the world gon' keep going
I'm really disappointed but a nigga gone keep focused
It's like he already told me, it's like he had a warning
But it come anyway, even if that heater on him
Ain't gotta creep up on him cause I gotta feed the soldiers
I don't know when I'm finna reap what I sow
So baby show me all your love before I go
This wasn't supposed to be no thug song bae
This was 'posed to be our love song bae
Got me thinking bout getting my gun and going bae
Got me thinking about putting my gloves on wait
I be getting in that pussy without no glove on, wait
I'm raw dogging now I will never go stray
I got a lot to say but I don't know where to start
I might break off from a nigga but I won't break your heart
At least not on purpose, now you can't even hurt me

He can't even read but he been slinging crack
You better tuck your jewelry, get your chain snatched
I'm tryna slow down, tryna lay back
You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake back
Pokin windows that's la Jackboy n la J Black
I'm 'bout to wet the Cutlass, fuck a Maybach
Free J Green, they tryna give him 8 flat
I went duffin' up da state I caught the plane back
If rap don't work, then I'm back up on that same crap
You can leave, baby, you gon' find your way back
He can't even spell, but he can sell dope
Once you come up from that corner, boy you gettin' low
They been lookin' for the boy, think they tryna scope
They gon' pop it, you can lock it, you still gettin' poked
I remember you was ballin', now you dead broke
The last time I seen that nigga, he was smokin' ports
I got nigga locked up, and they losin' hope
I don't do it for the hood, I do it for my folks
The neighbors on us, so we hit the bad up
But now I'm on the radio, no more camera
I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap
Girl, you been on my dick, since I done came back
I sent you a letter, I ain't get a page back
He can't even read but he been slinging crack

I just want the money, but they gave me fame too
You ain't really in the hood, I just came through
In the Audi A4 and the paint blue
They gon' love you now but later they gon' hate you
My lil' bitch from Gainesville, I call her gator boo
I ain't made the rules, but I break the rules
I was fucked up by that movie, now I'm paid in full
Go hard like go, go, do your thing boo
Get that money, just don't let that shit done change you
Left the high early, I ain't go to school
Young nigga bendin' corners in the old school

I'm not a idol, you can have the fame back
I don't wanna hear your music, boy you can't rap

You know that money got me beat, I'm tryna shake backMy cousin just text me and shit 
He said, "I just got wet up sitting in my car this morning Cuzzo
I got hit one time but I'm good though , just letting you know before these niggas kill me
I love you to death and forever. Let me live on as a real sniper
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though
I'm in the studio right now, I'm on album mode
I wanna get suited up and tooted up on sniper mode
Every time a nigga get focused, it be some fuck shit
It throw me off my pivot and make me get on my thug shit
Last year my cousin got hit up and got kidnapped
I wasn't even there but you know a nigga handle that
Hit him up again this year and I ain't feeling that
I'm throwed right now cause I don't know where my feelings at
I don't know if I wanna rap or want to pop a cap
But I know you niggas want to see me go right back
But this sniper gang shit in me, I'm living like that
You niggas about to make me relapse, I'm feeling like that
My cousin just got hit up today, I wanna slide though
Even though I'm on house arrest, I wanna ride though
But I go to prison I know my mama'll cry though
He told me I'm just telling you I love you before I die though
Soldier-like mentality, going through these tragedies
Don't wanna see me happily, rather see me raggedy
They don't wanna see me get a bag, they wanna bag a G
But I go on a clappin' spree and murk ya whole family
I guess a nigga kept it too real, that's why they mad at me
Sitting back thinking right now, I'm smoking Grabba Leaf
Nigga went from wearing baggy jeans to dressing casually
From being on the newspapers, now I'm on magazines
I'm chopping it up with Master P, told me keep God first
We doing venues now, selling out concerts
I'm trying to keep a tunnel vision, trying to see it his way
But I got blood in my eyes, I'm tired of seeing this way
I can't even sleep skraight, even on the Tempurpedic
Why I'm still going through it? Why I'm still fighting demons?
Niggas call you pussy when you focused and avoiding shit
We getting this money for no reason, nigga trying to enjoy this shit
I got a lil' boy and shit, and I don't wanna leave dude
Cause they'll trick him like they did me, that's what these skreets do
Niggas out here playing gangsta and playing police too
I seen the paperwork and that's why they don't kick it like we do
That's the same reason you couldn't come home to seafood
Been moving funny but a nigga just couldn't read you
Beat was been over with, looped it cause I love this beat
Looting for my cousin and my niggas who in custody
I'm feeling like its my fault, feel like it's because of me
Was tryna soak the industry, I already thugged the streets
Did my thing a couple nights, I already earned my stripes
Deeper than rap, they fucking with me cause I'm about that life
You know I'm head first, Big Cuz, that's why you called me man
But if I go to jail again, my mama she gone wash her hands
I'm innovating how to play it but it's still a slim chance
Cause you will sink in the sand in the game without a plan
Aye I swear to God cuz when you called me dog
And you told me that shit dog I said fuck everything
House arrest whatever, you know what I'm saying? I went to looking for my AR I couldn't find it you know what I'm saying
You know I fuck with them AR's and shit
Dracos too heavy and shit
Draco's get too hot
That AR got the coolin' center, the heat sensor, know what I'm saying with the scope with the crosshair
And shit I guess it wasn't meant, dogBreaking down this reefer right here

Golden acre boy free my nigga Greg Roundtree
Niggas played me dirty
Bitches played me dirty

I just want a better life, I know I deserve it
The hood on life support and it's real urgent
And I'm fucked up bad, I need a real surgeon
Why they do ya boy bad? I'm a good person
I'm the one who gon' ride out like a derby
If you my nigga imma slide out with you lurkin'
Dye your nose, paranoia I be gettin' nervous
Had to wait the fourth quarter, I ain't have a jersey
Niggas dying everyday can't behave they self
Before you jump off the porch nigga take a step
I was just a litttle boy, had to raise myself
I was movin' too fast, had to pace myself
Paper chasin for that cash tryna race myself
You know a nigga like to spaz, had to take a breath
Sometimes I think I'm too much for myself
And I done cost a lot of hurt to my health
It'll make a nigga cry, all the pain I felt
While everybody fold up, I remain myself
I'm the heart of the projects, hope I don't stroke
Over here we live in poverty, everybody broke

Punishment when I fail, new sneaks when I pass
Only child so I had two feet in my ass

Young nigga poppin' checks, wrist full of VVS's
Slugs all up in my mouth, VVS on my necklaces

I thought it was over for a minute, a bad situation
I was so far away from home, but I just emancipated
I'm just so captivated, that I could be here again
So fascinatin', to see my people again
Swear I tried to leave the streets, but they was pullin' me in
My nigga rolled a statement on me, I thought he was my friend

I used to be that cafe fit, the full holster in the cut
A young nigga, sixteen, with Remy in my cup
I had to take a Gatorade, braid, ran to these streets
I had to cut my niggas, showin' they were playin' for keeps
That's all a nigga has to tell ya, they were leechin' on me
I ain’t even charging them, getting fame for free
When I was in a sticky one, they ain't show no support
Before I learned how to swim, I jumped straight off the porch
We know a nigga from the south, hittin' licks up in north
I used to play ball, but now I'm in a whole other court

My niggas do it 'cause they love the boy

And now I do it, just me, I don't need no support
And I don't play basketball, so I ain't goin' to court

She love me to pieces, I love her to death
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the Devil
I woke up seen a demon dancin' with the metal
She love me forever, she made me a lil better
She fly just like my sweater, I never forget her
I'm turnt up in the air, I be on the pill
I took off on a pill, I be in the air
Push a nigga head back, cut his hair
Snatch her lace wig off, she ain't got no hair
Know my momma good and my brother doing great
And my son good
God fucked around and saved me
I'm smilin' with the glizzy tucked
Bitch look like I'm whippin' up
Wrist look like a million bucks
But it's just a quarter mill

Ha ha, man
Uh
In this life that I live, look, I'mma stand firm
Mamma told me bout my homeboys, but I guess I had to learn
See, people go to switchin' seats, the table never turn
Mamma told me not to touch the stove, but look, I got burned
They spreadin' lies, like a germ
Set my head head hot, like a perm
Was a jailbird, but they set me free, so the early-bird got the worm
I've been up, but I've been down
I was stuck, but I've been 'round
Pokin' windows, way outta town
I was lost, but now I'm found
These streets showed me how to be a man, cuz my dad wouldn't show me how
But it's too late to show me now
Cuz I'm in too deep with this lifestyle
Lord forgive me for that abortion, I wasn't ready to have no child
I was hittin' my girl with a bare dick, I ain't even have no lifestyle
Been out here, since a lil child
They safari, runnin' wild
Got felonies all in my file
Got me back n' forth, in the juvenile
Had to take my eyes off the prize, real quick
But, now my eyes on the prowl
I was hittin' licks, cuz I was on my dick, stayin' at my aunties house
Tryna stack them them racks in a pile
When I rap, they be like "wow"
I can't even have no friends no more, so tired of them rattin' me out
Keep my head high, to the clouds
I stay hot, on that loud
These permanent, in my mouth
Look, I'mma stay ten toes down
Gotta keep my head on a swivel
I hear these niggas will kill you
Niggas sprung out on them flockas, they ain't really got shit to live for
Young niggas, high riska's
Everyday, on the go
Already got a lil money, still out here tryna get more
This shit like shootin' dice, they just tryna hit a lick
Dope boys, they up all night, they just grindin' for a brick
I'm tryna stay out the mix
These niggas ain't real
These niggas go down, they'll snitch
Trust me, I know the deal
Lil project baby, in the field, runnin' with the still
Road runnin', for that money, wearin' Chest DeVille
I remember pourin' molly, in the Zephyr Hills
On the interstate, ridin' by them 18 wheelsAye look I'm a take it back a lil' piece

I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm slangin' K, yea I be dealin' shit and stealin' shit
Back in the day, I was a fool and I was ignorant
I'm not a killer, but my nigga they on that killer shit
I'm 'bout my skrilla, I be dealin' just like a dealership
I mean wit' that fire, but my lil' dawg he make your street rock
Rap don't pop, I'm in the kitchen whippin' heat rock
Back in the day, I'm talkin' Dickey with my Reebok
I'm on a jigga, and I'm swingin' like a seesaw
I hit the news, I hit the news, I hit the news again
My mama warned me, that's this was what the streets gonna do to me
I'm from the No, I go hit a lick on a dirtbike
Right on a stroll, the plug just fronted me a dirtbike
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
Back in the days, I was on the Ugly Corner
Trynna stack a pretty penny late night sellin' zona
Graduated from the streets but I ain't got a diploma
Been a little soldier hittin' licks around the 'Nolia
In and out of stolen cars, ridin' with Lil' soya
Had the coke no cola makin' stretch with the soda
Be a soul jumped behind us hit the gas, crash the 'Yota
If JJ's phone calls, mama sayin' boy I told you
Back in the day, them hoes left me on my own
Pullin' 'em now, won't quit callin' my phone

Don't wanna fuck in the car, made her ass walk home
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid
Back in the days, I was the runner, was the gunner man
Back in the days, you couldn't chill on the corner then
Back in the days, was one on ones, ain't no jumpin' in
Back in the days, my mama told me ain't no funny shit
Broke get a job, they helped the family cause we strugglin' yea
Back in the days, my mama told me get that money
So I stopped sellin' reefer
I'm kickin' doors and robbin' corner stores
I'm John Wicks baby, you know me I'll let that hammer go
Back in the days, I ain't have shit but now I'm stuntin' though
They wasn't fuckin' with me, but now today I got a ton of hoes
They lovin' my style, I'm Wick got mouth full of golds
No central air but now I'm iced out like a eskimo
I'm talkin' hot sausage and pickled eggs
Back in the day, everybody wanna be like chicken man
Back in the day, I growed I said I been a man
I'm 18 now but my ole' girl she think I'm still a kid

Had to take a lot of losses just to win
I was young, jumped in that water, been swimmin' ever since
Then I drowned, I never noticed how deep that I went
Head first, ain't waste no time, I dive right in
And life's a bitch, she spread them legs, I slide right in
This ain't a game, I'm runnin' 'round eatin' like Pac-Man
Fuck the fame, I knew I was a star since back then
Way back then, was gettin' them chips like Low-So
I think I'm way before my time, say I got a old soul
With the grown folks, shootin' dice by the dope 
I got ice runnin' through my veins, my heart just so cold
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family 
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap
Then a nigga found rap, I ain't never goin' back

And I keep the tool in the trunk like a spare tire
Way back, hittin' licks with my clique spazzin' out
 cashin' out
Way before my time, I was catchin' planes, hustlin' tryna make a wave
For me and my family 
Way before my time, I was grindin', no choice but the trap

Co-defendant folded up he wrote a statement on me

We think the same way like we got the same brain
They sent my young nigga Paul to the chain gang

This for the culture, where ya at
I got the reds and the blues like a Chaffinch
I'm not average
I'ma run up on these niggas when I just got out
Free from court, led by Crackers where they badges give clout
On parole, don't give a fuck, nigga i'm high as a cloud
Don't give a fuck, tell me what is and what's not allowed
I was smart, pick me to read aloud
I'm about
To expose all the fakes who give me a thundercloud
Put on your raincoat, poncho and umbrella
Cause there's always a brainstorm when I think out loud
Where ya from, where ya at, tell me all your whereabouts
And I don't give a fuck if these niggas have a doubt
And just listen, to what I'm bout to say
Once a nigga talk 'bout me
He'll never see another day
Just vibe, just dance, just bob ya head and sway
Red dot on his nose like Rudolph, i'ma make him ride a sleigh
I'm a Haitian, I'm from Broward County where the thugs lay
Don't make it obvious, tell em to, meet me there halfway
And remember, the fakes and the snakes are gon' betray

Court hearings, driving German Engineering
Self-moving cars, fell asleep I wasn't steering
But a nigga feel like a Jedi, I could probably use the force
I ain't on no saddle but I'm whipping on a horse, yeah
And I knew there was some beef I just had to find the source
Till I found it homies came through, like the 7 Dwarves
And the drugs got me moody, all like the 7 Dwarves
And a rose ain't a rose unless it's got it's thorns
And when it's all over I gone win the awards
And when one of them closes, there gon' be an open door
When I touched down in land like the Angels let me down
They was snapping all the pictures, yeah they got the angles down

Shit crazy, a nigga came up slow though man you know
I tried every little hustle out here to get that bread
Came up slow, all off a caret of gold
I remember kicking doors, me and D's all hands stole
I remember we was poor, had to go get some dough
Cuban link on glo, polo, whip, my pants low
I'm too fly for you, I'm seeing through a birds eye view
I won't lie to you, she bald-headed like Caillou
All this time you was living in the skies
But now a nigga seeing right through
I'm the one gonna ride for you
I'm the one who came through
There was nobody else around
Let this shit change you, I'm the one gon hold you down
Look what we done been through, just think about everything
Thought you was my round, fuck the money fuck the fame
Ran out my wonder pain, I can't see a damn thing
My heart so cold I got ice running through my veins
Crazy how things change, you were just here yesterday
I just caught another case, I'm asking God for better days
Hit my knees and pray, forgive me for my selfish ways
I ain't mean no harm, I was tryin' get it straight
I was tired of second place, I was tryin' win the race
I just hope you understand, everyday's a paper chase
Everyday a damn struggle, you don't bother you in trouble
Thuggin' wit my brothers, on my life and the gutter
Crazy how things go, young nigga from Pompano
Can't go to jail no more, remember eating Sloppy Joe
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real let me know
I've been there before, is you a friend or a foe?
What you round me for? Keep it real and let me know
I had ups and downs, times that with no one around
Told me stay humble, but I just didn't know how
I was just down bad, crazy I'm on now
Wanna see me locked up, its a blessing I'm home now
Deeper than zone pound, young nigga ten toes down
I be in my own lane, I go on my own route
Thras got me dumb hot, feeling like I'm on cloud
I was running wild, living fast had to slow down
I was in denial, feeling is in my foul
Fell victim to the system, free cool I really miss him
Taught me not to be a fool, young nigga keep the tool
Break your daughter heart, breaking all the rules
Learn my lesson in these streets, I ain't really go to school
Young nigga stick and move, fuck around and made the newsMan I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it
My mama told me do it
Just can't get discouraged 
I'm gonna give her the world
And I'm so determined 
The lights ain't ever working
Got me snatching purses 
I jumped up off the porch
Out here with a purpose 
Goddamn this world dirty
Whole family hurting 
Lil nigga out here lurking
Got my mama worried 
In the studio I'm on it
And I'm dropping verses 
Now these niggas acting like Lil Kodak ain't deserve it
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me
I remember all them niggas with my homie
Window poking tired of eating macaroni
I remember they ain't care about my music
Now these niggas claiming they related to me
I remember when I ain't have no friend
I remember it, every part of it
Talking way before the fame
I was broke 
Yeah when I was snatching chains
Had no hope 
Steady wrapped in chains
Jail back and forth 
I was going insane
Had nowhere to go 
They calling me names
They cracking jokes 
Back when I was lame
Was nobody close 
Told lil mama blow
Niggas ain't believe me 
My mixtape free
But they be tryna buy my CD 
I was out here scheming
Talking to those demons 
They say I'm arrogant
Say I'm so conceited 
You should be happy
I was blind now I'm seeing 
Nightmares going crazy
Ghetto dreaming 
When I was itching for that money
Out here fiending 
Somebody feed me
Because my stomach steady screaming 
Now you want some fame
Coming up you can't believe it 
Billie Jean
Michael Jackson nigga beat it!
Man I remember all them bitches cracking on me
But I got right now all them bitches grabbing on me

They tried to give me eight, got on my knees like "Jesus please"
He don't even believe in Jesus, why he got a Jesus piece?
If you wanna leave just leave
But you ain't gotta lie to me
Even the blind could see, that you ain't gon' ride for me
You ain't even showin' me the love you say you got for me
There ain't no loyalty, you lied to me
You say that you was gon' ride for me
Aye, I'ma just switch my flow up
Baby I'm sick, no throw up
Baby I'm sick, no checkup
Nigga you need to run you a check up
I'm eatin' on you niggas, no ketchup
I'm eatin' on you niggas, can't catch up
Even when I'm fuckin', I'm masked up
Hit her face down with her ass up
Hit her with no rubber but I'm masked up 
Everywhere I go, I'm masked up
Lil' Kodak Black, that's a, lil' dirty bastard
In a black Jaguar
Pull up in a white Jaguar
Remember pull up in a champagne Jaguar
Pull up in the same Jaguar

Been thuggin' since little league
And they don't wanna hear me preach
They don't wanna hear me preach
You a walkin' duck out in these streets

I lost myself and found myself right in these streets
I was by myself, I was by myself right in these streets
By myself lil' nigga, I keep that shit discreet

You niggas bleedin' Kool-Aid, you niggas sweet 
You niggas bleed Kool-Aid

Aye pass the joint, you know sharin' is carin'

'Bout that money, I'll shoot out to Maryland
All these books, you'd think I'm a librarian
I bumped into a powerhouse, 
You keep grindin', you can get a McLarenI be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things
I tried to explain, I swear, I tried to explain
Think lil Kodak got it good, cause the money and the fame
I got to leave the street where it's at, fell in love with the game
Studio night and day, now they say I ain't the same or I changed, cause I don't, come to my side no more and play
I don't shoot dice no more, cause I ain't got time to hang
They say I'm going insane
They say the mollies eating up my brain
I miss my nigga Cool
Like right now, I'd be with him chasing money and be running with'em
I just tried get'em with you
They water break
I'm tired of fake niggas, I'd let you walk in my shoes but you can't fit'em
Hard for a project baby
Sometimes I hate, I let the project raise me
I'm a bastard child, so the streets made me a man
That lil baby gonna grow up to that pistol and I can see it
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'
When I get out of these streets and do the same things
When I get out of these streets and do the same things
When its going good God don't hear from me but when its bad I get sad and I get on my knee
Take me through this battle, but I not gonna let you leave
Send them haters around me and I won't let'm leave
Need a break just fall back and get my mind straight
Feeling like the devil took me on a blind date
I ain't coming home tonight when I'm on a mission
Niggas feening and I'm the only youngin with'em
Somethings I be tripping
Folks say I'm a ghetto child, they say I'm ignorant
Just listen
I might need a minute
I hope this beat was long, cause I need them to hear me
Can't make the lemonade, life just gave me lemons
Feel like they don't understand
They don't get it
I've been up all night
I just had to lay this verse down to clear my mind
I can't believe I thought you were my friend
Here I am in the move bleed my soul again
I be feeling like nobody understands me
My friends or my family
They don't understand, asking God for a sign but I don't see it yet
Don't know what I'm saying and if I tell you bro, you still won't feel my pain
And I be telling God, 'I be changed'

I swear 'fore God
You know what I'm talkin’ 'bout?
Now, I done overcame so much obstacles
Came up from up under so much rocks and shit
Even though I be out here schemin' like a demon semen
I know I'm God-sent
This gotta be God
See what I got, I'll be moving so quiet I'm high on the pot
Devil sitting on my shoulders, with light on d spot
Telling me to go for it, said to give what I got
Been in light too much,  I'll be trying the dark
Blessings on me, is it blessings from God?
I don't know where to start, they be throwing dem darts
Won’t lie to u, some got to my heart
Making me feel alert, gat me smoking cigas

Squad on black durag, yeah we ball too hard!

And I made a decision, to live in perfection! Yeah

Shot a nigga, took a shower with the bleach, Yahweh
