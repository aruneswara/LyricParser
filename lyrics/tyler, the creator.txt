You tell him all your problems, he's fuckin' awesome with listenin'

I'm clockin' three past six and goin' postal
This the revenge of the dicks, that's nine cocks that cock 9's
This ain't no V. Tech shit, or Columbine
But after bowling, I went home for some damn Adventure Time
 I slipped myself some pink Xannies 
And danced around the house in all-over print panties
My mom's gone, that fuckin' broad will never understand me
I'm not gay, I just wanna boogie to some Marvin
Fuck her, Wolf Haley robbin' them
I'll crash that fuckin' airplane that that faggot nigga B.o.B is in
And stab Bruno Mars in his goddamn esophagus
And won't stop until the cops come in
I'm an overachiever, so how about I start a team of leaders
And pick up Stevie Wonder to be the wide receiver? 
Green paper, gold teeth, and pregnant golden retrievers
All I want, fuck money, diamonds, and bitches, don't need 'em
But where the fat ones at? I got somethin' to feed 'em
It's some cooking books, the black kids never wanted to read 'em
Snap back, green ch-ch-chia fuckin' leaves

And I'm Wolf, that was me who shoved a cock in your bitch
 Fuck the fame and all the hype, G
I just wanna know if my father would ever like me
But I don't give a fuck, so he's probably just like me
A motherfuckin' goblin
 That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny-hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
Now the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shit

You live in my dream state
Relocate my fantasy
I stay in reality
You live in my dream state
Any time I count sheep
That's the only time we make up, make up
You exist behind my eyelids, my eyelids
Now, I don't wanna wake up
20/20, 20/20 visions
Cupid hit me, Cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
Can I get a kiss?
And can you make it last forever?
I said, I'm 'bout to go to war
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Can I get a kiss? 
And can you make it last forever? 
I said, I'm 'bout to go to war 
And I don't know if I'ma see you again
Ugh, switch it up
I said, okay, okay, okay, okey-dokey, my infatuation
Is translating to another form of what you call it? 
Oh yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah, I ain't met you
I've been looking, stop the waiting
'Fore I stop the chasing, like an alcoholic
"You don't understand me"—what the fuck do you mean?
It's them rose-tinted cheeks, yeah, it's them dirt-colored eyes
Sugar-honey iced tea, bumblebee on the scene
Yeah, I'd give up my bakery to have a piece of your pie
Ugh!
20/20, 20/20 visions
Cupid hit me, cupid hit me with precision, eye
Wonder if you look both ways when you cross my mind
I said, I said
I'm sick of, sick of, sick of, sick of chasing
You're the one that's always running through my daydreams, I
I can only see your face when I close my eyes
So...
Can I get a kiss? 
And can you make it last forever? 
I said I'm 'bout to go to war 
I don't know if I'ma see you again 
Can I get a kiss? 
And can you make it last forever?

La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la, la la
Okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, okay, o—
La la, la la la la, la la
La la, la la la laI never would've thought that
Feelings could get thrown in the air
'Cause I accidentally caught that
I need some new boxing gloves
Shit got hectic whenever I fought back
For example, ten minutes can't go past without you brushing my thoughts
That's fourteen forty a day so I'll say a hundred and forty-four times
I think about you or something like that
Lost match, the fucking thought of you with somebody else
I don't like that; cellular convos getting left in the wrong
'Cause I get so fucking mad when you don't write back
This isn't a song, I just happen to rhyme when I get emo
And find time to write facts, fuck
I love you
Can we add some more color, um, like, some more, yellow?
Yeah, that's good
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
Girl, you fucking with my emotions
The fuck is all this noise about?
I even considered picking up smoking
You turned to a bitch, who let the dogs out?
But in my dog house
My bitch is the raddest
Crazy who makes me the happiest can make me the saddest
Look Alice, let's get lost in your wonder-er-land, fuck an atlas
You're perfectly perfect for me
What the fuck is this, practice?
Actually, if you even consider leaving
I'll lose a couple screws in due time, I'll stop breathin'
And you'll see the meaning of stalkin'
When I pop out the dark to find you
And that new dude that you're seein' with an attitude
Then proceed to fuck up your evenin'
Make sure you never meet again like goddamn vegans
'Cause when I hear your name, I cannot stop cheesin'
I love you so much that my heart stops beatin' when you're leavin'
And I'm grievin' and my heart starts bleedin'
Life without you has no goddamn meanin'
Sorry, I'm passive-aggressive for no goddamn reason
It's that my mood change like these goddamn seasons
I fall for you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled
Yeah
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it tonight
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling girl, let's try to catch it
The sky's falling bitch, let's try to catch it tonight
]
C'mon baby, even though I hate you, I still love you
I love you
And Salem, my love 
I'm passive aggressive 
I like when we hold hands
See I get jealous 
And if I see that nigga 
I just might kill him, haha 
Love, love, love
I'm in love 
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
I fucking hate you, but I love you
I'm bad at keeping my emotions bubbled
You're good at being perfect
We're good at being troubled, yeah
"Yo, why is Samuel such a fucking dick?"
"He isn't such a badass actually. He's only here because he ran away, because some shit happened back home. He's actually a dweeb"
"Yo, what happened?"Golden rubbers in these denim pockets 
On my waist, there's a black Glock 
New girl moved on the block 
She been plottin' on my brown cock 
Last night I slept over hers 
During sex, I overheard 
A sword sliced the air, I pulled out the na-na
Rolled off the bed, then shot back, pow-pow
Blood on the sheets, probably spillin' from my gash
Looked out the glass, seen him sprintin' on the grass
A real ninja, with the blade and the mask
Had them gold ninja stars, and red Supreme nunchuks
Now she tryna patch me up, but
Girl, I was just tryna get a nut bust
If that's your ex, you should probably own a pistol
But I'm guessin' it's wiser to exit with dude
The blinds wide open so he can
See you in the dark when you're sleepin'
Naked body, fresh out the shower
And you touch yourself after hours
Ain't no man allowed in your bedroom
You're sleeping alone in bed
But check your window 
He's at your window
Night light hits off, turnin' kisses to bites
I'm a down to Earth nigga with intentions that's right
You'll be down in Earth quicker if you diss me tonight
But I'll be the happiest if you decide to kick it tonight
We can chill and I can act like I don't wanna fuck
You can tell me all your problems like I really give one 
But I give two for us 'cause you're the one that I want
Don't wanna seem like a punk pussy that simps over punk pussy
See when I'm with my friends I just put on a front
But in the back of my top, I'm writing songs about we
We, as including I, and yourself, making three
Little ones, the drums are hitting pretty hard if you ask me
You're a pretty broad in the top three
Of things that I've been waiting to come, so
Meet me by the lake around 10 and skinny dippin' and then
We can begin the pretend game, I wanna be Finn from Adventure Time
The blinds wide open so he can

Gorgeous, baby you're gorgeous
I just wanna drag your lifeless body to the forest
And fornicate with it
But that's because I'm in love with you, cunt

And I finally got the courage to ask you on a date
So just say yes, let the future fall into place

Where you used to come and get me with the swerve, swerve
These days you gotta find time
Even the nightline
Work line
Dial nine
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothin', nothin', without you shotgun in the passenger
I'm the loneliest man alive
But I keep on dancing to throw 'em off
I'm gon' run out of moves 'cause I can't groove to the blues
If you know any DJs, tell 'em to call me at 911...
I can't even lie, I've been lonely as fuck
Old lonely ass nigga

Attention seeker, public speaker
Oh my God, that boy there is so fuckin' lonely
Writin' songs about these people
Who do not exist, he's such a fuckin' phony
One thing I know, is that I wanna
Win so bad, but I'm not Chicago
Heart is low, it's real low, it's so low
You can't lift me up, I'm like Gallardo
From the start it's been real dark
It's been so dark, I guess that you could call me charbroiled, huh
I'm playin' like Hasbro
I'm really Saari, call me Arto
Crashed the McLaren, bought me a Tesla
I know you sick of me talkin' 'bout cars 
But what the fuck else do you want from me?
That is the only thing keepin' me company
Purchase some things until I'm annoyed
These items is fillin' the void
Been fillin' it for so long
I don't even know if it's shit I enjoy 
Current battle as an adult
My partner is a shadow
I need love, do you got some I could borrow?
Fuck it, I could find some tomorrow
But that never comes
Like a vasectomy, what have I done?
I got the talent, the face and the funds
Found myself long ago but I haven't found someone 
Mirror, mirror on the wall 
The loneliest of them all 
Cupid actin' stupid
Do you got another number I could call?
Never had a pet
I've never had a pet
There's more fish in the sea
But I never had a goldfish to begin with
I never had a dog
So I've never been good with bitches
'Cause I never threw a ball, fetch
I never had a pet, that's where it stems from, I bet
Treat me like direct deposit

Popping since Bastard,  Clancy's my slave master
Thanks to them crackers, my pockets are fatter than excess shit that's weighing on Jasper
I've never popped a bottle, but I've fucked a couple models in Europe

And said I was a racist homophobic
So I grabbed Lucas and filmed us kissing
Feelings getting caught, it's off, I'm pissing
You think I give a fuck? I ain't even stick my dick in yet 
And while y'all are rolling doobies
I be in my bedroom scoring movies
Still excited like a fucking newbie
Suck my dick, motherfucker, sue me
Mom got a new whip so she could scoop me

Four story home, gotta climb eight set of stairs
Just to see where my fucking roof be

Would fall cause shit's going down
Just like Rodney King swimming lessons
Now me and Justin smoke sherm and been talking 'bout freeing perms
And purchasing weapons, naming them and aim 'em in One Direction
It sounds like midgets in a God damn speaker
Anytime you play this shit loud
But that's just me trying to get milk now
And the grunts of the god damn cow
Hit me on my beeper while Captain Hook suck my Peter
Pan camera, repeat procedure

I don’t want that shit
I don’t want your goddamn lettuce "I'm saying, you know, like. All I ever told you to do was grow up, don't grow down. You know, like, you know, grow up. Don't grow down, grow out. You go from being a kid, just doing your thing, hanging out with your friends. Months later you're world-famous. You're a gay rights activist, and you don't even know it. You know what, I don't wanna say it to you no more, Tyler. Fuck you, Tyler!"
Watch me get this money, nigga; tired of being hungry, nigga
Nothing funny, sass me while I'm thrashing, I'ma punch a nigga
Never made of plastic, I'm a savage -- you look lunch, my nigga
Passing all you hating fucking fags we don't discuss, my nigga
We ain't on no jolly shit and we don't pop no Mollies, bitch
I'm hocking, spitting got some niggas out here popping Ollie switch
Buncha novices, Odd Future the squad is thick
Them young niggas is back and brash, attacking with no common sense
We the last of a dying breed
And we don't give a fuck, so we cannot supply your needs
You stupid niggas who had said our hype is dying, please
My pockets solid, making profit off the highest tees
Bitch, merch twerk as I get on the verse, cursing
Nigga Dom so cool, I refer him in third person
Watch me get this money, I'm up when the birds chirping
Make actions, fuck rehearsing
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, 'cause I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
In a world where kids my age are popping Mollies with leather
Sitting on Tumblr, never outside or enjoying the weather
Can name a sweater, but not a talent or don't know if whether
Or not they got one, tried to change their life for the better
I was the drama club kid, I run where the fun did, my nuts itched
I was defiant, always said, "Fuck shit"
Hated the popular ones, now I'm the popular one
Also hated homes too, til I start coppin' me some
See I don't beez in the trap, nigga, I beez in the b's
And I be gassing up my buzz like some bees at a Shell
Fucking sick and getting bigger like I sneezed on Adele
And bitches getting touchy-feely like they reading some Braille
I bust quick like gun-holders with short tempers, and well
I tried to tell the kids, like fuck it, start being yourself
These fucking rappers got stylists cause they can't think for themselves
See, they don't have an identity, so they needed some help, but
Really, boy? Posers looking silly, boy
I'm in that past season 'Preme shit, older than Tity Boi
Not a diss, but same with ice cream, my shit is Diddy Riese
Na'kel Smith, Transworld page 64
Poppin' like oil ollie in fire flames
I'm harder than DJ Khaled playing the fucking quiet game
The fuck am I saying? Tyler's not even a violent name
About as threatening as stained windbreakers in hurricanes
But he rapes women, and spit wrong, like he hates dentists
God damn menace, 666 and he's not finished
And my shit's missing, he hates women, but love kittens?
See y'all niggas tripping, man
Look at that article that says my subject matter is wrong
Saying I hate gays even though Frank is on 10 of my songs
Look at that Mom who thinks I'm evil, hold that grudge against me
Though I'm the reason that her motherfucking son got to eat
Look at the kid who had the .9 and tried to blow out his mind
But talk is money, I said, "Hi," I guess I bought him some time
Look at the ones in the crowd -- that shit is barnacles, huh?
They thought I wasn't fair until I threw a carnival, huh?
But then again, I'm an atheist that just worships Satan
And it's probably why I'm not getting no fucking album placements
And MTV could suck my dick, and I ain't fuckin' playing
Bruh, they never played it, I just won shit for they fucking ratings
"Analog" fans are getting sick of the rape
All the "Tron Cat" fans are getting sick of the lakes
But what about me, bitch? I'm getting sick of complaints
But I don't hate it when I'm taking daily trips to the bank
Oh but no but, shit, who really gives a fuck what I think?
My fans don't, they turning on me, shit, they're almost extinct
Fuck buying studio time, I'ma go purchase a shrink
Record the session and send all you motherfuckers a link, bitch
Nigga, summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time

You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
Summer, fall, wintertime, twenty-four, three-sixty-five
You niggas gon' give me mine, I don't have plenty time
Flying out at any time, getting money, any grind
You niggas gon' give me mine, you niggas gon' give me mine
]
This shit just like the nights I look forward to not remembering
So much for being sober, I hope that you can forgive me
But Momma, I'm close to the edge as possible 
All I’m seeing is the drop in my ocular, jumping like they told me
That the 40's half off, like you know that cliff
Don't need a therapist to tell him he could float that shit 
Or get compared to fucking pair with all the program kids
So maybe a pair of pale bitches for the gonads lick 
Malt liquor filling me up, and all us not giving no fucks and
All of them sensitive chumps in awe when that pistol erupts 
Dirty one spitting that sumpy raw till his wrists in the cuffs
Brother the Pigeons is us
Bid you goodnight and good luck

Samuel's here! Where's Wolf? Fucking faggot. Salem was mine, bitch! Was that good enough, you fucking pussy?Tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale, tamale!
They say I've calmed down since the last album
Well, lick my dick, how does that sound? Ummm
Smell my gooch, you could kiss my buns
And I don't give a shit, ban my rectum
Somebody said bands make her dance
You think you're getting cash, no bitch, you're dumb
The only thing that you're gonna get is this dick
Wait turn this up, bitch, this my jam 
Here, take a goddamn picture
And tell Spike Lee he's a goddamn nig​ger
And while you're at it, pass the lotion
And fapping and Xbox Live, that fun
Before I cum, I call your sister
When she comes over, I take picture
Instantly put it on Instagram
And suplex her off a building if I get banned
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone
Bring back the horns that was played in the beginning
And tell Tony Parker that I found his vision
And if he's tripping off my sneak dissing
Then he has to deal with me and my minions
Tryna get a bimmer, E46
Have you heard "48"? Motherfucker, I'm great 
Golf Wang prints always cover the sleeves
From cuts for the Biebs, 'cause he's puffin' the trees, please
Fuck I look like? Got a new bike
Tire never pop like the puss on a butch dyke
Think I give a fuck, I do go raw
Then I bust in her jaw like 
My urethra, hole that I pee from
Bigger than the obese neck on Aretha
Now turn that snare down
I'm back like I'm Rosa Parks fare on the same damn bus
Like, "You're going to jail now"
Tamale! Tamale! Tamale! Tamale!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone
How much wood could a woodchuck chuck?
If a woodchuck could ever give a fuck?
Bitch suck dick, motherfuck you and your opinions
 Yes, I can sir, where the lump is
Sicker than the last bar bold-er, I’m a CO
Colorado, fuck Michael, bitch, I’m badder than my BO
Find me and Lance tryna dance during chemo
Before they repossess our strong arm bands and tuxedos
Yeah, buddy, this is my jam, na, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Golf Wang, Golf Wang, no, fuck you, na, na, na, na, na, na!
Why y'all so salty? Hot tamale is on
A can of beans, bitch, I'm on
Your boy is bad to the bone
How many fags can a lightbulb screw?
Well if it has a dick, maybe two or six
And tell the NRA I'm about to lose my shit
And shoot through Wayne LaPierre's hair with a crucifix
How many ladies in the house?
How many ladies in the house without a rich nigga, huh?
A little Jergens in my palm for the jerkin'
Hope my mom don't catch me, tryna set mood
Little Redtube, fuck lotion, I don't need lube, dry fist suits me 
Up and down, friction make a *fap fap* sound
The shit's kind of disgusting
Fap time and before I flatline
Clancy chimes in my room and catch me
This shit's so damn embarrassing, like—
Oh, shit, aw, fuck
What the fuck?
Aw, I'm sorry
Is that my shirt?
Yeah, sorry, I needed something
Clean that shit up, we're going to the office!Yo, fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Nah Right
And any other fuck-nigga-ass blog that can't put an 18 year old nigga
Making his own fucking beats, covers, videos and all that shit
Fuck you post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hypebeast niggas, now back to the album
Well, Tyler, hi, I'm Dr. TC and um, I'm guessing that your teacher sent you here to talk 'cause you were misbehaving
Um, it's gonna be three sessions: today, tomorrow, and the next day
So, just tell me something about yourself...
Well, look, if, if you don't talk, I mean, these sessions are going to go slower, so-
This is what the devil plays before he goes to sleep
Some food for thought? This food for death, go ahead and fucking eat
My father's dead, well I don't know, we'll never fucking meet
I cut my wrist and play piano cause I'm so depressed
Somebody call the pastor, this bastard is so possessed
This meeting just begun, nigga I'm Satan's son
My mother raised me a single parent so it's apparent
That I got love for my mother, none of you other fuckers
Are much important I'm getting angrier while recording
I'm feeling like the bulls, I've got a gang of wolves
Odd Future is children that's fucked up in they mental
Simple but probably not, fuck them
I'm tall, dark, skinny, my ears are big as fuck
Drunk white girls the only way I'll get my dick sucked
Suspended from school, coolest nigga without effort
Easy to spot like black bitches with fake leopard
Soak me up in a tampon, but keep the lamp on
Cause this album pack enough evil
That you can't fit inside a Jansport
Go to school with this
I go from AP to JC inside a fucking week
Waking up with random girls like "Yo, bitch, how the fuck we meet?"
I stay with grandma, she always bitching about her carpet
Every time I walk inside the house, she always tend to start shit
No to drugs, I never spark it, I used to be bullied for honor classes
By those that were slow as molasses
Take this shit to school
Raquel treat me like my father, like a fucking stranger
She still don't know I made Sarah to strangle her
Not put her in danger and chop her up in the back of a Wrangler
All because she said no to homecoming, demons running
Inside my heads telling me evil thoughts
I'm the dream catcher but nothing but nightmares are caught, go to sleep
I wear green hats because I'm fortunately lucky
Fuck me the monster said, somehow the monster's dead
Inside of me, but the thoughts it tells me are still evil
With this state of mind, big moves, Max Keeble
I'm on my grind feeble, my music is either
A fucking sin or too illegal, play this shit in church
I graduated without honors or fucking father
He died  No bitch, don't even fucking bother
I wanted a brother, my mother I told her
But instead I got a sister, just like me with her mister nada
So both of our imaginations are creations of the fucking situation
That's having our brains racing like Dayton
Wearing some fucking Heelys
I know you fucking feel me, I want to fucking kill me
But times I'm so serious, you think I'm silly
I'm doing Big Style Willy couldn't touch 11
Seven, what's religion nigga? I am legend
I roll with skaters and musicians with an intuition
I created O.F. cause I feel we're more talented
Than 40 year old rappers talking about Gucci
When they have kids they haven't seen in years
Impressing their peers
With the same problem, the only way to solve them
Is to go to Father's Day convention with a gold revolver
Life's a salad, I'm a toss it, eat that shit up, Rick Ross it
Shit it out, bag it up, sell it, I'm so damn rebellious
Cause my mother let me do what I want
She wasn't careless, protective she is the bear
The shit is so bare, my diary isn't hid
My father didn't give a fuck, so it's something I inherit
My mom is all I have so it's never meet the parents
When Danielle or Milan decide to fucking share
This confused boy, I wanna hug, oy
I’m bad for your kids to listen to, soy is not the choice
I'm bad milk, drink it
Whoa, umm, it seems you had a lot to say
Uh, who knows I might feel as I'm evaluating
My wrist is all red from the cutter
Dripping cold blood like the winter, the summer
Is never that's equivalent to me and Sarah
Well that's not her fucking name, but I think this shit is clever
My niggas wanna know if I'm fucking, if I'm kissing
But I'm sitting here downing beers simply just wishing
With a tear they try to tell me but I never listen
'Cause I don't give a shit like sitting down pissing
Eighteen, still talking to imaginaries
Hopefully they see the talent I carry just like Jimmy
Losers can never win me, you can never offend me
My goal in life is a Grammy, hopefully mom'll attend the
Ceremony with all my homies, I'm suicidal
This my Zombie Circus, I hope the majors heard this
Fuck a deal, I just want my father's email
So I can tell him how much I fucking hate him in detail
Wow, umm
So, Tyler, if you had the chance to tell him something
What would you tell him?La, la, la, la, la, la, la
AAAAHHH!
Satan's getting jealous of the wolves, the demons say they preferring us
Books on not giving a fuck is what they're referring us 
Wolves, I know you heard of us, we're murderers
And young enough to get the fucking priest to come and flirt with us 
You niggas rap about fucking bitches and getting head
Instead, I rap about fucking bitches and getting heads
While you niggas stacking bread, I can stack a couple dead
Bodies, making red look less of a color, more of a hobby
I'm not a rapper, nor a rapist, nor a racist
I fuck bitches with no permission and tend to hate shit
Brag about the actions in a rhyming pattern matter
Then proceed to sat her down when I go splatter in her chatterbox
Atta boy, Odd Future, you're not in our categore
Torture with the super soaker at the Asian liquor store
This the type of shit that make a Chris Brown want to kick a whore
That make songs about the wet blockers when it rains and pours 
I hate this, screaming, "Fuck patience!"
Got a nigga shaking like the calmest, fucking Haitian
After chronic masturbation, asking where Mary Kate went
I want to be the reasons why all lesbians hate dick
I make this damn Bullwinkle the red moose
Game of duck-duck-duct tape with a dead goose
She running 'round this motherfucking dungeon, her legs loose
Until I accidentally get the saw to her head, oops
Victim, victim, honey, you're my fifth one
Honey on that topping when I stuff you in my system
Rape a pregnant bitch and tell my friends I had a threesome
You got a fucking death wish? I'm a genie, it'll get done
Nice to meet you, but it's more pleasant to eat you
With a leaf of salad and some dressing pouring out a teacup
Bitch, I'm Tyler, The Creature, suck your feet up like a beach of leeches
Rubber more than the fucking bottom of a sneaker
Jeeper the fucking creeper, get your daughter and keep her
In the jeeps where the Wolf Gang rides around deeper
Take her to Ladera, now she's scared and you're embarrassed
Filled with terror, chop her legs off and tell her to run some errands
Put her eyes in a canteen, take her to the Berrics
Stare at Steve, say it costs ten to fuck Eric
Put her in the lake, her body sinks great, now it's time to fish her like Derek
Satan says we're dangerous, we're trading kids for angel dust
And snuff and sniff, and now that Michael Jackson's trying to suck our dick
Hippopot the fucking llamas, dead bodies, cheerleading squaders
Gave the team a bunch of fucking bees and the Keke Palmer
They will never catch him or catch up
They asked me what it was, I told them fuckers it was ketchup
Nutty like my Chex mix, she bleeding from her rectum
Odd Future wolves stirring ruckus, throwing sets up, yeah
This the type of shit that make children break in apartments
When you tell a fucking orphan you don't love them 'til they heart thin
 Starve her 'til I carve her then I shove her in the Rover
Where I cut her like a barber with a Parkinson's disorder
Store her in a portable freezer with me to Portland
Catch me with a bunch of fucking Mexicans crossing the border 
I'll be the only wetback who ain't really touched the water
Cause I'll be too fucking busy tryna flirt with Jesus' daughter
 I'm awesome, and I fuck dolphins
Sicker than the starving Nigerian kids barfing
Odd Future Wolf Gang Nazi bar mitzvah
With your sister at the bar playing leg and arm twister
Evident that I'm the shit, I'm the Pooh like Tigger dick
I got these cracker doctors saying, "yeah Bob, this nigga’s sick"
Animal safari, if I offend you I'm sorry
Because I'm the blackest skinhead since India Arie
I don't smoke weed, so no need for the matches
I said fuck coke and now I'm snorting Hitler's ashes
I plan on either dying for suicide or my asthma
Being the only bastard in a box logo casket
Rashes on my dick from licks of shishkabob Sagets
In some Kanye West glasses screaming out "fuck faggots"
Catch me in my attic taking photos of my dad's dick
Drop the beat here to make it extra climactic
What the fuck?
I... I'm speechless, that was... fuck
Shit, Tyler, you're gonna need some help
I'm not a... fuck it, different subject
How's that girl you were telling me about?Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture
She's really fuckin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone 
New magic , new magic, new magic wand
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin'
This 60-40 isn't workin'
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now
I wanna be found, passenger in your car 
You wanna be mean, mixed signals, don't park 
She's gonna be dead, I just got a magic wand 
We can finally be together
You roll the dice, hit a seven, sure you right
Beginner's luck, you not my first, who gives a fuck?
Your other one evaporate, we celebrate
You under oath, now pick a side and if you don't
I'll pick you both
It's not a joke, murder she wrote
Ayo, take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you won't be here
I will not fetch the ball
Eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
It has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk in the gym
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off, or I ain't talkin' to them
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I ain't–
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your number one
Not the other one, keep it on the low
I'm in my right mind, keep it on a high
Janis Joplin spillin' feelings, now I'm out here moppin' 'em
Four on the floor, pack up your bags, we hit the store
Grab our supplies, no need for masks, bust through the door
Get the job done like retirement, I admit you look concerned
New magic wandFor your boy, I'm watching Freaks and Geeks with the trampoline on the floor
I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors, nigga
Money, money, money, money, money ain't the motive
What's your name again? Nobody knows it
Don't speak to me nigga, you not important
I'm focused 
Bring in the horns
They say I'm nutty, I'm picnic basket
I'm short of a sandwich, I'm peanut butter
Boyce Watkins a faggot, please come and get me
Said I suckin' at your neck, like a hickey, boy I'm sicky
Like a HIV victim, ain't nobody fuckin' with me
I got banned from New Zealand, whitey called me a demon
And a terrorist, God damn it, I couldn't believe it
Ban a kid from a country, I never fall, never timber
But you fucked up as a parent, your child idol's a nig​ger
I clearly don't give a fuck, so you could run that shit back
And fuck your loud pack, and fuck your Snapchat 
Cherry Bomb the greatest fuckin' album since the days of sound
And that shit gon' pop just like that nigga that was never 'round
Damn, 'bout to drop, gas 'em up, thick exhaust
Young T, came quick, hard to beat, dick is soft
We ain't lyin', we the truth, call him Simba, beats his hooves
Tyler, The Creator sweatin' Jesus juice
Put that fuckin' cow on my level, 'cause I'm raising the stakes
Mom, I made you a promise, it's no more section 8
Well, when we ate, it was the steaks, now our section is great
'Cause that's the level I'm at, my nigga, pass 'em a plate
'Ye!
Why, oh why, why, why don't they like me? 
'Cause Nike gave a lot of niggas checks
But I'm the only nigga to ever check Nike
Richer than white people with black kids
Scarier than black people with ideas 
Nobody can tell me where I'm headin' 
But I feel like Michael Jordan, Scottie Pippen at my weddin' 
They say I'm crazy, but that's the best thing goin' for me
You can't lynch Marshawn if Tom Brady throwin' to me
I made a million mistakes, but I'm successful in spite of 'em
I believe you like a fat trainer taking a bite of somethin'
I wanna turn the tanks to playgrounds
I dreamt of 2Pac, he asked me "Are you still down?" Yeah, my nigga
It's on, it's on, it's on, it's on
I know they told they white daughters, "Don't bring home Jerome"
I am the free nigga archetype 
I am the light and the beacon; you can ask the deacon
It's funny, when you get extra money 
Every joke you tell just be extra funny 
I mean, you can even dress extra bummy
Cocaine, bathroom break, nose extra runny 
And I gave you all I got, you still want extra from me  
Oxford want a full-blown lecture from me
And the Lexus pull up, errr, like hop, I hopped out, like wassup?
Err-err-err, step back, hold up, my nigga, you suck
Hold up 
I studied the proportions
Emotions runnin' at a Autobahn speed-level 
Had a drink with fear, and I was textin' God 
He said, "I gave you a big dick, so go extra hard"
For your boy, I'm tryna cop the new McLaren with the vertical doors
I'm watchin' Freak and Geeks, got a trampoline in my room, damn
Hold your fuckin' horses
Niggas really fuckin' thought that T lost it
Like I bet it at a auction
Been exhausted, I been workin'
While y'all silly bros smoke like broken exhaust tips
Fuckin' losers
Hold your fuckin' ponies, my homie
I'll whip your donkey by my lonely, I eat pussy like Shoney's, yeah 
It's Tunechi, homie, Master of Ceremonies
I knock 'em down, Domino effect, no pepperoni, I swear
This them Golf boys, like them Hot Boys
For the nine-nine and two-thousand
But its the two-thou' and the one-four and the one-five
Yo, what up Wayne?
What up Slime? Nigga, go hard
Yeah, I'ma go hard like before came
Got too much drive, need like ten lanes
Life is a broad, and she give brain
That's that road head , that's a dream car
Got a full tank of that same year I was born
That's that one-nine-nine-one
'Nother nigga like I, you won't find one
'Cause nigga I'm a god, a divine one; Tune!
My trigger finger wise but my 9 dumb 
Middle finger blind, so it's fuck A-N-Y-one
Fuck, skate, and die son, a hundred ways to die, son
I'm starin' at a tramp on lean, make my eye jump
Use Adderall like alarm clocks, wake my high up
Stakes are high, well done, and prime cut; eat up
I stick my Rollie in her mouth, let the time come
She got hair like Sheneneh, and eyes like Wanda
Oh my goodness
Wayne, them bitches ugly
These niggas colder than Tommy buddy
Ye, we hittin' models like Tony Parker be hittin' bottles
Bitch, I'm goin' harder than yellow cabbies stoppin' for Lionel 
They be duckin' us niggas, shout out to Donald Sterling
Boy, let's get a scrimmage
And cut some niggas, I'll bring the Clippers
And a couple owners that's kinda German
You bring the nooses
And a couple trees, where the money grow
And get bodies burnin'
'Cause I'm tryna hang like I'm Mr. Cooper or Jews in Berlin
Or some niggas from Alabama, Birmingham
My new music's all over the street like Erick Sermon was
Fuck us, maybe we should team up
Anti-Golf boys 'cause I don't fuck with me either
I'm a liar, I'm a faggot 
Son, you need Jesus
But I heard he left Sunset to go on tour with Yeezus
Well, I'm prayin' for the new Yeezys
And you pussies prayin' that we squash the beef like zucchini, I know
It ain't gain, nor fame, nor tame
Or lame, nor strange
Nah faggot, it's Golf WangPart 1 - FUCKING YOUNG
Day that I met you, girl
I knew that it was something special
But I couldn't put my finger on it 
We met through mutual friends 
And this is where the story and confusion began
'Cause I was at nirvana but I had to pretend that I wasn't
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? 
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, 'cause
'Cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young 
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love
A six-year 
Is a ten year 
And with the  on my skin
I don't want to be another 
You bring me 
And you fill a void that was once missing
And 
There go the policeman, knocking at my door
Do I leave out the back and grab my wallet and coat?
Or do I answer real confused like, "I don't know"? 
Now me and she held hands and we danced, nothing more
She kissed my hand a couple times, FaceTime when we're bored
There's nobody at the door, man, I'm so paranoid
Fuck, 'cause
'Cause girl, you're perfect, but you're too fucking young 
And when temptation calls my phone, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young
And this is more than a crush, I just might be in love
When you're 35, I'll be 41, and when I'm 27, you'll be 21
Yo, this is dumb, and when that time comes for that 1-8
I'll probably run, 'cause I'm fucking terrified
Yo this is dumb, you should find someone else
I'm not the one for you, shit, I'm still growing up by myself
And mentally you're older than me and that shit doesn't help
'Cause if they see you with T, they'll think T needs some help
So when you mention "hang," I'm thinking about a tree and a belt
And I don't want no relation, shit no relation
Ship when my dick is longer than my attention-
Span, it's gonna suck if shit, hits that kitchen fan
And splatter on me like my dick in my hand
What? I'm still fucking off, not good at ducking off
Because I found a goose that I like, but I'm still running off
She gon' want a nest, that's why I cannot get fucking caught
That's a scary word, you could save that shit for the birds
But I found my wings, fuck
I really like you
I don't know what to do
(And when temptation calls, I never pick up
And girl, you stole my heart but you're too fucking young)
Funny thing about this is
By the time you hear this
It won't even matter
I'll be in the clear
It's T and Uncle Charlie!
But you're too young
But you're too young
But you're too young
Part 2 - PERFECT
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared
Boy I know, that we could be more
Than just friends, but you're scared 
I know that there could be
Somethin' for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
And I’ll exit and wait a while
Just say the word girl
Can't you see the answers are all there
But I'm just too blind to see
You and I are cut from different fabric
I wanna rock, I wanna rock with you girl
Don't be too material to see
But I'm just too blind to see
Somehow, this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck 'em all baby, it's just you and me
But you're too fuckin' young
And girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin’ hurts
Fuck, 'cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me
And it hurts, it fuckin' hurts
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one
That you're the one, for me
'Cause you're too fuckin' young
And, girl, I know that you're the one for me, yeah
I rock 
I rock 
I rock I don't know where I’m going 
But I know what I'm showing 
Feelings, that's what I’m pouring 
What the fuck is your motive? 
Man, I wish you would call me 
By your name 'cause I'm sorry 
This is not apology 
You are such a distraction 
That's what T on, aw 
Fuckin' up my ambiance, pause 
You drive me cuckoo and not car 
'Cause I want you like Leon Ware 
Okay, say again it 
Okay, wait a minute 
I dread that shit, I am Anwar 
Curiosity killed the feline, gone 
I think I've fallen in love 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I’ve fallen in love 
This time I think it’s for real 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?  How can I tell you? 
I notice that you're there, but I’m always in your hair
And you're always under my microscope 
Waste of bread, I need your attention 
I'm off balance, I need some fixin' 
I’m your puppet, you are Jim Henson 
Fallen in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
Fell in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I'm in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
I think I'm in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you? 
How can I tell you?
Take 'em to the bridge
Four, four, four, four 
I think I've fallen in love 
Fell in love now 
This time I think it's for real 
I think I'm in love now 
I think I've fallen in love 
This time I think it's for real Sawed-off, I eat those

Trashwang! Woah!
Illegal CIV!
Trashwang! Yo!

Big dog, cup full of egg nog
Don't give a fuck 'bout shit but clips and Camp Flog Gnaw
Sawed-off, I eat those
These clothes, they free though
Straight from the back of the Supreme store
Don't give a fuck about these hoes
They just slob knob in New York shows
Thirsty for the clips till I'm not flow
Pusha Georgia trip, bitch I got it poppin'
Me and Jasper going coffin shopping
Nose of the board see a lotta boxes
Bitches see the boy and they mouth be frothing
Chain is glossing

Thriller, we the killer
You can tell I'm Golf Wangin'
By the fucking stickers
OF or Wolf Gang

Haha
Click-click 
What the fuck was thatComparing scars before dinner
Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon' leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it 
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can't compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now 
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now 
You keep me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now 
Going away, and now I'm scarred for life
My love is gone , my love is gone 
My love is gone , my love is gone
Ayo, it's poison in that gumbo
Emotion, feel Dumbo
Ask me where my love go
That bitch walked outside the front door
Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga 
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
I said go, go
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Again, again
Again, againYo, now you gon' start me from the top? Listen
Shout out Harlem, man
Shout out A$AP Rocky, man
AWGE in the building, man
What's good? Is that potato salad?
Yo, listen
Niggas give me the cold shoulder, I can speak for myself
So I keep a high waist and alligator the belt
And got a belt with the holster, I ain't playing games
But got some lil' niggas who would do it so I pass the controller
You get pressed and X out, tri-angle your nose
Pause your life if you squares try to mess with my O's, whoa
So cut the crap like shit barbers
'Cause we really with the beef like closeted gay fathers
Nigga we get dollars, give 'em to Ben Baller
Exchange for them chains that's all shiny with thick water
I got back pains, neck heavy like whipped cream
My whip clean, and they all white, I whip cream
And cop boys and I joystick, I whip cream and cop cribs
I got more space than big jeans, y'all sleeping on me
Explain why they got shit dreams
I'm alien, got the laser gun with the big beam
Married to the money, my bitch green
No I don't sip lean, but ride around in rockets like Yao Ming
Y'all niggas weak
They thought I was goofy and all mouses
Double C my luggage and fill them with Comme blouses
Y'all cop kush, my nigga I cop houses
And fill 'em with some Leo DiCap's and some Cole Sprouses, nigga
Where we? Rocky, A$AP
GOLF, boy, where we at? Nigga in Paris
Fuck clothes, I cop pieces
Couple thots with me and them hoes is like divas
Got my Vans on but they look like sneakers
Flipped a couple packs, BasedGod in the speakers
Bass all in the speakers
In the field like baseball, play ball, face wall when polices come
I don't rock Chanel, I rock channel
And no this ain't a purse, it's a satchel 
Bless, at you, nah, I ain't sneeze
But if niggas want steam or smoke, bet I match you
Got a bullet with your name on the barrel
If hollows don't clip, you get nip like it's cat food
That dude, when I die, they gotta make a statue
Bad attitude, this ain't a purse, it's a satchel
Go to any nigga with money up in my bracket
Then I think about the state of rapping
All the freshmens in the classes
All the super seniors' mumblin' and ramblin'
Mumblin' and rappin', mumble rapping?
I find it hard to find actual talent
I find it hard to find an actual challenge
I'm like Shabazz Palace's last acid hit, elaborate
Rap lab's labyrinth, word to Kodak's Black's Lazarus
"CALLDROPS" on the album skits
Ayo, I'm the channel that you watch, I'm the ammo in the Glock
Weird nigga, full suit with the sandals and the socks, stop
And based on my neck boy
You would think I hate glass homes way I'm handling the rocks
Who cast the first stone? Bitch, it's me, fuck you thought?
Real grunge nigga, I ain't got a flannel as the top
And I'm picking up guitar, strum nigga
Bum niggas wish they could make a garden shed
But they sleeping on me man like their arm is dead
I'm a wild nigga boy and you farmer bred, born
You ain't animal, you are, corn, hahaha, yeah!
K shiz, what up, nigga!You wouldn't do that Tyler, kill yourself or anyone. You don't even have the balls to begin with. What you need is me, someone to talk to, uh, it's been a while since our last session. So, tell me what's been going on
I'm not a fucking role model 
I'm a 19 year old fucking emotional coaster with pipe dreams
Since Kanye tweeted telling people he's bumping all of my shit
These mothafuckas think I'm 'sposed to live up to something? Shit
I'm still jacking off and proceeding my life careless
But getting more pussy 'cause I tell bitches I'm Wood Harris 
Philly to Paris, I'm getting these weird stares
At skateparks and airports all in a year, it's weird
Yonkers dropped and left them craniums mindfucked
Now competition missing like that nigga my mom fucked
He still hasn't called me yet 
But that's a whole fucking different argument, shit, I got over it
And a couple bucks in my pocket, so now I could go buy
A couple Hot Pockets and grandma could stop cooking
Them nasty ass collard greens, pressure's on me like this top hat
Bastard intro, how the fuck I'm gonna top that?
"Tyler, you'll top it, you'll top that, you're a very capable individual"
"Okay, you guys caught me, I'm not a fucking rapist or serial killer, I lied"
"You know, you just want attention, you'll be fine"
"I try too hard, huh?"
"No, you don't"
Made a couple thou' and I just don't know what to buy yet
The 'preme shit is free and I don't drink, so fuck a wine set
Nigga, fuck a mindset, my brain is an obscenity
I'm fucked in the head, I lost my mind with my virginity
Oh, that's a triple three six, isn't he a devil worshiper
Cause I'm too fucking ignorant to do some research?
I'm the star of the group 
So no one else gets the respect that they deserve cause of you
 What you think I record it for?
To have a bunch a critics call my shit a bunch of horrorcore?
Like I didn't make "Parade" or "Inglorious"
Cause I'm too scared to tell my friends the way I really fucking feel?
Of course they only listen to lyrics about me pissin' off
In the tombs of Lara Croft, I'm getting pissed off 
Message boards are on my dick, I need a pissing waiver 
Let me bust one in they mouth, I know they full of flavor
"Can't they just be happy for me like, a kid with nothing, living out his dreams? Why they got to fucking hate?"
"I think everyone's happy, everyone's immature, everyone loves you Tyler, you have to believe that."
"I don't even skate anymore, I'm too fucking busy, I can barely kickflip now."
"Why? Why is that? Do you not have any free time when you're at  home?"
"What the fuck you mean I'm not talented? You see the shit that I've been doing?"
"I have, I mean you're a great person."
"I mean, I'm not that great of a rapper but as a whole, I'm pretty cool, right?"
People excited, thinking shit is so tight 
Getting co-signs from rappers that I don't even like
What the fuck you want me to do? Start to gobble his mic?
And start Jackson him off until his cack blasting off? 
Fuck that,  These niggas ain't fucking with me
Cause I don't listen to the Immortal of Tech-of-the-nique
And all this underground bullshit that's never gon' peak
On the Billboard Top 20 and Jam of the Week
I'd rather listen to Badu and Pusha the T
And some Waka Flocka Flame instead  of that real hip hop
That's bull-of-the-sheet, but they want to critique
Everything that we, Wolf Gang, has ever released
But they don't get it,  cause it's not made for them
The nigga that's in the mirror rapping, it's made for him
But they do not have the mindset that's same as him
I'm not weird, you're just a faggot, shame on him
"It is, but Tyler, you're going to have to cut down on that "faggot" word, that's very, that's a bad...
"I'm not homophobic."
"I mean, I don't think you are but..."
"Faggot."
"Alright, well, since the last time we..."
"The fuck is a good performance? I get on stage and I have as much fun as I can."
"I mean, you, you, it seems like you have fun. But your Twitter posts, just.. I mean, they're really random and it's ADD."
"Who doesn't have ADD..? Well, I don't."
"I mean, sometimes, you just say really outlandish things and we just want to know, what's the problem for this?"
"I wish Thebe was here."
Therapy's been sinning and niggas getting offended
They don't want to fuck with me cause I do not fuck with religion
You see, that's my decision, you fuckers don't have to listen
Here, put this middle finger in your ear 
When someone gets blamed cause some white kid had aimed  his AK-47
At 47 kids, I don't wanna see my name mentioned
College wasn't working and I wasn't working
So I was at home jerking off until my dick was hurting
But I was determined to be great, so those classes can wait
Cause the four days that I went, I wasn't learning shit 
Now I'm living dreams that I wanted since eight
And can afford to get my mother something on her birthday
They claim the shit I say is just wrong
Like nobody has those really dark thoughts when alone
I'm just a teenager, who admits he's suicide prone
My life is doing pretty good, so that date is postponed for now
Wow, life's a cute bitch full of estrogen
And when she gives you lemons, nigga, throw 'em at pedestrians
(So, what are you saying, take advantage?
I mean, you've been doing pretty good, I've seen that)
I still live in my grandma's house
Sell out a fucking show in London just to end up on couches
I hate my fucking life, but when I make that announcement
My hero calls my phone, just to put that in doubt then
And then I am confused if I want in or just out
My friends really think I'm playing when I say I need counseling
I sit in grandmother's living room and just pout
And shout loud inside, sometimes I just want to die 
Odd Future came from the bottom
And it's gonna take a couple armed armies tryna stop 'em
 All you fucking lames don't have to like me
The devil doesn't wear Prada, I'm clearly in a fucking white tee
Whoa, umm, alright, uh, so you was telling me you went to New York...When you're having fun, fun
When you're having fun 
Out the window 
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something

Boy, my bedroom floor is a cereal burial, I'm serious
I ate 'em all, dry boxes, bodies, yeah I caught 'em
If we're talkin' 'bout real meals, ask my stomach, he ain't saw 'em
I've been in this fuckin' room so long
My eyeballs are turning to drywall
My friends suck, fuck 'em, I'm over 'em
"Hi y'all, y'all ain't hit me all-day
What the fuck is the problem? Is it me?
'Cause I'm not solved, I'm... bored"
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
Bored and getting desperate as hell
Cellular not amusing and I hope someone will
Message me with some plans that are amusing as well
'Cause I haven’t seen the exit of these walls since before this morning
Morning, morning, morning, morning
Got some cars I can handle but nowhere for performance
My stomach angry and yellin', I need some food, I could order
But I hate eating solo
Need someone, we can loiter in parking lots
As sunsets at the border, yeah
Ringy dingy dong, I can't be alone
I been starting to feel like I don't know anyone
So now I'm staring at my ceiling fuckin' blowing
Like I have no idea where I'm going
Tick tock
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something
Find some time, find some time to do something 
 
'Cause boredom got a new best friend

Hey Dad, it's me, um...
Oh, I'm Tyler, I think I'd be your son
Sorry, I called you the wrong name, see, my brain's splitting
"Dad" isn't your name, see "Faggot"'s a little more fitting
Mom was only twenty when you ain't have any fucks to spare
You Nigerian fuck, now I'm stuck with this shitty facial hair
Also stuck with a beautiful home with a case of stairs
So you not being near fucking fire-started my damn career
But fuck it, I got Clancy, he gave me the chance to see
A world I wasn't supposed to, I'm stoked that I didn't know you
But sucks you ain't give a fuck and considered a sperm donor now
The fuck is an Okonma? I'm changing my shit to Haley
And I just ain't being passive, nigga

Suck my fucking dick and swallow this case of nuts
Ace hates your guts, I'm a selfish fuck
And I ain't sharing green as if I'm facing blunts
Frank is out the closet, Hodgy's an alcoholic
Syd might be bipolar, but fuck it, I couldn't call it
Supposed to be gone 'til November but quickly came back in August
I left two months through September to clearly remember all this
I would like to tell my grandma, but she just nostalgic
I'll call her number
But she won't answer
]
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
I hope you answer
Yeah, I hope you answer
'Cause when I call 
I hope you pick up your phone

You claim to hate my fucking guts
But say I'm on a island in Thailand and I was wilding
And, if I got stranded had to man up and hold my nuts
And hope that I could live off salt water and fucking coconuts
Phone ain't got no service, this 3G is fucking worthless
Day is getting dark like the area's turning urban
You'll be fucking nervous like me inside of a Church's
But, I'ma get in contact regardless, and
I hope you answer
The last verse was about this girl, hahaDon't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon
You don't have to hide
I can smell it in your eyes
That there's something more to say, baby
Them words
Damn, run me back, yeah
If I could, if I could
If you could
Find the words to say
Find the words to say
Find the words
In the garden
Shed
Go
Don't kill a rose
Before it could bloom
Fly, baby, fly
Out the cocoon
Ayo
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
For the garden
That is where I was hidin'
That was real love I was in
Ain't no reason to pretend
Garden shed, garden shed, garden shed
Garden shed for the garçons
Them feelings that I was guardin'
Heavy on my mind
All my friends lost
They couldn't read the signs
I didn't wanna talk and tell 'em my location
And they ain't wanna walk
Truth is, since a youth kid, thought it was a phase
Thought it'd be like the phrase; "poof," gone
But, it's still goin' on
Big fan of the beige tan
Polka dot nose, how it goes
Had to keep it on the subwoofer
A couple butterflies wanna float
But I was always like, "Eh"
Barely interested, but bagged just to brag to my boys like, "Bruh"
This is a crucial subject matter
Sensitive like cookin' batter
'Til the temperature that's risin'
Steppin' on that ladder, tryna
Grab the rings of Saturn, I'ma
Planet by the time you hear this
Shit and chatter 'bout the heat
It will not fuckin' matterPoppa ain't call even though he saw me on TV, it's all good 
But now my balls, balls deep in this broad's jaw
Swallow girl, it's just nut
Bitches scared to let me smash on they ass
Yeah, they heard I'm fuckin' nuts like the swag of a fag
Like me and Tekeli was gagging in the back of the cabin
Camp Flog Gnaw, nigga, you can tell by the badge
I'm sick of hacking and coughing, I'm often this fucking awesome
I'm animal, Noah's arking, all from this rapping nonsense
Four stories in my home like "What the fuck's an apartment?" 
Get shit poppin' like Peter's pores during puberty
Take bets on how quick Tyler can reach maturity
Cussing out Siri like a waitress with no patience
Oh, you want a tip bitch, well here's my dick for gratiturity, bitch
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!
I tumble-crush on huzzy sluts, give money up then nutty butt
Professor Nutty Buddy Klump gets petty when you touch his lunch
Like, what the fuck? I'm drunk as fuck, turn the fucking music up
So I can't hear these stupid fucks, talk-no-walk, let you discuss
You're talking too much, who the fuck are you to us? Uterus
I put that on my pubes and nuts, if I don't begin moving up
I'm shooting up, you and her crew on turf, new dessert
I can see the bitch in a nigga through his shirt
I can smell the whore on a bitch when she flock around my crew to flirt
It's on ya' shoulder, lose the dirt, yeah, it's the movement first
Fuck a human nurse! I'm ill I used this earth to infuse the birth
Of my scrotum on the Channel 10 news, my only motive is to
Skip to my Lou, get hip to the pew
You can drink piss and eat a dick in a few, the sickening view
Of visuals, woo, I'll eat your ribs, I'm a wolf
Then meet your kids after school, and give them drugs cause it's cool, fucker
Shut 'em down!
Nigga, shut 'em down!
Shut 'em down!
Hodgy, fuck this beat, nigga, let's smoke weed
That shit I need, be the shit that's green
A little purple and pink, come get some Swisher Sweets
About three or four more than needed be
I got a eighth I could face, I got a blunt flavored grape
I hate the grape, I could taste it when I'm inhaling the vapes
You could smell us in places when we walk in our clothing is always covered in flakes
Enough for two shake blunts; and what the fuck is this? Uh...
I think this Mary is laced; my heart is beating at paces
That Pacquiao can't relate I'm fucking faded like gradients
Shit, I'm stuck like the tape that's superglued
To the center of Kelly Price first waist
It's like my first date with Mrs. Mary, the shit is scary
The paranoia from this marijuana's very heavy, I'm lifted
Fainted by my fifth hit, Lionel, pass the sherm
Let's use the Philly as a dipstick for this bath salt, you dipshit
C'mon, my nigga! You don't even smoke, you weak as fuck, my nigga. You do not smoke, no tucks, my nigga. You're as weak as f- you’re butt my nigga. Oh, mark ass nigga, Cuh, oh my God, bro. Here come this weak-ass nigga, SamuelRandom disclaimer!
Hey, don't do anything that I say in this song, okay?
It's fucking fiction
If anything happens, don't fucking blame me
White America, fuck Bill O'Reilly
Four, three, two, one
What the fuck I look like? Saying I'm sorry
To a bunch of fucking fags that can't potentially harm me?
I ain't never gonna bow down to your expectations
By the way, I got sixty fucking wolves that'll guard me
That skate hard, Thrash' black hoodies, try something
Make sure your fuckin' feelings end up up in a Glad bag
Fuck all your opinions, I'm tyin' 'em with a shoestring
And fuck the fat lady, it's over when all the kids sing
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
Kill people, burn shit, fuck school
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
I'm fucking radical, nigga, I'm fucking radical
I'm fucking radical, I'm motherfucking radical
Odd Future, Wolf Gang
We came together cause
We ain't have nobody else
Do you?
You just might be one of us
Are you?

The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga

The party isn't over, we could still dance girl
But I don't have no rhythm
So fuck it, take a chance with a nigga
Like me, like me
Yeah, um
All I needed was a stick, grab the marshmallows
Motherfuckers getting lynched and burned
I earned it, my Flog Gnaw badge is looking good
On this brand new jacket
The donuts on the flag waving over the cabin
Now grab them graham crackers and pass them over here
Hurry, quickly I need a piece of Hersheys
Darker than the corners of the bushes we be lurking
I centered the mellow over the graham
Heated it too long now, it's melting over my hand
Fuck it, I'll bite it, I burnt it, but I liked it
Camping with my niggas, its so fucking exciting
We're making s'mores by the campfire
Camp Flog Gnaw, Golf Wang summer
Sat by the fire
To witness gentle, but radical
Transformation ceased to be mindless
Create our own sweetness
At last growing the heart
Yo bring the bass back in
Yeah, haha
Who ate all the fuckin' chocolate?
Oh that's Domo fat ass, haha
Yeah
I ain't trying to go home, really
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash
]
Pop some Tame Impala, your man got a lame Impala
And I'm sharing Slurpees and you ain't even begin to swallow
You’re fucking nuts, green top we coupled up
Run my fingers through em as you wax and buff my muffler
Cause I fingered you, you think the fucking ring is coming up?
Maybe, I don’t know, I think you’re chill
Riding on my pegs, and my back against your legs
And a seatbelt is needed if I get between 'em, yeah
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
And you got a lot of drive, I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer
See your ignition, baby girl I'm trying to key up
And your headlights are off, I'm trying to see 'em
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
So let me start it up and smash
Mmmm it’ll get dark outside, soon 
Where the street lights trail 
You ain’t gotta lie to kick it darling
It’s cool we’re moving slow
You remind me of my bimmer
A lot of trunk space, the perfect two seater
You got a lot of drive I’m trying to keep up
But it's not a lot of miles on ya meter
You remind me of my bimmer, smash
You remind me of my bimmer
Where you been, man?
Oh, I had a drop off to make real quick. Hey, have you seen Salem?
Oh she with that new dude, Wolf, or, Darnell, whatever his name is
Fuck that nigga, man. Hey you know where they went?
I seen 'em going down by the lake
What the fuck!
You good man? You need some sherm? I got some
I got a can of these baked beans tooWent to Six Flags, six fags came up
And said "Ayo! Can we get a pic?" I said no
And they said "Oh! It's Wolf Gang, "Yonkers", Goblin is my shit though"
Now I'm like, "fuck, I don't want to be an asshole"
So I'm sitting there posing with Travis, Devon
With a fake smile like her titties was drawing it on
So fucking annoyed 'cause I missed Goliath
'Cause some kid said I was there, then they caused a riot 
Now I'm surrounded by a 25 hound of fuckers tryna get a photo
All because they noticed the top with the box logo
And them fucking ears, guarantee they didn't even hear Bastard
They bandwagon-jumped me from a pogo
I'm going fucking loco, "Hey, Tyler, can I...?"
No, bitch, don't you see me tryna buy a fucking churro?
"But Tyler, you're my hero, I used to get bullied
Until I heard "Radicals," the last part got to me
See, I used to give a fuck until my cock would bleed
Now I'm the happiest I think I'll ever ever be
My life is just like yours, no father
My momma must have forgot to stop with a popped condom
In school I was the one that was thinking outside boxes
So everybody in them would say that I got problems
So when I heard you say it, I said it back like fuck 'em
You're an inspiration to niggas like me
Not the niggas who just like you 'cause of lyrics and beats
I'm talking 'bout the niggas who don't know where they're going to be
I heard the song "Bastard" right in the moment of heat
Not in summer, but of course, I was holding a heat
Gun on the edge of my feet, I heard that first piano chord
And it drew me in like predators carrying treats
Then I said to myself, "Fuck, is he speaking to me?"
See, me and you, we go together like snare and a beat
I mean snare and a kick drum, see my forearm?
I carved OF on it this morning with a glass shard
On my green mini ramp that I built in my backyard 
That's hard, that scar from playing air guitar
When I see you play at the Roxy 
Tyler, I love you, wanna be just like you 
I think about your face and I don't even fucking try to 
Wish I had a basement meant for me to hide you
We could play Xbox and listen to "In Search Of..." and eat donuts
Over conversating 'bout what church does
Come up with weird-ass videos with roach bugs
I'm straight edge too, so no drugs on this trip
And Raquel that bitch, you should've killed that bitch
You should've took me instead 
See, if you can't have her then he shouldn't neither
And if I can't have you then she shouldn't either
No one should see you, but me in your t-shirt
I worship you until the fucking wrinkles on my knees hurt 
Odd Future, Wolf Gang, Golf Wang, Flog Gnaw, free Earl mobbing
I know it seems like I'm just slobbing on your knob
But I'm just a fan and I ain't losing my fucking noggin 
I ain't got a job and I went out and bought Goblin about 5 times
'Cause  I love you man 
I like tie-dyed tees or just plain white tees
I like pants that's cut, I like words like "fuck"
I got your pics on my wall with the mouth cut out
Now paper cuts on my balls because your dick's in my jaw 
And I hit you on Twitter about 10 minutes a day
And now I'm bitter 'cause you don't even reply with a "hey" 
And my boys think I'm gay 'cause I play "VCR"
In my car all alone speakers waking up neighbors..."
All right, my nigga, calm down, it's getting weird, take this pic
So I can get on Colossus, line as slow as molasses
 No, nigga, I see you're loving my shit
And I appreciate the fact that you would suck on my dick
But I'm not gay so it's awkward, now I'm grouchy like Oscar
After spilling some shit on his newest pair of beige Dockers
"Yonkers" and "Yonkers"  Sick of hearing about "Yonkers"
I'm grateful that it worked, I attacked and I conquered
"Yeah whatever but I had a fucking blast at that concert
I was at the Boston one, I got a t-shirt from Sagan
The one that say "Sagan Lockhart" and when you came out to "Sandwitches"
That's when my fucking boy-crush got started"
Just take this fucking picture man, shit...Odd Future

To wear fucking suits and make good decisions?

Who the fuck invited Mr. I Don't Give a Fuck
Who cries about his daddy in a blog because his music sucks? 
Well, you fucking up, and truthfully I had enough
And fuck rolling papers, I'm a rebel, bitch, I'm ashing blunts 
Full of shit, like I ate that john
Come on kids, fuck that class and hit that bong
Let's buy guns and kill those kids with dads and mom
With nice homes, 401ks, and nice ass lawns
Those privileged fucks got to learn that we ain't taking no shit
Like Ellen DeGeneres clitoris is playing with dick
I'm jealous as shit, cause I ain't got no home meal to come to
So, if you do, I'm throwing fingers out screaming "fuck you"
I got ten of these Kennedy's
Not Dom, but if I was a Dahm, I would be Jeffery
'Preme hat the color of a leprechaun with leprosy
I'm fucking 'bout it, 'bout it, like I'm Master P in '96
It's fucking immaculate, the way your daughter smacking dicks
Surprised she hasn't taken gymnastic dick inside her alley-oop
The Golf Wang hooligans is fucking up the school again
And showing you and yours that breaking rules is fucking cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Chronic youth, I'm shoving blunt wraps in bitches ovaries
Punches to the stomach where that bastard kid supposed to be
Fuck a mask, I want that ho to know it's me, ugh

My love is gone for you mami, you could ride in hearses

You told me life would never, ever, ever get this perfect
Then you smoke a J of weed, and take his kids to the churches
Uh, fuck church, they singing and the shit ain't even worth it
In the choir, whores and liars, scumbags and the dirt, bitch
You told me God was the answer
When I ask him for shit, I get no answer, so God is the cancer
I'm stuck in triangles, looking for my angel
Kill me with a chainsaw, and let my balls dangle
Triple six is my number, you can get it off my Tumblr
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang

"My baby daddy shoot bricks, the nigga also shoot rounds"
Cause if I shoot blanks, oops, thanks

And we don't fucking make horrorcore, you fucking idiots
Listen deeper than the music before you put it in a box, Wolf GangAyo
I wanna talk, I wanna call you and talk
I wanna walk to your front door and knock
After I start my vehicle
Drive to your city 'cause we live an hour apart
Land at your driveway and put it in park
Then do the third line of this verse
Then back to my house and we pack up our bikes
And we ride through the park, chase the sun
God, that's all I want, other than air
Oxygen and financial freedom, yeah
I want your company, I need your company
I want you to want from me
I can't maneuver without you next to me
It's so complex to me
What do you need?
Do you need bread? Do you need this?
Do you need a hug? Do you need to be alone?
I could wrap this up and get the fuck away instead
What is your wish? It can be granted
You're number one, one on my list, see, I am Santa
Where is Rudolph? You're parasitic
I do not have self-control
I am startin' to wonder
Is this my free will or yours? 
I'm your puppet, you control me
I'm your puppet, I don't know me
I'm your puppet
You control me
I'm your puppet
I'm lonely
'Cause I'm your puppet
You control me 
I'm your puppet 
I don't know
I'm your puppet 
You control me 
You lost, son, and you've been tryna find your way to me
Ayy, to me, he's on somethin' that I hate to see

Run a 'thon, I just stop and I'ma take the breathe
...on a...

First, light the weed

First... 
First... 
Breathe on a song
Breathe on a song
Breathe on a song
But at some point, you come to your sensesUh, addicts arise when I arrive
In this cracked crack fag back slab in disguise
Fat sack of knives in the passenger side
Bitch, reach for the door, get your access denied
I'm not an asshole, I just don't give a fuck a lot
The only time I do is when a bitch is screaming "Tyler, stop!"
The big bad wolf; to me, you're just a minor fox
Red Riding is getting some of this wolfly odder cock
We the niggas you scared of like bad dentists
Flow is anthemic, dirty like it's plants in it
Sick, spit a pandemic, crack and cancer mixed with cannabis
To have a bitch ready to stab a clit with some glass and shit
Your whole gang'll be diminished, bunch got the Brady's in it
Spit sick shit like my saliva got the rabies in it
Fuck rap, I'll be a landlord so I can rape the tenant's daughter
Leave my house with a new stomach, and a baby in it

"I fucked this nigga eye up man haha"
Face it, me and Ace is sick like malaria carriers
Jim Carrey her to the cemetery to bury her
Listen busters, scarier when I finger fuck her
After I dig her up and then eat her out with a bit of mustard
Took karate, mommy told me "Tyler toughen up"
Rihanna haircut, somebody tell Chris Brown to fuck me up
Had to teach the bitch manners, now I gotta learn her
I'll beat the fuck out your bitch anonymous, Ike Turner
Over, sloppy seconds is my preference
Except for when I'm feeding on the flesh of a pedestrian
Nessy loch monster stop Will he though? Probably not
Silly hoes lick my balls like FIFA lollipops
Get the certain tingle, eating Häagen-Dazs
With some soccer moms where they like to fucking sit and mingle
Watch an Animal Planet document on the Eagles
In the flyest '06 Supreme beanie, Sigel
Your grind's feeble, I'm regal, really, I'm Willy Smith
I am Legend, a snicker dick in a vanilli chick
Come take a stab at it faggot, I pre-ordered your casket
This is known as a classic, yeah that chapped lips crack shit
Hat is always forest so the bitches call me Gump
But compliment her tits and then its off to hump her
Fuck her in a Hummer while I rape her then I put her in a slumber
It's not a figure of speech when I tell you that I dumped her
Known narcissists, sipping on arsenic
Carved carcasses in the garage, don't park in it
Hard as finding retarded kids at Harvard
It's Wolf Gang barking keep you up like car alarms and shit
Over the edge, yeah I hide in a potato sack
'Cause I'm cold as ice like Anasia when she fucking Traq
I'm the type to put you down to bring myself up
So when I rape a bitch I hold her down and get my best nut
The reincarnation of '98 Eminem
60 Crip and Grizzly and some RMK Denim
Pay attention I'm stabbing your women friends, like a gentleman
Then dipping with the fucking pen to go sin again
White girl, you can ask her what the dick be like
At monster madness doing drive by's on a fucking fixie bike
Fuck it, moron, snorting oxycontin, wearing cotton
Oxymoron like buff faggots playing sissy dikes
This the shit that get cripple bitches to hop
Dirty crack pipes lit, bullshit to stop, halt
Boss broke, spouse choke, blouse open
Sly's little shop of horrors, now showing
I hate gays, gangbangers and fucking jerkers
Unless it's gay gangbangers, that's fucking jerkers
Whoa yo, yo.. no homo, I'm not gay, faggot

'Cause I was too busy tryna make classics
Boy ain't got no motherfucking classics
What if my music too weird for the masses?
And I'm only known for tweets more than beats or
All my day-ones turn to three, fours 'cause of track seven
Fuck, what if I get stuck?
What if I got comfortable? I gotta keep it buck-fifty
What if I lost it all and ended up back in Ladera
At them shitty apartments that's across from Bank of America?
Damn, I would be hurtin'
Writing all of these songs 'cause Wi-Fi wasn't working
Last year, in total, I put out two verses
But five-seven figures since then, life's kinda perfect
Oh, is it really? Oh, is it really? Bitch, you know the dealy
Really hilly willy tilly silly, hold that billy, how I Milly Rock
When they can't relate him, when they start to hate him
They don't drive these cars, so what's their ultimatum?
Tell me, what's your November? Is it a person?
Mine was the summer, '06, I remember the... 
What if I thought the brake was the gas? What if I crashed?
What if these deep thoughts was my last? Let me pull over, quick
And drive back to November
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, cold water, cold water
Yeah, take me back to November, what's up?
Can we go back to November?
Take me back to November
Hawaiian shirts in the winter, deep thoughts, deep thoughts
Naw, take me back to November, wassup
My November was those Odd Future Sundays, where we used to just skate all day
My November, and I was performing and Lil Wayne rapped with me, I think I cried that night
My November was awesome, I booked my first feature film
My November was when I was gifted this Getz and Gilberto album
My November was seeing Erykah Badu perform
My November was... my brother took me to my first concert ever, which was to Kanye West's "Glow in the Dark..."
My November was summer 2015 when I fell in love with someone who fucked my whole world up, showed me life through a different
2014, Miami 43rd Street, every day was November
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back
I ain't doin' fine, lost my mothafuckin' mind
Time travel back and help me find
Take me back, take me back to November, this I know
Take me back, take me back
Take me back, take me back to November, this I kn—
"My November is right now"
I wrote a song about you, I want your opinion
Opposite of my heart rate, it slows down at the ending
'Cause the love I got for you has exceeded appearance
The lyrics are—
Matter of fact, I'ma just call you, so you can hear it
If you do answer, I'll play it to state facts
Although I already know the response you gon' say back
At that point I'll hang up, disappear and just stay back
And if you don't I'll leave a voicemail with the playback
Hello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the toneRunnin' out of time, runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Runnin' out of time, runnin' out of time
To make you love me
Secrets
Oh, you spin my head around 
I been lookin' for it 
I been runnin' out of spells
To make you love me
Secrets
Keep it up
To make you love me 
Wade in your water 
Your waves wash over me
I drift to the deep end
Don't save, don't save, don't save
It's a low tide 
I found peace in drownin'
Runnin' out of time, runnin out of time, runnin' out of time
Runnin' out of time to make you love me
Livin' in pretend
Keep it a buck fifty, fuck
Are you livin' in pretend?
Are you–
So
Take your mask off
I need her out the picture 
Take your mask off 
Stop lyin' for these niggas
Stop lyin' to yourself
I know the real you
Don't save, don't save, don't save
Halloween ain't for a minute, lose the costume
You need to chill, okay
Been runnin' from the targets and 'em back in the day
And now they working their all, another track out the DAW
Actin' a fool, actin' a ball, we packin' the park, yeah
But I'm still runnin'
Out of time
Of time, of time
Runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta
Of time
Still runnin' outta time
Time
YeahAyo
Let's take it back to them days
Counting sheep on Sadie Hannah's floor
Carpet was my baby mama
80 dollar profit from the coffee I poured
Rent-A-Center calling everyday
Nobody home, they're knocking on the door
Now I skrrt, skrrt, skrrt, skrrt 
In toys I only dreamed that I could afford
Now I roll through Okaga
I ride to California 
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me 
Simp sun shinin' on me 
Slick circles float roll
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, run it
I rock, I roll, I bloom, I grow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I grow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I grow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I grow
Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego
But don't be too cool, you might freeze
Because niggas get stuck in the cold 
Shit weighs a ton
Water your garden, my nigga 
Tell these black kids they could be who they are
Dye your hair blue, shit, I'll do it too 
Look, I smell like Chanel
I never mall grip with my manicured nails
I coconut oil the skin
I keep the top low 'cause the follicles thinnin'
But other than that, man
It feels like I'm winning 
Went from statistic to millionaire
CNN doubted 'cause my skin is dark
Then they forget when I get in my car
These frog oval goggles
I'm leanin' out the window
OJ shinin' on me 
Simp sun shinin' on me
Slick circles roll float
Out this world
Yeah, yeah
Run it, run it, run it, yeah
I glow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I grow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I grow 
I rock, I roll , I bloom, I—
Flower boy T, nigga that's me
Rooted from the bottom, bloomed into a tree
Took a lil' while, nigga makin' leaves
Keep it in my branches so my family can eat
Favorite color green, energy is skrong
Giving niggas life, birdies and the beez
Droppin' them seeds, not what you want
You don't know what I keep in the trunk
Ah, shit!
Ahh, ahh
Ahh
Run it, run it, run it, run it
Run it
Run it
Run itRight now we got some new music only here on Golf Radio!
We're going to dance
And exercise
And have some fun
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time
Boy, I need a Kleenex
How I got this far? Boy, I can't believe it
That I got this car, so I take the scenic
Passenger a white boy, look like River Phoenix
First, happy birthday!
You bitch-ass nigga, yup I'm thirsty
Them little shots that you threw, they ain't hurt me
I ain't fuck with your bitch-ass in the first place
I ain't got time for these niggas
Better throw a watch at the boy
Had my boys in this bitch, looking like a seminar
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time for these bitches
Better throw a clock at these hoes
Have these hoes in this bitch looking for a water hose
Who the fuck you talking to, motherfucker?
Boy, I ain't got time
Nat Turner would be so proud of me
'Cause all these motherfuckers got they style from me
I bet they all looking from the crowd at me
And if I ask them, they would bow at me
But you're a house nigga, so you don't know
How that shit go, with my big lips and my big nose
And my big dick and my short hair
'Cause you already know how slow my shit grow
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Been the man with a pickle plan, niggas know the dill
When I sell the carnival, I bet I get a 100 mil'
Next line will have 'em like "Whoa"
I've been kissing white boys since 2004
One me, two feet, three M's
Four, five, six years ago sucked
Seven figure conversations with Converse finalized
'Cause Vans fucked up
I'ma read commas, you gon' leave comments
Saying what I shoulda did, but you ain't did nada
You ain't important
I'ma keep sporting
All smiles over here
Shout out to The Garden
And I just handle all my business like a chessboard
And at them Golf boys? That's my motherfucking set, boy
Hard pill to swallow like some thick soda
Walk weird 'cause my pockets look like thick Yoda
With a Skywalker, riding 'round solar
Anakin skin Sprite, and my tint cola
Getting neck from abroad like some big shoulders
Till I bust like that 9 in ya heat holster
Everything I say is hot, bitch I speak toaster
And the bread orthodox like I eat kosher
Shout out to  they gave a big loaf of
Green bread, got me chilling like a clean sofa
What's that thick odor?
Young Millie T
A young, focused black boy, oh silly me
Better talk shit
'Cause I'm either in my Cons or my Golf shit
Pants got a lil flood, nigga pipe down
I'm Lil Boosie, Lil Boosie, way I wipe down
 Yeah, right now
'Cause niggas dying every day and I ain't light brown
And i-D ain't wanna give a nigga no post
So I went and did a 12-page spread in Vogue
Listen, man, I'm that boy
All you little niggas clones
Boy I fill that void
You better kill that noise
Turn around and remap route
When they see that boy with them big ears and that gap tooth
Tick, tock
Bitch
Tick, tock
Tick, tock
Fuck, helloDa na na na na, da na na na na
Da na na na na, my baby
You've been on my mind 
I'm losing my mind because
I hope that we can be more than just friends
Fireworks, I feel like glitter
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter 
You're the one that I needed in my life 
You're the one that I needed in my life
Ayo, mirror mirror on the wall, who the brightest of them all?
I never been the darkest one 'cause my self esteem is tall
So I never seen eye-to-eye with y'all niggas, ayo
Uno peso, never paid attention to what niggas gotta say-o
So I keep that buck, I ain't give no fuck
They ain't build me up so I block 'em like Lego
Feelin' glitter, feelin' good and great
Got the burner, got the heat, like wait
Got the shit, it's all up on that hip
I'll use it on myself on the day you dip
Got that 4, 5, 7, track 8 for me
Baby doll, I hope you agree
Because you light my
Fireworks, I feel like glitter 
And every time you come around, I feel like glitter
 You're the one that I needed in my life
 You're the one that I needed in my life
'Cause I love having you around 
'Cause I love having you around
Yeah, look at my face, look at that joy
This is one sided, yeah, I can't lie
We ain't gon' work out, we a fat boy
Yeah, sumo, got it, memo
Pale skin see-through, must be a window
'Cause you ain't an L, could be a DJ
When I see you my heart beat changes tempo
Yeah, simple, that's what I want but I can't
That's who you are but I ain't 
We can track 10 skiptrace, I'm caught in your quicksand, wait
Please don't save me
Ooooh
How ya feel?
How ya feel?
How ya feel?

How ya feel?
We didn't get your message, either because you were not speaking or because of a bad connection
FuckKnock-knock, mothafucks, it's me, Mr. Clusterfuck
What, when, where, how, like who gives a fuck
Golf Wang M-O-B, mopping niggas ante up
Ain't been this fucking sick since brain cancer ate my Granny up
Rest in peace or lie in it, life ain't got no light in it
Darker than that closet that nigga Frankie was hiding in
Open it, dope in it, Bobby where's my fucking pipe?
Dress my little dick as Ike, twenty says I hit your wife
This is life, truthfully I just want to fly some kites
Grab Salem and Slater and go around, riding bikes
Get some ice cream, Golf Wang Roscoe's for the night
To skate around and do annoying shit that older peeps despise
Nigga fuck it though, going hard as riga mo
Got a nigga dollars and a couple cracker kids at shows
Cracked a couple kids in the head with this cast
Had a blast out in Europe, had a Swedish bitch licking toes
That's how it goes, designing clothes
Cats on everything, cats on everything
You think all this money will make a happy me?
But I'm 'bout as lonely as crackers that supermodels eat
Everybody's sparking but me, and I keep coughing
Can't keep calm in this spot's hot box and I'm getting nauseous
Hop in the car, ride to Saugus, and head straight to the office
Pissed off at Jasper because that's some faggot shit called "Pink Dolphin"
I roll here on a mean unicorn
Green hat, Vans, Golf top is the team uniform
Downing that Capri Sun, tighten my bandana up
Something like a lez, I'm forgetting my damn manners cause
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy
When you're alone thoughts start coming in
Punching in that dark lock box and they start rummaging
Shit you've got to battle with, wishing they could skedaddle
But it makes your shadow say none, fun and grab the gun again
I needed to get out of the house
So I hit the Dead Sams, and we went biking it out
In a black hoodie, with an Arizona and a bag of Skittles
Just to see what all that fucking hype is about
Now everytime you see a roach you think of me, ay?
Cause everytime I see one I think what his parents would say
In court saying I ate him, I wasn't present that day
I was with Whitney smoking, sitting at the dock of the bay
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy
Do you know how weird it is knowing I make a bunch of cheese
While my friends can't afford little pizzas from Little Caesars
And their whole goal is to roll up and smoke bowls
So I don't feel bad when they not eating
Wolf Haley got more methods than Pinkman
I'm never civil, fuck Lincoln, 'Preme out the bag it's no wrinkles
I'm okie dokie and loopy and booboo nana and caca
If you think I'm fucking koo-koo, try talking to my shrink then
"Hey..."
"Bitch."
"I'm right here."
"Yo, who's that..?"
"That's Salem, that's my girlfriend. You stay the fuck away from her alright?"
I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboy on my own trip
And I am the cowboyCrack fucked up the world
And I wonder if they realized the damage
I mean, they come from an era
Who made a lot of money off that shit
And I wonder if it fucked with they conscience
It fucked with me being out there, I couldn't stand it
I couldn't stand seeing people fucking theyselves up like that on the shit
And that's where the money came from
48, 48, 48 states I get it in 
48, 48, 48 states I get it in 
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose

Shit's getting warmer, on that corner
Gotta watch out for them 5-0 foreigners
Your mother's a goner
I warned you before you supersized my fries with that dollar
You got a daughter, shit's getting harder
The only thing you wanna bunk her was your freedom
You can't afford to get caught up but you in too deep
And the seashore ain't saw ya
You got a mother, she don't support you
But you bought her a new house cause you love her
Growing up you barely had a roof
Now you got a coupe and it doesn't have a roof
I guess you’re accustomed what you’re used to
So you bought two, nigga
They coming for you, nigga
Niggas be hating I'm doing them bitches
Like Susan and Karen be doing your pockets
And running the man and he's losing his fucking mind
And it’s all an illusion
Who was alludin' all of this potent?
I am the reason your family is using and shooting up
It's my fault
You can, blame me, motherfucker
For killing your aunties and uncles
The hustle and hunger
All I wanted was a cheeseburger
And a little chain, tucked
Didn’t realize this game fucked, up some lives
Oh, how's mine?
My conscience eats it up all the time but, other than that I’m fine
I got a little money in my pocket
48, 48, 48 states I get it in 
48, 48, 48 states I get it in 
They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga

They call me Mr. Treat Your Nose
If you really need some blow, I can get it for the low, nigga
Nigga, we broke as fuck
Homie got a chop shop, I stole that truck
And I sold that dope, motherfuckers hope this nigga go broke
But like my work I give no fucks, I'm sorry 
She could have been a doctor, nigga, I’m sorry 
Could have been an actor and won that Oscar, said I'm sorry
I sold that soul, and I killed black folk, I'm sorry 
But I got a nice car, put my sister through school
While my mama all cool, I'm sorry 
I'm in too deep and I can’t see the shore, I'm sorry
You get addicted to the flip, we used to call it
You get addicted to the flip 
The, the, the, the transaction, the hustling 
Even more than the money, it's just your job 
You feel like it's your duty to be the man in between the man
And make this happen for that person 
And to do this and do that
You become the go to guy, you know, forever
Next thing you know you’re in too deep
Way too deep, it'll scare the shit out of you
You wind up with so much work, that you'd be scared to death
It's important for us to realize man, we gotta get out of that, man
You know, dudes is buying choppers
Shoot down the people that look just like them
Dudes is buying guns to take down each other
Nobody wins, ya know what I mean?Bitch, fuck! 
You have a question?
How many cars can I buy 'til I run outta drive?
How much drive can I have until I run outta road?
How much road can they pave until I run outta land?
How much land can it be until I run in the ocean?
Niggas go with the motions and all the plans
See, I was never into the beaches and all the sands
See, I was in the woods with flowers, rainbows, and posies
Fallin' outta my pocket, but y'all want to know if I swam to cool down
How much cooler can I get until I run out of fans?
How many fans can I have until they turn on the AC?
If the AC blow up, then I'm TNT, I'm gone
I'm gone and I'm finished
And I ain't seen my friends in a minute
Guessing nothing lasts forever
Yeah, nothing lasts forever
Nothing sticks together
Sick of sitting in doubt
Please let me figure this out
Shout out to the girls that I led on
For occasional head and always keepin' my bed warm
And tryin' their hardest to keep my head on straight
And keepin' me up enough 'til I had thought I was airborne
How many raps can I write 'til I get me a chain?
How many chains can I wear 'til I'm considered a slave?
How many slaves can it be 'til Nat Turner arise?
How many riots can it be until them Black lives matter?
Niggas click-clack splatter,  pew that nigga
Life a game of basketball, you better shoot that nigga
'Cause if that cop got trigger, he better pull
'Cause when I get pulled over, I usually play it cool
'Cause I know what I'm drivin' is usually paid in full
And my ego and possessions, will not let me be one 
Because I got a mansion, my mansion got some rooms
Them rooms got some windows and my windows got some views
Them views get some stares and my backyard does too
And if you walk to the bottom you'll prolly see a pool
You better not drown, keep them ten toes up
'Cause if them ten toes down, that mean that you fucked up
And that's what I swim in
And if I drown and don't come back
Who's gonna know? 
And if I crash and don't come back
Who's gonna know? 
And if I fall and don't come back
Who's gonna know? 
I'm wondering if I don't come back
Maybe then I'll know
Don't come back
Don't come back
Ayy, don't come back
Don't come back
No, noI was 16 when we first laid eyes
Scrawny little fucker, yeah, I was that guy
And you was down for the weekend
I was down for the greetings
And you eyes the same color shit that Jasper be chiefing
Couple freckles on ya noses, roses made you blush
Gentleman I was like I wasn't tryna fuck
But it was my first official date so I was stuck, like
It was past curfew, and we was at the Grove
And it was raining, and I had to be home
And then you grab my hand, talking about tryna get home safe or something
All I remember was your motherfucking face
I play in your hair as you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag
You gotta a nigga sprung, whenever I’m holding your hand and
Making eye contact I feel like the damn man
Cause even though I am and get round of applauses
I’m insecure and start to think that I do not stand chance
But, moments, wish that I can own it or lease it or clone it
Cause holding your fingertips is golden
I fucking love you, now treat my palms like a bowling ball and
Grip and keep holding on girl
As you rub on my ears
Then we awkwardly stare until our lips locked
Then we awkwardly stared because our lips locked
Now it's awkward in here because our lips locked
Feels like I’m floating in air
Can't believe that this dare turned into a reality when our lips locked
Man, this feels like a dream because our lips locked
You officially put my feelings inside a Ziploc bag
You got a nigga... Wait
Don't think this is going to work
Things got complicated and a couple feelings got hurt
I haven’t talked to you in a couple of days
I got too comfortable
And started to think that we was really a couple
But hey,  at least there was time spent
But by the time you hear this you won't know what these rhymes meant
But when you realize, its awkward, your name still my password
So I’m always fucking reminded
You got a nigga sprung
You're my girlfriend... You're my girl 
You're my girl... You're my girlfriend, you're my girl girlfriend 
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girl 
You're my girl, you're my girlfriend, you're my girlfriend
You're my girl.. oooo
You're my, you're my Girl
Ooooo girlfriend... girlfriend..
You're my girlfriend you're my girl girlfriend you're my girl
You're my girlfriendDream
Just dream
Long ago, long ago, long ago
Dream
Just dream
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? I've got to kno–
Know
If we can still see each other
Shake your hand, say hi
Long ago, long ago, long ago
I can't stop you, I can't rock too
I've been back there and I can not die too
But I've got to know
Are we still friends? Can we be friends?
Are we still friends? Can we be– 
Are we still friends? Can we be friends? 
Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? Are we still friends?
Are we still friends? 
I said, are we still friends? 
Are we still friends? 
Don't get green skin , keep contact 
Don't say, "Goodbye, smell you later" 
Nah, I can't
I don't want to end this season on a bad episode, nigga, nah
Bouncing off things and you don't know how you fall
Your power is drained, so you cannot go through walls
You're caught in this matrix, don't know where you play it
You hate it, it could be your favorite if you make it your friend
Are we still friends? 
Are we still friends? 
Are we, are we, are we, are we still friends?
Oh woah
Can't say goodbye 
Can't say goodbye, goodbye So, you tell me that everything just isn't going well
Well, first off...
My only problem is death
Fuck heaven, I ain't showing no religion respect
Brain damage, therapy's the only thing I regret
Talking to me is like a fucking body missing a neck
But, I'm surprised I ain't pop off my top off
Life is a bitch and my cock's soft, the Glock's cocked
My hands tremble, my finger slipped, the wall's red
Her life is fucked, she's sad now, her son is dead
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems
When I was younger, I would smile a lot
I'm getting older, getting bolder, but a wiser top
Now I'm drunk driving, lap's full of Budweiser tops
Life is a movie and you're just a prop
They begged me to stop, but I listen like deaf drums
Love? I don't get none, that's why I'm so hostile to the kids that get some
My father called me to tell me he loved me—
I'd have a better chance of getting Taylor Swift to fuck me
Annoying and I'm ugly, most niggas wanna punch me
I'm surprised the fucking doctor even touched me
Feel like Humpty, you hoping that I'll fall? Fuck y'all
I'm Ace, I'm parentless, odd, kinda arrogant
Ignorant as fuck, offend people for the hell of it
Because I am the devil, fucker, get on my level
Doughnuts and keys and kick-flips, Supremes and markers
My life is Ms. Mon-unique Parker, but a little darker
I'll see you in a couple, OF
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your daydreams, that's how death seems
Tyler, here's some water, man. You seem a little tense. How's Thebe?
All because a nigga just don't give a fuck
Parents wanna blame me all because their kid is fucking up
But fuck that, you're a shitty parent, face it, suck it up
That's what you should've did before that nigga bust, huh
Feel like I missed my little brother growing up
Feel like my little brother missed his brother growing up
But this is Golf Wang, like he missed his family growing up
I got a little taller since the last time you seen me, bruh
Now I'm emo, so fuck it, I'm pouring up
But I never had a drink— 
My nigga Jasper said if I drink and get drunk enough
I won't feel the feelings I be feeling when I'm sobered up
But that's a fucking lie, why would he say that? I'm
As emotionally straight as Travis when he--
Don't look at me, I'm 6'5", about to fucking cry
About another guy, but this is Golf Wang, do or die
I finally had a family
Domo's in another state, and where the fuck is Riley?
Now you niggas wanna be nice because the labels wanna sign me
But before the co-signing and you fuckers couldn't find me?
Fuck that! I hope you die in a fiery death
One ear I got kids screaming, "O.F. is the best"
The other ear I got Tron Cat, asking where the bullets and the bombs at
So I can kill these levels of stress, shit
They say that I'm shock value
How about you hop off cock and turn volume down?
I haven't got around to telling my mom shit 
Cause I don't know how to...
All I want is her support, but no, it's the fights at home
When mommy cusses out cousin, some knifes get shown
Now she's really fuckin' pissed, so the knives get thrown
And hit her in her fucking neck, now her throat's all gone
Looking like a fucking monster from the Twilight Zone
Then they wonder why I stay at Travis' pad with a backpack
For the whole week, full of plastic-wrapped black tees
And deodorant like his house is my home
I could live with the same hat
And the same flat-screen TV watching Flapjack
And the same bacon and waffles on a nice Saturday
Where I skate with the same fucking friends that
Didn't give a fuck about fame or a name, oh
"Message from The GZA, oh, another one from Plain Pat"
Email full of emails, I never write back
Ain't kill myself yet, and I already want my life back
I told her I'm her worst nightmare
This is hell, you don't ever gotta fight fair
My spirit floats around in the night air
Or in your day dreams, that's how death seems
One shot, two shots, one gun, two cops
I'm going in flu shots, couldn't kill me with two top rockers
You're on the side of faggots and cock blockers
I'm on the side of bad-ass kids and the top notches
I'm Barney, dinosaur Harley of a human
Cause I'm shrooming with the bangers and the carneys
You niggas can't harm me cause y'all know that
We at the fuckin' Dirty like it's laundry 
Nigga, get off me
Fuck off me man, fuck 
I don't know, it's like I'm a different person at times
Sometimes I'm fucking mad, sometimes I'm not 
It's like I got a fucking voice in my head
Telling me to do all this fucked up shit, man 
I don't fucking know, man 
He tells me to do this shit, that I don't wanna fucking do 
Tron CatI'm not crazy, I'm a fuck—ohh, shit!
Floopy goober, motherfucker 
Hey, man, god damn, hey, bro
They ain't ready for what we 'bout to bring back!
They ain't ready for Tyler with the green hat!
Ugh, fuck it
They ain't ready for the WANG$AP, niggas!
I—I'mma rap this next verse
Fuck is niggas talkin' 'bout, nigga?
Yo
We gon' die legends!
I hope you stackin'
I hope you puttin' some money to the side, my nigga
And payin' your taxes 
I hope you not incriminatin' you and your niggas
On songs if you trappin'
I hope you dressin' yourself
And not followin' niggas opinions on fashion
I hope them cars that you drivin' ain't rented
Just to get some comments on 'Gram
Oh, shit, they are, because you not the man
Low self-esteem, hide it in lean 
Xan every meal
You fuckin' weak, and you robbin' your plug? 
You ain't got no plan, but I'm not here to judge
'Cause apparently you're doin' your thing
Talk your shit, Young Nigga! Woo!
I know they see me
Your pants got a flood, a little bit Katrina
Oh you wearin' Vans and Supreme this season?
Stop lyin' to yourself, nigga, me the reason
AHH! Right now, nigga
Ugh, right now
A little gooey with some nice sounds huh
This little groupie want the pipe now yeah
She eatin' coochie, kinda dyke now, ugh
Got a new dirt bike, wow
And it match the go-kart, go skrrt! now 
I really want the La Ferrari, but shit 
Can't you lower the price down?
Fuck right now
Ayy! Ayy!
Fuck right now
Woo! God! Ayy
Ayy right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Go right now, nigga
What the fuck right now!
Bite down, nigga, here we go!
'Cause I'm not one 
When it come to a vision, they ain't got one 
Rolling Stone never gave me a cover, so...
Um...  So I shot one! 
I ain't do college , I said fuck them lessons 
I ain't join no gang, I said fuck them weapons 
Grabbed the keyboard, Clancy crossed my path 
Cashed my first check and said "Fuck depression, nigga!"
Nigga what you scared for? 
Everybody lean, everybody gang though 
Nigga you a new slave, I'm an old one
Thanks to Ben Yang, still walk around with chains on 
Like you ain't seen no shit like mine 
You ain't seen no dick like mine
Nahhh—pause
What the, what the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? 
What the fuck right now? 
What the fuck right now? 
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? 
What the fuck right now?
What the fuck right now? 
Told you dickheads I'ma go nuts 
Niggas told me to grow up 
So I matured to a V10 
I'm in a vacant lot doin' donuts 
There go my ego, Leggo my Eggo
Never sip syrup, shout my nigga Scooty
Y'all don't want beef, let us know he can eat that bread
Cause he pushin' that mayo, fuego 
Respect when you see him
Boy, last album was a musical museum
Somethin' always lost with you niggas like Liam
Neeson, boy, you better run 
Here I come, snortin' glitter, portrait pictures
I don't run with many cause their walk is bitter
Niggas mad at T, where the tall freckled white boys at?
'Cause I don't fuck with niggas 
That's not my homie, that's not my whoadies 
That not my team, nigga, they're benchwarmers 
I am a stormer, I am a trooper 
I am a Koopa, bet it lost its value as soon as I moved it
I run the business, I do not got time for niggas' opinions
They fuckin' stupid, don't need 'em, don't want 'em
I drop 'em, they're deadweight, them niggas useless
Neck heavy like mothafuckin' bad news 
Thanks to Ben Baller, walkin' with a hunchback
I got a new white one that I worked hard for
So the doors on my car doin' jump-jacks 
My big bro Frankie got a Porsche 
My little brother Taco got a Bimmer
If you see 'em around me, they eatin'
We all good, it's like FEMA, but of course
Get money, nigga! Get money!
All you funny lookin' niggas, back the fuck up!
Ayy, ayy, ayy, man
Um, oh, I wanted to add this
I sit in room with a to-do list, pro-
Ceed to do and play acoustics, you
Sit around and look at me feelin' foolish
Rollin' up and make excuses, fucking losers
Jesus, damn man
Fuck them niggas! Ayy man, ayy man!
What the fuck right now!
Ayy I just got one mothafuckin' question
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas wanna look like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these hoes wanna fuck a nigga like you now?
What the fuck right now!
Why the fuck these niggas frontin' like niggas ain't been invented the swag they runnin' with?
Why the fuck is niggas actin' like niggas ain't the originators of this shit?
Man, I tell these niggas they can die and suck a dick!
How was that?
Cool?Oh, I don't need the metronome, bro
Ayy
Kahn-da-muh duh-cay
When you wanna be, ahh
When you eat all the cheese
In the store, in the store, in the store
In the store, yeah, yeah yeah
Alright
She lives next door
To the store that I loiter at
We talk every night, she cry to me about her guy
And if we text I get pissed when I get no reply
I know that she's the key to love
She is who I'm thinking of when I am beating Richard up
To mental images—her face look
The closest that I got was when I'm poking her on Facebook
Video chats are so exciting
'Cause it's like she is inviting me to her world full of privacy
I'm getting gassed up, I think she's liking me
She's gullible and I just wanna take it like a pirate 
I see her in class
Not really, two doors down, but anytime that I pass
To take a piss in a stall, I picture us in the hall
Locking lips on the wall, her hand grabbing my dick
My left hand on her tits, ah, my shit's getting hard
From thoughts of dating this bitch
Her name is my password, fuck
All my niggas got they bitches and stuff
But all the bitches they fuck are known as bitches and sluts
And she's special, I know to y'all, I come off as rough
But I'm the nicest to her, and I just want to concur
A relation: I want the cheesy dates at the movies
And stupid walks at the beach, and sharing straws in a cup
I never had that, so when we holding hands walking home
I look past that, the fact that she's fucking guys that I hate, but
Things are looking great, cut copy
Last time we talked, she said that her relationship was rocky 
Now that Mr. Faggot's gone, there's no one that can stop me
From bagging her, I got these tickets to the Roxy
Next day, metro's taking me home
I see her in the cut at Wendy's; she's not alone 
Who's that guy? Wait, why the fuck he 'bout to kiss her? 
Come to find out she got back with her nigga
Fuck
Another one
It's not the first time
She's so pretty
Fuck self-pity, I feel so shitty
I wanna text her in a jealous rage
But if she reply to say anything, I'ma smile, I know
What do I do with myself?
Sit in my room for some days?
Play Xbox with piles full of wet socks? Fuck that
My nigga ask, "Ace, what happened to such-and-such?"
I could slander her name, and then tell him I probably fucked 
Or I could tell him the truth and just say she ain't like me much
But instead, I lie and say she moved to Nebraska
But she's not mineSee, um, heavy feelings for you, yeah, yeah, it's no secret
You too cool for me and I ain't tryna freeze up
Like the Johnsons, nonsense, I would speak up
And realize there's more fish in the sea, I'ma re-up
Like, bitch, I know my shit is bumping, it's eczema
So I won't walk around with my head down like I got beat up
Um, you do you, I'll do me, I’ll just chuck the peace up
I ain't tryna keep up, because
I don't love you anymore 
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
But this just might be better for us, you know?
Where did time go, I need location
That's all that I know, I, I, I, I
Where did time go?
But now, movin' on, but how?
Uh, somethin' put my feelings in the lost and found
Now I'm stuck forever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever, and ever
And ever, and ever
Forever, and ever, and ever
I don't love you no more
Tell me where to go
Can I have my heart back? 
I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore
'Cause I don't love you anymore 
'Cause I don't love you anymore
But this just might be better for us, you kn-Geek, fag, stupid loser, find a rope to hang
I'm not bipolar, see I'm just known by those couple names
I wanna tell my pops but shit, he'll probably say the same
Fuck...
Hated by everyone, that's the way it seems
I don't know what's shorter, his damn temper or my self-esteem
I sit in my room and I listen to tunes, I'm amused alone
Cause none of the cool kids would let me join a team
Depression's on the stalk again
My best friend's an inhaler because it will not let me cough
Whenever I am losing oxygen, bully hand around my neck
Cause he felt disrespected when I decided to talk again
I brought that on myself, see I should know my place
But not at lunchtime, see I know better than to show my face
Around them, but the day I do it'll be everywhere
When I share these feelings finally they gon' fucking care
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga
Murder, murder, m-murder the last they heard of you
Was when I... "uh" with all them burners, you
Think that I'm some punk bullied bitch who ain't gon' trouble you
Well, I'm gonna burst your bubble two times if you don't mind
Umm "Who are you again?" I'm Samuel and that's Tyler
We came to get wild and style in these trench coats!
Don't start asking what's packing in these trench coats!
Just know if you start acting, I'm grabbing for these trench coats!
My step-father called me a fag
I'll show him a fag, and I'll light a fire up in his ass
And recently them assholes been fucking with me in class
So I'ma keep them muhfuckers there and make sure they pass huh
My prom date, she dismissed my offer
So I'mma  her and toss her in the principal's office
Oh, now you wanna conversate with me try to be my friend?  Don't worry, you'll probably never see them again
Grab a couple friends, start a couple riots
Crash a couple-
Gather all the bullies, crush them motherfuckers
Odd Future hooligans causing up a ruckus
It's us, nigga
I said it's us, nigga
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum bum bum bum bum
Bum. bum. bum. burumrumrumrum bum bum bum
Bum bum bumbumbumbum, hehe
We are the Sams, and we're dead -- it's just four of us
We come in peace, we mean no harm, and we're inglorious
We took their heads but we just took back what they took from us
I guess we lost ours
Music had nothing to do with my final decision
I just really wanted somebody to come pay me attention
But nobody would listen, but stuffed animals that I had
Since I was a kid but I'm growing up so they're missing
I didn't mean to hurt anybody, I'm sorry
I wouldn't hurt a fly or consider joining the Army
I'm hardly ever angry, Roger Rabbit framed me
Momma I'm the same fucking kid that you made, see?
I don't wanna go to jail, I just wanna go home
And I want them fucking kids at school to just leave me alone
And I... I hear helicopters, make ‘em dip
I'm fucking reloaded -- I told you all that I ain't taking shit
You better back up before this Mac start to lift up
I'll pump it like my inhaler when asthma begin to act up
The difference between us and our class is tan khakis
I got 99 problems and all of them's being happyShit
My mother warned me that some niggas ain't my right hand
To trust her, only my heart and that elder white man
His name is Clancy, I fancy him, gotta give him props
He half the reason why dealerships even let me cop
So now I'm speedin' and tryna drive away from the fact
That she was right, so I triple left, tryna double back
The streets are filled with some clues like how I ain't notice that? 
Fuck it, I seen some familiar stuck in the cul-de-sac
I pull up, get out, what up? I wanna help
But what you want for some, some niggas
Really don't want for themself
Now do I stay? Do I go? That's my dilemma
And traffic is picking up, if I don't leave I'ma get stuck 
So I speed off, we talk barely and it seems awkward
And I heard through some words that you're off it
I got too much drive, don't wanna steer off path
And crash and get distracted
But I listen to that weather man 'cause it might rain
Keep my windshield wipers prepared
'Cause y'all throw so much shade
And I got jacket in trunk, but that's in the front
I also got power for both of us if you're ever in need of jump
Just let me know, my nigga
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em 
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Snakes in the grass, but I walk
I got some new boots, on the back it says GOLF
So I be prepared for their bites, they're all talk
I left the condom in the grass so fuck off
Watchin' Clarence in a mansion with nobody in it
Young successful nigga, ride McLaren with no windows tinted
I drive by piggies when I'm in it 'cause it feels amazin'
The irony is I stopped eatin' bacon
Don't get it twisted, nigga, I'm still hungry, oh he lonely
All my friends talk about their hoes and tenderonies
But all I can show 'em is a couple cars and more things
That I've made in the couple past month, he's on, please
Everyone is a sheep, me, a lone wolf
Nobody gon' make a peep 'cause everyone wants some wool
Since everyone is a sheep, not everyone here is cool
Man I'd rather drown in a pool by myself
Than fuck with their fleece
See, man, T-Man fans be seesaw
Wind blows, they go, which way, who knows?
One day, "Fuck no," the next day, "Okay"
But fuck y'all, I know that T is four for four
I just want that garden and that Batmobile
Good health, success, time on earth worthwhile
Find somebody who love me and raise a couple of lizards
But my vehicle's good for now, that's in a couple of miles
Now keep it pushin', nigga
I had to switch gears on 'em
Fishtail in the rearview mirror on 'em 
I had to switch gears on 'em
You know, swerve, left turn, steerin' wheel on 'em
Nigga that's a pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Look out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Watch out for the pothole, watch out for the pothole
Fuck, okay, next one
Do-do-do-do-do-do
Gotta watch out for the potholes
Ooh, said watch out for the potholes
HahaOh, shit 
Three icy ass niggas from Odd Future doin' some crazy shit 
By the way, we do punch bitches, huh
I'm a swagging, bitch , I'm iced out 
Oh, you mad, bitch?  'Cause I'm laying on the couch 
Smoke a blunt, fuck a bitch in the butt, I'm bossing

Got the bops in the house, socking bitches in they mouth 
See my neck? Iced the fuck out 
She at the fucking mall, forty bitches on my nutsack
I pulled up on a mothafuckin' unicorn 
Wolf Gang, nigga
Scream that 'til they motherfucking show me death
Golf Wang, nigga
Free Earl, better show some motherfucking respect
All this ice around my neck, all this ice around my dick
Gun to her head, make your bitch massage my shoulders
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick 
My bitch suck dick like  she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick 
Shut up, bitch , suck my dick 
You fucking bop , you better swallow it
I got a chain with a fuckin' platinum plaque on it
Is that a hundred dollar bill? I'll shit on it
I bought a fucking whale, 'cause I'm ballin' 
Your bitch work for me, she my dick washer
Swag on my dick, 30 thousand million, nigga
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick
My bitch suck dick like she suck dick 
You bopping, bitch,  you like this dick?
We all know why, 'cause you's a boppin' bitch 
I got the burner, I pop you in your lip 
Zoom-zoom, yeah, I'm going fast, bitch
I'm loud as fuck , I'm ignorant 
Punch a bitch in her mouth just for talkin' shit
You lurking, bitch? Well, I see that shit
Once again, I gotta punch a bitch in her shit
I'm icy, bitch, don't look at my wrist 
Because if you do , I might blind you bitch 
Mount Everest ain't fucking with my fucking wrist
Fuck global warming, this the Ice Age, bitch 
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Swag, swag, punch a bitch
Yo, yo, Jasper, Taco, y'all my niggas, man
I love y'all niggas, I'm sorry
Ow! What the fuck?!Got all the black bitches mad 'cause my main bitch vanilla
She tryna get her groove back like Stella, grab the umbrella
When it comes to your perception of my shit, I'm Helen Keller
When it comes to the perfection of my shit, I know you smell the
Rectum, I'm like a chromosome, I always X 'em
Like Wolverine's stepson, attacking a deadly weapon
I'm opening a church to sell coke and Led Zeppelin
And fuck Mary in her ass
Haha, yo
I'm fucking Goldilocks up in the forest
In the three-bear house eating their motherfucking porridge
I tell her it's my house, give her a tour
In my basement, and keep that bitch locked up in my storage
Rape her and record it, then edit it with more shit
Octopussy, special effect, the wet bitches be banging
And please never disrespect my set
With Canons hanging from our necks like it's a motherfucking circus
You little niggas better 
You getting money? Better 
What time is it, huh? 
If you got my shit, you better check my French 
I'm making moves 
I speak English, but 
Your ho be on my penis, she 
Bitch
I guess I left my dignity up in the cupboard
'Cause every girl I'm digging
When I'm digging in her pussy I'm never using 
But fuck it, I guess I got to stretch it out like it was flubber
And leave it dripping green and red like double cheeseburgers
Chewing on cum like bubble gum from Hubba
This bitch knew dick like Bubba knew shrimp 
Yeah
Yo, I'm seventeen, already sniffing blow
I tell my friends it's asthma every time I start to itch my throat
I got a new show for MTV, "Pimp My Boat"
Because some bitch said my semen was dirty, that silly ho
The most that they can do is fine me, I'm hiding
Somewhere where Chris Stokes can't find me
"Oh no, Mr. Stokes, I don't like misters, no"
Don't tell R. Kelly where my little sister go
You little niggas better 
You getting money? Better 
What time is it, huh? 
If you got my shit you better check my French 
I'm making moves 
I speak English, but 
Your ho be on my penis, she 
Bitch
Yo, you little niggas better check my French
I got all stars and you can check my bench
Left Brain, Super 3, Creator Ace
Put expressions in their music and create the face
Of the picture, punchline, figured out, "Ahh, I get you"
No, you don't, nigga, so why don't you go and figure?
You seem confused anyway, pressured enough?
You the type to do the choke when the pressure is up
The pressure is the pump, and the pressure is us
Bitches having eargasms, and the pleasure is us
Niggas wanna be O.F. and write letters to us
Competition's competition, yo, you better than us?
Digest what I'm saying? I don't think so
We sick shit, throw it up down in the sink, yo
These Odd niggas are beginning to spill these pink flows
We think sorta odd, so we think so
Crusing in my go-kart at Walmart selling cupcakes
Go 'head, admit it, faggot, this shit is tighter than butt rape
That involve Ballpark Franks and silver duct tape
Pornos and hormones and boxes of DiGiorno
You homos is loco, you're probably drinking Cuervo
With some vatos with the door closed watching Zorro
You homos
O.F.
Yes
So, are you dating anyone right now? You know, or...
No, I'm just playing the field, just for now
Ah, so... I'm guessing she's white, since she's "vanilla"
HahaLeft Brain, Wolf Haley
Golf Wang, Free Earl, uh
Goddamn I love women
Daydream about penis being in 'em
Meet them with a big grin with a Mac-10
Rope, katana, and then I skin 'em
All beige suit made out of white women
With the red lipstick, dancing to John Lennon
With the red splattered jeans made out of blue denim
They can catch me in the spot where the sun don’t shine
Bitch don’t mind me, shake your hiney
The only motherfucking Wolf here that spit venom
You’re a bad bitch with a real good kitten
And I got the appetite of them fat black women
Wolf Gang in this bitch with a bunch of rats with 'em
Lookin' like the holocaust with Supreme hats with 'em
I am tryna get Miss Piggy by the motherfucking hairs of her chinny chin chin
Umm, what’s that? The cock of a black dude
Mad cause his daughter got the swag of a vacuum 
I’ll take her to the back room dungeon, fighting and punching
And now the slut is under the fucking assumption
That I will be fucking and munching her muffin
Cunt will be bleeding, but that’s not from the time signature of the month, umm
 I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
 I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick
Goddamn I love bitches
Especially when they only suck dick and wash dishes
Cook and clean and grant my wishes
And make me and the Wolf Gang sandwiches
Transylvania crypt let's take a, tour
Bitch try getting through that black trap, door
Keep yelling and working them vocal chords
And that’ll be more of a reason that you'll get slapped up, for
Is that Ford trunk's comfy? 
Fuck me? No, fuck Buffy
That little bitch keeps trying to hunt me
Jumping over gates, what the fuck she want from me?
She keeps sending me garlic
How many times I gotta tell her I’m allergic
 Oh this Bathing Ape cape?
Bitch, I got it for a bargain at the neighborhood Target
Fangs are sharp and I hope you know
That all I really want from you is that throat
I can’t eat pussy cause I might leave cuts
Then there’s blood on my sheets, but that might be a plus
On the channel, a fucking animal, leaking like pairs of candles
Bitch, is it hard to handle?
I don’t want a bride, I just want bone marrow
 I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shit
'Til I grab them throats and start smacking them shits
 I’m Dracula bitch
Don’t got a problem smacking a bitch
Kidnapping, attacking, with axes and shits
'Til she decides to take Dracula’s dick
Bite her in her fucking neck, bite her in her fucking neck
Bottom of the fucking lake, bottom of the fucking lake
Call my gang of wolves and bats, call my gang of wolves and bats
It’s a full moon tonight, and these hoes ain’t acting right
It’s because I’m Dracula bitch, 
It's because; Left Brain, Wolf Haley, Free Earl, Golf Wang...Slip it in her drink, and in the blink of an eye
I can make a white girl look chink
Don't know what to think, 'cause last time I attempted this shit
The judge ordered me to see a shrink
Started with the link
Contended her to meet me at the local Odd Future Wolf Gang skating rink
We was uniquely in sync
Already fuckin' and we only met last week
We were both young, not yet antique
So her mindset was working for my technique
Tell her that I love her and by next week
You can hear her shriek from the gashes in her cheeks
No, I'm not a freak, I am meekly a creep
The neighbors by the creek says my house stinks
And it reeks on the sheet, girl
Streaks of red, even though all pussy is pink
Oblivion makes obvious seeks
Which make meats for my obvious feasts
Used to just blot up thoughts, plot, and rethink
Now I get daughters and tie 'em and clink
Got my dick harder than iron and zinc
Now they just rot up, arms caught in the sink
Where they get cut up to fit my physique
Critique my chic in this brand new mink, go
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh 
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, ohh 
 Oh, oh 
 Oh, ohh 
Bitches running 'round down, pussy take a trip
Make her strip, got my dick harder than the unzip
Tyler swiftly slips his dick inside of Taylor Swift's slit
Round trip in that pussy, here comes a ticket
Film clips popping on that Canon
Busting Ottoman cannons, on the pill
Is he real? Gaza stripping 
Wolf Gang full moon, I'm assuming mushrooms 
I'm a necrolampoon, not of Charles Mansoon
This fuck is ending soon because I'm ejaculating
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ohh 
Oh, oh
Oh, ohh
]
Now I'd like to take this time of day
To thank the Mother Earth 
Letting the sun shine down on the lake
While I fish your waters
Ooh, hide your daughters, hide your sisters
Hell, hide grandmama too 
'Cause the fisherman's raping everybody in the pool
He on the loose, yeah 
Got to wash it down, all this gold is fuckin' bait
Wait 'til you see the semen swimming
Baby, please not half, the whole is great
Morals? Your body's near that coral reef
It was once upon a time you came home with me
Then the next chapter left you in my teeth
Fill your gills with goo
Going deeper than Pacific Ocean
This specific motion
Makes this hammerhead puke
Got to wear a wetsuit, can’t get seasick
I love when you're in fishnets, you want me to eat you
You’re fucking wet, fish
So I met this girl at the club
And I just wanted her to suck my dick
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she's drunk and talkin' to me a lot
Until we go to another room
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin'
This little slut whore sucks cock for a little more bucks
Than them other sluts fuck for, real easy
Cause I didn't even knock on the front door, sleazy
I used the welcome mat as a cum rag
And all the Wolves fucked too, yeah she’s a cum bag
Filled with a bunch of shit I purchased at a drug store
Four more Dora-looking sluts let me explore
Until my cock got sore and started growing cold sores
Now she thinks that I like her
But all I really wanted was that mouth
And that's 'cause
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch
Now she text messages me every day
And I don't ever hit that bitch back
And that's because
She a boppin' bitch, she a boppin' bitch , she's a boppin' bitch, she's a boppin'
This little hoodrat started jockin' at my jock strap
Until my uncircumcised penis finally unwrapped
Flapping up and down until the cack finally go splat
Now you gotta spat, spit it out until you do scat
Then you gotta sat and shit it out, bitch, fuck your feelings
You wasn’t feeling shit when you was down there kneeling
Now shut the fuck up you got another dick to deal with
Now, now why can't we fuck with this bitch? 
Wait, tell him why we can’t fuck with this bitch, y'all? 
What is she? She a BB, what does that stand for? 
She, what do she be doin'? 
Now I'm at a fuckin' clinic
'Cause my dick is swollen and keeps itchin'
Nigga, I'ma kill this bitch 
Bitch 
She a boppin' bitch
Where's my gun?  I'ma kill this bitch
Why am I gon' kill this bitch?
To all my niggas out there listenin', that bitch 
And don't let her suck your dick or you'll get hurtYou are a whore, you are a whore 
Fuck you, fuck you, fuck you, fuck him
Fuck everything else I can see
I know, fuck you I hate you so fucking much
I know you think I'm crazy
'Cause I think you’re a fucking fag
"Sam, the music sounds good, man! You've been practicing?"
"Thanks"
"Sam, this is Wolf. He's new here."
"What's up, dude?"
"Wolf, this is Sam. Sam and his band have been here at Flog Gnaw for a while. Sam's gonna show you around while I fill out these last minute field trip slips, alright? Now you guys have fun"
"So, you guys are into jazz?"
"Look. Wolf, Prairie Dog, Ronzell—whatever the fuck your name is. We don't fuck with you or anybody else here, alright? You stay the fuck out of our way and we'll stay out of yours, capisce?"Tyler, you... obviously have some fucking problems
And, this—, this is... this is the end of this session, let's... anything else you've gotta say?
Mom is getting jealous, I see my manager more
Than I see her before I go on tour and it hurts 
I miss the days when this was fun, but now it turned into work
And getting legal, so I gotta watch the shit that I blurt out
As you should, that shit's outrageous
My friends are turning into opposites
Because my life is turning into opposite of sloppy wrist
And all the bitches who forgot about me want to ride my dick
Harder than the white kids who copy shit
Ending it is all I fucking think about, that's the shit I think about
All alone, bawling 'til my muhfuckin' eyes bleed
See, he's a leader in person and smile, shit gets disgursting
When there's no person around, talking discussion shit, man, fuck
I'm here to talk to you
I'm putting myself at a distance
For instance, my best friend is now my fucking assistant
Who, Travis?
Niggas saying "Free Earl" without even knowin' him
See, they're missing a new album, I'm missing my only friend
You have everyone around you
You have thirty meetings a day
I don't see what it is
I mean, you—you act like you don't have anyone to talk to
I'm here for you, I'm your friend
When I say "Odd," y'all say "Future!"
Odd... Uh-uh, nah, that shit's corny as fuck
Fuck!
You're doin' good, you have a cult following
You're—"Yonkers"...
Tch—To these white kids?
Oh, my gosh
Charbroiled nigga on these dark beats
Nauseous with the Nazi, but it's normal what the cops see
Awesome at his concert, but he never had a pop, see
Mommy was a living single queen with a La-ti
So while my wallets piling with symbolic-colored paper
I lace her, 'cause she gave me such a lot at such a young age
20, why didn't she get that abortion?
Probably cause that motherfuckin embryo was morphing
Into a Grammy-winning, schizophrenic, fucking orphan
Oops! I mean, bastard, skinny-ass disaster
Mom works hard, still working on her masters
Son lies about taking classes at community college
Just to record some bullshit he calls Bastard 
Start a fucking cult, clash his talents in a brash way
Before he even had a mustache and cash
And all I got was a fucking shitty article in Thrasher
All right, just calm down
That ain’t shit, man
Now, don’t—don’t—don’t make yourself feel guilty
That—that article was great...
No, fuck that, nigga
You're beating yourself up and you're living the fucking life right now, kid!
When I was your age, I would have loved to be fucking doing the things that you're doing right now
Fuck that, fuck all this shit!
You—You—You act like I’m not here
You're not!
I'm exactly who you’re supposed to be talking to
You don’t fucking help me with shit!
You don’t help me with shit! Fuck!
Yeah, you get... that—that—who wouldn’t do that?
Fuck you! Fuck, you!
Who wouldn’t—who wouldn't shoot their friend?
Old fucking fuck!
That’s fine, it’s not your fault
I killed my fucking friends! Fuck!
Fuck! I didn't fucking sign up for this shit!
I'm—I'm not fucking crazy—I'm a fucking table! I'm a fucking table!
No, fuck this shit!
Tyler, calm down!
I'ma grab the Nina  and find a nice arena
'Cause I can’t even choose between Ortega or Sabrina
Get security in here
And I’m not even human, I’m a body-shaped demon
With some semen in my sack, and some problems in the back
Calm the fuck down!
And a life that’s fill with crap, and a finger filled with hate
And a gat that’s filled with love, now let opposites attract
I can finally be one  like a marriage in a church
But this marriage has a hearse
And the parents of the one that’s getting married has a curse
And it’s made up inside of him
Too late to reimburse but, wait, it gets worse!
All the guests that’s in the church all decided to disperse 
So there was nobody who could stop the wedding with converse You don't want to do this...
So they tied the knot
Now it’s too late to reverse this arrangement
Yes, it is!
And the nurse is amazed at the hurt that he was pained and
Calm the fuck down!
But it was obvious in all the photos he was painting
Now, a bunch of whispering immerse...
Yeah, he's right there, security's right there
Shit! No! Get away from me! 
And then the nurse blurts... 
What the fuck is his problem?
Here, we have two doses to give him, here
Why didn’t anybody ask him first?
Hold him down
I’ve been asking you this whole time, Tyler
Get the fuck away from me! Get away from me!
Because nobody gave a fuck
Get the fuck off of me...
Someone gave a fuck, Tyler, and, uh...
The person that gave a fuck was me
See, you’re not going crazy...
It’s me
I’m your best friend, Tyler
I know everything, I know everything about you
You’ve been helping yourself this whole time
Your friends? They’re just figments of your imagination
Dr. TC... See, Tyler, I’m your conscience
I’m Tron Cat...
I’m Ace...
I’m Wolf Haley...
I’m...
MeI'd tell him to eat a dick quicker than Mexicans sprint over borders
I give a fuck like a quarter with 20 cent
At Hamptons with Fred Hampton relaxing at Happy Camper
It's the fucking financial aid at Hamptons wasn't relaxing, I'm taxing
"Fuck 'em all!"'s what I'm chanting, don't complain, I'm just ranting
Fuck ranking, I'm the best, I'm the champion's chariot
I'm a liar like Carrey in Liar Liar
I'm dirtier than the sheets in the Marriott, cable guy like Larry
Peter Pan in my youth, fucking fairies
I'm using my tooth bait to get that bitches teeth paste
Fuck it, Odd Future some Nazis, black Nazis don't copy
We perfect, you sloppy, hotter than Saki Takei
Fuck a label on my jacket, screw you like a ratchet
Screw you like a black teen on Judge Hatchett
Hang with thrashers and jackers, drug dealers and crackers
AP students and slackers, I'm backwards
Like Jermaine Dupri in '93, escaping from concentration camps
With a fucking girl board and a ramp
That I ordered from CCS with some diamonds that's VVS
Like I went to Sierra Leone in a homecoming dress
With some matching pink panties, lipstick from my granny
Sup on my hat like that motherfucker friendly
White red-headed bitch reminded me of Annie
She dino like my state of mind, so yeah she understand me
Fuck You Bunch is here, never disrespect my family
That’s for my little brother, sister, cousin and my auntie
Wasted fucking youth? All you old niggas antiques
We go skate, rape sluts and eat donuts from Randy
Bitches like Tia Landry watching Billy and Mandy
Motherfuckers wanna be Odd but you can't be
Sit the fuck down all you old niggas stand me, faggot
I guess I got to be a fucking hand-me-down rapper
From Los Angee area anytime I'm fucking landing
Fuck 2DopeBoyz and NahRight
Shout out to Hype Trak, them motherfuckers could never get rid of me
Guess I gotta do a fucking song with Dom Kennedy
Get these fucking hip hop bloggers to start feeling me
Because I'm seventeen, compose my own beats
Lyrically I'm dope enough to ass-fuck the dude who made nicotine
Maybe I should buy some Hundreds, wear some fucking skinny jeans
And follow in your footsteps like a motherfucking millipede
Centipede, make songs about Gucci and ciga-weed
Jerk with my freshmen like it's some motherfucking little league
No, I'm not no fucking hipster, mister
No, I'm not no fucking Kid Cudi, all my fucking fans love me
Collaboration hits for fans screaming fuck buddies
Yo, yo
I'm driving in a stolen truck, and I'm probably fucking drunk
Wasted as fuck, can't walk it out, DJ Unk 
My nose is filled with coke and my license is revoked
 Who the fuck told me not to spoke?
Fuck everybody here, everybody vanished
I'm managed, hop off my dick and make a fucking sandwich
Everybody listening can suck my dick in Spanish
Fuck you, faggot 
Yeah, um, as you can probably tell from listening to this record
I was, I was probably angry, probably on my period
But um, I didn’t mean to offend anyone
Alright, I'm lying
OFTyler, we, ah, I know it's short notice but I brought all your friends here
For some reason I couldn't get a hold of Taco and Jasper
But, I just brought all your friends to talk to you
Because they're really worried about you
I thought it would be better if, they could talk to you
It was all a dream, I used to read Complex magazines
When I rhyme, I'm tryna get pictures in High Times
Smoke trees and see my dreams hanging in the skyline
Swanton bomb off the bed into a fine dime
In my mind, I'm just tryna smoke the finest
And get high sticking bad heinas in vaginas
I'm the flyest when it come to this, fire when I come to spit
I am getting higher when the lighter comes in front of this
I'm a stoner, yeah, yeah, yeah, you get the picture now
30 thousand feet gon' make it hard for me to simmer down
Another flight, another beat, another city, wow
Thus another couple bitches crying when I kick 'em out
Where we at? Where we at? Where we at? Where we at?
We on top of the world
And five minutes from suicide, I biked it to the park
I walked onto the block, met a guy, burgundy 'Preme snap-back
Hurling himself at cars, and flirting with blonde Cadillacs
All was gray, all was gray, Frankie had the blues in fact
Bunch of pale hipster girls, pretty, but they booty flat
Teenage males, couldn't tell I was going through it
Had a wallet full of cream, Amex Green, Bimmer almost black
Parked in front the studio Bastard's recorded at
Earl, Gilbert, Tyler, Hodgy, Domo, Left, Taco, Nakel
Sydney, Lionel, Juan, Michael, Jasper, Hal and Matt
Bet I'm missing several but I had to bring that pattern back
We live inside a house that says fuck 'em on the welcome mat
Deep inside the ear canals of Bill O'Reilly's daughter that's where I'm at
Now where we at? Wolf Gang, where we at?
Swell motions get promotions, to my whole team
Hell yeah, I smoke weed 'cause I like to go green
Professor Beats educates niggas, let me proceed
Shine chandelier bright might make your nose bleeds
We at Randy's ordering that 306
Milk and glaze is the greed gold mix me
Your bitch is coming along, yeah, she hum to my song
Singing like they were for her, but they were for the blur
No longer, but we were in premature, immature
She's unsure, I'm for sure, blouse and dress and my shirt
On the floor then pick it up, out the door, door
Chased, an imaginary friend, a reverie absorption
Impregnate the dream 'til it has an abortion
Where we at? We on top of the world
Everything they say I'd never have, I'm seeing
Now, I bet they see that we balling like All-Star Weekend
Always been the most cool, they chase our shade
They say life switches pace when you got shit made
So I'm just tryna get paid, don't you remember the days
When your dreams were the only thing that kept you sane
And too often they think that they could stop me
Now every show we makin' half a Maserati
And the only thing blocking me is paparazzi
Now it's gold Rolex's if they try to clock me
Everything stays in the box like fighters in hockey
Miss me if you're thinking we slack, work hard
I got the world saying every single Friday is black
Took your bitch, you ain't getting her back, cause she know
Where we at nigga? We on top of the world
Where we at, niggas?
Where the fuck we at, man? You niggas don't know me, huh
Where we at?
Down to fucking Earth, huh, down to fucking Earth, huh
Fuck everybody, here goes some extra girth, Sir
You fucking critics are making my nerves hurt
Since I'm saying fuck everybody I guess that I'm a fucking pervert
My window is a book and I'm a fucking crook
Stealing phones to call home but the line is off the hook
My mom ain't paid the bill, guess I can't pay it either
I ain't signed a fucking deal yet
But when I do, Clancy and David are taking percentages
That could pay the whole fucking city's mortgage
Hopefully, I make a lot of porridge from touring in fucking Oregon
From playing piano organs and hopefully, I can pay the bill
Shit is getting real, people begin to feel
Like I'm changing, but their complaining, making big fucking deals
About some shit, they bitch and pout
Can we get backstage, man? No, faggot, it's sold out
Come on, why you holding out? I thought we was boys
Without me, you wouldn't be Tyler, The Creator, you're from the Dirty
I can tell whenever you perform, a leopard can't change it's spots
But I'm a fucking unicorn Whatever, man
Look, you can't stop me, I'm going full Monty
Fuck that, I'm Hitler, everyone's a fucking Nazi
Wolf Gi-di-dang you be roaming where the fox be
And I be where, anybody cares
I try to preach "Fuck age, live dreams and have fun"
Here’s some give a fuck cake Oh, maybe I should have some
Asshole, have none
How can I wake up on the wrong side of the bed, when I don't even fucking have one?
Shit, I don't know
When I'm on that stage, I feel important
A whole fucking assortment of children that's taking Ritalin
Because the teacher said that the therapist wasn't feeling him
You gotta be fucking kidding me
In school, I was a zero, now I'm every boy's hero and they fear it
You can hear it when that little fuck is reciting my lyrics, yeah, I'm rebel nigga
Cheer it, dead parents everywhere, it's smelling like teen spirit
Okay, fuck it, Elvis has left the building
Fuck, take this!
Nigga, what the f—

Calm down, I'm here to help you. 
I'm your friend. *Crying*
You're in your good space with me. We'll figure all of this outMe and Slater just hit a curb

A stack of cheese for these rats, um, that mac and cheese
New 'Preme shit got me feeling flyer than a bag of bees
Fuck critics  Shit, how's your knees?
Y'all on my dick more than my index when I take a pee
I came up with ''Rella'', ain't touch a bag of weed
Shit was doper than Whitney Houston's needs

We was missing Sweatshirt, like "Where's the hooded sleeve?"
Okay, nevermind, we found him, yeah

Probably where that faggot went  Tyler talking father problems
Shocking shit, he spit to popping topics in them gossip columns

Merch booth made niggas extensive funds 
Mama got the Rover with the Range

And I put that on my dead grandmama's name 
Too soon 
Ugh, my nigga Slater, yeah that's my little pony
Little homies is repping like I been fucking with Kony
Nigga, Phillip and Kobi, to my niggas that know me
Your boy seem happy as fuck, but truthfully, your boy lonely
Nigga's a target for marketing, he's an artist
Can't even walk into Target
Without bothering customers bothering
Asking me for a picture, can I talk to they sister?
Naww, nigga, get lost, you're fucking smothering
God, I wanna quit ... But I can't
'Cause mother and sister can't pay the rent
Four stories with storage, I'm 21 with a mortgage
And touring's paying the bills, life is paying for thrills
Life's a bitch, bruh, but from the third floor, man, she's gorgeous
A year ago I was broke; now, how can I afford this?
I started off with disposables; now, I have an assortment
And I'm using these negatives to develop a portrait
Now, the frame is a pain in the ass
To get it in without a scratch or stain on the glass
But that's not important
Just as long as it's printed, and I hinted it is
But when I get it I'll make sure you get a copy, you bitch
Shit, I'll even add a signature with the fuckin' pic-a-ture
I'll even tell you the film I used, and the aperture
Domo, roll another one
I'm just fuckin' with you, I ain't smokin' none
My squad bring terror, no intended pun 
Merch booth made niggas extensive funds 
Mama got the Rover with the Range 
She don't ever ever gotta struggle, not again 
And I put that on my dead grandmama's name 
Too soon 
Grandmother died, didn't cry, not a tear
Not gonna lie, fucking weird, no water dripped out the eye
But when I got the news, yup, it left your boy stuck
'Cause when my mom dipped
She was the one that gave me a fuck
Mom calling and calling, I'm on my way to a show
I answer, she crying, saying, "Sadie is dying"
The doc said she only had a week for us to speak
Before she deceased, 'cause cancer was just eating her cheeks up
Fuck! Nah, this is really awkward for me, bruh
I hang the phone up, and adjust my seat back
And started to think, like, "What the fuck just happened?"
I never had a death, and I just seen her a week ago
Meet them at the hospital, I should
In between the set of BADBADNOTGOOD
Lionel asked what happened I said it's bad bad, not good
Just take me to the Cedars-Sinai off of Oakwood
Getting there, family sitting center chair
Awkward in the lobby, it was floating in the thinning air
Getting there, need a sticker saying how I got in there
There's her room
Open up the curtain, she's just sitting there, "Hello"
Our conversation's brief
Couldn't even make eye contact when we speak
Lookin' at her, you could tell all she had was weak
And I'm not talkin' days, bruh, I'm talkin' 'bout her strength
I sat there, 20 minutes tops
Hoping it was just a fucking plea that she could cop
She died that night
Oh, that's heavy, man. I'm sorry for your loss
Yeah, whatever. Don't worry about it...
The last time I seen Sammy, he was lookin' for you
Fuck that nigga, Samuel!
Uhh, have you seen him?
Nah, but if I seen that nigga I woulda killed him.Um, excuse me mister, but can you please turn down the lights?
I don't really like all these cameras, man
And this shit just don't feel right
And I don't really wanna be rude to you, sir
But fuck you mean I can't wear my hat in here?
And you got me fucked up, if you think I care, nigga
I hope you little niggas is listening
Them Golf Boys is in this bitch like an infant
The blind niggas used to make fun of my vision
And now I pay a mortage and they stuck with tuition
So special, the teacher asked if I was autistic
And now I'm making plates, you just washing the dishes
So if you don't mind, get the fuck out of my kitchen
But keep your ego there so I can butt fuck your opinion
But in the meantime, brainwashing millions of minions
Leader of the new school? 
And you would never catch me in none of their fucking shin-digs
I hope you fucking niggas is angry, pissed, and offended
In Search Of... did more for me than Illmatic
That's when I realized we ain't cut from the same fabric
I made my own shit, you went out and bought yours
Man, I got too much drive, motherfucker, I hate traffic
La-di-da-di, I'm going harder
Than coming out the closet to conservative Christian fathers
When it's a lot at stake carne asada but let's be honest, I'm really morphing
Named my album "Cherry Bomb" because "Greatest Hits" sounded boring
I don't like to follow the rules
She said that I must, I don't have any armpits
She wanted to talk; "Who's in charge of this Golf shit?"
I said "Howdy do? How are you? I'm the sergeant
And who I are isn't really important
My heart is as dark as a window with car tint
So hop in with your friends, gal and I'll unpark it
And I'll do donuts until the fat one is carsick."
It's young T
I don't like to follow the rules
And that's just who I am
I hope you understand
And I don't really think y'all cool
So give yourself a hand
No, no, give yourself a hand
Better pose for that camera
You better pose, boy you better pose
And it's your life nigga I suppose
For the lights, for the camera, and the action
Now your face is meltin' from the flash of the big ol' lights
Nigga you ask for this life
Welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Yeah, welcome to death camp
Kissing on my bean bag
Your lips high-five my tongue
And my fingers moonwalk through your hair
This is fun I can tell
I don't know if you'll handle it well
Welcome to hell camp
You should be mine in a way tonightExactly what you run from, you end up chasing. Like, you can't avoid, but just chasing it and just like trying. Giving it everything that you can. There's always an obstacle.We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater
About a hundred on Fax and it's easy to stop
You see my shit isn't stock
I used to piss in a pot and now I piss on the walls
Since I pissed off a cop, a couple tickets I have copped
But I can pay for them all
And by the model of my vehicle you know that I ball
E92, but '91 the year that Tyler was spawned
And if I crash I'm owing wheels like I'm a Vaughn or a Vince
Tiptronic stick or automatic you pick
Shit is static as shit, sure my shit is AM
Might get that X6 end, don't follow exit him
Might take a back street hidden
House got all sports cars like his garage is gym
Two sapphires on him neck next his precious gems
No AMG, it's M, boy I will eat him Benz
New engine, you got that old shit with those deep rims
You got a warranty don't care if you scratching rims again
We can speed in my 2 seater
Girl, I got a 2 seater
Speed in my 2 seater
In my 2 seater
Sit in my passenger seat
You tell me I got too much speed
And I should slow, I should slow down
But I can't, 'cause you driving me wild
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much
And you can feel the beat in my heart
Girl, I get a rush when we're speeding in my car
And sometimes it's too much
I know some dudes that would find you that carry rugers
And shottas, and fucking shoot at your Honda
Then fucking zoom out in Mazdas
Them GOLF boys is bad for you like the food from McDonald's
Boy, I'm a king and I ain't lyin', boy, hakuna matata
Better watch for them hyenas if you flex then they swarm
Cashing so many checks they're calling him Tyler O-Comma
I'm tryna ball like I was Domo O'Connor in '09
Probably September...
Boy I'm just rhyming these syllables, suck my genitals
Album cover looking like the mascot of the timberwolves
Skate park at Pemberton
Hoping that I ditched the chords and go pick up the pen again
'Cause I killed the dark shit like I'm motherfucking Zimmerman
Turn around and lose pounds like I'm fucking Timbaland
By pounds, I mean in 
Give it 'til he cop brick like a wall with pig in it
And money coming out the blue
Like cops are changing fits or shit I'm killin' it
Back when Left Brain had the hightop fade
And we would go skate on them concrete waves
And now I switch gears to hear the cylinders pump
The beat thump, don't get it twisted boy my board's in the trunk 
Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?
Why? Damn!
'Cause it's windy!
But I love it when your hair...
Blows, when it blows

Hanging out the sunroof
I love it when your hair blows

Hanging out the sunroof

When your hair blows
Hanging out the sunroof
Listening to Mac DeMarco
Hanging out the roof window
Switch to third gear turbo
Skrting on these niggas
Skrting on these bitches
Listening to Mac DeMarco

That boy T nuts, surprised his thoughts isn't chafing
And fuck them crackers up at Mountain Dew, them niggas is racist
Cabbage was made, critic faggots was shook
So I told 'em that I'll exchange the word "faggot" with "book"
And all them "books" is pissed off and had they page in a bunch
Fucking attitude switched just like a "book" when it struts
But I'm a fraud, I pray to God when the six triple "book" bashing
While me and my favorite author's lips tickle
Peter Parker pick a pack of peppers when the plot thickens
Tyler, The Creator fucking kill you with a popsicle
Cold blooded, so we rock mittens so they won't find him
Not kidding, keep the Tommy on me; bitch, I'm Ms. Pickles
Said I seemed off, last time that team talked
Sick of making niggas cabbage so I took the 'Preme off
Should've bought some stock in it 
Not Golf when the little homies don't—wait, let's weigh my options
I bought me a mansion, and bought some attention
Ain't give none to Hopsin, and dear Boyce Watkins
Why you mad? It's the slave in me
It's facts, boy, I'm back like Rosa Parks's least favorite seat
Videos, stage dives, popups, they watching T
While y'all niggas watching the throne, the throne be watching me
"If you fuck this up... There are so many fucking kids right now, listening to this guy."
"Get those wings flapping, motherfucker! 'Cause this kid's ready to fucking fly."
Eenie, meenie, miney, mo, nigga, nigga on the wall
Rap bars, jail bars, die or shoot a basketball
Tyler, the dark skin arrested in Austin
Cops know who I was cause their kids said the show was awesome
"Tyler, Tyler, I swear to—I swear to fuck! If you fucking... Do not fuck this up! You have the whole world in your fucking hands."
How many leaders in the house?
Well can somebody bring the mirrors out? I'm getting lonely
Likes and apologies and snaps make it obvious

How many leaders in the house? 
Well can somebody bring the camera out so I can film me?
T a great director, niggas' vision must be blurry

And I said, "Hey man, I agree"
Rocks on rainbow, Ben's a nice fellow
Your neck reflects your personality, and mine is yellow

Brent Lowe, mind motherfuckin' been gone
Pink and yellow on my neck remind you of my dickhole
And I don't really fuck with you niggas, shout out to Jim Crow

Nigga, Taco Tuesday, you don't want none of that
Have you heard of Fairfax? Boy, we was running that
Nigga took the store from us, yeah, fuck all of that
Crack a cracker with a barrel, uh 
Gang bang tattoos, this ain't a Louis rag 
Orange Paisley got me crip crazy 
Pants heavy, sag to the left with the belt strapped
No face mask, nigga, just toe tags
Still, the blunts getting passed, yeah
Ain't worried 'bout no niggas 
I don't grieve over suckers 
Gunpowder on my knuckles 
Call the ambulances 
I'm from the era of crip walking
You was clown-dancing, you wanna be me, huh?
Cuz is wack in his raps and what he rap, he ain't done
It's Top Dawg, Wolf Gang, smell the cat on your tongue
Pussyboy, you fucked over, nigga, control your gums
Teeth missing, moms' won't recognize your face when it's lump
My square homie's license, double life in my trunk
Mind, power, body, and soul, we break handcuffs
Got a strike on my record, double cups, and duck
You want the life like us, you need to crip that coast
You want to steer that wheel, you want to smoke that kill
Well, who am I?
Part 2 - SPECIAL 
Shit, piss, fuck, cunt, cocksucker, motherfucker
Anything that'll piss you muthafuckas off
I don't even smoke and I'm a level above of y'all
Bitch, you couldn't reach me with a ladder and a calling card
I'm special, nigga
Who the fuck are you?!
I'm special, nigga
They used to tell me to calm down, said I have a problem
Now I'm runnin' shit, that's why you never see me wearin' joggers
Lead by example, how?
All y'all is my son and I ain't never had a fuckin' father
Boy, I'ma bring the noise
I got my own beat and we all got drums
What these weapons about? We're just flexin' about
You on your grind but who the one that got the wep at their house?
Bitch, I do this on purpose, you niggas don't got a purpose
This nigga call me a clown, nigga I own the circus
Stack is sittin' in my pocket folded like a papaya
You know I golf bitch like I been sleepin' with Tiger
Woody woody, my mob, mob is goodie we Oddkast
We O-K-K-K just like the clan hoodie
Golf shit packet, rip it out the fuckin' package
In that all pink fit lookin' like a fuckin' faggot
Who the fuck you think you fuckin' with, nigga!?
I'm a bad case of I don't even know
I gotta to tear the shit out of this goddamn house
I think that I'mma blow my muthafuckin' brains out
Tyler, take a chill pill, niggaI like my girls skinny with brains
I like my hoodies fucked with Lame
I like my friends imaginary with no names
And I make music for the fuck of it, no fame
Aim, shoot, the gun of love, round
Tried to find ammo but it's none around town
So I went Down South but I ended up North
Uptown sitting on Cloud 9's white porch
And of course, my car's off course
You're so white, my blinkers don't work
I'm trying to let the force be with you, I get you
Music is my first, but I contemplate divorce
You make a nigga sing songs nice
You make a nigga's night turn day
And you make the flowers sing say turn green yellow
It sucks that I didn't get the chance to say hello 
I want to eat you out like jello
And mess with your body like the bass and the cello
And tell your mom I said hello, you want to go to prom? 
Fuck  and another one, there goes another one
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Maybe? 
Maybe? 
Maybe? 
Maybe? 
I like her L-I-K-E, the only difference is she won't fuck with me
But she will fuck with that vegetable with the hairs full of X's and O's
I want to tie her body up and throw her in my basement
Keep her there, so nobody can wonder where her face went
- Tyler, what are you doing?
- Shut the fuck up!
- Uh-umm..
- You gon' fuckin' love me bitch
- Uhh..
- Or I'mma fuckin' put this gun in your fuckin' head
But all I really want is a kiss on the cheek
In private, not public in the streets
And your cupcake I would eat and your toes
Cause I got a big fetish with the feet
I just want somebody I can see
You can be a gold digger, you ain't got to love me
I'm serious  I don't ask for much
Your heart literally is what I do want for lunch
Now this shit is turning to a habit
I'm the burger king, I gotta have it my way
And truthfully girl you really make my day
I would probably kill myself if you told me you was gay
And I can't even look the other way
Your aura is a magnet, my eyes a metal bag, it's attractive
L-O-L laughing, you're a gold Oscar and I'm just actin'
And I want your cinema hole, and have our kids play supporting role
Climbing up the pole, Jack and the Beanstalk, bitch it's gold
And I was in loath, I would never get over you, ever, Sarah
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Another love song about shit
And I'll be rich if I get another diss
And maybe Cupid won't miss
Half your body laying on my chest
The rest is in my stomach, that's including your breast
And I'ma just take another guess
Now you probably wishing that you would have said yes
Am I crazy? Maybe
But fucked up is how I been lately
Shit, I don't give a fuck
Your family looking for you, wish 'em good luck
Bitch, you tried to play me like a dummy
Now you stuck up in my mothafuckin' basement all bloody
And I'm fucking your dead body, your coochie all cummy
Looking in your dead eyes, what the fuck you want from me?
What did you want from me?
What did you want from me?Hello, I'm a salesman sorta giant
I sell molly and mary and other various items
One time one guy came to where I'm residing
And I didn't invite him, so instead tried to fight him
I got violent, long story short he's not breathing
For some reason I liked it and it was really exciting
Couldn't stop the addiction, and the irony is
A couple junkies went missing and I know right where they're hiding
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Task force poured into my fortress
Found some lipstick, a couple corpses
Bitches was harmed and they couldn't reach the alarm
I'm ripping sockets out like I had fucking problems with arms
They found a couple portraits on the porch
Hope they don't check up under the floor
It's bodies and hotties and we was raging I'm gauging a shawty
Hit so many bitches I was pimping like Scotty
I'm a bull, red, piss me off
Like that lipstick position when she kissed me
So I bit 'em off, they was too soft, I'm a Wolf
And a designer mixing skin cotton leather and wool
And most people like flying kites, riding bikes in the woods
Baking cake cause its good, I mean I would if I could
But I like playing dress up and mix match
Sorry I'mma 'fess up, you aren't getting your kids back
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
Dope in the bag, Pretty bitch on the side
I sell dope in the back, if you tryna get high
What's in my trunk? White, girl
What's in my trunk? White, girl
You need a warrant, officer
You could say I kill 'em, if my product doesn't
Couple basement stairs where I drug them, down
It's pretty disgusting, finger crush your face
I'll leave you permanently blushing, blood
Nosebleed drugs, cook you in the oven
DrumsI don't fucking like this shit, fuck
Ah!
Tall ugly nigga with lips bigger than Tigger
Only blue print on these Vans like I don't listen to Jigger 
Cotton-picking nigger, Golf Wang season sicker than the block
Colette and skateshops, where wolves deal 'em 
Workshop is awesome, ask Dill and let's pretend
Like I'm not making dollar Bill Withers on these fucking stickers 
Pulling down my zipper and she quick to say she doesn't suck
Bitch, cut the crap like dyke booty when they scissor 
Pink haired Mrs., I'm her mister, sipping Slurpees, bag of chips
Now show your tits for mister Fuji, take a picture 
OF is popping like a blister, need some Listerine
Spitting got us balling like we Mr. Clean's sister 
Sick of being black, sipping paint thinner out a tin flask
Plotting on the babysitter before dinner
And hopefully I get her, if I don't, fuck it then
See I never simp son, polar opposite of Smithers, I'm done bitch

Moshing pits to breaking arms
Zombie Circus not a carn–
Evil wolves is on the farm

Fucking body will go missing in a week
Roam around the city with her titties like a fucking greek

You haters put up your guards
They against us? Oh, no

I'ma eat your pussy 'til you tell me you can't take it
Screaming "Stop it," don't you fake it, wanna tape it

Look: FaceTime your clit, I will jack off my dick
I go hard, shit, I might need ice pack on my wrist

When you kiss me, swear to God, blood was rushing to my Jimmy
Oh, Laying on my trampoline, looking at the stars
From my fake space fog machine
Laying on my arm, it's dead
From the pressure of your head
I said I loved you, said it back
Like it was scripted, but you meant it
Like the flavor of that lemonade
That we was sipping on our sushi-ridden dinner date
Oh, you think you special now?
Other bitches trippin' now

Aw, nah, boy don't cut that wood
Found out your flowers don't smell that good?
But if they smell real good to him
Then he don't need nobody else nose to win
Look, I am a God, nobody prays to the sight of you

"GOLF 191, Okaga! Playing only classic hits!"Find your wings 
Find your wings 
Hey you, whatcha doin' and why you runnin'?
Supposed to fly and take control cause you're the pilot
You can't swim, you're gonna drown, the sharks are comin'
The sky's your home, there's no limit, you know you gotta
Find your wings 
Find your wings 
We can go down to the rainbows
Don't let your high keep your brain low

Don't let your wings go to waste 
The sky is your home, be free
Be freeWell, Tyler, uh
It's about that time
I mean, you're a good kid, just misguided
Okay, so is there anything else you wanna say before we end this?
My father died the day I came out of my mother's hole
And left a burden on my soul, until I was old enough
To understand that the fuckin' faggot didn't like me much
He loved my moms enough to bust a nut and then he... 
Bring Your Pops to School Day, for twelve years, I cheated
Told the fuckin' faculty that he was at a meeting and
Bring That Dude to Life day, he wasn't at the meeting
Made a U-turn on the way there like, "The fuck am I thinking?" 
Birthdays, Christmas, my only fucking wishlist
Was CDs  and a new fit
Instead, I got some CDs, inhaler, some Ritalin, some white socks
I was hyper 'cause I ain't get attention from my real pops
Cops say I'm supposed to be in jail, but they don't know it's me
Statistics say that niggas with no father ain't gon' be shit 
Well I guess I had one, 'cause, nigga, I'm it
You smell that?  That's the odor of success, bitch
I know I'm not the only bastard
In America
So I'm gon' to need some help, on this next part
Scream it with me, niggas
 I'm good
 I graduated
 I'm good
 I'm good
 I'm good
 I'm good
 Fuck you
 Bitch
Father's Day was the worst when it came to gifts
'Cause I ain't know for who or what the fuck to get
Now, my mama mentioned the day before what she would like
'Cause she's playin' both roles, like her occupation was dyke, fucking right
I ain't look up to Obama and Nixon 
I look up to the Hugos and Dixons 
The niggas in the vision, rap about the shit they cooking in the kitchen
Pushing keys, like them niggas that were banging on them keys
My father never seen me, the nigga probably Stevie
He bought me a hoodie, a couple albums
Like that's gonna make up for the years and the tears
And the money that my mama spent on rent and clothes
You fucking dipped out, I swear to God, if I see you I'ma get out
The M-16 and let a fucking clip out 
'Cause in 16 years, you let your kid doubt the existence, none
I don't give a fuck either, like father, like son, I'm done
He ain't give a fuck about me
He ain't give a fuck about you
He ain't give a fuck about we
So what the fuck we gon' do?
 I'm good
 I graduated
 I'm good
 I'm good
 I'm good
 I'm good
 Fuck you
 Bitch
The cold is nice, and I'm not talking 'bout the weather
The skin is thick, no need for leather
Your father called, he said you're better without him
I'm not the only fuck without them
How to tie a tie and how to get your suit hemmed
Up, take it to the shop, then, what?
Fuck it, momma's proud of her asthmatic, thin fuck
Luck on my brim, Sup-preme keeps me warm
When the cold blood swarms in my veins, fuck rain in the summer
The bummer is the fact that I'm black
And I hang with white Neos whose marrow stays frío
Now, this counselor is tryna tell me that I'm emo
She don't give a fuck
D-low, where's the trigger? I'll let this bullet play hero
Shit
No, no, fuck that
Fuck that
I ain't deserve this
I'm over it
BANG!Mula!
Like Adam in the Garden of Eden
My bitch got an apple bottom and she swallow my seeds
Follow my lead, fire I breathe, water my seed
And sit back and watch money grow on trees
Droppin' seeds like classes, these hoes drop they asses
I drop a seed in her panties if it smell like pansies
I'm a banshee in her panties, nigga, ask your mammy
Never played golf, but got a driver and a Caddy
Whole squad slammin' like Onyx, you know Sticky Fingaz
Some drop science, I'm droppin' English
Even if Tyler named the song "Flower"
No seeds in the bud, still don't trust bugs
I'm down
Droppin' seeds on these niggas, they can't fuck with the boy 
I'm droppin' seeds on these bitches for the love of the sport
I'm droppin' seeds, got this garden, flowers poppin' of course
I'm droppin' seeds, motherfucker, Weezy Baby the boy, yugh!Oh, my nigga, oh shit, cuz it's startin', aaaaight!
Wolf Gang be on that wrist split splatter
Snortin' coke pattern misfit'll hit Mick Jagger
Me and Jasper bangin' Bastard, beatin' midgets up with ladders nigga
Don't give a fuck, that's that Wolf Gang swagger
Don't give a shit so my dick fuck bladders in your ear
Radical shows that Wolf Gang's radder
With a staggerin' pack of cocaine in the sack of my dick
Where the lips of your teen daughter sits, bitch
Fuck Tyler, I'mma change my name to Uncle Phil
Cause every girl I deal and fuck, it's always against her Will
Dope enough to snort crack and sit the fuck still
In Nellyville's old folks home searchin' tip drills
Get my fill on with this grandmother named Jill
Takin' shots of poon juice to the head for a cheap thrill
Hopefully my dick don't shrivel up, when it's time to bust
In this rusty cunt, that won a cup in collectin' dust
Boogyin' with Jesus and a bunch of Nazi hoes
In the front row at a holy Justin Bieber show
Slowly my Ritalin is kickin' in and Jesus left hand
Begin to make me feel like a little kid again
This isn't rape, this is fuckin' without a condom on
Throw her slightly to the right, so dyke I'm kinda wrong
Wolves is out past dawn on your front lawn
Me and Juan ensurin' you that your slut daughter's gone
At the pawn shop, tryna sell this Baume watch
She's a white vegetarian, I'll get this blonde cock
Lip balm she's some nun bitch from St. John
Told her that her pastor was a faggot and he likes John
He's a janitor recreational rectum manager
I am not, let's consider me a little pecan
That'll get your chest nutted on with an acorn
They swore that I was all fuckin' nuts like a gay porn
Cause I disregard the white dress and the perm weave
And the headrest had to have about eight thorns
I was born back, Wolf pack, nigga fuck that
Somebody tell Satan that I want my fuckin' swag back
Niggas know it's Wolf Gang, in the mall with
Thirty bitches, and they gorgeous
Wolf Gang, killing niggas, rabble rousers
And Wolf Gang running shit in dirty houses
Wolf Gang 
Wolf Gang 
Wolf Gang 
Wolf Gang, you better kill 'em
Box logo on my muthafuckin' chest
Left hand staggerin' on her muthafuckin' breast
Deep down, I'm an emo fuckin' faggot that's depressed
So the fuckin' school suggested me a therapist
I confessed bein' atheist, they said I was possessed
By a demon, cause I wanna see a bitch infested
With my semen and oppressed by my give a fuck less
Of the baby not bein' digested by a fuckin' hungry punk
Feedin' kids to slutty nuns with his cum
Got a fuckin' blog that needs a post? I can get it done
2DopeBoyz I know you like this
 This hot cum that's from my dick
Call me a clown but a week from now
You're goin' to hear this and begin to ride on my dick
Like how the fuck did we miss this kid's shit
Oh yeah we're old as fuck, we didn't have our glasses
But fuck y'all, I don't need y'all help

Boy, I know

]
I know that there could be
Something for you and me
What's your philosophy?
You're scared, scared
Oh darlin', it's in the way you want me
You can see the answers are all there
You and I are cut from different fabric
Don't be too material to see
Some how this world is such a struggle just to be
Fuck em' all, baby, it's just you and me
You make me better
And I know this don't make sense
But you make me better

But nigga, how much of that shit do you own?
See me, I don't compromise

You're speedin' and gleamin' and stuntin' so Evel Knievel
You beaming and circle in Bimmers you hoping them niggas’ll see it
Results may vary, my chain, it's not too heavy
I'll rather pedal smooth on my bike than to crash in that Bugatti
But back to the garden, Niggas gone do you dirty

Gotta keep it obsolete like Chris Brown when Rihanna got her fuckin' ass beat
Fuck Jeeves ask me for advice, if I'm not reading a Vice

Everything that I write is dope because the pipe

Box Logo hoodie, still haven't got the stains out

I got you niggas nervous like a Pop
Tryna ask his virgin, hot, vegan daughter where the cock goes
Wake up, wash ass, go and eat some Roscoe's
Head back to the studio to munch up on some tacos
When I was younger I was bitchin' and
Now I'm coming quicker than
The shit that's swimmin' in my sock hole
When them teeny boppers ain't around
So Johnson and Johnson baby lotion
Beat on my Johnson 'til my cock swole
Stop saying you're sick, shit is kinda old
I'm a fucking Herpe in a coma, you're a common cold
Have you heard my brother verse on Llama?
When that nigga's home
Me, him and Hodgy gonna take the game and
Get a stainless steel AK and aim it
To the fucking referees head and put his lifeless body
In a chokehold
Uh-oh, these niggas is loco
Best thing smokin' minus all of the tobacco
Still hard to be black, well
Malcolm X would be proud, this white bitch getting black-maled
Blue-eyed cracker named Jenny, and skinny
And Obama wanted change, I threw a couple fucking pennies at him
Just a chip off the old block
Chipped tooth ruth got some dick off my swole cock
'Cause I bag bitches, she's a zip off the old lock
And that's just a logo on the center of that old box
Oh stop, tryna be me, kids will go cop anything
That I put on from the gold watch to the boxers that I put on
Probably 'cause I'm going harder than erect cock dick filled with Botox
Oh shit, you're as hard as senior citizens dick
Oh fuck, don't slip, break hips and pop backs
Show some respect to old chaps with my left fist
'Cause I'm the next best spitting wreck that's left here
That's my ex bitch
Her? She's my next bitch
Have you met her mouth? No? Oh that's my bestest
Bestie, and she gets beastie
And she's my favorite babysitter cause the children never exit
I was taught to act my shoe size, I'm eleven and a half
Cock the umbrella cause when I spit Seven on your ass
It's gonna be mid-stage Coachella
Shake's faggot ass keep hatin'
But I work hard for the shit that I got
So it's still fuck 2DopeBoyz and fuck Planet Earth
All associates can suck cockFly with the birds in the wind
Where you wanna go, who, what, why, when? Uh
On a scale of nine to ten
You taking L's baby, hold my hand and feel like the wind, uh
Now fasten your seat belt, and turn everything off
I got your attention, motherfucker, I'm bout to take off
I'm the new pilot in this bitch
And I ain't bring no extra baggage for this trip
But I do bring a terror like I hate America
A brand new camera and a parachute
Nigga, you and I are not the same, we not parallel
Don't talk to me 'fore I fucking embarrass you
Now sit your ass down, you doing three much
I'm the captain on this bitch, don't get it fucked up
Or you'll get fucked up
I'm so far ahead of you niggas, I'm in the future
Y'all don't even know about my existence, it's like I'm dead to you niggas
I'm saying 
Look, y'all be on the stupid shit
I'm the fucking pilot, your goal is to be the stewardess
I'm the fucking bomb like I was stuffing my shoe with it
The boy's a fucking problem like turbulence boy, get used to it
If anything happens, it's one door
'Cause if I see a building, motherfucker, we're done for
I'ma hit a couple of 'em up, this is parkour
Better call your family and give 'em your last wishes, nigga
And every line dirty, you thought that I dug ditches
But I never give a fuck, it's like I was born dickless
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til' there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash
I don't wanna crash anymore, I don't wanna crash anymore
I just wanna soar through the space, let the wind hit my face
Til' there's nothing left in the gas tank, I don't wanna crash
I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah, uh
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, yeah
It's kinda weird
'Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach, look 
I'm tryna find a place, a place where I can land at
A place where I can be with no alphabet
Dictating where to stand at
You can buy a car, you can buy many things
You can buy happiness, but you can't buy wings
You can buy a parachute, you can buy a parrot
But you can't buy a pair of wings, aerodynamic
To stay cloud level
That's why I'm in first class but I feel like coach 
Cause I'm in first class but I feel like coach
It's just crazy how you can have everything in the world, but
You in first class but you feel like coach, damn
That's why I'm in first class, but I feel like coach
I don't wanna—I can't read!
I got 5
I got five on it too my nigga
You smokin my nigga?
Nah I ain't smokin
Nigga come on just hit the fucking blunt
Nah I'm not gon smoke man
This nigga never wanna smoke
I'm high off life nigga 
Straight edge ass
I'm Tyler, Mr. Green Hat
Pro-abortion, anti-clean rap
Fuck your blog opinion and your feedback
My self-respect I leave that, in the lost and found
Where the black girls get their weaves back
Awesome I achieve that mini, blasting "You're a jerk"
In some fucking yellow skinnies looking like a fucking faggot
Bouncing 'round the house trying to find an easy way to rape Minnie
Bet you thirty dollars you find her like Cartman found Kenny, dead
I like my girls smart, skinny
Kinda pop tart, when I bite into them red
I'm a self-racist, you should tape this, ask Sarah, I'm the rapist
I'm a fascist, fuck fashion, Gucci belts is for them faggots
My hat is by Jabbia, and if you got a fucking problem
With the future, you can get a death wish just like Atiba
Fuck the biz apparent, Odd Future errant
I'm watching the Berrics getting head from someone's parent
A lot of fucking hate inside my heart, guaranteed
That I'm sharing in the force with the cyclops staring
I'm flying on a beaver, you're a disbeliever
So don't ask for no mothafuckin' ride when you see us
Swim right past you, the shit-list said that I'm nutty such a cashew
'Cause I jack off with dish soap and smell gas fumes
Permanent brain damage similar to tattoos
The shit, you can mention me if anybody ask you
Kill the jungle, let the cats loose
You didn't see me here if someone ask you
I want to feel her in every way
Mary Jane keeps me high like every day
Bong, vaporizer, in the sack now
Stuck in my high, afraid of heights, I'm trapped
Buy a swisher for a dollar or two blunt wraps
Roll it up and ensure that everything's fat
She ain't got time to try and relieve ya
But she'll get all in your head, Sativa
I'm good but y'all don't want me like vegetables
I'm all in front of you zeroes like decimals 
Let's take them high like the decibels
So we get them high, get them high like cholesterol
In a overweight mother-lover, my tracks is filled with blubber
That's fat, who needs another producer?
Chica-Go-Getter from Odd Future, used to ride solo
'Cause I ain't really care what the rest say
Type of nigga to jerk off to his own sex tape
Best stay away when the door closed, I show up with four hoes
Best believe I'm leaving with more of those
And I got a girlfriend so I'm a keep lying til the verse end, FIN
BrandUn DeShay, Hodgy Beats, Ace the Creator
Odd Future, O.F. until, until... from now until forever, Peace
We grind, these niggas asking for some promo
We sit back, observe, stacking hella box logos
Square circle jerks starting O.F. moshpit
Preaching to the poets, I'm an O.F. prophet
No less profit, fiened when we drop shit
Convertible coupe, bitches scream when they tops split
It's that crack, give you something to sell
Put these bitches on lock down, something like jail
Thought she hot I swear, probably rougher than hell
And she ain't gay, but the only thing she like is fucking Chanel
Light skinned women, all sex everything
Think we can fit ten in, bowls packed with everything
Everything that we call flight, living life
This is everything that they call hype
I'm everything that they call nice
She in colors and shit, she off that northern lights, right
Intimidated by niggas you can't be
I'm a G, and this is something you can't see
Top ranked, number one my son
And she looking for them trees, baby we got some
And stay focused on the women and you get less done
It's ironic cause I always hear you talking about one
Them other niggas smoke, they ain't this high
How high? Nigga, higher than the kites they flyAyy, ayy, uh
I was taught to act my shoe size, never my age
I always judge a book by the cover, never the page
I never judge a murder by weapons, only the rage
That he felt when he dealt with the physiological phase
They say that I never cease to amaze
While half my mental belongs in a cage
The ape is a beast, tranquilize that bitch
If you niggas selling dope then you selling my shit
Selling my assets, I'm so damn illegal that I need to be arrest
But then they'll get my mom for 18 years of possession
She showed me affection like a drug dealer using her pocket for my protection
The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes
I bet you've never seen a pig fly, nope
Right next to the fat lady hitting high notes
Went to sleep at seven never woke up from the dream
Wore my wings and my jeans but my hat is from Supreme
So I guess that's where I hide my things
Caged, and the wonder is seen
Middle finger missing so I can not give a fuck
I can hear the bells ringing off the nice dream truck
So I'm chasing the dreams, no realities
Hoping that maturity won't be too mad at me
But if so, I'll take the scorn, indeed happily
Long as I can feel my heart tap like happy feet
Fatherless kids, orphans like me and Domo is
A fuck that we will never give is like our pops
But what we did was found our niche and made a stitch
Just like a shirt, that's why our stains smell like the shit, that's from
The pigs fly away in the morning
But I ain't get to see you today
And if I want to go outside
I got to make sure that I can play here
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
I bet you've never seen a pig fly
Well you ain't been looking through my eyes, yeah
And my circus is all night 
It's all night 
Bitch, it's all night 
And my circus is all night 
Bitch, it's all night 
It's all night 
I'm an odd fellow, the opposite of mellow
The therapist said hello but my mom would wonder
I was dealing with iller shit like professional plumbers
Like food for thought was my father but I ain't have the hunger
My self esteem was like me, tall and full of flaws
My pride is gone, I'm that guy like Aaron Hall
Shit, I know some niggas wear their hearts on they sleeves
But I wear mine on my head, SupremeCompliments to smiles, or light to sun

Odd Future, I'm your motherfucking sergeant
Nigga, I'm in charge, I fuck with Freshjive
'Cause I get it, no charge, and BBC for the low price
No barging, nigga that's a bargain
Cow-print t-shirt like motherfucking dog
On the motherfucking farm with cockadoodle doodles
I'm making straight bitches pussy wet just like a noodle
And my dick must be dog food to these bitches' poodles
Felines on the free time, I'm tossing bitches' salads
And I'm eating up they croutons, Erica to Milan
We was flying to Milan, was supposed to go to Bangkok
Until she figured out that she don't really like to bang cock
To Soho, Baby Milo so dope

I can wear some Wranglers, with a fucking White T
Doo-rags to match, and I do sag, in fact
My hat is in tact with the Fubu pull over
Nigga, you pull over, fuck a Rover Range
And I'm driving a unicorn, plus my bitch is strange
And I'm the only fucking rapper without a chain
With a four-finger ring like I can't spell my fucking name
And I go to Obama rallies screaming out "McCain"
Them ignorant, thrashing motherfuckers is my gang
And the dirty Ladera, I can't forget where I came from
Nigga, you don't claim none, from, I am the teacher
White and black bitch like she's a motherfucking zebra
Candies in my pocket, I see you niggas on Easter

Hello
Nice to meet youYo, I've seen a lot of niggas
So when them niggas start talkin' reckless, I get offended
I get it, they try to keep a image
But look real closely at the pictures and you see that they chameleons
How you doin'?
You in the motherfucking building?
Nigga, I'm a architect, got another crane and I don't know if I'mma park it yet, you ain't even start one yet, fuck off my property
Tell Australia I'm sneaking in with a mic in my damn hand
Instead of the vegetables that I packed in my backpack
When Marshall had this problem, what the fuck was they telling him?
Is it cause of status or his melanin lacks black? Huh?
I think people love to be mad
How can I be misogynist? I love titties and ass
How can I be homophobic when my boyfriend's a fag?
And we been hiding in the closet like our passion is fashion
Still trying to come out
Couldn't deal with niggas who decide to take the fun out
Probably cause I like to be in places where the sun out
So comparing niggas lights is a motherfucking bum out
Thought y'all niggas nudists but y'all clothes
I was 'bout to tee off and putt-putt till the end
Now it's Anti-Golf Boys cause I don't fuck with my friends
Worse thing they gave me was an opportunity and a pen
Look, freedom of speech? My freedom was breached
Border Patrol put me on streets immediately
For shit I said when I was a virgin repeatedly
Posting on Hypebeast cause nobody would listen to me
My child is a product of me, very honest
Left of center, very different, they didn't want us
They didn't get us, didn't fit enough for their standards
Diverse and loud, so they ignored us
You put your life in a child that everybody hates
Now everybody hates papa despite that papa's great
But that's your favorite child boy that's your favorite one
 Nope, I'm talking 'bout that Cherry Bomb
I don't think they hear it, I was fearing deteriorating
Almost ate my spirit til the children cheered along
Watching them sing the songs
Eyeballs inspired from Pilot to 2Seater, I couldn't steer them wrong
That's why I rode the McLaren, couldn't stop at the Bimmer
"Tyler losing himself, and that nigga turned to a diva
That nigga preaching and wildin', that nigga smilin' and breathing
Tryna inspire all the little niggas that wanna be him
But fuck that!, We want:
Cats cats daddy problems
Kickflip fuck fuck, cupcakes buttrape
Golf Wang, daddy problems fag fag dad dad
Bike lake everything that I hate, plus being sad"
Y'all can cry about your year's top rap new albums
Golf did a quarter million in about two hours
Money money ain't the motive, but it is up for discussion
Niggas frontin' niggas wish that they could fuck with my production nigga
Saying you the plug, get your chords up
I was writing string sections on my tour bus
They adore me, my little birds
Be free, go flap your wings, I encourage it
Look, I wish I had a fucking xanax problem
So y'all talk about how I deep I am
Man-child in the flesh, bitch, I'm Peter Pan
You captain tier hook  muthafuckas won't ever be the man
I got a muthafucking vision, I don't see your plans
So shut your muthafucking mouth when I be speaking, man
Cause T the only sober nigga that be tweaking, fam
Fuck
I don't—I don't like rapping like thatFuck you running for nigga?
Aye nigga, come here nigga
Let me try that hat on
I told you come over here stupid bitch
Come over here with that weak ass hat
All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out
In the car called life took the lame route
Going nowhere fast but you think that you not
Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop
At his drop top, took another lame out
Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?
Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga
Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
And make sure that your mama cry the pain out
Now that gang is out to get you
But you stuck in the same house
Nigga never came out, wow
It's a shame how you got sucked in that life
But hey man at least you got a name now
They say you a "real nigga" cause you kill niggas
Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out
For they approval boy, you can't even hang out
That light you hit, it was the light I held
That's why you never ever see me with my chains out
I don't need to, truth they don't feed you
Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you
They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you
Better look the other way if he ever see you
And run as fast as you can, nigga
That's the shit I be talkin' bout, though
We ain't try'na hear that shit, my nigga
Cuz, stay preachy cuz
Like nigga come on homie
I don't wanna hear that shit, preachy shit my nigga
Yeah, we all black, who give a fuck, cuz?
I don't give a fuck, nigga
Whatchu mean?Now when I first saw you
I could tell you was the one
That I've been searchin' for
I needed somethin' that was like the Sun
Now all my flowers grow
Right now my life, it blooms, baby
You're my favorite color, my favorite color
My favorite color's you
It's like the endless summer, endless summer
It never ends with you
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellow
Cause you're my yellow, yellow, yellowYuh, ayo
Ayo
I put the feline in my hair, looking like a cheetah pet
And you know they getting green if a flower on they neck
If a flower on they neck hit Clancy on the text
I ain't tryna check a bag, can we get another jet?
I ain't gassin' niggas up, but that fuel is 50 grand
Passionfruit in D.R., had me dripping in the sand
New nigga from New York, I'ma give him sticky hands
Sticky fingers from the green, Jasper playing with them grams
They was playing at the Gramm's, one nom ain't enough
I'm a make sure that that shit ain't happening again, yuh
Golf boys, it's them golf boys
In that 12 seater wings looking like a hawk boy
Getting to the paper better re-up on the chalkboard
Because the student turned into the teacher
Don't talk boy, class in session
1 through 5, I'm a 7
I'm a god nigga ask your reverend
And that crib in Bel-Air is heaven
Hot-coco outta chinas nigga pass the beverage, yuh
Comme Des on that hombre
Haters with the long face
New whip is Pirelli tired like a long day

Pink chinchilla, something like Thriller
My t-shirts are bathing, a bathing gorilla
You niggas all hype like you drink a cup of Splenda
But I ate the whole plate like a fat bitch dinner
I'm never the winner, always the loser
I don't choose to win, but I will choose her
Her kitty-cat fish loves his tuna
I never use a fork I always spoon her
Go nuts, instrumental flow much
European model white bitch is eating donuts
Fuck you faggots, I'm with a fat bitch
Making shit come like I'm Go-Go Gadget
I'm mental, it's instrumental
Make your bitches' therapist ask for dental records
And I hope this record have you stabbing niggas with colored pencils

What's the point of bein' rich when you wake up alone?
What's the point of goin' home when it ain't nobody there?
Fuck that, I grab my bike and phone home in the air
And I pedal through the city with the wide frame steer
With that tall pale boy that I met last year
Grape, that's what I call him, love, that's what I fall in

I'll keep your, your best interest 
I'll keep your best interestHello, no one is available to take your call
Please leave a message after the tone

I know, I know, I'm sorry, I know I'm annoyin'
I just want your attention
Ever since I saw you, knew nothin' was important
Your gravity is too strong and it's fuckin' up my orbit
Contact avoided by the time I record this
I just want you to listen
Everytime I see you, yeah, you brighten up my day
You're the cashmere to my cotton and I wished you felt the same
More options in the alphabet, I know I'll be okay-kay-kay
No, I won't...
'Cause it's them rose tinted cheeks 
It's them rose tinted cheeks 
And it's them rose tinted cheeks 
It's them rose tinted cheeks 
They Black Flag we AF

That's that 20 Century Women reference
You so hard to get like intricate metaphors
Companies? I own four

Hit the 'plex and catch a band 
Sushi spot I recommend 
Float around hittin' wheelies, leg or engine-based, it all depends

Thirsty I am, I may need three cups, what's up?

La-la-la, la-la-la, la-la-la
Eye contact, eye contact, eye contact, yeah
Speedin' down the 5 in my newest ride
You was kinda high, speakers mild high
Track 10 track 10, dirt bike afternoons
As long as pale skin's near, I didn't have to leave the room
Switch gears
Roamed around fell in love 
Broke my leg, got stuck, what the fuck?
Hit my head, wait, I wish you would fall in too, I said
I wish you would fall in and snap them legs
Cause I'ma be stuck here until I'm dead and gone
La-la-la, la-la-la, uh
La-la-la, la-la-la
Yeah
La-la-la, la-la-la
La-la-la, la-la-la
I remember when we first met
My eyes, like jeans too tight, I couldn't take 'em off you
You're precious metal I was a magnet just lookin'
I've been searching for somethin'
But didn't know what I was looking for
Then you popped and it became so clear
Like that water up north, so clear
Got me sayin'
Alright, alright
And truthfully now
I'm intimidated by your existence
Flustered because of your presence and
Your absence leaves me, leaves me in a state of confusion... I mean... 
I really can't function 
La-la-la-la 
I can't explain it 
I'm aware enough to know this is just a temporary pool of emotion, shit 
But since I'm here, I might as well drown, so
Please don't save me 
Ha ha ha, woo!
Yeah, alright Snow is falling, it's on the ground
First delayed but it's cancelled now
Late to the train broke myself off
Am I getting closer? Now am I getting closer?
Taking the streets, I'm moving slow
Sure made a sweat now, what's there to lose?
I just wanna get there before you go
I hope I'm getting closer
I hope I'm getting closer
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
I'll be there in the morning
I'll be there before you know it
Going fast as I can
But the traffic is bad
And my rental is slow
I'm coming, I'm coming
I'm coming home
You on my team, I can't be alone
You hear that ring, I pick up the phone
Car, a plane, a walk, a train
No matter which way baby, I'm coming home
Wish that I could press fast forward
To the part where I get there
Seeing all the lights on
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Unlock the door
I'm coming, I'm coming
No matter how far
Leave the lights on
It may take a while but I'm coming home
Bar is low, texts slow
No goodbyes, no xo
My flight delay, no echo 
Hurry 'cause the plan's urgent
I'm trying to get home like the man's version
Emergency until I see you
And then you can hold mine like a hand surgeon
But let me take your bow off
Wooly knits, Prada hat so I can show off
You my gift that I can't get until I get to that front door
It's fluorescent if I leave with the lights on
Yeah, leave the lights onThe only girl I ever loved
Fucked some nigga that I really hate
And the funny part about it that we didn't even date
But at the end she could still say she got her pussy ate
Yummy her in her tummy, pour out cause
Cummy in her bummy means that a little me being coming
So I let her blow my flute and start humming, bitch's brewin'
But that wasn't bubble gum that she was chewin'
Our relationship was like my music, chopped up, screwed up
Made her sick threw up, I gave her everything that wasn't enough
So I put two up, I'm hot, she cool, I call it a blue crush
We fucked, no kiss, that's it, fuck love
Snort drugs, make songs, go skate, daily life
Sarah or Dorothy, which one to make my wife
Or maybe I'll just marry both of them bitches, maybe twice
I was in love, but fuck it
Dorothy, my everything
She was my everything
Sarah, I love you

I celebrated, getting masturbated by my pastor
Now he's in a plastic, on the kitchen table
Near a bowl of Lucky Charms and the newest Thrasher
When I say Wolf Gang, you say fuck that
Room full of wolves, inhalers and used blunt wraps
Fingers in the middle of bitches bodacious butt cracks
Enough fucking atheist rappers to get a nun slapped
Um, that's not a potato, give me my gun back
Before I blast bigger than pimples on Big Pun's back
Black fat bitches was washin' on my dishes
And using my large stick on her lips like my cum's chapped
I love Jews but I hate faggots
And bitches who be nagging about me taking the trash out
I got a fuckin' can of whoop ass, who wants to pack it
Going ape shit in the newest bape straight jacket
With six dicks of chap stick, sticking in my black lips
Six sippie cups full of sick shit enhancements
Wolf Gang spit right
Ain't been this much fuckin' crack rock music since free way had flip side
So get low, lower than a ditch
I'm with some retarded bitch, hoping she know how to kiss low
They know, I'm the clinic's aid and I'm sick
So they clap for me kinda like a herpe on the lip
With some tutor bitch, tryna tickle wetback hooter this
Bitch acting I still did not know with it
Until I put this cock on, the end of clitoris
Fucking this game I used this shit as spit as lubricant
So who you with? 
I got this fuckin' gun, you better say yes you stupid bitch
Before you lose your wrist and rich make you do some dick
I'm fucking crazy, well I guess I am if these shoes will fit
Fuck the Key club, they wanna ban 'em
I got fucking fans from Compton to Montana
To Indiana, where deaf dwarfs still don't understand 'em
Because yelling at midgets is like me beefing with brandUn 
Stomp 'em out, with these crab ass Nikes
Make it look like some slob, scribbled all on his white Tee
Invite me, come on, you got a better chance to getting Shake
My dad and Earl's motherfuckin' momma to like me 
Animals is farming you, patrick this is barnacles
Said he gave Ace a spongejob at the carnival
And Spongebob got his head knocked from the piss that Ace got
Nigga's soft as baby cock and the cotton swab
This that fuck music, put your shit and fuck to it
Shouldn't give one when your bumping in the trunk to it
Grab a couple gats, stuff 'em in your backpack and then take 'em to school
For show and tell day screamin' "fuck students"
Locate the bitch that didn't wanna give you kiss
Then get her tits, then use your fists to add a couple lumps to it
Shoot the faculty for taking hats, you stupid butts
Skip the music teacher and the janitor you real cool with
Continue this procedure until lunch is through with
Go home out the back like a scared student
Keep a low pro, until you on your block
Then you just make it home in time for new news brief at 2ish
Stuck at all this bible study, shit is not fun
Me and wolf gang go jump nuns for hot fun
Playing with the bell when shots heard, and cops come
But I'm still punchin' this bitch out, I'm not done
Sittin' in my room masturbating
Truthful, these lyrics are relating like my dad did
I make music for teenagers and bad ass kids
Bastard touched more boys than your local church did
Killing these niggas off quick
Don't believe me then watch me empty out a full clip
Trigger being pulled, niggers in a ditch
That wasn't bullets, that was copies of Bastard you bitchHey... you...
Looking good in that skirt
Flirting is the effective way that this works
Bingo  how about we go
Down to the lake and eat a couple of pringles
Picnic by the way, hey I’m single
Pardon my bad manners, french and lingo
Intentions were  brighter than the summer
Reflection in the lake being seen by Stevie
You're a golden lady and it seems that me and you
We’re supposed to be the ozone team but who
Would have thought this conversation would have grew
Into me talking about sun rays with you!
I’m turning to a creep, that just won’t sleep
Next sex, that's cause you used to that kind of poo
See I'm the new shit in town
Lets mash together and make new browns
How that sound?
Hey, shit, it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me
Oh it sounds cool to me
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
It sounds cool to me!
Hey girl, that shit sounds cool to me!
Shit sounds good to me!White bitches, white girls, white drugs
Black girls don't do it but my type does
Fuck it in my white van, beat her with a nice white nightstand
Until I give her gashes where it's nothin' but the white meat
E-T-I-H, W's, double D's on her knees
White gargle yellow fuckin' bumblebees
Use whitey's as my dinner course for intercourse
So much fuckin' white make Darth Vader have a thinner force
But of course, I'm the white boy that shows no remorse
Pull up on a stark with enough white to kill a horse
Blacc Friday, fuck a Nigga Friday, umm
Wolf Gang make a white pregnant bitch wan' abort
Bring the remainin' red and white pieces to the fort
Odd Future, there wolves bang where a couple bears hang
With a white box logo with a couple stains
From a black creampie in a whitey, make it light gray
Oh wow, Obilivion stump
I do not know how that dead body got inside of my trunk
What the fuck? Gee Willikers and no, I'm not drunk
I coulda sworn that Budweiser can read fruit punch
Let you sip casually when you tryna lose calories
I'm not a murderer, this occurance that isn't happenin'
Is sporadically damagin' my reputation
See I'm a good guy but when I see dead casualties
My penis gets erected and nipples are such aroused
And the blouses of these bitches always end up in my house
And three hours in the showers with the corpse
I've ejaculated enough semen to sink a boat what, umm
Riley's body's entirely covered and tied up
From my desire, now look at the fuckin' irony
I killed my manager with an iron
All because the bitch finally decided to fire me
Back at Travis' house even though that faggot admires me
All because I heard that he was talkin' to Danielle
So now that I finally made that fags head handheld
He can finally help me masturbate and read fan mail 
First letter says motherfucker you're dead
The king of comedy heard everythin' that you said
And Just in Time your head is mine
You crossed the fuckin' line like them dirty Mexicans
Second letter reads: "Hey son, it's me"
Fuck you, I'm a subject without my permission
Third letter quote hey Ace I'm addicted to coke
Wanna ask how I been so?
I make songs about shit for attention
Put them out randomly hopin' that I get some
I got problems in my head that I want, no
But I don't trust anybody, yeah no one
Savin' up 24 bullets with gun
Cause I got demons that I cannot let out, umm
Hopefully the next album can help me out
Cause I'm now, livin' this life with foolproof doubts
So, I just need someone to talk to, kinda rushed
But nobody gives a fuck, fuck it, signed anonymousNiggas just rapping 'cause like

That's 400 for my exhaust, the mean with the walk
Now tell the Black Youth, to just be
Tell 'em never stop
Yeah we all moving, but you ain't gotta put us in a box

I'm eighteen, you from around here?
Oh, you look like my next victim
I said you look like my ex-girlfriend, sister
While James is jamming on the mixer
We can play Twister naked
Don't be afraid, it's just a kiss
I'm open to everything if you're inviting your sister
That's another topic, we should start a project
You could be the lab rat, I could be the doctor
Let me drug you up and put different things in you
But I'm not gonna do that until you begin to pass out
Now I can draw your face up pretty
Or do it jackass and leave your breath all shitty
Or I can get the hand held and hold held titty
And stick my dick in you but that just might offend you
Teenage parties, I recommend you
Never get drunk with a nigga like us
But I kinda like your company
And you rubbing on my dick, yeah it comforts me
Fuck, condom pocket, luckily, I brought one
Herpes virus, yeah bitch, I fought one
I don't want you to have my permit yet
That I just haven't came up with a name yet
I got some new shit, well technically, I got a new dick
The other one fell off in a pulpit
A gay coaches' white grease and Chris Stokes
Blew the fuck up in gray clouds of thick smoke
Funny, right? Ha-ha, this shit's jokes
I got the idea from a letter that the shit wrote
Hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's dance
I said hey, you right there
In that pretty red dress, let's fuck 
Well, I have a gram cupcake mix
Mix a little syrup, it ain't no way to cure him
But I don't do the syrup, I just do the sniffles
Take a couple bits, bitch kibbles, bitch I gotta riddle
What can you tickle that can make a dinosaur giggle
I'm tryna get your puss, your pimple is a push
Away from the tush, I don't smoke kush
I don't do drugs, I don't even club
I don't drink beer, why the fuck am I here
The girls are really cute but there on X
And that's a better reason to for me to take advantage with sex
And you might be next, you pass out on
Me and your mouth drool, throw you in my van now it's carpool
Let you rest your ass on my dick like a barstool
Going deep like a scuba with the snorkle
You never gonna forgive me, but your so damn pretty
I'mma drop you off home quickly
You passed out, bitch you ain't even listening
And leave your house empty, your neighbors didn't see me
Your never gonna get me, your self respect were skimpy
You was up thirty, now you're down fifty
Abracadabra your memory I'm tricky
You are what I rob so I guess your pussy empty
Just like your home by taking the store of oreos
Over by the cabin of cheerios and the mint tea
Yep. But.. I had fun, tonight..A-C-E, O-F, uh
Wild, I'm not tame just because my visions are strange
I am normal not deranged, I am not a fucking lame
Your pee dripping wet, I need all my nutrients
On the phone, if I take you home how much can I get?
Yeah, I like you but, you act like you don't like us
We could start a whole new religion girl, in Odd we trust
You play hard to got, got me hard like cement
Here's my car I love please do not dip, please just
 go
 go
 go
 wait
 go
 go
 go
 wait
I'm a fucking monster, my Tonka is trucker
In my locker got books, I'm a nasty mothafucker
Truth or dare in the cemetery, right past the elementary
My faith lasts for the whole century
You could bite my neck or I could bite your neck
Or you could bite her and excite her you will not regret
My castle got dungeons, my dungeons got dungeons
Open up them legs, let me see what's for luncheon
 go
 go
 go
 wait
 go
 go
 go
 wait
And the sky is dark
The bats invade the park
The water swims the shark
But don't just wait, goI'm Ace, what's your name? 
Oh that's nice, do you wanna hang out some time
That time on the clock, we could either go to Rosco's or Wingstop
Unless, you wanna see a flick, my homie work at pacific
That means I could get a ticket for a couple six bucks
But that's priceless compared to getting my dick sucked girl
I'm just playing, I'm not really hanging out with you for laying
I'm tryna mold a relationship I'm claying
So I can hear your thoughts and see what your saying
Favorite color, AP Government, this conversation I'm loving it
We can talk about your favorite music, talk about politics
I got an open mind I'm into all type of shit
I just wanna be your friend girl 
I just wanna be your friend girl 
We could go to the movies, you don't gotta kiss me
I could pull my pants down, you don't gotta lick me
Even if we go to the bathroom, I'll help you, we don't have to getta quickie
We could have study groups, girl just hang with me
 yeah, 
Look bitch  I'm not here to conversate, and listen to all your feelings, aight?
I got things to do, my daughter hungry, bills to pay, and games to watch 
I don't feel like listening to your feelings and how you feel and your favourite colour and all that 
If I can't put nothing in you, I shouldn't put no time in you , you understand what I'm saying? 
Holla at your boy, here's a lesson to all men 
Yo, if she trying to stay in that friend zone, zone her ass to her friends 
 N-no, don't give me that, don't give me that

Got the fuckin' window tinted, 'cause I needed the shade
And that E30 Bimmer, that you ain't seen since you a teen
Uh, back in '91, when they was doin' E and P and D at the arena
Macarena, Hayna, Jayna, Shayda, Raida, Aida
I'm back from LA, with Mexicans, they love the Raiders
But I don't watch football, I just watch the crooks ball
With them fuckin' eight balls, sellin' inside the hall of the high school
I was not cool, niggas thought that I was weird and shit, they kept they space
But it's cool, 'cause now I got they amazin' grace, nigga
How many M's? It don't matter how much I make

'Cause I got a lil' date with this dude real quick
We gon' go prolly get some ice cream, and do-, oh, wait a minute
He just got off his damn last shift
And he said that his momma can't do the dishes
So he gotta go help her
So I'm gonna go weep, and look for someone on Yelp
But, wait, that's not a dating app
So what you use, Tinder, Grindr
Get with all your niggas, and get right behind 'em
What, you gon' do me like your DM, and slide 'em, hm
Flex send me emoji
No, there's no emoji, I didn't send an emoji, wait a minute
Now, Flex, why you lyin'
Why you tryna play me like change and 50 Cent when he was dyin'
Tryin' just to get it, get it, I split it
I read it in it, and intended, your head was in it, um, mwah, I kiss it, nigga
Scooby Doobie, oobie the lubie
Me and Flex was cuddled up watchin' Scooby Doo and eatin' Scooby snacks
He said he, "Wanted my boobies"
I said, "I don't got 'em"
He said, "Whatever, nigga, I rock 'em"
We stock-a-bock 'em, ocka-rock 'em, tacka-dock 'em

But bitch you dumb as fuck to right from wrong 
 You're on my bed, but Simon's red
Now Simon says get the fuck out my life
Cause you're not my wife, bitch you're a stand for this night
And you could be a stab for this knife
I'm seventeen , you're twenty-six 
You're a divorced slut and you can't suck dick 
You dropped outta college, you can't pay shit
But I'm broke as fuck too, bitch, we on the same boat 
Where's my inhaler? I think I'm gonna puke
Cause I can't believe I lost my virginity to you

Crawls right down the crack of your ass
Booty meat snackin' , back that ass up
Until you come back up and lick my sack up
I'm Tyler, the Creator
Hang with thrashers and skaters
I do sound like Darth Vader
But that's not stoppin' me from eating your muffin
I think you and your friends
Should come with me to get your salad tossed
'Cause when I make this stew in your gold pot
I'm adding extra sauce
Because...

Shake that ass and don't make vibrations stop
BitchI get high in Ohio
Fucken' coke and a smile
Devil reading the bible
Reverends triggered the rifle
Animal heads important to the back yard again
Bury the Backyardigans
Blood covers my button up in step fathers cardigan
Erect a pistol, eject a clip full of missiles
A bodybag, to clean the gory issue
Closed casket, faggot, burn the house down with you
End this shit to end this shit
Does heaven have a membership?
Because I pick up angels by a pistol whip
This time she's so beautiful and me
Unusual to see
Shove her in the trunk, you can go with me
You like my FreshJive shirt, well I can give you one for free
Cause' when I wished for it I found me on a killin' spree
...Just leave up to me
My mom caught me jackin' off to Hannah Montana with a banana peel
Sippin' a cherry Fanta to match my dress and my purple heels
Looking like I'm Santa but skinny in a black weave, it's real
In a stolen truck with my license to kill
I tell em' "I'm Frank from Montana, the king of the hill"
Except I'm a nigga from the junk yard gang
Bill Cosby couldn't spot me if I copied a duck in a bill
Simply cause I do not give a fuck like virginity
Illmatic with the tactics
I do not give a fuck how you feel, I got wolf
I flow backwards like heat when it chills on a thermometer
A skatin', rappin', composin' photographer is
Back like a black bitch's hairline, kilometer
Hotter than Madonnadoo-doo mama back-up dancers with the windows rolled up inside the Honda driving through Nevada during summer
Tyler, comma, the Creator is a fucking animal
I'm such spitting like a llama niggaIgnorant, Atheist, sound like a fucking monster
Tall, skinny, lanky, buck it, fuck it badass posture
Cops are angering the hell
Where they discounted mounted
With the devil, he was formal and some Polo and some Dockers
Dancing with him playing vengeance Cindi Lauper with some Crips
In all red like they playin' Red Lobster
My bitch is white Italian to be exact
Mobster is her father and he'll kill me
When he finds out I'm reading her Harry Potter
FUCK HIM!, Im a Demon fill your daughter up with semen
With Supreme embroidered logos, making fun of homos cause its funny
Tommy rugby hilfiger screaming nigga with the klux
I'm a fuckin' Nazi with a condom, barely give a fuck
Odd Future Wolf Gang, Fuck Lame, 91'
We hockey fuckin' awesome, hit you with the Wolf Gang puck
Puck, trucks thunder now shes in the trunk wondering why shes about to get raped and chopped up, lumber
He said, write a sixteen, well she was seventeen
And I'm only eighteen and that's statutory rape
And if you fuckin' snitch on me I guess i'll make the great escape
To have a date with your dead body and I cannot be late
Might do a Ted Bundy, I can consider ya'll some haughtys
If they find me at my home, guess I gotta fuckin roam
All alone ,in the streets, gotta hustle drugs for food
Gotta sell beats for clothes if I really wanna eat
Fuck you, O.F.M. Bangin' on your mothafuckin' FM
Fuck TammyWolf fucking Haley
I'm not fucking crazy, fucking crazy
Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Okay, it's my turn to rap 
Fucking modern day Ian Curtis I oughta been
The motherfuckin' bulls was hotter than a Dennis Rod-a-Man
All the men and girls was tied up inside a cottage and
Raquel, Riley, Brandun, Alexis, fuckin' Milan and them
House’s egg yolking, motherfuckin' ain’t joking
Throats chokin' hulkin that motherfuckers like I’m Hulk Hogan
Halloween at Neverland Ranch? I’m Macaulay Culkin
Fuckin' Superbad swag when I murder Seth Rogen
I’m sick, this asthma, takin' 6 Robitussin
I’m fuckin' this game up no trojans for the semen
On the boat, better vote and fuckin' pray
Even though the pope is bogus
Even though I’m hyped the dopest
2Dope don’t wanna post us
Copy all we are off how we all are rockin
And they kosher but don’t trip
My pockets got a loaf of that
I’ll show you how you’re supposed to rap
Yeah, for the blonde bitches
They say they enjoy the vision
I’m the man now the boys missin' from the decision
My television is eclectic
How can he move on Waka Flocka and back to Joy Division?
Yeah, I said that I received info now the surgeon is missing
Probably cause I dressed up as a nurse
Went it to his office, gave him his cup of coffee
Aw, now he is feeling nauseous buzzin' me to walk in
Takin’ all the doctor calls, ask her to prescribe
A bunch of shit that he can munch and such
He asked what was in the coffee, I just coughed a blush
Whatchu say? 
Hit him with the uppercut then cut him up
With the roughest tools
And I found out the wolves had
Aten some sections of ugly sluts
Fuck! Now I got blood on my new fuckin' sneakers and stuff
Fuck it, storage room where this doctor's getting his body stuffed
By this fuckin' awesome, thrashin' African that’s marvelous
With green supreme hats, smoker’s head, it was a pot of luck
I love Taylor Swift, Date Rape Sirloin, in a wife beater with a Chris Brown iron-on
Bitch, I’m tighter than a stogie and a lighter
The cuts thats on Taylor or the Braces when I bite her
After that I will retain her from leaving gaps and gashes
When I brush her with the rubber bands leaving gummy rashes
Laughing Gas, Pass her out, fool beat this
Cause I’ll do to her what my father didn’t really give
And that’s not hard to figure out but just in case it is
I’ll make it really hard to get it out, if you catch my drift
Wolf, Gang

Surprised she hasn't did school stuff in the alley oop
Golf Wang hooligans messing up the school again
Showing you and yours that doing stuff is really cool again
I'm going harder than a midget jumping over me
Look at my hat, it's cool
Punches to the stomach where that other stuff's supposed to be
Forget this man, yeah!
It's the Wolf Gang, Wolf Gang
Wolf Gang, triple six crew
My love is gone for you Tommy, you can go figure
Now it's time for me to be a real, hey 
This beat is real nice 
So I'mma spit like I ain't never spit before
And I'mma walk through that.. door 
And I'mma make all that.. dough
So is you messing with me? No
This that Wolf Gang, this that, this that Wolf Gang
Green hats and green gats, knocking everybody on their back
Mess around with me and I'm gon scratch your cat, uh!
They don't know us, they don't know us
They don't know where we from, they don't know nothing
I ain't jokingI'm recordin' that shit on the fuckin' little mic
By the little camera thing on the fuckin' Mac book
So this shit is choppy and bad quality, but fuck it
Wolf Gang, Ace Creator
Somebody tell Justin Beiber that I'm fuckin' coming
Ain't no point in runnin', I'm a nigga, just a little quicker
So I catch him stretchin', have him guessin' where his cracker throat
Chop his balls off and use his skin to make a baby coat
Ain't he dope? No, he the same as shit that Tyler wrote
This is Ace, Wolf is in the back with Travis snortin' coke
Riley's here, Connie's dead, pickin' pussy pisses pike
She won't leave, dick as big as Kelly Price's appetite
Apprehend a couple men, triple six is fuckin' sin
Make Queen Latifah and Sydney go slap a couple dykes
Wrap around 'til they hit the ground and they hear a sound
That doesn't make sense like nigga kids wearing cap and gowns
This my album, and when your parents try to come around
Do the fuckin' exact opposite of turnin' it down
And when they try to get parental and start talkin' loud
Tell them that you're from the Wolf Gang and you're fuckin' proud
Then start barkin' loud 'til the neighbors wanna calm you down
But call the pigs, who'll probably come in bout a half an hour
Tell them that your sorry, you're a cow, took a fuckin' shower
But make it in time for shitty re-runs of Rocket Power
This is the shit that is makin' me cynical
The clinical attempts at schizophrenia's critical
Fuckin' voices follow me, emulatin' like twitter roll
O.F. is a cult, assume that I'm the fucking general
So when I mention suicide, I'm being Mr. Literal
The coke inside nine capsules, fuck it let's split a roll
Life is like a phone booth, these pigeons is the fuckin' toll
1-800-fuck-this-shit
Seven years old in my heart, so I'm stayin' gold
But when I fuckin' go, Lucifer will probably have my soul
It's hot down there, fuck that, bitch I'm hot as coals
Out the microwave, mixed with a bowl of yellow raviol
And a firetruck and Arizona durin' summertime
In a turtle neck, thermal jeans, spit purple wine
Wolf Gang pete and gon' live, running outta time
The fuck I give is the same as the next line
 That's what my conscience said
Then it bunny hopped off my shoulder, now my conscience dead
So the only guidance that I had is splattered on cement
Actions speak louder than words, let me try this shitI might just add a verse for no reason, fuck it
Ayo
I sit in my garden and play Stevie Wonder
And get foot massages while Clancy talk numbers
He threw me some game and I swear I won't fumble
Might cop me a Bronco to ride for the summer
Marni the trousers, tell Risso to holla
The carnival sell out, the stadium Dodger
Cut off some homies, but Taco my brodie
Until he score millions, I won't leave the goalie
Pass 'em the mittens, he never betrayed me
The E30 sitting, the LT my daily
The engine is stupid, I drive like a tutor
When I move, it moves, the transmission like Luda
Ketchup like packets, my new nigga pretty
Your new bitch is tacky like Busta Rhymes jackets
Want smoke? I can match it, that second-hand action
We exhale you inhale and asthma attack
Teeing off, niggas nauseous as fuck
Fuck you thought? Bitch, it's GOLF
Brand new whip got no keys
Tailor my clothes, no starch, please
Soon as I nut, you can gon' leave
Got M's in the bank, like: "Yes, indeed"
This shit going crazy, I swear I go crazy
I never met him but man shout out Lil Baby
We running the thing *gibberish* I just ran out of wordsHey guys 
I'm Peter Rosenberg, super-underground
You know me, uh, you see my laptop, yeah, I mean
Apple is pretty mainstream but I have underground stickers
So it levels out..
Y'all niggas got it twisted, we ain't the Misfits
We the sick shit, make the competition slit wrists
Bodybag, beats get rapped like it's Christmas
Popping tags, I stay in Dior cause I'm Christian
Nigga listen: I been killing shit since I was the
Age of the face that R. Kelly pissed in
In the booth, I'm brawling to be like the Pistons
Only smoke flight, you can't hit if you ain't pitched in!
And bitch stop talking, let the marijuana sink in
And when that chauffeur roll up, you better get in
You and your 6 friends, even your big friend
Got a gang of wolves that slay hoes like henchmen
O.F. kill someone, yeah nigga we shipped it
Local ass nigga, we overseas on you dipshits
Walking flex tweet, motherfucker take a Twitpic
Kidnapped the game and it won't quit bitching
Duct tape, bow knife, now I’m breaking in homes
And now I’m in the closet with Kelly, we’re watching The Throne
And 'till I get that mothafucka I'll be watching ya home
And gonna tryna go harder than me hiding a boner
With lights on it, see I was the loner
Now I got a bunch of fucking Lindsay Lohans
That don’t even know me, tryna get me that old hand
Job, fuck that ho blow me
The G.I. Joe of O.F. is slowly
Solely running shit his toes is swollen
Goblin left the bridge, no more patrolling
Stick my finger in any hole I can find, fuck bowling
I’m making that bread, jabronni, and the green shit that’s growing is stuck
My Bank account is molding
Me and Wanda Sykes was holding hands 'till I eat her cooter
Like a fresh bowl of Ravioli, Chef Boyar-T
On tour, had to make a couple pit stops
Ended at this fucking hipster club called the Pin Drop
Where they said they hated on me and Odd Future kids
And how much they really love underground hip-hop
We don’t give a fuck like a virginized dick cock
After being tickled by a couple Eddie Bishops
Young niggas OF, got this
Come to my show and see niggers in the moshpit
Cat on my cotton, zebra print 5 panel from Jebbia
Now I’m flyer than an ostrich
VMA nom, yes! Video my set
Harder than Nakel not nolling a nine set
Thrasher, billboard, cover of them issues
Boy flow colder than O'Shay stuck in an igloo
I'mma fuck the game till my herpes-covered dick's bruisedI'm rolling through Ladera in a Bimmer looking cleaner
Drinking on a blueberry Slurpee, eating that fajita
My passenger seat is occupied by señorita
And mother keeps on bugging me about wanting to meet her
I don't really need her, I'm just tryna treat her real nice
And later on, up in the night, I could go eat her
And make a lie about the gonorrhea
So she don't feel guilty about me wanting to leave her
That "FUCK" on my t-shirt print is cheetah
And I got that '87 bunny flow, like an Easter
Basket, you faggots is plastic, like nerds with old glasses
But I'm still liable to get my ass kicked
Kinda sorta active, a Baby Milo addict in the attic
Where you losers can't get me
Nikon and the Canon, they were never the same
And please do not take a picture, I can't be seen with you lames
Man, y'all some muthafuckin' lames
Man, y'all some muthafuckin' lames
Don't lie to yourself, y'all some lames
Man, y'all some l— fuckin' lames
The Canon don't flash, y'all some lames

Ahem
Tyler, the Creator

Me and— , no Rockwell, I'm a rock star
Fuck y'all, the O.F. is banging on 'em
Custom crewnecks rolling 'round with Ronald Regan on 'em 
Y'all drug dealers, I Carl Sagan on 'em
Chop and screw Nas tracks, I got piano's waiting on 'em
My shirt is yellow, but the grill is gold
I couldn't take the Rit-lin 'cause my therapist said the pill is old
I can't stay  lost control
I don't have sense, sorry, I sold my soul
For some gold Bapes; low-price, stale rate
Authentic, never fake, check the poll, our statistics
Stay with authentics, check my steelo
Cause my mob's goodie like we Cee-Lo, and he know
I am, yes, and even she know
Every instrument is a gram, kilo 
O.F.M.
Bangin' on your F.M.
Ace the CreatorTall skinny flaco, that's for my nigga Paco

Dumber than corny jokester, horny hoes wanna poke me
I'm dope you wanna smoke me, you don't know the effects
Of an asshole perspective, fuck respect
I think my asthma flaring, but Sarah wasn't caring
She left, so I beat my fucking meat just like abusive parents
Hot like Fahrenheit, I'm tight just like virgin twat
Fucking awesome that I am but a lot of swag that I'm not
Ace the Creator, chronic masturbator
I'm sipping on some, pissing on some, kissing on some bitch
That I just met and I'mma fuck her, cause she wet
I use no rubber and I make it stretch like Flubber, what you thought
"I'm not under-covers" just like the cosby sheet on my cock like police be
Y'all niggas see me, AC, OF,fuck it
Macaroni, I'm horny, these bitches on me like herpes
These bitches coughing I'll eat they coochie, I'm burping like Burpie
These niggas looking at me like I'm Ernie, but I'm more Berthy
Shit that I'm rocking it ticking and tocking
No watch and no chain, I do not make it rain, I bring the drought
Cause it's money I'm without, the shoes is fucking beat up
The dirties fucking heat up, them nolly treasures see us
The "fuck you buster" skate video coming, two-thousand and nine
We fine, we flying high, in the sky
Naw we flying in Ocean, the potion, I got the motion like
Piano keys got these bitches on they knees
Begging please like uno, dos, tres, three
Mexican bitches they love the cock like they love the cheese

Could you please tell me what you know about skippin' 24, 25
'Cause your mom was at her 9-to-5
Still stacking up the dough
I was wrapping gifts age six with the paper bandanas
Mom was always honest, I ain't never had a Santa Claus
She was my amigo like my buddies from Atlanta
We was hopin' for a signal, too afraid to change the channel, yo
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
Run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
I run up the back, you runnin' to that
I run off the back, you runnin' to that
That's a big step, snow boots
But it's hot in herre, '02
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Quick, fast, big Max with the big bag, I throw 'em
You stay up, get cake up
For new gifts I take 'em
You wake up like big mad 
Roof to roof, I jump, I jump, I take, I take
It feels the void, I want, I want 
Way that I sneak in
I'm about as low as self-esteem when I creep in 
Don't make noise, my feet thin
I'm looking for the paper, same color my green skin
Toys what is on the list
When it comes to this, I'm too legit
Tell all them kids that he be the Grinch
When they ask who has type of heart to do this
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag, fill 'em up with the produce
Big bag
It's meAnd I present to you
To you all
The Odd Future compilation
The fuck? Give it up
Starring
Casey V, Hodgy Beats, Left Brain, Super 3, and Tyler, the Creator
Give it up! Give it up for ‘em!
Will y'all shut the fuck up?
Damn, I’m here
Alright, let me configure this
Get this ready
Alright, let’s go
Nigga seventeen his own fucking magazine
And of course, his Hunger Force is Aqua Teen by all means
Fuck a deal, signature is legible
I'm the reason why niggas is heatin' up they vegetables
From being bullied in the sixth, to being dissed by any bitch
That can breath, please throw me in a ditch
And I hope I sell a copy of this disk
Fuck Hope, I am one short, a miracle of wish
Whether you nigga or ese, the magazine is great
Because the articles an essay
Half you dumb niggas can't even write an essay
Cause all of ya'll some stupid asses, S.A
You motherfuckers in denial
I'm the square just like the tile, right down the fucking isle
Music was my only friend, ever since I was a child
I make niggas frown, just to give myself a smile
Mother was my father, the nigga didn't bother
To send a kid a dollar, my only role model was
Niggas that record and that could play keyboards
And wild piano chords make me happy
Dr. Suess more important than Jesus
Y'all immigrants to depression, nigga give me a visa
We sick, the same lames that sneeze us
Made us turn to Jazz now, because the black kids would tease us
I need a fucking chain, I need to make it rain
I need some fucking rims, a car that I can rent
A verse about swag, jeans sagging off my ass
No I don't, fuck that, I am not a fucking fag
I rhyme and I'm still scared of guns
In the marching band but I bang my own drums and
Sing my own song, all of my wrongs are right
Never got into a fight, hit me
Bass, drum, snare, let it go
Disappear like good music in the past year
And everybody do the same thing, I hear the same shit
All the time, like the radio is queer
This isn't a mixtape, it's more of ear rape
By kids who think you other niggas suck
It's very offensive, you niggas defensive
If you can't take the heat then get the fuck out the kitchen, listen
Tyler the Creator, Hodgy Beats, Super 3, Casey V, Left Brain
Enjoy the show, good night, thank you, and fuck youDrip drop, the angels made a pit stop
Pissin' on the demons of the Earth
What’s it really worth? Shit, now it's fuckin' pourin'
Wanted to go skate, can't, now my day is borin', damn
Snorin' in the bed with blankets cause my head spin
Probably cause I popped a couple purple Excedrins
It's a rainy day, so I'll skip the Led Zeppelin
And play some Sade "Love Deluxe" through my headset
On my way home I punched a bitch for an umbrella
Why? Cause I really didn’t wanna get my shit wet
Run through the puddles, playin' in the mud
Fun, sucks that I'm too tall for the tub
Or I would get my toys and make a lotta noise
While my mom is in the kitchen cookin' up a meal
Fire place is startin' up, dick is barely warmin' up
Sippy cup full of whip creamed hot chocolate
I can smell it when I go outside
Then it just pours
It gives us peace then all in the town is quiet
That's what rain's for
All the kids see rain and scream "No, no"
Run off the bus and they will just stay in
Me I love how rain fills the potholes
Me and my sailboat, that's what we played in
Ever wonder exactly where the sun goes
Did it go or did somethin' shade it?
The sun gives light cause it is the window
The rain gives life cause it is amazin'
Lightning is striking, water hittin' on my window like Ike
I am not Tina, buddy, do not give my window pain
Lights bulbs when wearin' that wig, flyin' kites
Here's an idea, why don't I go hiking
On a fuckin' mountain where the water fountains icing
Stand there in a tank top prop that's from Baywatch
And eat about four bowls of some frozen ice cream
Get sick and then I won't have to
Go to school today, tomorrow, the day after
Sit in bed, write a bunch of raps up
And I won't be lyin' when I say I’m a sick rapper
I might fail so I won't bother
The sun is playin' hide and seek like my fuckin' father
The only difference is it comes back, full effect
In the summer heats up, the thermometers erected
The inside of clouds
That's the window into the sky
Proves there's lifeIt's gettin' cold, chocolate
Too warm, chocolate
It's too hot , chocolate
Leche for my  damn self
Hot chocolate
You can use water
Hot chocolate
I prefer milk if it's 2%
Marshmallows on top and some extra whip
You can even use cinnamon, cinnamon on top
Hot chocolate
By the fire, I sip hot cocoa tonight
It makes me feel all right
It's Christmas time 
Jigsaw puzzle with my buddies
Tonight is our big night
It's Christmas time 
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertime
Cold that's my favorite, cold that's my favorite time
It gets cold in the winter, cold in the wintertimeAfter the joy, half laughter the book
Of the kids favorite motherfucking chapter
No need to be a actor 
So the fat nigga could drink my motherfucking milk
I wan't some gold bapes I want a prom date
Sloppy ass musty bitch, that's overweight
I wan't a new piano,record deal, new pills, therapist
I'm pissed 
Jingle balls and I'm fucking Mrs. Clause
Have her climbing up the wall, while he givin' ya'll gifts
He ain't never gave me shit
My mom bought the wrapping, and the shit that influenced
Me to start rapping. It's not a joke, chilling with the Polar Bear
That used to work for coke, santa's sniffin' coke
My Santa Letter Wrote
Fuck you, whiney Malcolm X movie, try me
And I'm stealing Harry Potter's Cloak
Middle East was his birthday, 25th I'd rather get gifts
So why the fuck would I go out my way to celebrate birthday
I'm selfish what the fuck I look like buying a gift
Hide em, bed under the couch
Rad kid done smashed they motherfucking ginger house
And Jesus don't know me, he ain't my homie
Our friendship sits on a self
Santa go and molest an elf
Prancer, Jingle, Rudolf
Drunk driving at night, a peppermint Smirnoff
Santa little buzz, and forgot to switch gears off
My childhood is here, never ever ever smirnoff
Snowman robbing little girl, boys, for toys
And G.I. Joes, and here his fat ass go on my roof
Like Ho Ho 
Christmas tree's green, and this time of year clean
Make me wanna go and do things 
Nigga's in a tinsel, sleighbell blow whistle
Alana, Raquel, hope ya'll under the missle-toe
The house is decorated, and man I'm frustrated
Cause' I didn't get shit that I really wanted
New Years zoom like a mother fucking Mazda
But at the end I wanna' know what the fuck is Kwanzaa?
(What is it? Nobody Knows...Nobody Knows
Anybody?)
Merry Christmas, Happy Holidays
Fuck It, I'm still a kid
Bout' to go have a snowball fight
In the middle of LA
Steal some Christmas trees, set em' on fire
Eat some gingerbread cookies
Shit, I don't know
It's the time to enjoy life
You Know?
Happy Holidays from us at Odd Future
And, Fuck you. Fuck You. Fuck YouTell Theresa May to let me in
I've been going in since 2010
It gotta be the color of my skin
Cause there's nigga's there
That doing more damage than my pen, man
Said some old lines was offensive
I was young, I can't apologize for that shit
They took my fiction literature for literal
I ain't no motherfuckin' criminal
The fuck is the problem, my record ain't got no smudges
Shit is clean as a whistle, and they just blow in them grudges
Let the kids see a show, that's what they waiting to see
It ain't no drugs on my bus, boy, my edges are straighter than me
So what the fuck is the problem? That lil Black boy made it
He's got a little bit of power and these white niggas hate it
And now he talking shit again, his stupid ass should have waited, fuck
They said I was a bad influence to who?
The camouflage following niggas like you?
Or all the free thinkers that know what it do?
Cause I'm one of them
See Ace is a king, I don't need your respect
So I made my own shoes, fuck that royalty check
I don't need your opinion, keep a mirror on deck
So don't you talk to me
It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego
It might just be my ego right now
Clancy you should calm me down
It's my ego
Or maybe it's my ego
It might just be my motherfuckin' ego
Well maybe it's my motherfuckin' ego when I'm ruling the world
And I ain't proving shit to niggas who just want me to fail
Niggas is fronting saying we distant cousins
While y'all pants was always flowing, all my trousers was flooded
Mad niggas be watching my moves, I never copped my props
For everybody and they momma got a problem with shock
Y'all niggas trash, y'all niggas trash 
Same niggas laugh when you making shit
Then three years later wanna emulate the shit you did
Y'all pay the price
Ask some old friends, that shit is over and finished
Look around in the crowd, them niggas not even attendance
That shit is done, and Lionel  my witness
But I had to move on cause I can't fuck with them niggas
I shut it down
Now wow, now he's saying that one day
He found his wings, now he using 'em on his runway
Pink yellow, blue and orange, shit is dark
Different pattern, you say the same shit from the start
Niggas I am a wave, y'all just fuck with the sharks
And I got flames on my pants cause I walk how I talk
So keep them comments, keep them comments, keep them comments, boy
When it's said and done my pockets gon' be filled with commas, boy
Y'all , y'all saying this
Y'all niggas say that shit is gross, that shit is nasty, eww get away boy, I'm good
And if you see my old friends, tell 'em that I really miss 'em but I'm good
And if you see some bad times, tell 'em I don't really miss 'em, boy I'm good
And if you see my old self, tell him not to worry cause he'll be good

Don't keep me starving, bitchJerrod: This album, um—like when I, when I first heard it and the more I hear it, I feel like the only, like, appropriate question to ask you after listening to it is, are you okay? Like, is something wrong? Like, like, it's like gut-wrenching. It's both beautiful—it's very beautiful—but it's like, parts that hurt a little bit, you know what I mean?
Tyler: Yeah it's—man I was like... 'Cause for Cherry Bomb I purposely was like, "I don't wanna get personal at all. Like I'mma just make songs. This is all just, this is a song." And in this one I was like, "Alright, let me write down every feeling."
J: Oh, you started with emotions?
T: Just—just, a lot of them was just asking questions. A lot of the songs just have questions, it's just like, "How am I feeling today? Fuck, what if I go poor again? What if it doesn't work?" And then that's how a lot of the songs just happened, just me kind of, just asking these quest—answering these questions, like, so...
J: But it's speaking to, like, a mood you were in. Like—like you recorded this one, when did you...
T: Um, mostly 2016—like I started to the end of 2015. A lot of spring, summer 2016, and then a lot of fall
J: What were you listening to? Like—
T: Um...
J: Like watching and listening to?
T: Pop music. I love—I was, like, listening to pop structure. Uh, kinda just what, like, Max Martin was doing and really getting into what, what Pharrell and Justin was doing—
J: Yeah...
T: And, um, just noticing, just hooks. I uh—hanging out with Travis, Taco. I went to the club with him and just seeing what people, how people reacted to certain—
J: You never go to clubs!
T: I hate 'em. But when I would go I would just study, "Oh, that, that bass drop," or,  "Oh, that girl loves that part." Just like, "Okay, I want to have a song that has that feeling." So I kind of was like, okay. I wanna see—challenge myself and try to make a few songs that's not like, "Uh, rappity-rappy," or, super distorted, I was like... Last night, I went to—me and Lionel went to like a house party and they, they, all the songs they were playing—"Señiorita" by Justin, "Tell Me" by Total, "Frontin'" by P—like, all these house partying songs. And "See You Again" came on, and it's full of black people, that for sure go to clubs, and they were in there, like, singing the lyrics and I was like, "Oh shit, I've always wanted that."
J: To just have black people... dance...
T: I, I did it. Yeah, yeah! I was so hyped, and I was—we were playing Jenga and I was being cool about it but inside I was like, "Oh shit—"
J: You were going crazy—
T: I finally have something that they could do that to
J: It's funny because I guess I wouldn't have, uh, like thought about how much like pop is, you know, influenced in the album because, because of like the subject matter. Like, a lot of it is so heavy. That's why I was just wondering, were you in like a place of just like...?
T: Well, uh, you gotta feed, you put the—some people, old people say you put the medicine in like the uh, the candy—
J: The applesauce
T: —Or the applesauce, whatever, so...
Like, with "Mr. Lonely" I was like, "Aw dude, I want to write the saddest song I could possibly write and see people go crazy, and like dance to it," it's that. And at shows, that song is insane, and it's the saddest song I've ever wrote
J: Yeah it really is—and you dance—I mean it's so hard, it's so hard, and like the greatest, like, bridge ever! What was that—what was that? I don't know if we—I mean I'm just gonna kind of jump into various songs—but like what, what was like, specifically that like... why that transition? Like, why did you think that was like, needed a transit—like was it, like it for emotional, like were you trying to create different moods?
T: So, "911" and "Mr. Lonely" originally was, uh, a different song kind of together. It was this jazz take I had that was super triumphant and just sounded grand, and a lot of those lyrics was uh... was in that song and I just took 'em, and just placed them on "911" and then took the verse and placed it on "Mr. Lonely" and added some stuff. And, "911"—the version that came out is the 25th version, it had...
J: Wait, the 25th version? You did 25 versions of that song?
T: It was 24. The first version was over an interlude song that Tony Toni Toné had. I looped it, sang over that, liked the hook that I put there, made 30 beats for it. It's—and the versions aren't just different type of lyrics, it's literally like... different beats, different melodies, all that
J: A completely different vibe?
T: Made that, took the beat from the fashion show I did, reworked that. Took the lyrics from the original "Mr. Lonely" and like, implementing it in that, and like, so the original "Mr. Lonely" it's like, uh...
A five car garage
Full tank of gas
A call for every day of the week and it go really fast
But it means nothing, nothing, nothing
Without you, shotgun
J: Yeah, yeah...
T: Right yeah. That's in the last version of "911"...
Five car garage
Full tank of the gas
But that don't mean nothing, nothing
Nothing, nothing
So you kept that based on the previous, you just-
Tyler: Exactly, so I took it from this jazz song, and I was like, "nah, I want them to groove to this shit," so I put it on that
Jerrod: I actually always wondered why that bit repeat-
Tyler: Well yeah it just 'cause it was from it was it was from the bass of the other one but when I put it there and drop the beat people I was like "oh people are gonna love saying this." And if you see that shows I don't even say it I just put the mic and the whole -ten thousand people: " nothing, nothing, nothing."
And I'm like I figured it out and I-
Jerrod: You figured out—that, that feeling that you want, the feeling of just everybody really connecting with it but wait- specifically the bridge on that- what was like-
Tyler: Oh oh what the "chirp chirp" part?
Jerrod: I say bird- but like, which is the most one of the most addictive things-
Tyler: I ain't made that, I remember I made that and it was just the beat and I remember stopping like "I made the bridge that I've always wanted to make. Lonny came by-or Frank however people know him-  and he came by and I played it for him he's like you let me go in there Just try something he just started making phone noises and it worked out so perfectly and we was like "alright" and-
Jerrod: was it longer?
Tyler: no that part I'm just giving niggas eight bars of these chords just so they could want it so they could replay it and left it at that
Jerrod: How did you balance out and this is kind of for the whole album your love of chords with-you always talk about and you always say "niggas don't want chords" and that's all you're obsessed with. It's just everything is specific and just-
Tyler: I just Want chords and melodies
Jerrod: Yeah. and was it like a battle- cause the whole album has chords
Tyler: Yeah, I fucked up-well I didn't fuck up but Cherry Bomb was an album full of bridges and shit going everywhere, so I was like, let me for this album specifically add all the chords I like but  do it in a way that they can digest. So Mr. Lonely has some of the prettiest chords on the album, but I kinda hid it behind the hard drums and the fast paced rap, but if you really listen it's really fucking pretty-
Other: Rolling!
Tyler: Thank you. And I was like I'm definitely gonna-just try to hide it in those and stuff. And 911 even the uh, "call me some time." I was listening to Gap Band and I was like damn, these are simple chords and I love the melody let me try to implement it in this and make it as simple as possible but it still gives me that feeling. So the part where I was like "fuck it I'mma go crazy, I right before Steve Lacy's part when it goes back to the hook and it's like: "dun, dun, dun ,dun ,dun" and I was like I'mma go on my Jill Scott shit and that's my favorite part of that song, just cause it just-
Jerrod: It has all the chords that you love
Tyler: Exactly
Jerrod: Umm, do you wanna...
Tyler: You could cut it now
Jerrod: "I can't even lie..." Where does the..
Tyler: I can just imagine a nigga in a wife-beater on Valentines Day like in the hood and like-
Jerrod: Is he talking to his friends or in the mirror-
Tyler: I don't know who he's talking to but it's a quick shot like "I can't even lie I've been lonely as fuck nigga," just being honest with his homies or something, and I was like man that would be really funny to chant. But it's the perfect set up for when that song comes on. It set's you up for like what's 'bout to happen. It's honest but it's right here and they go crazy when they-
Jerrod: It's like so sad it's hilarious. It's like there a group of niggas chanting-
Tyler: And that's Rocky. That's Rocky yelling that. That's Q, I think that's Wyatt, that's Lionel, that's Jasper-
Other: Ah, don't talk, the camera..
Jerrod: Alright
Jerrod: Foreword is ah- ok, first of all, that tempo is very weird. It's like a really weird tempo that you found, was it kind of just like a challenge?
Tyler: Well so, that's a loop from this band called Can. I've always been into krautrock, its like- it was a sound that was very European, like Eastern Europe, and you got like Can, The Silver Apples, even Soft Machine, which was this really proud jazz band that took influence around that time. And it's kind of what Portis Head listens to for influence, and it's something I've always liked because it's just so weird and just- this weird drum patterns and these haunting bass lines, and that's a song that they had and everytime I played it I would just rap over it. And I was like fuck it I'mma loop it, add these-
Jerrod: Is it hard to rap over, just the-
Tyler: Not actually, It's actually just the "one ,two, three, four" but the pockets that they would use makes its sound like this weird push and pull back thing
Jerrod: Yeah it feels like your on something, you know what I mean? Just kinda pulls. Yeah and its like- that pocket is such- the pace of it, when you're rapping over it is you do a little bit faster than I would expect. Like a little bit more- why, why that song first? Why that mood though first? Where you trying to set a-?
Tyler: I remember making it like "this need to be the first song." Just go in, just so you can see where I'm at in my head, and I remember writing that verse fully like.... "how much shit can I buy, till it gets boring" like "how many jumps can I do on a bike until I'm over it and on to the next thing." And every answer that I had went to the next question, like "was it ever enough."
Jerrod: it almost sounded it was so existential and contemplative and it almost sounded suicidal, especially the "if I'm going and don't come back"- do you know what I mean? It was so dark its-
Tyler: Yeah, yeah, yeah. That was the end question like "damn, what if I died? What happen? And that's kinda what it was and just to set the tone of like that's where I'm at. And it's not depressed-I'm not depressed at all. A lot of people mix up depression with self awareness. Someone was like "dude this album is depressing" and I was nah, I never said I was depressed. I'm lonely, but I'm having the most fun of my goddamn life. But that song kinda sets that tone
Jerrod: Ok, I mean if you're considering death, but it's not from a depressed, sad state, is it from a state of like "alright I've got something to prove" cause it almost seems like you had a thing to prove on this album. I don't know to yourself, or like-
Tyler: Well, a lot of people do stuff for the conversation of when they're dead. Like hopefully, when I die people can say "oh he-this, this and this," I leave a good discography behind, but-
Jerrod: Yeah, I like to start with every project, I like to start from death and work backwards
Tyler: Exactly
Jerrod: It's just like, we're all gonna die someday
Tyler: I  just knew that if this album wasn't good I would be fucked. That's how I felt. And some people would disagree, but I'm like, man I'm nothing right now
Jerrod: You felt like that coming off of Cherry Bomb?
Tyler: Yeah yeah yeah, cause everyone hated it, except for like, real music lovers who care about drums- like I opened a rap album with a rock song. Most niggas was like "uh." And then "Buffalo" comes and you can barely hear what I'm saying, and then "Pilot" comes on and it's this 80's music and they're out cause they want rap. Then "Run" comes, dun, dun,  and then "Find Your Wings" comes and they're like "this is chill," and then Cherry Bomb comes and just punches them-so they're out and a lot of people didn't know how to take it so-
But "Find Your Wings" and stuff felt so- I don't even know if I mean lyrically, I mean sonically, going back to your love of chords and stuff like that and you would on Cherry Bomb" it seems like you would have chords and distort it, like it was you were always running from it and covering it up, so that-saying it's your most personal album, removed from the subject matter, it feels that way, like sonically
Tyler: Yeah, I fully get that yeah. never thought that
Jerrod: It just feels like a real- Okay so the sadness of Foreword that goes into almost the like- I'm going to say almost this cockiness of "Where This Flower Blooms." Do you feel like you were accepting yourself?
Tyler: So its a lot of things-and I don't wanna take credit-that I was doing that people were like, what is he doing, and then two years later it's what everyone's doing, whether it's the way videos are done or these stupid pop-up things or whatever, and I'm not taking credit, but I was doing that and no-one ever puts me on these lists or respects me in the sense that I wanted. So I was just, and that's why that line is like: "Ain't nobody fucking with T, but that just may be my ego but don't be too cool" because I may freeze, and I'm stuck in this egotistical mindset and I never move forward, and that's how niggas freeze to death, but that "ice, shit weighs a ton, water your garden, my nigga and stunt." I got a flower chain made, with all these different things, and that's what I was talking about, but I was like, fuck these niggas, keep doing my shit, uh, and "tell these black kids they can be who they are"-
Jerrod: That's one of my favorite lyrics, is just "tell these black kids they can be who they are"
Tyler: Dude, right!
Jerrod: Like it's one of my favorite- you had another lyric like that on Cherry Bomb that was just like, "the world is yours little nigga" like "my little nigga, the world is yours." Like I love that- like it's a similar thing like, tell these black kids they can be who they are. Where you saying that to you or the people you see...?
Tyler: I was saying that to me to but it uh, it's no-one saying that to kids that look like me, or anyone that looks like me. We had this conversation just wanting to snowboard when I was 12, but someone was like "oh, that's white people shit. Black people don't do that." No, you don't do that, don't put a damper on me and tell me what I can a can't be just because of the way everyone else was that's my same color. And I just feel like I just wanted to tell them like "be you"-
J: Who you are is such the alternative of the expectations are placed on like a young black guy growing up. Like you're influenced by kind of everything, kinda all cultures, so do you think you accepted that by yourself through your music
T: I knew who I was at like 12
J: I think you rapped maybe 28% on the album. It's like so-
T: My goal for this album was to shut the fuck up, and let the all feature be the leader. "Yes, Rex, here sing for two minutes before I come in with an 8 bar on 'Boredom' and then I'll have another 8 bar but I wanna shut up and just let the string section be 2 minutes at the end."
J: "Boredom" I think-I found out about it this morning- "Boredom" right now, to me, is like your "Billy Jean."
T: Really?
J: It really is kind of a- seeing people connect with that song... That song influenced... I think I called you and said if I don't know this song is creating an emotion for me or if it's like the soundtrack to something I already feel. Like that's how powerful I think it is
T: Well, I wrote that, literally, it was a 5 pm on a Saturday, laying on my back, looking so bored. It was nothing to do, no-one was hitting me back, Jasper was in the other room, bored out of his mind but I didn't see him the whole day, my room was warm as hell because I like the heater on, and there was nothing to eat but dry cereal and I'm sitting thinking "what the fuck am I going to do?" I literally wrote that verse in 10 seconds, cause again, it was these questions and these legit feelings of boredom that I was having. And it was weird to me 'cause it's like... I'm in a tax bracket where I can go do whatever. I have all these cars, I can go drive--but I have nowhere to go and I'm just bored. And it was just confusing to me 'cause it's like-
J: You don't understand how you could possibly--
T: How the hell I could be bored when its... but there was nothing to do at the moment. So I was like, fuck it, I'm gonna write a song about it
J: Jasper has to listen to that song and be like "fuck you nigga I was right there"
T: I wrote the song over the chords of "God Bless the Child" by Stevie Wonder. I figured out the chords, looped it, and had it just playing for hours in my room. And I wrote the verse, which was like a 40 bar verse originally, but I cut it in half 'cause I was like the hook needs to come back. So, at the end of the first verse, it's like "I'm... bored." I did that right when we was editing 'cause it went to the end of the verse, it was like, originally, "I'm bored and getting desperate. Phone is not--" It went straight to a different verse and it was a different pocket but I cut it, because I was like I need to put the hook back in here, 'cause I don't wanna hear myself
J: Yeah, 'cause it's a weird chunk, just, "I'm... bored. Find some time!"
T: Uh huh. So I added that right when we was editing, finishing, I was like, "No no no, fuck that, put the hook. Imma change the second verse a little bit and like, so the pocket is easier to rap so everyone could say it." 'Cause it was too rapitty, you know, and I was like, nobody wanna hear this deep ass voice rap for that long; let me shut the fuck up and do a hook, so all the white girls at Coachella can sing this shit
T: And, I'm not lying, doing festivals, you realize white people love singing along to shit
T: That's why, the fucking, Boredom is two minutes of just this like...
Director: Roll up!
J: When you perform this album live, you start on Where This Flower Blooms, usually. Is it a longer intro?
T: Yeah yeah yeah, so... I wanted this album to sound like a Disney score. Just like, very magical. My perfect little indie movie, and, fucking...
J: Sound like the album cover looks
T: Yeah, sound like the album cover looks like. But, it turned into, you know, what it turned into. Where This Flower Blooms had this very beautiful longer intro, I shortened it a bit, but, it sound like the beginning of a movie
J: It's sweeping and...
T: Yeah, I start the shows with that because it's like bringing them into my world and then it drops and gets crazy but... yeah
J: How long did you-- why did you trim it and not just go-
T: I just wanted to cut the fucking fat. I wanted this album to be no longer that 45 minutes. And I think we hit 45:36 or 46 minutes and I was like, okay, cool. I just want it to be short and get to the point and yeah
J: You were talking about questions and how every song is sparked by a... thing.  My favourite sequence of this-- of these songs, but... uh, Pothole is inspired by something your mom said to you. Is that like...
T: A long time ago she was like, "yo, some people just aren't really as loyal or close to you as you think." And I'm always like, "shut the fuck up, like, what the fuck are you talking about?" Sometimes moms know best and I had to find out on my own, like, oh wow, she wasn't wrong about that person. And I kind of wrote that verse like: "My mom told me, blah blah blah." And, uh...
J: So you singing that more? You started singing that more
T: Yeah, and even like, I did it in the car like, I drove back to the points where she told me specifically. Like, when you make three lefts it makes it right. So like, I triple left tryna double back. And the streets are filled with clues that she told me
J: And that's great, that some of your best--
T: But, how I ain't notice that. And I see some familiars, I see some people I knew, stuck in the cul-de-sac. I pull up, get out, "what up", I wanna help you. But what you want for some people they don't want for themselves. So, do I stay here and try to figure it out, or do I go, and traffic is picking up? And if I don't leave now and get on my path and do what I need to do, Imma be stuck, andI'm in your room now your screaming for help
Anxiety attack so you piss on yourself
And you pray to god that one of your neighbors can help you
But that won't happen I'm helter skelter
In my lobby, they can't find me
I'm not a maniac, i'm a zombie
I'mma rap about some neo nazi
Bitch you better call on God or Gandhi
Better hope Jesus come baptize you
Because I'm about to come rape or sodomize you
Keep doing that until I realize you
Dead from the sound boom when I pound you
I'm a night stalker, catching bitches walking after dark in parks
Hit that corner, then they're gone
They can't call for help because I took their phone
Using up minutes, use them to call my homies just to tell them that I'm in it
Bitch I dare you to scream
Haven't you heard of Sarah? That's me
I made that bitch my milk tits
I was dressed up like Lisa Simpson
Put her to sleep, quick in my hilton

That's not makin' sense, I'm a fuckin' ithiet

With a fuckin' pastor tryna fuck me in his class
While there's cum up on my ass
So when I slide I can just motherfuckin', um, move faster

Know how to Hollywood and Jerk,
Dem Hoes, I tell you bout them hoesIts Been A Week Since The Carnival, Which I Have Now Realized Was The Greatest Day Of My Life. Seeing Everyone I Care About There Was Crazy. No, Thats Not Even The Part That Got Me Excited. Seeing What Some Stupid Little ideas Can Turn Into Is What Shocks Me. The Little Stupid Cats And Graphics I Made On Photo Shop Out Of Boredom On Flags And Murals; Seeing That Donut I Drew When I Was 15 On Stages And Everyones Bag; 10 Thousand People Came To A Place Called ‘Camp Flog Gnaw’, Wow
I Remember When I Came Up With That Name Summer 2011. I Never Been To Camp And In My Head, I Created A Place That I Figured Would Never Exist, But That Changed. Just Fliping The First Letters Of Wolf Gang Turned Into Its Own Separate Thing. Seeing All Different Races From Skinny To Fat To Everything All In One Place With Something In Common Was Mind Blowing. The Zipper Is My Favorite Ride In The World. Not That You Care, But That Fact That I Figured Out How To Get That Thing And Ride It For As Many Times As I Want Without Waiting In Line IS Fucking Amazing
I Have An Amazing Team With Me. No Matter How Crazy And Offensive Or Weird My Ideas Were, They Put Their Trust In Me And Allowed Me To Move Forward.Like Dude, We Threw A Fucking Carnival In The Middle Of Los Angeles With 10k Plus People. We Didn't Have Any Crazy Sponsors And I Didn't Have To Suck Up to Anyone Or Any Of That Shit, WE Did It. And The Skatepark? Did You See That Skatepark? I Was Up Till 2 Am Painting That Bitch! Growing Up In Hawthorne At The Dirty  And Seeing My Old Friends From There Getting Clips Was Prolly The Craziest Shit Ive Seen. How Far Ive Came With Every Little Idea that I Believed In No Matter Who Did Or Didn't. Walking Around Seeing Kids In EXACT Things That I Wear Is Mind Blowing. Something That I Just Naturally Like And Put On, Its Some Kid Out There That Studies Every Article Of Clothing That Was Put On And Emulates That. Thats Crazy To Me. I Used To Do That With P, So Know That Someone IS Looking At Me The Way I Look At Him Is Really Amazing To Me
I Didn't Think I Would Change So Many Lives. Someone Retweeted An Old Tweet Of Mine From Feb 2012 Yesterday And It Read ’ I Had A Dream That Kanye Invited Me To Perform LATE With Him. I Wish’. Kanye Came To The Carnival And I Performed Late With Him. My Favorite Song By Kanye, AN Album Cut He NEVER Does, Was Performed Not Only With But During My Set And My Carnival! No Matter if You Hate Me Think Im Stupid Untalented Annoying Or Whatever, I FUCKING WIN AND YOU CAN SUCK MY WHOLE SHIT. We Did This, OF Did This, Coming From Actually Jack Shit And Turned That Jack Shit In Something. I’m Just Blabbing Now. I Just Want Who Ever Reading This To Know That Anything Is Possible, No Matter How Crazy It May Seem, Anything IS Possible You Just Have To Figure It Out. Get Your Self Esteem Up And Like Yourself, Then Like Your Ideas. We Live In A World Where People Dont Even Like Their Own Ideas, That Why You Have People Copying One Thing Thats Working So Much, Then Everything Gets Over Saturated With The Same Shit, And That Goes With Fashion, Music And All That. If People Actually Loved Themselves And Believed In Themselves More You Know How Many More Crazy Things Would Be Created? There Is No Fucking Limit To Anything! 
Its A World Of People Who Dont Give A Fuck About The Mall Or The Radio Or None Of That Shit, Who Dont Care About Race Or If Someone Is Gay Or What Not. Thats What I Was Trying To Say On That Arsenio Interview. I Prolly Came Of As An Idiot Tho. Im Really Passionate About Everything I Do. From Music To Clothing To Videos. I Love Make Videos So Much. I Just Want Some Millionaire To Throw Me Money To Be Creative And Get Shots. I Remember Kids In School Always Thought I Was Weird, Not Just Cause How I Dressed Or The Music I Liked Or That Fact I Was Just Different Overall, But Because I Was So Open With Future Goals. I Would Always Say The Grammies Im Gonna Get, And The Number 1 Movie Im Going To Write And Direct, And Just Random Shit Im Gonna Do. Now Those Same Dude Who Shut Me Down Are Paying Shitty College Debt Doing Something They Hate, Because They Didn't Go Full Throttle On Their Own Dreams And Quickly Shitted On Mines. And Im Not Knocking Anyone In College, Please Get Your Education, Im Just Saying, Do What You Love And Be Happy, Dont Live For Anyone Else. I Dont Like The Color Black. I Dont Know What That Has To Do With Anything But I Like Colors, Bright Colors, Like Flowers. It Brings A Great Energy
Ok Im Just Talking Again. Its Prolly A lot Of Typos In This But Im Just Going Off Of What Ever Is Coming To My Head. This Photo Of Na-Kel Smith Skating In Front Of The GOLF Mural At The Skatepark Means So Much To Me. The World Is Yours Little Nigga, And I Mean That. They Are Them, We Are Us, Fuck Them All! OFWGKTA]:

Hodgy, Casey V, after that MellowHype came 
And at heart we are all lames
At that brain we’re left and at this we’re best

Hey Left Brain, put that piano away during class
Shit…. Fuck I need to quitLife after death, death after life
Made mistakes before, I swear I wasn't gonna do it twice
You love me and it wouldn't change
So I'm by myself which will remain the same
And it was just one girl who left me sprung
And it was just one girl who had me going dumb
And it was just one girl who was where I was from
Gave me her feelings and I left that bitch with none
I was in love, but I jumped out quick
Gave her my heart, she broke it, put it in the bucket
On another level I'm bitter, I wanted to keep her
But now this shit is coming out your speaker
Wish that you could meet her
But she's chopped up in my freezer
By the mixed vegetables, I'll eat her
Looking in the iris, I knew she was lying
Cuz she wasn't crying, laughing
So I starting grabbing
And she started gasping for air
She told me the truth, I didn't care
The dead made me win
And her death made me grin
Like a mouth with a side of nipples and limbs
This the end, yeah
Potatoes and grits on the plate of her
I should have stayed away from her
But she cheated
And now she's in my freezer bleeding
Her parents looking for her, good luck
You dirty bitch
Met the bitch, tied the bitch up
And then I ate her up because she want to go and fuck my cousin up
Nigga's balls in the room and now this bitch is mad at me cause I made a song with autotune with my nigga G
She looking at me all mad and all sad
But now I'm glad that she's wrapped up in that Glad bag
And that shit's all black and I'm wearing all black
And now she mad cause I found out she was fucking, sucking other niggas
Busting, cumming, running, here I'm coming with a motherfucking knife and now I'm gunning
And now this bitch is screaming for help, yelp, dealt, the motherfucking card that she dealt
But that's her fucking fault, I don't give a fuck
I fucking more, she fucking one and now these cases that I caught
Shit, but I ain't even fucking tripping
I need a new chick, I'm sick of dealing with these bitches
In the club, niggas in the clubI can't wait to take you home

Insurance higher than the lease bill, run flats when the feet peel
Fish tail, the boy eats meals, tummy ache from my cheap thrills
Granny hug the way the seat feel, on the left turn, leave the neck burned
From the frost bit links, size of an earth worm, wasted on last check earned
I’m, expecting this so it ain't odd, two 5’s on the paint job, lactose, wide body, fat ghost
Grannys watch over me when I act slow, rev till I plateau
Keys sorted on the hip, jeff gordon is his mind, life’s forza on the strip
Switch gears like I take breaths, wish I had 8
Left 6 got skipped, went to 7th from the 5th
More advance than your average
I like coupes, two shit
When my friends pull up, stops turn into a pageant
But until I get that enzo, its chapter uno
But I know what that bus pass turned into, its magic???

Making that money, counting these figuresTyler is shown in black and white sitting on a stool in an all white room. The camera shakes slightly, bringing Tyler in and out of focus.
Tyler begins to rap, miming the words as he says them. He lifts his hand up, and we see a Madagascar Cockroach climbing on his fingers. The cockroach climbs to his other hand, and Tyler stares at it intently as he raps.
It crawls over his hand, and then onto his other hand again. Tyler brings his hand up and looks down on the cockroach, and we see the word "Kill" written in sharpie on the back of his hand. We also see an upside-down cross drawn on his middle knuckle.
The cockroach climbs to the edge of his hand and it crawls onto his other hand, and Tyler stares at the camera.
Tyler brings the hand with the cockroach down, out of the view of the camera. He brings it back up in between his fingers and puts it in his mouth.
He chews, and the camera begins panning out, bringing Tyler in and out of focus. He makes a face of disgust, and stands up from the stool, heaving.
Tyler becomes a silhouette, and he throws up onto the floor. It takes a while, and then he wipes his mouth and spits onto the floor. He sits up on the stool and he comes back into focus.
He begins rapping again, pausing to spit on the ground again. The camera slowly pans in until the upper half of his body is showing. He begins unbuttoning his shirt.
He unbuttons his shirt all the way and then his gestures become very animated. He grabs his face in rage, showing that he is wearing a chain. He then takes his shirt off  all the way.
The camera zooms in to Tyler's face, with the image becoming extremely blurry and then in sharp focus. We see that Tyler's eyes are dark black, and then we see only Tyler's teeth, then his eyes again. Tyler gives the camera the middle finger.
Tyler begins to move around a lot, agitated, grabbing his chain. He becomes completely out of view at one point, then when he comes back into view, his nose begins to bleed. He wipes the blood off his top lip.
The camera zooms out, and a noose falls from the ceiling. Tyler grabs the noose and wraps it around his neck. He stands on the stool, and we only see his feet.
The stool falls over, and the legs begin thrashing, as Tyler hangs from the noose . His legs twitch as his legs swing back and forth.
The camera moves to see the stool on the ground and Tyler's feet dangling. The feet finally stop twitching, and they just sway around in a circle. The camera shifts in and out of focus. .Um......'Sup, cock fucking face niggas?
It's your boy Ace, man. Um.....
I'm in fucking Sacramento right now and shit, mom just moved
I've got nothing better to do out here, so I'm just gonna freestyle for you dick sucking motherfuckers, alright?

Bin Laden, that nigga been hidin'. Probably been ridin' in the dirty
Eating on my dad's white stuff, like Mcflurry
Nigga's can't burn me. I am not a book, you can't learn me
But don't fuck me, you cannot yearn me. I am not a fucking check, you cannot earn me
What the fuck else rhymes with earn? Bernie
Bernie and irk, irk and Kirk, and Kirk is fucking Berk and Berk is fucking Bobby
Bobby's fucking auntie, Johnny. Johnny fucking nanny, auntie. Johnny's fucking Chuck, and Chuck is fucking Bobby
So, it's like a threesome, with eighteen more fucking people
I'm a fucking zero, your a fucking two plus eight, six. I can't count, that's why I won't amount to shit
But I got a big dick, and it's growing. And my fucking lyrics keep flowing
And my mother fucking spit keep getting on my fucking clothes and the camera
Lens. I am in the mother fucking camera bends
I don't make sense, but I could give a damn if your bitch is a man. If your mother fucking head hurt from working all day
If your momma's dead, she be sucking dick and fucking pussy blunt ashtrays with your uncle
Fuck 'em, fuck you. If you looking at this, fuck you
Here, you is a mother fucking queer
Shout out to Odd Future, Peas 'n Carrots. We gon sit down and say cheers. I just though of that right now
Actually, I thought about that two minutes ago. We can go find a ho, or a slut, or a bitch, open up her legs and probably bust a nut in her hair
Spit up on the lens, lens up on the spit. This camera's shit
Hopefully, some nigga's will get me a cannon
Back to my first line, bammin Obama. Fuck you and your fucking momma
And your momma's cousin, they be buzzing, they be smoking, and then they coke, and then they drink, and then they play Young dro in a Lincoln. I'm winking
I'm lying, and your bitch is lying. Because the bitch got shot, and her fucking mom's dying
No, she's not dying, I'm lying. Her fucking uncle bobby just got shot with a BB......Gun, nigga's better run
My dick's a gun, and it's about to cum. Blow you in your mouth, yeah, I blow it in your mouth
Get it? No, you don't. Yes, you will, no, I won't
Fuck, I'm running out of breath. Need a fucking, inhaler before I fucking, inhale ya
This shit is recording, now I gotta save you like I'm jesus Christ, but I'm not
And hopefully the nigga behind me don't have a knife. I'm home alone, and I got my own bone, this is my own song
Actually, I'm going home tonight. Actually, I'm lying, I ain't right. Yep, yeah, eah
No, I'm going theres, to the house
I'm from Hawthorne, the dirty dirty. Where niggas get stabbed up, where niggas get rabbed up in rasbeads
And when I say rasbead, nigga's get raped. No homo, we're not fruity, we're not rasbead
We're the other b2k members. We're not fucking white winter, like December. We're low so, like fall in like September, or October, or November
I thought I told you, fuck. I'm sick of fucking rapping, I'm sick of fucking clapping, for you mother fuckers that's rapping
Saying that I freestyle, bring the pain. Nigga, this is not a freestyle. I'm not stupid, your not Lil Wayne
These nigga's say, fuck I'm not gonna get up into it. Because these wallet chain niggas gonna get me into it, and I'm a say screw it, but I'm not gonna chop
But I'm not Mike Jones, and I'm not Mike Jones, Mike Jones. Who? Shut the fuck up
Here's a dick, dad, you can suck up. But actually, I don't give a fuck up
I'mma a be a man about it and hopefully, suck it up. I'm talking about your dick, fuck it. You love it, no, you fucking hate it

I'll see ya'll nigga's laterShe right left me
The plane flew away, now my soul is unhealthy
On flight American 47
My summer love left me, and faded into heavens
She came to LA on vacation, about the third day we was having relation
For two weeks she was my angel
The kisses were incredible, the dates uncomparable
With her, she took my key
The key to remain, relationship sanity
Now it was crazy
Fiending for her love, and texting her daily
Abstinence is what she went by
No sex, I pretended like I had respect
I thought that I was set
But I was in love, when I heard she was
My summer love, my summer love
28 karats of gold
That's almost 24 karats of glow
But bugs bunny said 24 carrots of old
That they been spoiled green bean
That's three layers of mold
I've got three layers of coolness
And one of them is lukewarm water
She's somebody daughter
Her brain is smaller than the other girls
I've got Sarah Belle umm
Man I love summer heat
Never told her
Can't tell her, about cars dealing
She gambles with my dentist
That's why I have feelings
She stole my heart but they didn't really need it
So I guess shes off, not guilty
Love jewellery, so filthy
Now were chilling at the beach
Corn on the chips, corn on her feet
Feet in the sand, Hands on her weave
She's the fish to my water
Summer love
She's the summer to my heat
So I slide in
Cool like the breeze, feather
It's the Summer weather
I know this her blinging
Like rose gold, rose gold
I went to the dealer
And he sold gold, I chose gold
With a little bit of red bone
5'5 still pigeon toed
With her Keds on
Rasacha chey fitted caps
She the dope dealer type, the feds' drawn
Where my flow excels
I don't show and tell
And it's the summer baby, ring my bell
Her names Rochelle, I want road kill
Because she’s not after the money, leaving me broke as hell
This summer, this summer
I got jokes for sale, wanna buy one?
Girl, where the F you get this guy from?
This summer, this summer, this summer, yeah this summerChilling at the house on a couch with the box crayons and a line of cocaine
My nose is on fire like a button with propane, it's dripping all red of old gangs
And now you've seen your stars and your face numb like a funny bone cupping at ice
And your nose white like your head's covered in lice
But we both dazed, and I think I found my wife
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm blown
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm gone
Dazed and Amazed and I'm dazed and I'm home
Chilling at the house on the couch, nose white
Mind is travelling, thoughts is mental
I'm trying to get into your pus just like a pimple
And I wait for the Cat in the Hat to pop through the window
The opium is in slow
Thin Though
Put My Brim Low
Let the lights dim lowListen
Bad ass bitch, big ass titties man
Got a fucking AK size of a fucking mini-van

"You a bit-" 
Pop you right in your fucking faceCops tripping on a nigga cause they know I'm a black man
The flow dirty like a real stinky trash can
Niggas don't really want no problems, I got guns, I solve em

My niggas be listening to fucking N Sync

Now - for all my Odd Future crew out there that's uh backstage
I just uh, I just wanna know who's gonna start this showVERY MUCH A WORK IN PROGRESS!!!
Tyler, The Creator. Is he extremely ridiculous? Yes. Is he extremely talented? Definitely. We are about to embark on an adventure through the making of the album: Cherry Bomb. Take a seat, and relax
Yo, what up, it's Tyler, and I'm about to show y'all what really went down when I was recording the album: Cherry Bomb! The album!
I had a show New Year's 2015, and I haven't came out with music in a while
Damn, finally, you gonna drop a new album
That show fuckin' sucked dick! That show was trash. What none of these kids knew was that I was halfway done with a brand new album
*Tyler recording verse from Death Camp*
DEATH CAMP
I'm recording songs, directing these videos, doing these photoshoots, the release date is comin'
We look like Puffy and Mase on our jiggy shit, you feel me?
And right before it releases, this bullshit happens
Tyler here, and I'm makin' this video, just to prove the fact that I don't wanna get sued for sampling on my song *DEATHCAMP* that appeared on Cherry Bomb
Now, I rarely sample. I usually play the instruments or get someone to play it if I can't. And the one time I sample for this album, it gets rejected, right before I have to turn the album in. I got Coachella, I got a tour comin' up, I don't really have time. But, fuck it, I gotta figure it out

BUFFALO
There's obviously an incredible intelligence and shit that I have no opinion on, but he's the dude to make that statement if he backs it up with intelligent thought. The problem is, America doesn't have the intelligent conversation that, they read a headline, but that's actually the problem. So half of me goes, fuck, this ain't my thing, but if this dude's gonna push a button that causes important dialogue, then fuckin' A dude, you know what I mean, 'cause I'm not proud of our whole shit, it's like, you know what I mean?
I usually just make shit 'cause it look cool, but people's brains misinterpret it whatever way they want it to, man...
*Offstage filming of _____*
I should be that white face character I was in Tamale, because it's like no deeper underlying shit
You're just making art and then it's interpreted after. 
*At a live performance*
I performed this shit in my bedroom, so this shit's personal when I'm just in my room dancin' alone. Play that shit, Travis?
Me and my friends hang out at my house a lot, whether we're skateboarding or swimming or playin' a game or someone cooking some food that is really really trash
I'm just really hungry, this shit is garbage
*Live performance of Pilot*
I recorded Cherry Bomb in random houses because I like the windows and looking outside and stuff, and I think why the album has such a bright tone to it
Yo, 
You got cum in your ear. *Laughs*
Alright, back to my house, 'cause that's my, that's my comfort zone
PILOT
*Tyler records his verse on Pilot in his room*
I'm about to put this banana in my fuckin' ass! That shit is amazing! Wow! And I'm only on thirty-three percent, that charger is fufu. I've been gone for three hours. Damn, that shit sounds amazing. Alright, can I hear it from the top?
*Kali Uchis recording her verse on ____*
TYLER AND ROCKY TOUR TEXAS
Listen, yesterday, me and  played a game of NBA 2k
What? You gonna come clean, what, 'cause I whooped your ass?
You wasn't even playing, nigga! Get the fuck out of here, nigga! You wasn't even there, nigga! Ay bro, I'mma come clean, 
Jay in first, I'm in third! Where the fuck you at?!
 Everybody know when you play Mario go-karts, you don't play one race
Coming on this tour, I didn't know what to expect
It's crazy, it kinda, I think it kinda makes me not judge as much
See, this is really us together, like, we chose to do this, this not no higher powers, like, I know what this nigga does, no-one, comin' around, giving this nigga ideas, he gets with his niggas and he really do what I do, and be like 'yo, we need to, ah man, I need to, we need to do this, do this, do that', that's real creative shit
And, when you're really not afraid to be yourself, you're comfortable, it's like a web or a umbrella. When you're not afraid to be you, you're comfortable, when you're comfortable with yourself, you don't have that much hate in your heart, you're not that quick to judge, and when you're not that quick to judge, you're open to more things, and when you're open to more things, you're not ignorant, and when you're not ignorant, racism doesn't exist
*Mocking Rocky* Yo, what up, I'm ASAP Rocky, you gettin' jiggy here with my mans, uh, I love bad bitches, that's my fuckin' problem
This nigga Tyler though, almost killed me and Nico, on Washington Boulevard, the day before the carnival last year, just because this nigga was listening to some fuckass, turnt up Death Grips shit, bro
Yeah, I wrote RUN at like, nine in the morning. I wake up really early all the time, and I had logged in on Twitter just to, and I saw someone tweet 'bout to roll up'... Dude, that's all you do? And that's how that first line came, 'cause I thought to myself, 'all y'all niggas smokin' y'all brains out'. That song is really about a lot of the gang violence circle:
All y'all niggas smoking y'all brains out
In the car called life take the lame route
Going nowhere fast but you think that you not
Cause you never hesitate to take the thang out
In the drop top, pop the trunk then pop pop
At his drop top, took another lame out
Oh you the big nigga? Took a hit nigga?
Well I hope you understand you ain't shit nigga
Cause them niggas whole purpose is to get niggas
And make sure that your mama cry the pain out
Now that gang is out to get you
But you stuck in the same house
Nigga never came out, wow
It's a shame how you got sucked in that life
But hey man at least you got a name now
They say you a "real nigga" cause you kill niggas
Nuts for that ice and that cream banana peel niggas
Banana clips spill, niggas wanna bang out
For they approval boy, you can't even hang out
That light you hit, it was the light I held
That's why you never ever see me with my chains out
I don't need to, truth they don't feed you
Lies what they got on their plate, they gon eat you
They got a homie called Karma he gon meet you
Better look the other way if he ever see you
And run as fast as you can, nigga
Plus, that's in my top three songs to perform
*Live performance of RUN in Paris, France *
You gotta uh, you gotta follow direction. Watch my hand, okay? No nigga, don't put your hands up, just watch  my hand. I'll do this, and then I'll do this. Let's try this
*Proceeds to perform RUN live*
CALABASAS, CALIFORNIA 8PM MONDAY NIGHT
Got big arms
What's up with you? *Laughs* You good? Aight?
Yo, chill bro!
**MORE LIVE STUFF*
So Chaz, from Toro, one of my favorite artists ever, there was this melody that I had in my head forever, just in my head, I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', like some weird opera stuff, but I didn't want it to be too extra'd out. I easily coulda hired a lady who sings opera or got one of the female singers who hits runs and coulda, I'm runnin' I'm runnin', just to emulate a string, but, I know Toro would do it perfect, and he does high pitch, like, he can do high, he can do low, he has such a middle that's really good too, so I just stacked all of 'em and... It came out perfect
*Toro y Moi plays the chords to Fucking Young on his guitar*
Those chords are gorgeous. I can't do without 'em. The day that I met Tony-
Yo, yo yo yo yo! Back to RUN!
I set up, like, all my recording stuff and my instruments in my living room downstairs
That ain't even your regular voice?
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin-
Look, it  be high-pitched, 'cause this is, remember the original is fast as fuck and pitched high. So, but I just couldn't record it at that speed, but that shit is- *plays instrumental* I couldn't record it that fast. And, it's going to be higher pitched, but right now, its- *plays instrumental*
Runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin', I'm runnin'
Follow the keyboard
Runni- might have to overdub it
What you mean?
It's such a weird jump. It's like, jumpin' octaves, it's kinda weird
*re-records his line on RUN*
Uh, that last note right here, try to hold that
Hold it. Okay
Man, black people are gonna hate this song
I don't see y'all niggas bein' challenged to jump over a fucking car, jump over a trash can with both feet!  Where your knees at, nigga? Where your knees at? Oh, okay!
He clipped that shit!
Trash! Ay, go up, go up! Trunk now! Go up, trunk!
What, he's not gonna do it, did I not do it? Did I do it? I Already did it. I have nothing else to prove
The trunk! It's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! Do the trunk, it's taller! See, look at him. There's always an excuse
What the fuck!
When I made, so, 2Seater was made at the end of 2013, in my room, in like, twenty minutes, out of boredom again. I had just got my house, I was in my room, no furniture, no nothin'. And, this is cool, like, one minute and thirty second song, but I'm like, I wanna take it somewhere. I literally had wrote that string section, played it, and was like, okay, add all these instruments, I'mma get real players to play this, and then, hearing it come to life was so sick!
HOLLYWOOD HILLS 5PM 2015
So, that's like the main part. I'mma use it throughout the song, but that's like the important part. Um 'cause  eight bars, for the first four bars, you could get, like, riff it, get crazy, but like, when I start saying two seater and shit, like that part, you could get like soulful, repetitive, just so it doesn't get, uh, it doesn't get lost in jumble with my vocals
*Aaron Shaw begins playing the sax*
That sounds amazing. Just do like, another pass where you just fuckin' let it all out, just do what this tells you
*Aaron Shaw begins playing the sax*
Alright, alright, alright, you get it, you get it. So it's 8 PM, I'm about to record at Hans Zimmer studio, I'm a little nervous 'cause this is my first time with a actual string section, but, I know it's gonna be tight as fuck. Trust me, a lot of thought was put into this
Doubling things, and tripling-
These pads, they-
So that should actually be A -
Well, if we're doubling lots of-
But I'mma just pan this one-
Coming in with a swell is nice-
It might be easier to have-
Yeah, or, no, it should be, it should be on three. Dun dun dun dun dun-
But dog, when you get that finished product? It's all worth it
*____ begin playing strings*
I'm like, what is that? I think I could go higher!
Oh, shit! Why'd you do that?!
I'm starting over. I'm starting over! That was so 
SAME NIGHT 30 MINS LATER WANDERING THE STUDIO
Hey! How are you!
I'm fine man, how are you?
This is Hans Zimmer. If you're not familiar with his work, he scored a bunch of movies like Spiderman and Despicable Me, and... Oh yeah, Inception, and a bunch of other crazy shit, 'cause he's really talented and the list just goes on and on and on. And I got to see his secret little stuff in his secret little room
Like, you can't make the same sound
No, exactly, and that's what I love, is it's totally unpredictable
Is this the one where you just plug in shit?
Yes
Oh my god
And there's a whole back wall. I got all this stuff 
But more importantly, I got the nod of approval. So sick!
High five! High five! Then you ain't shit, hoe
Okay, okay, I'm fully not feeling this
Black diamonds, yellow canary diamonds, white diamonds...
BROWN STAINS
*Tyler records his verse on Brown Stains*
I think ScHoolboy Q is a actual shermhead, and no-one can tell me any different. He's my fucking favorite ever, I love him so much. He's a shermhead
I produced a song off his first album, I mean, we've been homies ever since, he's one of the only few rappers I fuck with, and I had made this beat, it sounded like, schizophrenic shermhead, whatever you wanna call it, automatically thought that the tone of voice ScHoolboy Q has would just sound ridiculous over it. I hit him up, he came at night, knocked his shit out in an hour. Bam
Nigga that really makes me sad
TYLER AND SCHOOLBOY Q RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD CA 2015
*ScHoolboy Q records his verse on Brown Stains*
We gotta do it again. Let me 
What are you doin'?
Just goin' in, man, you know, gon' body some shit cuz
What kinda draws are you wearing?
Um...
Dude, that's weird
Some Calvin Kleins-
Don't answer! No! No!
*Live performance of Brown Stains*
What the fuck
This is $80,000, nigga. Fashion, youth, dab, lit, gas emoji, bitch
Why you hiding, Tyler? Where you goin'?
Oh beans it's lit!
What else you get?
What else?
Me and Q both got white Mclarens, but he got it after I dusted him in his weak ass Porsche of course
It was dope as fuck. Shout out to Tyler, we got the same car, it's tight
When I'm not making a song I can drive fast to or wild out on stage, I'm tryna figure out the right chords and melodies
SINGERS
*Tiffany Palmer, Onitsha Shaw and Samantha Nelson record their part for Find Your Wings*
I feel like rap has a timestamp on it. You could listen to My Cheri Amor by Stevie Wonder any time frame, ever. A five-year-old could listen to it. A eighty-year-old could listen to it. It's less boundaries with singing songs
Keeping ALL the fuckups too
My boy Austin, who's in a band called Slow Hollows, is really sick with guitar. He's playing on three songs on the album, and the things that I've learned from him, just over the years made me more comfortable, with who I am, and the things that I like, and just learning more stuff, and what keeps things fresh is just, new energy, and, not getting complacent and stuck. Working with these three girls was just amazing, they knew exactly what I wanted, and then in unison, they just sounded together, and they were open, and they- they made me feel comfortable
KALI & TYLER RECORDING SESSION HOLLYWOOD TUESDAY 11 PM
Oh, my name's Kali Uchis, usually he already has something ready and he'll already have an idea, most of the time he writes everything, or he'll have a melody idea. Obviously he produces everything, so he really hones in on making sure everything is exactly how he wants it to be. 'Cause, when I met him, I had just started singing, I feel like I was still really learning about my voice. He definitely made me a lot more comfortable and experiment more with my range. I think what I admire most about Tyler, how dedicated he is, how much he really wants to make something meaningful that's gonna be lasting, rather than make something that, you know, will get to radio, or, will be, something that people listen to right now, and then maybe goes away later, I don't think he's ever really cared about trends, or, um, he just kind of follows what he wants to do, and, um, he works really hard
*Unreleased song plays *
*Clem records her part for OKAGA, CA*
OKAGA, CA is my favorite song on that album, and probably, to me personally, in my top five songs in my discography
I remember hearing Clem a long time ago, and her voice stood out to me so much. It was so high pitched, and like, it almost had this kid-like vibe to it, to where it was just fun, and she was just like- it had no worries in it
Pretend, you're Tido and Jermaine?, to youre Michael Jackson leads, so you you're own backup singers
You know, she comes from this rock background, so to have her singing in a soul cadence, was really interesting to me. It's not many people who know how to hit those registers and riffs that I love. Me and Frank talk about it all the time, it's few people like Kim Burrell is one that we always bring up, Jasmine Sullivan, um, Alice Smith, I which- uh, she's on the OKAGA, CA song on the album, too
*ALICE SINGS*
I'm Syd, I've known Tyler since I think 2008, so that would be 8 years. The biggest thing that I've learned from working with Tyler is to trust your ideas. I don't agree with all of his ideas, but when somebody, like, trusts themselves that much, makes you question yourself if you don't like it, and that's what I really got from him
*SYD SINGS*
But working with Charlie Wilson, that was a whole 'nother story
FUCKING YOUNG
I don't think I've ever been this stressed making a song. Charlie Wilson took what I had in my head and made it come to fruition so perfectly, that I started stressing out on the fact that I could never do anything that good
*CHARLIE RECORDS*
What the fuck, I hate this. *Laughs* I fully, I fully can't take this
He's a legend, and him taking cues from we was so weird
*CHARLIE SINGS HIS PART FOR FUCKING YOUNG*
FUCKING YOUNG VIDEO SHOOT
I'm so sorry! I'm so sorry
This is happening! Oh, my god
It was a two week span where everything I had planned for this album just started to come together. It was beautiful
SMUCKERS
*KANYE RECORDING VERSE*
KANYE WEST RECORDING SESSION HIDDEN HILLS 9PM
I gotta figure that shit out!
I see you tryna figure it out!
Hey, 
Ten years down the line, niggas gonna be like, SMUCKERS is legendary. That one's for the books, for sure. Yeah, finally just  working with those two dudes was just crazy! I remember playing it for Travis and Lionel, and we was like 'oh, shit', like, I really got these two niggas on a song
Fuckin' fire!
And I knew specifically, I wanted Wayne's tone of voice on there
I kinda- He texted me, just like, 'Man, I got this joint'. He's like a, perfectionist, so he's one of those guys that you know, you, he want, he know exactly what he want from you. Might fuck around and write your verse for you
So, I told him I wanted him over, and he was like, 'alright, cool'. I sent him my parts with his parts out, and then he just laid his shit down, and it was great by then. Went to 'Ye house, played it for him, he was like, 'cool'. Wayne sent me his shit the day after I played it, I went back the day after Wayne sent it and played it for 'Ye again, and he heard me and Wayne verse, and he was like *shakes his head* ripped his paper out of his notebook, balled it up, and started a new, and it was ideas on there, and he was like, 'Y'all niggas really 'bout to make me rap and go in, like, I ain't had niggas makin' me want to do that in so long'
First of all, Tyler changed the game. Maybe I probably had online, and I knew- I wouldn't say because people might think  it was too gross to put in a rap, or it didn't go with the whole vibeGap tooth T on the keys
That was new music from the soundtrack of the upcoming film

Jump off the roof into the mirror
Felt like summer to my December
Was it my August? Shit, I don't remember
I know my temperature was set
You finally flew south
The bird gon’ leave the nest, you're so chromatic
At least I had it 
Instead of never
Or maybe I'm too dramatic
Whether it’s rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love’s gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, gone
Gone, gone, gone, gone, gone
I know love is, is all I got
I just hope to God she got good taste
Could put you on some shit you never seen
Could play a couple songs that you could dance to
I hope you know she can’t compete with me
Whether it's rain or shine, I know I'm fine for now
My love's gone, my love’s gone
My love's gone, oh, gone
I guess it wasn't meant to be
Or maybe it's just a dream that I can't seem to wake up from
My love's gone, my love's gone
My love's gone, gone
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now 
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now 
You kept me goin', the Band-Aid is falling off now

Knock, knock, knock, knock
I'm not shocked, I brought this on me
It's my fault, you gon' leave
Lesson taught, see
The weatherman told me it wasn't rainin'
My stupid ass brought umbrellas
I got a glimpse of your cloud and felt better
Now it's 90 degrees, and all the tricks up my sleeve
Is drenched in sweat and delusion because I jet to conclusions
You got your thing, I got nothing but memories
I know your secrets, nigga 
I'm not bitter or nothing, I understand that
Everybody making a choice according to plan and
We had two different blueprints, but understood influence
You opened up early on, I thought I had a permit
You started buildin' a bridge and turned it into a fence
Then my buildin' got tore down all because of your new tenant
I'll just buy up some new shit, never down with a lease
You never lived in your truth, I'm just happy I lived in it
But I finally found peace, so peace
It was my fault, I reached
That contract got breached
Now I'm back roaming the streets
So peace
I hate wasted potential, that shit crushes your spirit
It really does, it crushes your soul
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
I said go, go
Thank you for the love
Thank you for the joy
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Thank you for the time
Thank you for your mind, mind
But I don't ever wanna fall in love again
Again, again
Again, againI WAS 15 ATTENDING SUMMER SCHOOL AT HAWTHORNE HIGH, SPENDING MOST OF MY NIGHTS TRYING TO FIND ANY SNIPPETS OF THE ALBUM ON VARIOUS GERMAN SITES. THEN 7/25/06 CAME. IMM RANGES IN DIFFERENT STYLES AND SOUNDS AND I BELIEVE THATS WHY I GRAVITATED TO IT SO MUCH
THE UPRIGHT BASSLINE ON “CAN I HAVE IT LIKE THAT” OR THE BUCKETS ON “HOW DOES IT FEEL”. OFF THE WALL MJ ON “NUMBER 1″. I STILL TO THIS DAY DONT THINK I CAN MAKE A SONG BETTER THAN “THAT GIRL”. AND “I REALLY LIKE YOU GIRL” IS EASILY THE BEST SONG ON THIS ALBUM WITH YOUR BEST TIMBERLAKE IMPERSONATION AND STEVIE HARMONICA. IMM ALSO INCLUDES “RASPY SHIT” WHICH IS THE WORST SONG IN YOUR DISCOGRAPHY I HATE THAT SONG SO MUCH YOU ARE SO GROSS FOR THAT. BUT THE ONE THAT STOOD OUT WAS “YOU CAN DO IT TOO”. THE SADE BASSLINE, THE STRING PAD WITH CHORDS THAT YOU CLAIM ONLY Q-TIP, YOU AND I LIKE, THE JAMIE CULLUM OUTRO!
BEING 15 BLACK NOT REALLY “INTERESTED” IN WHAT THE MAJORITY OF MY PEERS WERE INTO, IT MADE ME FEEL SAFE. I WAS OPTIMISTIC, ALWAYS DAYDREAMING AND SETTING GOALS SO I FELT YOU WERE DIRECTLY SPEAKING TO ME. I REMEMBER CLANCY TELLING ME HOW JIMMY IOVINE THOUGHT THIS ALBUM WAS A “COMPLETE FUCKING FAILURE IT DIDNT WORK”
BUT SEE, IT DID, JUST NOT ON THE KIDS HE WAS LOOKING AT. THE ONES WHO JUST EXISTED;USED THE POPULAR SLANG;LISTENED TO WHAT WAS THROWN AT THEM;DRESSED IN CLOTHING THAT WAS TRENDING AT THE TIME. NOT SAYING THATS BAD BUT OF COURSE THIS WOULDNT WORK ON THEM. BUT IT WORKED ON ME AND I CREATED ODD FUTURE THAT SAME SUMMER. I WAS ACTUALLY NAIVE ENOUGH TO BELIEVE YOU AND THOUGHT I COULD DO ALL THESE AMAZING THINGS IF I REALLY TRIED. WHERE I GREW UP, NIGGAS GET STUCK AND NEVER MAKE IT OUT. JAIL, DEAD, SHIT JOBS, NOT REALLY GROWING
IT SEEMS LIKE AT A CERTAIN AGE, IDEAS; ORIGINAL THOUGHTS ARE NO LONGER A THING; I DIDNT FALL INTO THAT CYCLE. I’M NOW A YOUNG ENTREPRENEUR ALL BECAUSE I BELIEVED YOU WHEN YOU SAID I COULD BE. YOU WERE THE FIRST PERSON I CONTACTED WHEN I PULLED OFF THAT MCLAREN DEALERSHIP! THIS IS GETTING LONG SO UHHH, HBD IMM. I NEVER HAD BROTHERS,UNCLES OR MY FATHER AROUND SO THANK YOU FOR BEING THE MALE FIGURE I GRAVITATED TO. ALLOWING ME TO EMBRACE BEING DIFFERENT AND TRUSTING MY IDEAS ❤️Can you roll my window up?
The fuck you turn my music down for, man?
Can you roll my window up?

He just got off his damn last shift
And he said that his momma can't do the dishes
So he gotta go help her

Crucify the horses in the stable when I'm able
When the horse shit, bootleg cable with the text

Dark deep coral for your brain oral
Just a bunch of teenagers with no morals
BitchЙоу, на хуй 2DopeBoyz, и на хуй Nah Right
И любые другие fuck-nigga-ass блоги, которые не могут поставить 18-летнего ниггера
Делающего свои собственные биты, каверы, видео и все это дерьмо
Идите на хуй post-Drake-ass cliche-jerking, LA-slauson rapping
Fuck-nigga-ass Hyperbeast niggas, теперь вернемся к альбому
И так, Тайлер, здравствуй, я Dr. TC и, хм, догадываюсь
Что твой учитель послал тебя сюда, чтобы поговорить, потому что ты плохо себя вел
Хм, у нас будет 3 сеанса: сегодня, завтра и послезавтра
Ну, что ж, просто расскажи что-нибудь о себе
Хорошо, смотри, если ты не будешь разговаривать, я полагаю, наши встречи пройдут намного медленнее
Это то, во что играет Дьявол перед тем, как пойти спать
Немного пищи для размышлений, это трапеза смерти, продолжай и  ешь
Мой отец мертв, я не знал его, мы никогда не встретимся
Я порезал свои запястья и играл на пианино, потому что был так подавлен
Кто-нибудь, позовите пастыря, этот ублюдок одержим
Наша встреча только началась, ниггер, я сын Сатаны
Моя мать воспитывала меня одна, так что очевидно
Что я отдаю всю свою любовь ей, а не вам, уебкам
Намного важнее, что я становлюсь злее, когда записываюсь
Я чувствую себя как буйвол, со мной банда волков
Odd Future – это дети, что насрали в их головы
Это просто, а может и нет, на хуй их
Я высокий, темнокожий, худой, мои уши огромные, что пиздец
Набухать белых девок – мой единственный путь дать на клыка
Отстранен от занятий. Крутейший ниггер без напряга
Меня легко заметить, как черных блядей в леопардовых лосинах
Впитай меня в тампон, но оставь свет включенным
Потому что в этом альбоме достаточно зла
Бери с собой в школу все, что не поместится в JanSport
Я перешел от AP до JC всего за ебаную неделю
Просыпаюсь с рандомными девками, типа «Йоу, сука, как мы встретились»
Я живу со своей бабушкой, она постоянно пиздит насчет своего ковра
Каждый раз, когда я прихожу домой, она начинает мне причитать
Никаких наркотиков, я ни разу не взрывал; я учился в «почетном» классе и надо мной издевались те
Кто были еще медленнее мелассы, возьми это дерьмо в школуYou make my earth quake 
Oh, you make my earth quake
Riding around, your love be—, me up
And making my heart—
Oh, you make my earth quake
Oh, you make my earth quake 
Riding around, your love be shakin' me up
You're making my heart break 
So don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
Don't leave, it's my fault
And it all comes crashing down, I'll need you
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New—
Sometimes you gotta close a door to open a window
Ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah-ah, whoop!
I saw a photo, you looked joyous
My eyes are green, I eat my veggies
I need to get her out the picture, uh
She's really messin' up my frame
She's not developed like we are
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone
New magic, new magic, new magic wand 
Like magic, like magic, like magic, gone 
New magic , new magic, new magic wand
My brother said I'm on the spectrum
Don't call me selfish, I hate sharin', baby
This 60-40 isn't workin', uh
I want a hundred of your time, you're mine
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now 
Please don't leave me now
I wanna be found, passenger in your car 
You wanna be mean, boy, whoo! 
She's gonna be dead, yeah, I just got a magic wand, uh 
We can finally be together, together, together, baby, uh
Take one look in the mirror, implications so clear
I live life with no fear, except for the idea
That one day you will not be here
I will not fetch the ball
My eyes are green, I eat my vegetables
But it has nothin' to do with that broad
But if it did, guarantee she'd be gone, well
I got a plan, 'bout to walk in the pen
If you can't understand, I'm a hawk
Eyes on the prize, got weight on my chest
That I need to get off
Can't be in the picture if it got no frame
Gon' let the world know 'cause I ain't got no shame
Blow the whole spot up, 'cause I
I wanna share last names, I wanna be your
Not the other one, keep it on the low

Im with these niggas makin that money counting these figuresAll of you negative motherfuckers should look to me as inspiration. I'm 23 fucking years old and I built a fucking monster and I'm not ever gonna fucking land. Stop being scared and negative. Start believing in yourself and stop living for all these other fucking idiots. Some of y'all should put that fucking blunt down and go do what the fuck you know you need to do. Do it for yourself. I believe in everyone because I believe in myself. Fuck reaching for the stars, that's setting a limit. Fuck those. Some of you don't like yourself. Some of you aren't comfortable with yourself. That's so fucking sad. Stop that shit. Some of you can't. That's why y'all ask for likes on Instagram and shit, because y'all's self esteem is so fucking low. Cut that shit out and start liking yourself. When that happens, you will start trusting yourself, then you trust your ideas, then you fucking become that person you really want to be. If you don't have any confidence, let me be your fucking confidence
I'm gonna be a fucking great years from now and I fully believe that and fully do not care about anyone's opinion on why I'm not because I know. Start smiling more and start hanging around people that makes you feel good or make you want to be better. Stop associating with losers. If a nigga only hits you up to smoke or drink or turn up and have nothing else to offer to get you where ever you think about being when you are alone daydreaming, then get the fuck away from them. Time is going by so fast and before you know it, you're gonna be on your deathbed telling stories about how much you sucked and how you regret not living the life you wanted to live, loving the people you wanted to love, taking the chances you wanted to take. THERE ARE NO RULES. FUCK THE RULES. GO. FIND YOUR WINGS. I FOUND MY WINGS AND I'M STILL FLYING AND I WILL NEVER EVER LAND. Some of you have to find yourself. I knew who I was at like age 10. I knew the music, I loved the colors, and I knew what I was into. Most of you listen to what ever is hot or what your friends like, y'all dress how everyone else dresses, y'all do what everyone else does. FUCKING STOP BEING A FUCKING FOLLOWER. Read the comments, the weak ass follower that will never make a difference ever because they fucking suck are gonna say some shit like "easier said than done" or "you are a hypocrite" or "you changed" or some stupid shit like that, because they are the weak fucks that I'm talking about and they can't cope with it, cause they are scared. DON'T BE SCARED
I don't know why I'm typing this. I'm on a lake on vacation just drawing and listening to music  and I just realized, "Oh wow! I'm on a vacation for no reason, this is crazy. I've dreamed of this. How did I get this far? Oh yeah, by trusting myself and not following the path that my mom wanted me to go, and by surrounding myself with other people that wanted more out of life and trusted my wild ideas, and I put my art out there and people liked it and trusted me, and now I'm here. I guess what I'm trying to say is that I want everyone to win. I want everyone to smile. I want everyone to be in a good mood and annoying and always jumping around like me cause I'm so fucking happy and grateful, but I realize niggas is scared. Or who knows, maybe I'm just a special one. I don't know anything. I'm in the woods and I really want to meet a moose in person. If I see one I'm gonna get a photo. Hahahahahaha. Oh, and RACISM IS FUCKING WEAK AS FUCK ANTI GOLF BOYS. This saturday, there will be another fall/winter drop from GOLF. Love you. Today, I want you to find your wings
