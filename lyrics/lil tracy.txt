Alone in my castle
Can't trust a soul these days
They love to lie to your face
I have less friends than switchblades
Alone in my castle
No one can enter and I can't escape
My heart is easy to break
But these racks keep it in place
Die alone, that's the only way
Don't even try to run
Unless you're running towards the sun
Burn me to ash, roll me in a blunt
Tell me I'm different, I'm not like the last one
I wanna be good now, I know I'm the bad one

Practicing dark magic, doing evil things

My OG said, "Bruh, you can't change these hoes"
I said, "You don't understand" then I hit the door
I never lie awake wondering who to blame

I grabbed her by the hand, I said 'You scared of the dark?'
And she looked me in my eyes and she said 'Fuck nah'
We walk into the forest, getting deeper than the trees
I let go of her hand I said 'Imma show you who I be'
I could tell she getting scared, she could feel my energy
I said 'baby just chill, I'm a sad vampire'
I grabbed her by the face I said 'girl this not no kiss'
Then I bit on her neck and her blood start to drip

A shadow just ran by me, god damn, I'm seeing things 
Or maybe it's just God in the form of a fox, he do that shit a lot
Now I'm following his footsteps he leads me to a lake
I'm 3 feet behind and his body starts to change
Use my phone for light, and I see my own face
Fuck, I'm going insane, that LSD's to blame
I turn around and ran down as fast as I could
But it's dark as a bitch, man, I'm trapped in the woods
I turn around to see myself chasing after me
My hearts fucking racing, and it's hard for me to breathe
Not to mention it's pitch black and it's hard for me to see
Now I'm running up a hill and I get to the top
And I looked back down and I see myself stop
Standing there in shock, man I can't fucking move
Wait a fucking minute man I feel déjà vu
Scared of myself, frightened of my power
Heard a voice in my head, and it's gettin' louder
It said "Yung Bruh, become one with yourself, you won't be alone, you got the Sun as your help"
Now I'm not as scared, and I run back to myself
Looked myself in the eye and I felt so alive
I blinked one time and I vanished to the land of my mind
The moral of this story is
You might be afraid of yourself
You might not know what you capable of
But go head to head wit' your mental fears
I guarantee you'll overcome it, man, I did
It's real shit
I don't give a fuck, man, Star Trek

Wipe me down, wipe me downWalking through the forest in the night
Can't see a thing 
A shadow just ran by me, god damn I'm seeing things
Or maybe it's just God
In the form of a fox
He do that shit a lot
Now I'm following his footsteps
He leads me to a lake
I'm three feet behind him
His body starts to change
Use my phone for light
And I see my own face
Fuck, I'm going insane
That LSD's to blame
I turned around and ran out as fast as I could
But it's dark as a bitch
Man I'm trapped in the woods
I turned around to see myself chasing after me
My heart fucking racing and it's hard for me to breathe
Not to mention it's pitch black
And it's hard for me to see
Now I'm running up a hill and I get to the top
And I look back down and I see myself stop
Standing there in shock and I can't fucking move
Wait a fucking minute man I feel déjà vu
Scared of myself, frightened of my power
Heard a voice in my head and it's getting louder
It's saying "Yung Bruh become one with yourself"
"You won't be alone"
"You got the sun as your help"
Now I'm not as scared and I run back to myself
Look myself in the eye and I felt so alive
I blink one time and I vanish to the land of my mind
The moral of this story is
You might be afraid of yourself
You might not know what you're capable of
But go head to head with your mental fears
I guarantee you'll overcome it, man I did
It's real shit
I don't give a fuck man StarTrek
Shout out to all my niggas man
Shout out to my family
Shout out to everybody that's rocking with me
Even if it's only one person that listen to my music, man
Imma do this for you, feel me?
Real love
Yeah
You niggas is some faggots addicted to fashion
I'm something like an elf I'm addicted to rapping
The world fucked up and we living in madness
I can feel people's energy when tripping off acid
One of my niggas said I look strung out
I don't eat much every day I'm losing one pound
I feel more awake when the suns down
Nigga take a bowl pack, put the blunt down
Walking through the night I'm a fucking fox
Fuck 12 fuck the Johns, man fuck the cops
Why am I the one that they always stop?
Because they the devil and intimidated by a God
I might be buying acid or buying pot
As far as drugs go, I won't try to stop
I'm an addict for acid tablets and shroom caps
This bitch all up on my nuts, hoe move back
You know what I'm sayin'?

Ooh, Bi-Bighead on the beat
You must be 12, you like a cop, you cuffin' on that thot 
I treat that thot like a thot, can't lie though, I love that top
My hoe like hoes, I let them kiss and I do more than watch 
Made sure to show your bitch, bought tickets just so she could watch 
You must be 12, you like a cop, you cuffin' on that thot 
I treat that thot like a thot, can't lie though, I love that top
My hoe like hoes, I let them kiss and I do more than watch 
Made sure to show your bitch, bought tickets just so she could watch 
There's no way, there's no way, we're in this shit for life
Moving swiftly like the creatures lurking through the night
I'm just tired of seein' them in the sky 
Now we got them angel wings watching over the guys 
One day maybe I'll be rich
Maybe I could make a change if life wasn't such a bitch
One day maybe I'll be rich
Maybe I could make a change if life wasn't such a bitch
RIP tai , fuck a shirt
Buku wear you on his skin
Used to walk around the block, now we speedin' in a benz
Used to have no hoes, now I can't stand these lil' hoes
I'll get shot just for my bros, let that Glock pop just for my bros 
This year I'm a fuckin' ball
Keep my conversations short, I need my money tall
These hoes sneaky, that's why I can't be worrying bout' bitches
Fuck that thot, and then watch her hit up another nigga
You must be 12, you like a cop, you cuffin' on that thot 
I treat that thot like a thot, can't lie though, I love that top
My hoe like hoes, I let them kiss and I do more than watch 
Made sure to show your bitch, bought tickets just so she could watch 
You must be 12, you like a cop, you cuffin' on that thot

This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truck
This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truck
Leaving in my shoes
Now I'm in my mood
I was out in Beverly and now I'm in her room
I'm counting money up and staring at the moon
Every time I run it up, she says she coming through
I got bands, I got money in my jeans
And I'm living in my dreams
I was acting rosey with the new Moncler
She had a brand new Birkin bag, I had a lot of lean
You know how we rocking
We don't ever do no talking
Stone Cold Steve Austin
And I'm always gonna be a fucking Martian
This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truck
This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truck
Smoking cigarettes in a foreign car
When I hop out, she says, "I know who you are"
I'm a fucking punkstar
Yeah, I feel like Fish Narc
This is the anthem, throw all your bands up
Step on stage and they're pulling out them cameras
I don't like the light on me
I'm a vampire, she said, "Bite on me"
This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truck
This is the anthem, punkstars
3 am on the highway in a new car
America is fucked up so I get fucked up
I just wanna pull up in a Rover truckGang, gang

Hit him with the demon hook or some spinning kicks
Watch that nigga hit the floor screaming like a bitch
Shouts out to the pack star trek my clique

Rolling fat blunts might break your wrist
Dropping acid tabs going on them trips

Acid tabs shawty on my fucking tongue 
25 I got my mouth numb 
God damn I'm think I just might just throw up
I'm tripping

Sober for days I'm a beast and a savage
Rap on a beat like I'm doing black magic
Living life lavish
Smoking on cabbage
Ion give a fuck man I'm really just swagging
Fire like a dragon
But I ain't braggin'
Y'all on some funny shit so I stay laughing
Sipping on passion
Heat cus I'm gassin
Clean and I'm neat on the beat no slackin'
Swag
With Yung Bruh
Reppin' northwest we don't give a motherfuck
Thousand degrees I'm a star like the sun
8 bars and I'm done
It's a game and we won
I'm insane with the drugs
We're you even listening
I'm so wet that a motherfucker glistening
Everything else played out like an instrument
With a bad bitch and we gettin' so intimateStar Trek
I'm feeling like Picasso, the beat is my canvas
My brain is the paint, the results so candid
Moving through the night, black on black like some panthers
The girl said she horny, I got her feelin' antlers
I'm thinking like I'm 40, I'm only a teen
This the rappers cuisine, now your ears can feast
So finesse when I talk, my speech is serene
You niggas fiend for attention, me and my clique we creep
Around the time you boys sleep I'm in the booth and we workin'
You boys looking kinda plain, bitch I'm living incursive
You boys looking kinda gay, like you living in purses
Nah, fuck a snapback, me and my niggas rock turbans
Bringing terror, giving your ears pleasure
I'm hella clever, and don't hate, cause that's an error
My style change like the weather
Different patterns like my sweater
I'm better than the rest of you, fuck the beef, I eat my vegetables
Me and my girl getting sexual
That once was now she's forgetting you
She's so elegant, an excellent specimen
I respect every heritage, except American
They kill everything, from pelicans to elephants
They'll come and take your land and leave your race as a skeleton
Got the nerve to say that running shit
What's the president? They don't give a fuck about shit
I got evidence
 x4
I don't believe what I see except for trees & the snow
Fuck the mainstream, we underground with the moles
I hope to do show after show
My clique black on black, real fly like the crows
I made a fortress in the forest, I'm feeling like a florist
The scene is so gorgeous, the birds sing like the chorus
Fuck the fast life, I want it slow like a tortoise
My lyrics so artsy, they paint a portrait
You can see what I see, but your vision is distorted
I'm thinking outside the box, you mentalists trapped and boarded
My lyrics is bad, they morbid, should have a orbit
I'm legendary, like 6th graders gon' report it
You secondary, I'm the number one truest kid
I never slipped like there's glue under my shoes
Bet you feeling like water how you under my crew
She said I think you're hella fine, I said the feeling's mutual
She said I think you're hella fly, not like the usual
I said I don't even try, I'm just moving how I'm moving
Not all the niggas are the same, no lie, I'm improvin'
Now we grooving in the spot sippin' juice
Not for toddlers, can't say the rest, but it's no enter like a locker
So you can spit your game but, I bet you'll never prosper
Uh
DolphinIt's Yung Bruh

Girl I love your soul yea it's deeper then sex
Wanna be a vampire follow me to my nest
I can only turn you into a vampire if we're truly in love so
Might take a whileI'm hot like the sun now
Smoking weed high as hell I can't come down
Took LSD my heart beating like a drum now
Climb a ladder to the top I'm gone jump down
I swear the rap game full of dumb clowns
This that damn genius music it's just dumbed down
For you stupid ass niggas who illiterate
Yea I got my fucking sword get your liver split
Everywhere I go
I'm surrounded by these clones
Robot niggas they some drones
Why I'm so alone
My soul cold as snow 
Are you ready for those LSD visuals?
Constant colors changing that's what trippin' do
The thought of getting life stops me from killing you
Fuck high school and every principal

Rub your pussy through your jeans I feel it dripping through

Feds watching me I might get locked down
Yea my money running low I gotta plot now

They said I sold my soul
I just sold out a show
Living life fast, but I'm dying
So slow, I've been on the road
Kiss me through the phone
You don't really love me
You just love it that I'm known
Known around the world
I feel alone though
I think fast, but I talk slow
Ask me who I am, I don't really know
Ask me who I am, I don't really know
I don't really know who I am now
You left me dead as I laid there and bled out
I know I wanted you tell me you're so down
Now me and Tracy in the club, in the background
I know that I can't change
I'm hoping that you
Stop doing pills
They said I sold my soul
I just sold out a show
Living life fast, but I'm dying
So slow, I've been on the road
Kiss me through the phone
You don't really love me
You just love it that I'm known
Known around the world
I feel alone though
I think fast, but I talk slow
Ask me who I am, I don't really know
Ask me who I am, I don't really knowYou know, one time
I knew this girl
I'm not, I’m not gon' say her name or nothin'
But you know, I
She was real’ beautiful
You know, I could tell that she had only fucked with...
Them type of niggas, you know like, them common ass niggas
Them rat niggas 
You know I'm saying, I, I started, we started talking
You know, the end of, to get to the, you know, the end of the story, she had asked me, she said "Why are these niggas so predictable?"
I would never only live for the paper, money over bitches
I'm not with it 'cause I love mother nature
From the rocks to the waves
And I still don't get how black men can kill they own race
If there once were slaves
I contemplate my life situation
Should I leave or shall I stay mental pacing?
Real based boys dress up like they ancient
Swag , except that's sag
If the booth was a lap, I'm whipping you in the car seat
Young nigga we just numbers in a system, so quit chasing money You might get fucked like a stripper
And no, they won't tip you, strip you down what I heard
You act a fool locked up, you get locked down what I heard
I hope to only hear it
But I got a couple hearings so I might get near it in the near future
As of now I’m chilling labeled a black man, criminal
By the judicial branch
I’m in a  stance
I'm finna hop the loogie
I’m thinking above these niggas who spend guap on Gucci
I'm getting top, then she get it back
Quick I never slap with this rap shit
I never act, bitch you Brad Pitt rapid
Or, was it Mark Wahlberg?
Dolphin swimming in the shindig, with his friends
Made your girlfriend awkward... being with you
I'm eating fruit, 'cause I’m green like the weed
Fox clan nigga, I creep the streets as you sleep
Fuck a schedule, I be going with the flow
You see, I'm steady making moves
Kick push then I coast, never slow
Some underground dudes is a clique full of moles
This track a solid rock, go through you niggas like foam
Not tryin' to boast, nigga, but my clique, you can't approach
'Cause while you're walking on the streets
F0X clan lies below, you never know
I got bars for many days, lyrics last 'til I'm old
Rappin' as, I plant the weed seed, still spittin' when it's grown
It's time to smoke, nigga 
It's time to smoke, Chai rolls the dope
I sip my tea, feeling time moving slow
My mind miles from the flow
I look up to the sky, and wonder "Why?", "What?", "How?", "When?"
Crazy I'm on the east yet the streets tease my vision 'cause they resemble the south end
I've been doused in the radical juices and when I'm skating I make the radical movements
Far from average
The trek told me this is slappin', this is more than rappin'
This gift too big
So my favorite actions is split too thick
Then you lift to another dimension
My girl bad, she got a 100 detentions
She's an african princess
Some nights I sit reminiscing listen on the old booth
If I could, I'd beat it up like it's pro tools
Fuck it, release my anger on the beat leave it on crutches
My colored culture calls for royalty, buying name brands
Waste of money like oil leak
I'm just a product of the earth like the soil be, uhPut this Gucci purse around yo' shoulder

Bitch, I'm working like a slave
I'm in the booth all day

Could give a fuck 'bout what you thinkI don't want the money nigga I don’t want the fame
All I need is my girl and a blunt to the face
Niggas acting fake from my life they get erased
From my life they get erased
I can't trust a nigga man, I can't trust a hoe
If you wanna smoke put my dick in your throat
If you wanna smoke let my kids in your throat
Girl this spliff make you joke but first you gotta choke
Bitch this ain’t no joke, hoe get up on your knees
If you want some weed hoe get up on your knees
If you want some trees then you gotta suck me
You don't gotta fuck me
Girl just suck me
Bitch I'm Yung Bruh I got grams on me
What the fuck you need I got grams on me
I got loud, I got loud
Rock bands on me

I smoke to much weed man, I swear I'm never sober
She lucky if I fuck, I'm a four leaf clover
Her pussy like my weed, God damn she got an odour
I don't touch the pussy I’m in her mouth like soda
My girl got a Glock, make ’em run like a motor
I'm high of the weed Yung Bruh going solar
Bitch I’m all alone, I'm making moves solo
Yea she look good but her head game so so
Im oh so foreign these other niggas boring
I wear dirty Vans
I don't fuck with Ralph Laurens
I got lots of hoes but no I'm not a mormon
Bitch I’m Yung Bruh sparking weed in a forestI know that you aren't the one for me

I know, yes I know, you could
You always leaving me, write backYes

But if you got the money, I can get it to yo' nose
I've been watching your every movement
So elegant, as you rest
The weed that I smoke is louder
Then a young ass bitch gettin' raped in the shower
Never sell my soul for the money or power

Stick it in her clit like sniffin' the powder
It's so addicting, got my muscles tensing

Talk about robbing, you really ain't shit
Get me some drugs and I'll feed 'em to kids

Keepin' it fresh, got the shrooms in the fridge
A faded reality, fucked up mentality
This is the way that they want me to live

Told me shit and I know I will never die
I am a samurai, two kunais in my fucking side

My vision is supreme
I see through the fake shit
I quit smoking weed because my lungs couldn't take it
Now I'm on the acid
Watch the objects start to shape shift
The color's so amazing
My heartbeat is racing
My mind said it's fuck cash?, I'm rapping for respect now
The cash made me weak
I'm spitting heat
Like a tech now
I was mainstream, but I kick it with the trek now
I'm still fucked up
I got my mom dukes stressed out
I dropped out of school
I kick it with the fools
All we do is skate
Drink liquor with the shrooms
I used to have emotions but they ripped like my shoes
I'm numb to the pain
A slave to my brain
My thoughts run deep
It's something like a lake
I lived on the streets, I was hot and caught a case
Now the white man got them got control over my face
Shit, we need a revolution, make 'em fall like some flakes

Don't come crawlin' back
Dont like this
No cryin'
Baby know she hidin'
Kill the body insideThis is some real shit, from a real nigga
This is straight from my, from my brain
From my, from my head
From my soul
From what I see man, from what I feel
I'ma just speak on it, right now
People die everyday, but who really is living?
Yes, I rob and steal but who is really the villain?
Okay, yes I drink liquor, but that’s made by the system
And how does man run the earth if we come from the women?
Questions that I have, have yet to be answered
Instead I'm shunned by the man who demands to have a plan
To disrupt the corruption, but we must come together
Instead of killin' off each other
We killin’ off each other, 'cause the money's in charge
And my people can't see the truth 'cause the dollars is large
We too focused on the clothes and the diamonds and cars
All we need is the grass and the sky and the ponds
And I really am not a saint, 'cause I be jackin' the cars
I roll the joint 'cause I’m mad, I smoke that in the park
The weed enlightens my brain, you niggas smoke in the dark
And I’m thinking outside the car and your mind's stuck in a jar
I’ve tried to loosen the cap, but you bust the cap in my arm
That's crazy, niggas who hate the truth
They want the jewels, I don't follow the rules
But I got love 'cause I can feel it in my stomach when
Me and mom hug
I don’t give a fuck 'bout the bucks, man
They put me up in cuffs, man, said I'm going in
For property destruction
What the fuck, you crackers came and  causing ruckus
Changed the whole fuckin' future, that shit is fuckin' stupid
Man, man they wanna come in
They wanna, not that they wanna, they, they took niggas
Niggas from they home
Brought 'em to some sketchy ass motherfuckin' devil land and shit
And then they wanna, they wanna label us the evil
They wanna label us the heathens and shit
And like, who's really the villain?
'Cause it's not us, nigga you put me in this motherfuckin' situation, man
You provoked this, nigga, you-Uh
It’s the dolphin
Shoutsouts DTB, chai tea
Much love to my cuz, Dynamic
You feel me
Uh, uh
I’m the dolphin
Yes, I’m with dynamic
Our lyrics like Glock .40’s
We spit, you niggas panic
Gon' need a bandage
‘Cause I’m spitting flames like a volcanic
Eruption
You step to us, that’s self-destruction
You lay it up, nigga, we dunkin'
Ain’t no discussion
We too young and trapping like we 65
She wanna 69
Well, shit, I can’t decline
I’m hella fly
Bird’s like “Who the fuck is you?”
I’m in the booth spittin’ sick lyrics, got the flu
But, no it’s not contagious
All I care for is rap
Could give a fuck ‘bout the paper
Words sweet like candy
Something like Now and Later
I got a girl dark skin, wit' that African heritage
I rip the spliff, watch me levitate
Boy, you light on the mic, yes, I’m heavyweight
You too drunk to be rappin', so let’s designate
Me
The lyrical drive, and my bars are hella crazy
I belong in asylum
You nigga spittin’ that fake shit
Nigga, this is the Science
So very smooth in the boof like a poet
You niggas wish that I’d slip, keep hoping
I’m too focused
You can hang with the crew
Just a young dude
I’m what it do, nigga
So very smooth in the boof like a poet
You niggas wish that I’d slip, keep hoping
I’m too focused
You can hang with the crew
Just a young dude
I’m what it do, nigga
You a baby learning to talk
My speech’s finesse, I’m a poet
You can never compare to me, even
At my lowest
You dusty and dull
I’m clean and I’m glowing
I’m focused on what’s ahead
Anticipating the beats motion up against the dolphin
Damn, your situation is hopeless
The way I think is open
Fuck conservative, I speak the truth
You fake niggas can’t interpret it
I win the race, that shit’s affirmative
I got a firm grip, on the stick called rapping
You niggas mice chasing cheese and you call it trappin'
The government gon' trap ya
And they gon' rape your mind
I’m young as fuck my nigga, I’m 65 in mind
I don’t run, I slide
‘Cause I’m smooth like silk
My physical frame is skinny but my lyrics is built
Strong
Fuck the law, that shit is all bad
Star Trek be the clique, my niggas’ all rad
My niggas' off that green shit, that natural Ganja
You niggas copy and paste flows
That’s a rapping in pasta
But who am I to stop you, shit, do what you do
Dolphin causing
Hipsters hips to move
To smooth, like butter
Spread myself on the track
Spit the flame, toast the beat
How that taste? Enjoy that, mm
VoilaWhy
Why
Why

Why lie
Why lie

Love is a drug, let's overdose tonight, 
The moon's in the sky, 
It seems extra bright tonight, 
Smoking cigarettes inside a foreign car
The paintjob is all white, looks like a unicorn
I step inside the club, I see her on the floor
A white designer dress, is what she wore
I position my bracelet to glisten in her eye
As she looks up, I'm standing in the light
I don't know your name, and you do not know mines
But that does not matter, at least for tonight
Love is a drug, let's overdose tonight, 
The moon's in the sky, 
It seems extra bright tonight
Love is a drug, let's overdose tonight

            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        I'm feelin' righteous
Pipe hits got me high as kite drifts
The lights dim
I like spliffs that hit hard like Mike Tyson's
Right fist
I'm on the the mic, spit shit you can vibe with
Crazy I used to be 
My life shit, pop another dime quick
My clique full of high kids, Star Trek
From the known farfetched
Government want control of your arms, legs, soul, brain & heart
My mind is not your grasp, broke free from carpets
Fuck snitches we know where you narcs rest
I'm car-less, kickin', pushin'
Kush so soft it's like twistin' a cushion
Lyrical Glock, bruh I promise I'll pull it
Knowledge is the bullet, shootin' at toddlers
Bustin' at robbers, Robert
Even the coppers, she a dime so I copped her
I'm the type to meet her father, be cool as water
Show honor, he said "I like you with my daughter"
I'm the charmer, Earth is the god
I believe in karma
Do you?
Practice good deeds, get yo good karmaSo do you hate me for taking your friend away from you?
Nah, I guess, I'm just sad
Ya ya
I don't know why these n*ggas want beef
Yung bruh just want peace
I just wanna smoke my weed, I just wanna sip my lean
I just wanna pop my pills
I don't gotta rob and steal
I don't cop shit, I deal
Got kush, got shrooms, got pills
Yung Bruh, I can't trust a bitch
Can't cuff cause I know you gon switch
I don't give a fuck about shit
I'm emo so I cut wrists
Feel better when I see blood drip
Can't kiss cause I know you suck dick
And I ain't tryna catch no shit
Without a condom bitch, I can't go in
I sip lean, pop pills, roll spliffs
I like my girl no ass no tits
She on tumblr looking like a spliff
Eat shrooms and I'm going on trips
Eat shrooms and I'm going on trips
Eat shrooms and I'm going on trips
Aye, nigga trap shit, star trek
I'm laced up off that vodka and that robitussin, you feel me?
I'm in my feelings, fuck life
I don't give a fuck about cash
I wanna smoke and rap
I don't gotta tow no gats
I don't gotta tow no strap
I wanna smoke that thrax
I wanna roam the map
I wanna see berlin
I wanna see her tits
Got more pills than nurses
I'm a pharmacy, I'm servin'
What a nigga wanna purchase?
Cop from me man, I swear it's worth it
It's worth it, I ain't got a job but I'm workin'
I ain't got a car but I'm swervin'
Skinny jeans but I'm not jerkin'
Make a bitch love me on purpose
My kush come straight from the furnace
One hit have your throat burning'

Time doesn't exist nigga throw away your watches
The weed that I smoke is very obnoxious

I speak with intelligence no college
Welcome aboard the lyrical plane I'm in the cockpit
If a nigga step to me for him that's toxic
On the beat I'm a pill fiend I get it popping
No crip shit but I get it cracking
Niggas dying over fabrics
Mentally they in traffic
My thoughts rapid
Ballet on the beat check my balance
These rap niggas suck, I need a challenge
I'm shooting threes on the beat, Ray Allen
I'm from , I'm a stallion

Came from the jail game now watch me set flames
Through these two inch metal rods we considers fuckin chains
My 17 point at a dep, lets test my fuckin aim fair range
Shoot em in his throat, call it breathtakin aim
Call me a monster, now lets see satan's range
Darkness grow stronger when you lock me in a cage
Take the key and throw it away
But one day, light will overpower devious ways
And positivity will rеign
Shit, that will be the fuckin days
Whats the rеason, for the Seasons? I'm steady chiefin'
Third eye open, I'm focused, I'm never sleepin'
Walkin through the streets and my jeans are saggin
The track like crack, I'm a fiend for rappin
I'm ratchet, but girls love it, no need for fasion
All my niggas B, As ya'll Ds and average
Deal drugs for the cheese and cabbage
End up in a cell with the thieves and bastards
Star trek nigga
Feel chills down you back like a spinal tap
Cold sweats and nightmares on the vinyl track
Don't tread, on these shoes that's a vital fact
Natural fact don't forget to recite this rap
Got black suede shoes, tie a noose around my neck
Fresh black jacket to cover my bare flesh
White glove society movin with finnese
The people keep an eye on me as I reach success
Pyramid mind sets,  inhibited mind sense
As I reach the top I see the people who might guess
The next best thing ever, since sliced bread
But when you aim for the best, the bullets might spreadGot my ten-speed, and I'm waiting for the bus

It’s Yung Bruh
Ay bruh it's Star Trek
You feel me?
Star Year, I've got that cherry flavoured lean
I’ve got that damn pinnacle
Yeah, yeah
Cherry flavoured lean, Imma try not to fall asleep
You don't want to drink with me, I mix vodka with that lean
You don't wanna hit my weed, I sprinkle dust on my tree
Yung Bruh only fuck with queens so she not gon' fuck the team
I fuck like internet porn that's why she in love with me
I ain't scared to eat, she wet just like the sea
I don't wanna rock no Js only dirty Vans on my feet
Breaking down that kush, I got crumbs all on me jeans
If you take a puff you might just see what I see
Hella gay niggas rocking True Religion jeans
Imma fucking king, pussy nigga kiss my feet
Imma take your bitch, Imma treat her like my queen
Take her to my palace, I'm gon’ fuck her ’til she sing
 up my cup, then I pour a lil' gin
Sippin’ on that juice, Yung Bruh puffin' that spliff
I don't give a fuck, Yung Bruh I don't give a shit
It’s Yung Bruh
It's Yung Bruh
Yeah
I'm all alone
Fuck everything
Fuck life
Fuck you
Yeah
I smoke Mary Jane
I don't fuck with no lames
Everybody know my name
Yung Bruh don't care about fame
I can't trust these hoes
Can't even trust my bros
People turned my heart so cold
Now all I do is smoke
I sip vodka with that lean
I pop pills and I smoke weed
I'm all alone I ain't got no team
I'm all alone I ain't got no team

        I'm the motherfucking dolphin, Low-key and very cautious
Shouts-out to the track, we hella sick, made her nauseous
Stick it in her clit, make it leak like a faucet
When I rap it's for real like I'm workin' in an office
I'm flawless on offense, bruh, you need to get your D up
I'm the boss, last level, you boys soft like some D-cups
I'm in the forrest smokin' on forrest, now I'm one with the trees
Compose the track all alone, make me one with the beat
Fox Clan, I'm the sheep, move through the night like some creeps
I'm taggin' knowledge on the wall while the cops lurk the streets
While the world fast asleep, I'm in the booth and I'm twerkin'
I'm a young skinny nigga wit' my feet off the surface
No hats, I'm in turbans and one thing's for certain
If I get a little fame I'ma 'cause the game 
And I'ma put niggas on lyrical incursion
I'm the dolphin underwater, I'm swimmin' up to the surface
And when I splash on the scene niggas gon' hate on purpose
Ayy, yo, Insomnia is real 'cause I don't sleep, I stay lurkin'
Man, I'm somethin' like a fox, it's rare to see me in person
But when you do, you in awe 'cause I'm rare and I'm gorgeous
Other niggas don't compare and they lack the importance
I swear my life like a tortoise, man, I'm slowly dyin'
The drugs ruin my insides, they think I need an asylum
When truth is, I'm a rebel, fuck them governmental devils
Turnt my fam into slaves, got 'em killin' over J's
Got 'em feinin' over chains, got 'em thinkin' in the caves
Cops gon' put me in the cage like they did my grandma
I refused to be a clone, so, I enhanced my grammar
And my mental type strong, bitch, I'm thinkin' like Santa
So if you come at me weak you will suffer a defeat
I'm the king, you at my feet, I'm Shepard Dolphin, you're the sheep
So, listen to me speak, I bet you learn somethin'
These other rappers lying to you, Persian Dolphin can be trusted

I'ma keep spittin heat til' my cake raise
Spittin' flame, am I the son of the sun?
Twist up the haze, put the blunt in my lungs
Niggas so fake but they front for the sluts
The spliff get stuffed like a cunt
I'm so radical, strapped with the loud package we smoke attitude
I rhyme dimes lyrically selling Ganja
Could give a fuck about the fame, nigga
The trek so lowkey
All we do is smoke weed
Never trippin'
Unless the shrooms in my system
Give a fuck about these bitches
I love women

They don't know we in love, we in love

She used to go with my bro 
He cheated on her with a ho 
We gotta keep this on the low 
You look good with no clothes

Let's go face this blunt
Get high we can face the sun 
She a freak she ate my son

Shouts out to my girl 
You know who you are 
Yuh, yuhYou  me that money, and uhh
This is a, uh, this tape here is not, you know this is just what you whistle
This ain't, this ain't what I got planned for you, you know?
Once I get something to max  and something ,  or whatever I'll put together a couple good albumsVerse 1::
Losing Myself
I ain't been choosing myself
Been choosing you
I don’t know what to do with myself
Changing my view of myself
Its nothing you can do to help
Gotta do it myself
Its up to me I know I gotta find my own way
Spiritually, I got some things I need to go and face
I’m not safe, all these demons ain't going away
All this pain ain't going away
I’m feeling things I don’t want to say
I’m ashamed, of me
But I can only put the blame on me
Chorus::
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
Can only put the blame on me
Verse 2::
I was fighting off the love that I need I
Shoulda been fighting for the love inside of me I
Realize that it wasn’t you it was me I
Need to find peace cuz I see the signs
So I gotta leave you with a peace sign
Pieces of mine, scattered and broke
I need peace in my mind
The potential u seen I ain't see all the time
So I need more than time I need space to align
Eventually in time maybe we can be fine
Held in my heart i won’t leave you behind 
I appreciate ya love made me need you like a drug
Til I relapsed n forgot how strong I really was
Now its time to remind me
Redesign me
Reach inside me
Treat me kindly
Like the queen
That I’m rising to be, how I got here, 
Now it ain't surprising to me
Chorus::
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
Can only put the blame on me
Bridge::
Heart broken lost in love
Thought it was, forever you and me I
Realized all the games, I let you play
I guess the jokes on me, right
Can’t put it on you, its all my fault
I let you do what you do, I
Put the blame on me, you can put the blame on me right
Chorus::
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
I can only put the blame on me
Can only put the blame on meS-S-Souljahwitch

        Lyrics From Snippet
Keyworld
If my headphones on, don't speak to me
I'm cheesed up like pizza, she want a piece of me
Everywhere I go I bet I'm thirty minutes late
I can't decide between the Fendi or the Hermes
I got a bitch who got a bitch, we finna switch
I don't give a shit she suck my dick, I gave her a kiss
I eat gourmet still miss my grandma grits
All these blue hunnids look like I bang with the crips
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hol' up, hol' up
Isn't that your girl? Isn't that your girl?
I put down the diamond I pick up the pearl
Yes I love that bitch, don't care who hit it first
Wait, wait, wait, wait, hol' up, hol' up
The latest Fendi shoes you see me in 'em first
Yea, I'm warm when it's cold I got coyote furPart 1: "square pandaa"
Shangdi!
Smokin' dro, got a nigga so high
Niggas always hate, I don't even know why
Dress black like a crow, Yung Bruh so fly
Sell Kush in the sun or in the snow time
Can't trust a bitch 'cause I know ho's lie
Bitch, look me in the eye, you a thot, don't lie
Possessed by the beast, finna make your soul mine
Listen to me speak, you'll be free in no time
I be smokin' weed, never sniffin' coke lines
Fo' grams in the blunt, I dont wanna smoke dimes 
I don't wanna smoke dimes
Ayy, yuh
I swear nobody loyal, all I do is rap like aluminum foil
Niggas don't life free so I'm doin' it for you
Underground music, mix the boof wit' the soil
Next nigga disrespect get slapped like iPods
Cannabis abuse, I inherit a slight cough
I'm just wakin' up, you turnin' the lights off
That bitch actin' fake, she makin' my nights long
Codeine and Smirnoff so my liquor pink
Come from the underground where a sinner sinks
Fuck Lambos and ice, I'm into bigger things
Smoke grass wit' you, bro, we could be slithering
Holy fuck, I'm spitting flame, the devil is entering
I'm so rare, god personally mentored me
I flow Hennessey, spit make your liver bleed
You feel me? I'm gon' be free if it kills me
Niggas poppin' at the crip, trying to peel me
Niggas copy how I live, tryna steal me
Lot of beef cookin', No Lil' B
Can't call everybody your friend
Smokin' dro, got a nigga so high
Niggas always hatin', I don't even know why
I don't even know why
Smokin' dro, got a nigga so high
Black like a crow so a nigga so fly
So a nigga so high
Smokin' dro, got a nigga so high
Niggas always hatin', I don't even know why
You will never win against me, even if you win against me
Part 2: "vintage malboro clique *sk8boards acid tabs*"
Part 3: "ICY WHITE MACBOOK"Lyrics From Snippets
Lil Tracy
Driving so fast with no license
She sucked my dick, looked me in my eyes, let do her like this
And like I said, I check my bank account
I see them  and I can't help but smile
Sit the fuck down, 'lil boy
Don't make a sound, 'lil boy
Got your bitch at the house, 'lil boy
She said she want a Birky
Bitch you sound like a junkie
Boy your diamonds so blurry
Must've got them for dirt cheap
Call up , he cop up a Sprite
Put a hole in your face like a bagel
I just put this bad bitch on the table
Got your mother, I think imma date you
Niggas dying every day, this shit get real
I might go buy a Drakе, and then I might extend my clip
Many niggas talkin' mе, but 
I bet if I switch a lane, that 'lil boy gone do a saying
I got  in my pocket, I got VV's in my chain
I'm still screaming, "Free the gang!"
Wish I could break you out today
Got you lying on that bullshit, that shit great
She'll have my sister beat your ass, and then I should spit in your face
I got a thousand dollar plans, but I still can see bluefaces

, let me see your 69's...
