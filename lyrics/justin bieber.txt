For all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourselfYou gotta go and get angry at all of my honesty
You know I try, but I don't do too well with apologies
I hope I don't run out of time, could someone call a referee?
'Cause I just need one more shot at forgiveness
I know you know that I made those mistakes maybe once or twice
By once or twice, I mean maybe a couple a hundred times
So let me, oh let me redeem, oh redeem, oh myself tonight
'Cause I just need one more shot at second chances
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, yeah
Sorry
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'll take every single piece of the blame if you want me to
But you know that there is no innocent one in this game for two
I'll go, I'll go and then you go, you go out and spill the truth
Can we both say the words and forget this?
Yeah, is it too late now to say sorry?
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm not just trying to get you back on me 
'Cause I'm missing more than just your body 
Oh, is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah, I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down

Tryna talk, but we can't hear ourselves
Read your lips, I'd rather kiss 'em right back
With all these people all around
I'm crippled with anxiety
But I'm told it's where I'm s'posed to be
You know what? It's kinda crazy 'cause I really don't mind
When you make it better like that
Don't think we fit in at this party
Everyone's got so much to say, oh yeah, yeah

There was nobody that compared to my baby
And nobody came between us, nor could ever come above
She had me going crazy
Oh, I was starstruck
She woke me up daily, don’t need no Starbucks
She made my heart pound, and skip a beat when I see her in the street and
At school on the playground, but I really want to see her on the weekend
She knows she's got me dazing, cause she was so amazing
And now my heart is breaking, but I just keep on saying

I was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest 
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends? 
Can we be friends? 
Can we be friends?
Wonderin' if you got a body
To hold you tighter since I left 
Wonderin' if you think about me 
Actually, don't answer that 
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'

But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'

But you know we had something so good
I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?I hear a lot about sinners
Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's makin' me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know 
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know 
The first step pleases the Father
Might be the hardest to take
But when you come out of the water
I'm a believer, my heart is fleshy
Life is short with a temper like Joe Pesci
They always come and sing your praises, your name is catchy
But they don't see you how I see you, Parlay and Desi
Cross, Tween, Tween, Hesi' hit the jet speed
When they get messy, go lefty like Lionel Messi
Let's take a trip and get the Vespas or rent a Jet Ski
I know the spots that got the best weed, we goin' next week
I wanna honor, wanna honor you, bride's groom, I'm my father's child
I know when the son takes the first steps, the Father's proud 
If you make it to the water, He'll part the clouds 
I know He made you a snack like Oscar Proud 
Suffer it to be so now gotta clean it up 
Formalize the union in communion, He can trust 
I know I ain't leavin' you like I know He ain't leavin' us 
I know we believe in God, and I know God believes in us
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second

She ain't got a heart or a ass, just her brains
Gotta ask 'cause her ass on a learning curve 
And she love to hurn the berb, I mean burn the word
That's only legal with a doctor's note 
Real deep pockets like a doctor's coat 
Stay faded like Diddy's hair, back tryna rock the vote
She the first mate when I rock the boat 
She never forget to ride like a bicycle
She like planes, trains, chains with icicles
It goes her, blank, blank, and rock and roll 
She say "I know, honey bunny, that's the funny thing" 
Thots twerk for the Goodfellas
She money dance with the money team, IGH!
She's confident

White shirt now red, my bloody nose
Sleepin', you're on your tippy toes
Creepin' around like no one knows
Think you're so criminal
Bruises on both my knees for you
Don't say thank you or please
I do what I want when I'm wanting to
My soul so cynical
So you're a tough guy
Like it really rough guy

Chest always so puffed guy

Might seduce your dad type

But maybe it's 'cause I'm wearing your cologne 
I'm a bad guy 
I-I'm a bad guy 
I'm a bad...You put me on a pedestal and tell me I'm the best
Raise me up into the sky until I'm short of breath 
Fill me up with confidence, I say what's in my chest
Spill my words and tear me down until there's nothin' left
Rearrange the pieces just to fit me with the rest, yeah
But what if I, what if I trip?
What if I, what if I fall?
Then am I the monster?
Just let me know
And what if I, what if I sin?
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah
Then am I the monster? Yeah
Just let me know, yeah
I was fifteen when the world put me on a pedestal
I had big dreams of doin' shows and making memories
Made some bad moves tryin' to act cool, upset by their jealousy, uh
Liftin' me up , liftin' me up 
And tearin' me down , tearin' me down 
I'll take responsibility for everything I've done 
Holdin' it against me like you're the holy one 
I had a chip on my shoulder, had to let it go
'Cause unforgiveness keeps them in control
I came in with good intentions, then I let it go
And now I really wanna know
What if I, what if I trip? 
What if I, what if I fall? 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know 
And what if I, what if I sin? 
And what if I, what if I break? Yeah 
Then am I the monster? 
Just let me know

It's all 'bout you
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you do
Uh, uh
In time, ink lines
Bitches couldn't get on my incline
World tours, it's mine
Ten little letters on a big sign
Justin Bieber, you know I'ma hit 'em with the ether
Buns out, weiner, but I gotta keep an eye out for Selener
Beauty, beauty and the beast

'Cause all , I need is a beauty and a beat
Who can make my life complete 
It's all 'bout you 
When the music makes you move
Baby, do it like you doEverybody knows my name now
But somethin' 'bout it still feels strange
Like lookin' in a mirror, tryna steady yourself
And seein' somebody else
And everything is not the same now
It feels like all our lives have changed
Maybe when I'm older, it'll all calm down
But it's killin' me now
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
Everybody knows my past now
Like my house was always made of glass
And maybe that's the price you pay
For the money and fame at an early age
And everybody saw me sick
And it felt like no one gave a shit
They criticized the things I did as an idiot kid
What if you had it all
But nobody to call?
Maybe then you'd know me
'Cause I've had everything
But no one's listening
And that's just fuckin' lonely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onely
I'm so lo-o-o-onely
Lo-o-o-onelyMy life is a movie and everyone's watching
So let's get to the good part and past all the nonsense
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I've got to learn things, learn them the hard way
Got to see what it feels like, no matter what they say
Sometimes it's hard to do the right thing
When the pressure's coming down like lightning
It's like they want me to be perfect
When they don't even know that I'm hurting
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
I'll show you
Cause life's not easy, I'm not made out of steel
Don't forget that I'm human, don't forget that I'm real
Act like you know me, but you never will
There's one thing that I know for sure
I'll show you
I'll show youMark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my words
So you heard it all before
Falling in and out of trust
Trying to rekindle us
Only to lose yourself
But I won't let me lose you
And I won't let us just fade away
After all that we've been through
I'ma show you more than I ever could say
Mark my words, that's all that I have
Mark my words, give you all I got
In every way I will
You're the only reason why
Oh I don't wanna live a lie
Mark my words
Mark my wordsFeeling like I'm breathing my last breath
Feeling like I'm walking my last steps
Look at all of these tears I've wept
Look at all the promises that I've kept
I put my all into your hands
Here's my soul to keep
I let you in with all that I can
You're not hard to reach
And you bless me with the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose
Yeah, you've given me purpose
Thinking my journey's come to an end
Sending out a farewell to my friends, for inner peace
Ask you to forgive me for my sins, oh would you please?
I'm more than grateful for the time we spent, my spirit's at ease
I put my heart into your hands
Learn the lessons you teach
No matter when, wherever I am
You're not hard to reach
And you've given me the best gift
That I've ever known
You give me purpose everyday
You give me purpose in every way
Oh, you are my everything
Oh, you are my everything

I don’t know if this is wrong, because someone else is telling me that it’s wrong. But I feel this so let me just like try my best not to let this happen again.  We weren’t necessarily put in the best position to make the best decisions
You can’t be hard on yourself for it, these are the cards you were given so you have to understand that’s not who you are. You know you’re trying to be the best you can be, but that’s all you can do. If you don’t give it all you got, you’re only cheating yourself give it all you got but if it ends up happening, it ends up happening
That’s what happening with me, it’s like “God, I’m giving it all I’ve got, sometimes I’m weak and I’m going to do it.” And it’s like I’m not giving myself grace, I’m just like understanding that’s how it isIt don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense 'less I'm doing it with you
The sun don't set the same
'Less you're watching it go down with me
The bed won't sleep the same
'Less you're waking up in here with me
Oh, my heart's a vacant house
When you're gone away, it's so empty
And love don't make sense when it's empty 
I've driven almost every car
It ain't the same when I'm without you
Been around a million stars
None of them shine brighter than you
The sky be so dark now without you
Yeah, ooh, baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Oh been around the world
Ain't the same without you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Focus ain't the same
If the picture ain't got you in it
In every line my
Emotions ain't the same
If it ain't about you, I don't get it
Ever since the beginning now
You had that effect on me
All I wanna do is you, oh
I mean that so literally
Don't nobody go harder than you
All of the angels must be lonely now, without you, woah
]
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
'Less I'm doing it with you baby
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
I only want to hear your voice, yeah
Oh, been around the world
Ain't the same without you
Had to find out the hard way
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
Time and time again I break a plan
Without you, girl I ain't the man
Could never be all I can be
You overstand, I'm incomplete
Apparently, gotta know I hate that
How I'm supposed to take that?
Boo'd up, missing all of that
Gotta be laying in that
Rolled up, put a flame to that
Thought by now you would have made it back
Be patient
Won't you pull up to me now?
Live forever young
It’s amazing
I don't want to sleep 'less you at home
It don't make sense, no
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with you
No, it don't make sense
It don't make sense
It don't make no sense
'Less I'm doing it with youYou ain't gotta answer none of my calls
I'm believing you'll pick up one day
I don't wanna add to your pain at all
I'm praying that time makes a change in your life
I'm realizing how much you made a change in my life
And I don't wanna spend it with nobody else
Hear me? Don't nobody deserve myself
Oh no, baby what I'm saying is
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Calm down, don't rush, no pressure
Thought that you were in it for the paper
Never thought I'd take you serious
Now I need you, not a moment later
Losin' it, I'm so delirious
And I'ma put up a fight for it
Never give up a love like this
Finally I found someone
That can do me like no other
Talking to my conscience
I made a few mistakes
I did it to myself
I'm the only one to blame
I know you need a little while to believe again
To love again
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
I'll be waiting for you
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Right now, don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
Put my key in the ignition
Don't rush it girl, just stretch it out for me
I know that you ain’t got no place to be
Girl I need your attention
And every time I see you make that face
I wanna love you all over the place
Don't do it, baby
Don't do it to me, no, no
I know you don't wanna talk, right
We've been on and off like the cross lights
You heard I'm playin' with them hoes like I golf, right?
When I touch you, I get frostbite
Girl you're so cold, so cold, so cold
How we so young but livin' so old?
In the bed together but we sleepin' solo
That could drive you loco
You supposed to be my uno, Yoko Ono
Oh no, round two again
We've been fighting more than Ryu and Ken
Last time we argued eight straight days
I learned my lesson, I got straight As
And I know it's deeper than masseuses
Oh, you know I eat the cookie like I'm Lucious
Go ahead and take the time
But it's a waste of time if your waist ain't on mine
Think about it
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush, no pressure
You ain't gotta make your mind up
You ain't gotta make your mind up right now
Don't rush , no pressure
Say yeah, say yeah
You ain't gotta make your mind up now
Know I did you wrong
Let your heart heal
Don't rush, no pressureIf I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go
I could take you places you ain’t never been before
Baby, take a chance, or you’ll never ever know
I got money in my hands that I’d really like to blow
Swag swag swag, on you
Chillin' by the fire while we eating fondue
I dunno about me, but I know about you
So say hello to falsetto in three, two, swag

 Na-na-na , na-na-na, hey, if I was your boyfriendYou are to me
A part of me just like anatomy
You're pulling me
You're pulling me in like you're gravity
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
You give to me
Everything, anything that I could dream
And at least that's what it seems
Could it be I don't know what's good for me?
I'm notorious for thinking you're full of beautiful
Instead of hollow
Sugar on your lips, it starts to kill
Jagged like a pill, so hard to swallow
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm sinking faster and faster
Between heaven and disaster
Sorry if I make you feel like
I'm standing on the borderline
Am I in love with you? Am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?
I'm trying to find the truth, trying to find the truth
But sometimes the heart is deceiving
Can't get out of my head and I need you to save me
If I am delusional then maybe I'm crazy
In love with you, am I in love with you?
Or am I in love with the feeling?Oh-oh, just as sure as the stars in the sky
I need you to shine in my life
Not just for the meanwhile, for a long long time
Better believe it
Oh-oh, whenever you're not in my presence
It feels like I'm missing my blessings, yeah
So I sleep through the daylight, stay awake all night
'Til you're back again, oh yeah, yeah
You think I'm biased, to my significant other
You hit it right on the head, only been missing my lover
Got a whole lot of texts in my phone and I don't reply
But the next eight bars tell you why
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
Ain't worried about nobody else
If I ain't with you, I ain't myself
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me, yeah yeah
What's a king bed without a queen?
There ain't no "I" in team
You make me complete
You're all that matters to me
Take the gas out the car, it won't drive
That's how I feel when you're not by my side
When I wake up in the morning up under you
And only you

Faithful no matter the distance

From the bottom of my heart, please believe

Someone to share my reign
Tell me what you wanna drink

Yeah, yeah, never, -ever-ever-ever-ever, eh, eh-eh
See I never thought that I could walk through fire 
I never thought that I could take the burn 
I never had the strength to take it higher 
Until I reached the point of no return 
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
Ne-Never say never
I never thought that I could feel this power 
I never thought that I could feel this free 
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower 
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea, oh-oh
'Cause there's just no turning back 
When your heart's under attack 
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight 
I will fight 'till forever make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up-up-up
And never say never 
Here we go!
Guess who?
J Smith and JB
Uh-huh
I gotcha, lil bro
I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be trying a chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water for blood 
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand

Moonrise, tide change, right before our eyes
Aggressive but softly, you place your lips on my lips
We're each other's vice
Our feelings, they go deep, deeper than the touching
Deeper than the ocean, so we ain't never rushing through
Our days or our nights, ain't no repercussions

That's all I wanna do
I'm goin' through changes

I just wanna be the best of me
Even though sometimes I forget to breathe
So that I can be the best for you

Uh, people change, circumstances change
But God always remains the sameEnded up on a crossroad
Tried to figure out which way to go
It's like you're stuck on a treadmill
Running in the same place
You got your hazard lights on now
Hoping that somebody would slow down
Praying for a miracle
Ooh show your grace
Had a couple dollars and a quarter tank of gas
With a long journey ahead
Seen a truck pull over
God sent an angel to help you out
He gave you direction
Showed you how to read a map
For the long journey ahead
Said it ain't over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Relationship on a ski slope
Avalanche comin' down slow
Do we have enough time to salvage this love?
Feels like a blizzard in April
Cause my heart, it's just that cold
Skating on thin ice
But it's strong enough to hold us up
Seen her scream and holler
Put us both on blast
Tearing each other down
When I thought it was over
God sent in an angel to help us out
He gave us direction, showed us how to make it last
For that long journey ahead
Said it ain't ever over
Oh, even in the midst of doubt
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes, doesn't mean you have to give in
Life is worth living again
Life is worth living again
What I get from my reflection
Is a difference in perception?
From what the world may see
They tried to crucify me
I ain't perfect, won't deny
My reputation's on the line
So I'm working on a better me
Life is worth living
Life is worth living, so live another day
The meaning of forgiveness
People make mistakes
Only God can judge me
Life is worth living again
Another day
Life is worth living again9 times out of 10 you a 10

Of missing your loving
Haunts me at night
The ghosts are alive
All of the memories
Of serenity
Dwindle in my mind
All the time
Like a permanent stain
Wishing I could just wash away, away
Hate our love was in vein
Who was to blame
For all the pain
For all the pain
If I would have known
If I would have known
If I would have known
It could have been you
If I had a chance
If I had a chance
I'd make us brand new
I never wanted to be
Wanted to be
Your enemy, no, no

Been youNot sure what I was doing before ya
I quit tryna figure it out
Nothin' like havin' someone for you
Someone beside you when it's time to lay down
Fully committed, you're here for the stay down
Look in the mirror, you right for the takedown
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I need you all around me
Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah
Never thought I could ever be loyal
To someone other than myself
I never thought I could ever be a spoiler
Guess anything is possible with your help
Anything's possible since you made my heart melt
Gave me the best hand that I'd ever been dealt
Room for you in my coupe, let me open up the door
Open up my eyes to a feelin' I can't ignore
I need you all around me, yeah
Oh yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah

Wouldn't wanna be in any other place
From my home to the road
I'll make sure you're comfortable
You make sure I'm comfortable
Our love's unconditional
I need you all around me
All around me, yeah, yeah, yeahFeels like time's moving in slow motion
Just trying to occupy my mind
So that I don't go looney over you 
Just trying to amplify the sound
To drown out all of this need for you 
Biting my nails, got me nervous, so anxious
See it's one o'clock now
Noon felt like three hours ago
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
Say you almost right here now
Just say you pulling up to my gate
Don't say the signal faded driving through the canyon
Just hurry up for my sake
I was born ready for you
Skin sweeter than cinnamon
Eyes deeper than the ocean
Love me hard like, "Where you been?"
Love me like you don't want it to end
I just wanna know your E.T.A., E.T.A.​
Out the window, got me looking out the street
What's your E.T.A.?
Distance only made us grow fonder
Of one another
Be honest, what's your E.T.A.?
What's your E.T.A.?
Before you gotta go
Oh-oh-oh-oh
Before you gotta go
Drop a pin for me now
So I can learn your location
Thank you, yes, you're less than five minutes away from me
In your arms, rubbing on your face
Only place I wanna be
In the bed, where we lay our head
Only place I wanna beHappy birthday
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
If it ain't broke then we don't need to fix it
Believing in that she say'll have you livid
No they won't be happy 'til your love is over
They tryna break us up but you don't wanna get it
They ain't never had your back like I got it
They ain’t never had trust like how we got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it
Don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary
Don't want us to lose what we are, no
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
It's like you're always looking for a problem
But there ain't enough equations for you to solve 'em
So quick to turn nothin' right into somethin'
Take the numbers out my phone, go 'head and call 'em
They ain’t ever had my back like you got it
They ain't never had a chance, how you got it
So they can't help but to come and hate on it
They see what we got and you know they want it, don't question it
You ain't gotta question it
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary 
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we are
She texts me "How's you love life?"
And "How are you?", I said "I'm good"
They only get as close as you allow them to
We should be closer together
Warm oceans, better weather
Instead of us playing games forever
She says whatever
I says whatever
Who get you wetter than the half moon wearer?
HSTRY sweater
Serendipity when you with me
Swear you love that one thing we did
That one time in that one place
Blew your mind, you got my mind gone when I'm home
I'm serious girl, a much older dude, a whole 42
I've accomplished my goals, it's only you
You and I in that Wraith, retired my pimp super-fly cape
Just my Mets cap and my batch and I'm straight
Esco
You ain't gotta question it, oh
You already know the answer
The truth'll make us relevant
Hurts but it's necessary, yeah
Don't want us to lose what we are
Don't want us to lose what we are
Lose what we areTry to bite my tongue, but I can't take it
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion? 
Do you second that emotion? 
You really got me open 
Do you second that emotion? 
High heels on, heard you comin' 'fore I seent ya
Movies all around, but you look like the feature
Had another meeting, now my plan is to meet you
Got my hands out, all I wanna do is reach ya
All I wanna do is greet ya
Infatuated, sorry if I stare

Struck a match, you got me litty, like, "La, la, la, la" 
You got the keys to my city , like, "La, la, la, la" 
Do you second that emotion, baby? 
Mmm, yeah
Out to big boys 
Spring her off the hitch , everything legit
Movin' like the blitz , crib like the Ritz 
So you know there's room 
So, baby, please
Don't like to talk to bitch , just like to play the wish
I know the problem is they bothered by the kid 
Oh, you sent the jet out for me?
You tryna ball harder than me?
Did I come 'cross your radar?
Cross your mind now and later?
Do you feel like you know me?
It's just a part of nature
Let's ask each other questions
Can we do each other favors?
Would you mind the labor? Baby
Try to bite my tongue, but I can't take it 
I got whiplash from me turnin' my head 
Have somewhere else to go, no, I can't make it 
I'd rather take my chance with you instead
Do you second that emotion?

You got the keys to my city, like, "La, la, la, la"
Do you second that emotion, baby?Subjected to my system
Reflecting on the days
When we used to be just friends
Protected both our interest
Our trust was in a bank
That's where our hearts were safe
And then we got closer
Separated from my ex
So we got closer

Feelings got stronger
Now this is out our hands
Our love is here to stay

Instigators, like putting fire on propane
The wrong thing, they be worrying about
Ooh you know females and how they like to run they mouths
Wanna be, wanna be just like talk like, you
Like you, you, like you
Misery, misery loves company
Don't let 'em change your mood
They try to get at me 
Behind your back 
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others
But I ain't all bad
No, no I ain't all bad, all bad, all bad
I ain't that bad, all bad all bad
I might make you mad, so mad, my bad

Between us, they wanna come in
Your worst enemy, so they try to be your best friend
Perfect, ain't saying that I am
Proven, at least I've proven that I give a damn
Wanna be, wanna be everything I oughta be
To you to you, to you
Envy, envy, same thing as jealousy
Jealous of you
That's what they do
They try to get at me, they try to get at me
Behind your back, your back, your back, your back
They tryna tell me that I'm just like the others

I might make you mad, so mad, my bad
No I ain't all badFirst, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah
I'm missing your good intentions, I'm missing you from a distance
Hope you did the same
I know that I caused a problem, know that I left you livid
Pushed you far away
Learned it don’t pay to lie cause I don’t wanna see you cry
Saying nothing gets you nowhere fast, I'mma hold it back inside
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing else really matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again
Learn a lot through trial and error, tryna make it right
Make it right, make it right
Make it right, this time I'll do you right, woah
I'm going through old emotions, tryna find a reason
That we ended that way
Nothing in life is perfect, we'll be changing like the seasons
That's what they used to say
If it's going to sleep alone at night, I don’t wanna close my eyes
Wanna give you all I have to give, no more holding back this time
Well now that I'm back around ya, nothing around me matters
Hope you feel the same
First, I'll acknowledge, all trust has been broken
A successful recovery, I pray for us at night
Bless me with a second chance, never thought I’d see your face again

Don’t let this effort go to waste
Put our all in it
Don’t wanna be left with the question, why?
Let’s be honest with ourselves
Did we really come this far
Just to watch it go down the drain?
Sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature
We got so much more to live for
They don’t wanna see us together now
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh

And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow
If you want the best for us
Like I want the best for us
Then we gotta learn to trust right now
Growing pains come along with these changes
Some people get closer
Some people separate, yeah
Don’t think we should separate
When we both adore one another
You’re a dream come true
We should start over brand new
That’s what we oughta do, yeah
Yeah, sometimes the heart can see
What’s invisible to the eye
All you gotta do is listen to your deepest feelings
They don’t ever lie
Giving up is immature, oh
We got so much more to live for, oh
They don’t wanna see us together now, oh
Let's be strong enough to endure, oh
If I believe in love
And you believe in love
Then we can be in love, somehow

Oh, you're sorry?
Well, where are you now that I need you?
But girl, let me tell you something
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
I know when that hotline bling
I'm sure I'm not your only fling
Every time I leave the city you
Been hangin' out with him like I don't know
Stay away from places that we always go
Tellin' him that we don't even talk no more
Every time he leave the city, you
Try to run game on me like it's just us
But I seen you in a Snapchat on his tour bus
When you hit my line, it don't mean that much
I know you called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
Called him on his cell phone
When you couldn't reach my love
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
I know when that hotline blings
Sure I'm not your only flame
Every time I leave the city you, you, you
Tell me where he like to shop when you're up under him
Said you're lyin' 'bout being with your girlfriends
When you take advantage of me bein' absent
Take advantage, yeah
And I really tried taking you serious baby, it’s really your loss
You had the chance being the only girl livin' in my heart and cross
Wanted to hold you down for a while, keep you smiling, no matter the cost
Would I double cross?
We could be talking on my cell phone
Right now when you need my love
Lose the number to my cell phone
Cause you don't really care about my love
Call me on that hotline bling
If you wanna be with me
Call me on that hotline bling, right now
If you wanna be with meWell let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend
When she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you?
Or were you not aware?
You're the smile on my face, and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well, I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't wanna lose it either
And I don't think I can stand sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well, did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry?
Cause I know that a piece of you’s gone, every time you done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song I'll have figured out
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let your
You can’t fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh, my love 
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
What's gonna make you fall in love? 
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all 
Oh, my love
But you can't fly unless you let your, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall
But if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you listen,  let yourself fallAin't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now 
Ain't nobody got no patience
Want what they want right now
Ain't no need in being so anxious

Take a moment to cherish this space
So quick to move forward, no pressure

Lips on your neck
We're never too close now
Nothing like you and me
I don't know your name
But I'm sure that you know me
Fell in love with the music
The feeling is mutual
Loving the way you move on me
Skin so soft, hands on my face to be directed
And you're all that I can see
You give the baddest one in here a run for their money
And when this song comes on, you know
I need a one dance
1942 in my hand
One more time 'fore I go
Body lockin', put a hold on me

Hold on me

One more dance is all I need
One more dance is all I need
Oh, oh, ohAcross the ocean, across the sea
Starting to forget the way you look at me now
Over the mountains, across the sky
Need to see your face, I need to look in your eyes
Through the storm and through the clouds
Bumps in the road, and upside down now
I know it's hard to be asleep at night
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
All alone in my room
Waiting for your phone call to come soon
For you, oh, I would walk a thousand miles
To be in your arms holding my heart
Oh I, oh I, I love you
And everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the long nights and the bright lights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
You know that I care for you
I'll always be there for you
I promise I'll just stay right here
I know that you want me too
Baby, we can make it through anything
Cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry, 'cause everything's gonna be alright
Be alright
Through the sorrow and the fights
Don't you worry

Wednesday
It feel like a Tuesday when you met me
I remember it like it was yesterday
You just said, "Hello," I lost my sanity
Thought you was lookin' through me
Then you made me laugh with personality
When you said goodbye that was a tragedy
Had to get a lesson in anatomy
You just ran me over
Look out, watch out, got me on the defense
Thought love at first sight was just a false pretense
Took my hat off, made me pledge allegiance
Everything was in divine sequence

When I left you, when I met you
I called mom and told her 'bout it
I got all up on your IG and was scrollin' down for hours

It’s been 72 hours since the crash
A fiery ball come clashing from the sky
Reports still show no known survivors
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens
You said “I come in peace” so I took you home
I gave you food and I gave you clothes
I taught you how to move your feet when the rhythm's on
Still you wanna leave cause you feel alone
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive
They’re gonna try to take away the secrets of your planet's life
I know you must be upset, you lost your family in a wreck
But you gotta listen
Don’t try to find your spaceship
They might be out there waiting
Stay in my backpack forever
Stay in my backpack forever
You know I gotta find my spaceship, my planet’s outside there waiting, I can’t stay in your backpack forever
Stay in your backpack
Before you came around I was in a rut
Didn’t have a friend, didn’t know what it was
You taught me how to dream and how to love
You’re my best friend please listen to me
You don’t know what they’re like, if they know that you’re alive

Different galaxy, they try to capture me
When I die they gonna name this planet after me
Wayne’s world

Sounds like something out of a movie
After 
First of all the object is lying here
There were other lifeforms in the ship
UFO 
Nobody knows what to do, we’re all freaking out here
We found this but no one can identify it
There’s aliens, I’m telling you there’s aliens

See, growing up, I
I always felt like I had to be the best at everything
Cause I, I just didn't think I was good enough
And, and maybe if I was good at something that I'd get recognition from that but
I quickly found out that I wasn't gonna get the recognition that I wanted or that I needed because
Because people aren't perfect and by not being perfect you sometimes can disappoint people
And with God it's like he's perfect
And he never disappoints
So I just get my recognition from him
And give him recognitionThere's no sophistication in my lack of patience
I'm just wishing you were better at communication
As I sit here steady waiting
Wishing that you would call my name in
 & Justin Bieber]
It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving
Cause of all the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me
All of the love that you give me, give me
(Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change)
Wishing I was better at this damn thing
Cause it's just been too long and I can't change
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
Gotta be strong, strong, strong
What should I do? Should I go?
Who do I talk to? Nobody knows
Who knows the answer to all of my questions?
When will I get over this, over this?

It's cause you're the only one I'm really missing
Nobody else would be forgiving

When you got a bunch of feelings that you don't show?
I could tell, I could tell, I could tell certain people don't like me no more
New shit don't excite me no more, guess that they don't really make em like me no more
You can look me in my eyes and see I ain't myself
Cause if y'all what I created then I hate myself
But still, let them girls in and tell them all leave their cell phones
On the table where we see them
I'm all day with it man, A.M to the P.M
Niggas hating, I just wish that they would say it when they see him, that's that ish that drives me crazy
And that's all I've been getting lately
And it's probably why I'm scared to put the time in
Women want to fuck like they're me and I'm them
Looking for some things and I think that I can find them in you
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah, trust issues
Oh woah, trust issues, oh woah
Yeah, oh yeah, oh yeah
Let's call up one drink and let's all get wasted
One drink and let's all get faded, yeah
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Call up one drink and let's, let's call up one, uhI close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you love me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
I close my eyes, I take it slow
Lay on down and let me rest my soul
I've been so high, I've been so low
I'm just tryna find my way back home
Can't help but roam
My signal's gone
Guess this journey's left me on my own
I don't care why
I'm alone, alone, alone
And if I could
Forget about the way you loved me
Forget about the world we set in stone
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
I never thought that I'd be broken
I never thought I'd be this far from home
I'm dreaming with my eyes wide open now
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
If only I could hit the ground
Take it one day at a time
Reach for the stars now
Ooh just leave the past behind
That's a part of living, woah
That's a part of living, woah, oh yeah
If only I could hit the ground
Yeah, eh, eh, eh, if only I could
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground, right now, I would
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be falling down
Yeah, woah if only I could hit it
If only I could hit the ground
If I could hit the ground
Then I'd be touching down
If only I could hit the groundOoh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side
Ooh, and you can trust me
After all the lies I told you
Yeah, that's what love is
That's what true love is
Don't nobody else deserve my time
I reach out to you, but my hands can't hold enough
Enough of your greatness
You teach me patience
Like the best of our worlds collide
Never understood what it meant
It meant to submit to love
So beyond what lust is
Hey, it's a blessing that you're in my life
Make me look even better
When we shine, we shine together
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Don't nobody else deserve my eyes
When you demand my presence, it's hard to read the message
I stay on the defense to take away your leverage
'Til you put it in perspective
Can't help but to respect it
Oh, now I know what love is
I know what true love is
Yeah, down in my soul
Far more than you know
My self-esteem gets low
You lift it right up through the ceiling, woah
Ooh, and I can feel you
Even though I haven't touched you
Yeah, that's what love is
Now, that's what love is
Wouldn't want nobody else by my side, no

Now we kick it in Japan, kung-fu
So I'm heading for the gold, I'm sweating
I swear Otis Redding will be oh-so ready
I already got ahead-y of the game, I'm with Kenny
And we steady getting many, I mean money
Riding in an all-black Benz with the all black rims
And we looking at some 10s through our all-black lenses
Wait...I'm not done
I thanked Jesus at the awards I'm never going to hell
Call me Zack Morris, I'm saving you by the bell
My girl says I'm perfect she just loves an imperfect person perfectly
Personally I think she is perfectly perfect
I get it done abundantly, she wants to get up under me
I swear I got a hun' of these cause baby I'm a money tree
So be my little honey be my little-bitty bunny
I got honeys all up on me baby I just get it done-y
Possibly you're probably thinking this type of swag is impossible
And logically will probably but you just take me lyrically
Try to feel me spiritually, get out your mind literally
There's a bigger me inside this little me
Screaming out I should make history
I am like a mystery, hated by jealousy cause they envy me
Run up on my enemies see if they remember me
Soon as they remember me I wipe away their memory
Can't you see the private jets flying over you?
I ain't even notice but my focus on my photos
Might be bogus, no they shouldn't be a photoshoot
It's funny how you wanna take my picture and it's like your first time
Playing with camera claiming that "It's not mine"
Just calm down, you don't gotta hurry
Don't be nervous, you don't gotta worry
And my fans are like my glasses, yeah without them I'd be blurryI love you, need you
Need you here to stay
Girl you're on my mind like 24/7
Every single time that I'm not with you
If you spend the night, baby it could be heaven
Hit me on my line if you're tryna come through
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
Every time you're distant, girl somethin' is missin'
And wish that I could fix it, I wish things were different
What else, what else? If you love me, girl then say it
Say what else, what else? If you wanna be my baby
I feel my heartbeat bumpin' to the bass
She give me butterflies and they won't go away
Under the stars, she took my hand and said
"I love you, need you, need you here to stay"
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
Is this what you want? The baddest
I know what you want, without askin'
I hit once, had to have it
I hit twice, it's a habit, don't get caught up in traffic
I heard that it's hazardous stormin' outside, let's do that on the mattress
I just keep askin, is it real, is it real? Look, tell me, is it real?
Yep, real enough to go and get it tatted
Give you flowers, now you look like you're on a pageant
I can take you to the crib, condo, or the cabin, what's up?
If you make it, I can make it happen, I can grant it
Don't you take my "grant it" though for granted
I know that's not your intent, we ain't even campin'
And to leave this bed I'mma need a fuckin' ransom
Man I got her screamin' "Finally Famous!" when we fly around
Never lie to you 'less I lie you down
I put the writin' on the wall, but you don't understand it all like we in Chinatown
We one and one, both one of ones, and when you put the twos together
That's not twenty-two, it's forever, I promise 20-20 couldn't even make it clearer
I swear, Sean Don
I'd like to give you what you need
I try but you're makin' it hard for me
How do I make you believe?
Cause I love you, need you, need you here to stay
I'd like to give you what you need

Cause nothing can ever, ever replace you
Nothing can make me feel like you do
You know there’s no one, I can relate to
And know we won’t find a love that’s so true
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together
I gave you everything, baby, everything I had to give
Girl, why would you push me away? Yeah
Lost in confusion, like an illusion
You know I'm used to making your day
But that is the past now, we didn't last now
I guess that this is meant to be
Tell me was it worth it? We were so perfect
But baby I just want you to see
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me
Together through the storm
There’s nothing like us, there’s nothing like you and me

Rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum pum
Yeah, I'm on the drum, yeah, I'm on the snare drum
Yeah, I'm on the beat 'cause the beat goes dumb
And I only spit heat 'cause I'm playing for the Son
Playing for the king, playing for the title
I'm surprised you didn't hear this in the Bible
I'm so tight I might go psycho
Christmas time, so here's a recital
I'm so bad like Michael, I know
I'm still young, but I go, I go
Stupid, stupid, love like Cupid
I'm the drummer boy, so do it, do it

Nothing to give our king , pa rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum, rum pum pum pum
Yo, at the table with the family, havin' dinner
BlackBerry on our hip and then it gave a little flicker
Then I took a look to see before it activates the ringer
Came to realize my homie Bieber hit me on the Twitter
Then I hit him back, despite I had some food up on my fingers
Sippin' eggnog, with a little sprinkle of vanilla
Even though it's kinda cold, I'm pullin' out a chinchilla
Bieber hit me back and said, "Let's make it hot up in the winter", I said "Cool"
You know I'ma deliver
Let's collaborate and make the holiday a little bigger
Before we work, I gotta get this off
See the other family members and drop gifts off
Then I'm headed to the studio 'cause ain't nothing stopping how
You know we 'bout to turn it up and really get it poppin' now
People everywhere and all our Twitter followers
Merry Christmas, Kwanza, Happy Hanukkah
Mary nodded, pa rum pa pum pum

If you wanna give, it's the time of year
JB on the beat, yeah, yeah, I'm on the snare
It's crazy how some people say they, say they don't care
When there's people on the street with no food, it's not fair
It's about time for you to act merrily
It's about time for you to give to charity
Rarely do people even wanna help at all
'Cause they're warm by the fire getting toys and their dolls
Not thinkin' there's a family out hungry and cold
Wishin', wishin' that they had somebody they could hold
So I think some of you need to act bold
Give a can to a drive, let's change the globe, globe, globe, globe, globe
I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

I'm the drummer boy so do it, do it

Yeah 
Once again 
The dynamic duo is back at it
JB, Luda
I love everything about you, you're imperfectly perfect
Everyone's itchin' for beauty, but just scratching the surface
Lost time is never found, can the DJ please reverse it?
In life we pay for change, let's make every second worth it
Anything can work if you work it
When people say you don't deserve it, then don't give in
'Cause hate may win some battles, but love wins in the end
You shine just like the sun while the moon and the stars reflect your light
Beauty revolves around you, it's only right that
All around the world, people want to be loved
All around the world, they're no different than us
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world
All around the world-world-worldGirl I'm ready if you're ready now

Maybe you could change me
Maybe you could change me, woah
Maybe you could be the light that opens up my eyes
Make all my wrongs right, change me, change me
Don't fight fire with fire
If I'm screaming, talk quieter

Feel the pain that I'm facing
Be like serenity, help reposition my mind
Take a chance make a difference, in my life
Maybe you could change me

She became a victim to my busy schedule
And I know that it's not fair, that don't mean that I don't care
This one's dedicated to the girl out there
Girl you always catch me at the bad time

Not breathing, what is it I'm not seeing?

It's like my heart's bleeding knowing that you don't need me
Shut my heart down, now I don't know what I'mma do now

You sip champagne while I sip on red wine
Never mind me watchin' you, never mind the tension

Quisiera regresar el tiempo y cambiar errores
Se que todo fue mi culpa y te cause dolores
Espero que de volver tu tengas intenciones
Por que hoy estoy aquí extrañándote
Okay, tu por mi morias ma'
No solo física, había química
Yo te llamaba y no querias contestar
Se que fui tonto y no te supe valorar
Entiende mi estilo de vida
Por favor comprende que esto no paso de repente
Si esta en mi manos no lo dejo a la suerte
Solo espero que me perdones
Nena, tengo tantas ganas de amarte
Solo quiero que me perdones
Si tu y yo no podemos estar
Olvida todo, no voy a fallar
I'm not just trying to get you back on me
Cause I'm missing more than just your body
Is it too late now to say sorry?
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?
I'm sorry, yeah
Sorry, oh
Sorry
Yeah I know that I let you down
Is it too late to say I'm sorry now?Everybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me? Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me? Cause baby I didn't
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me, that should be me
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies? What you doing to me, you're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working because you know that
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
Oooh
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong, I can't go on
'Til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh oh baby, oh that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be me, that should be me
Never shoulda let you go, I never shoulda let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never shoulda let you go
I'm never gonna let you go
That should be me
I'm never gonna let you goKid
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
Sometimes I don't mind you havin' the worst day
Oh, no, I don't
All the stress turns into built-up energy
Yes, it does
On the edge, I'm your net, go on and fall back
Easy on that pressure point, I love to push that
Let your frustrations out right here
I'm your psychiatrist, let's talk about it
We can use sign language, I know your body
I see the weight weighin' on your shoulders
It's so heavy
Let me be the meaning of your composure
Oh, oh
You can take it out on me
You can take it out on me
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might
And get it all out 'til you feel light
And take it out on me
You can take it out on me
Yeah, I'm your plug
Whatever you need, I'll make sure you get enough
And when your battery gets low
I'ma be the one to charge you up
Let me massage your mental and your physical
Whenever you lose doubt, I'll be your miracle
When you're around me, you should feel invincible
Please don't forget that
You can take it out on me, yeah-yeah-yeah-yeah
You can take it out on me, hey, hey, hey, hey
I'll be your punching bag, hit me with all of your might 
And get it all out 'til you feel light 
And take it out on me 
You can take it out on me Visual visual, JB
Yo, Ye, what up? Raekwon
You got stacks like the International House of Pancakes
All alone, ready to phone me and your hand shakes
Palms is wet, a don's regret
Never to walk miles for love, I sit in the starter's deck
It just happened, I was floatin', you seen the captain?
Blinked at me then I threw him my thinking cap
Take her, then we could slide to Jamaica
Shop for like a year or two, stop in Diego
It's obvious, I want to see who your mami is
We just friends so she can't Clyde, Bonnie this
Fly walls, dinin' in fly halls
Come to the master suite, leave every piece in the master hall
All my money tied in knots
Stand over there, that's why I make it happen on blocks
Brazil cut sweater, Audi leather
Playin' the field, tryin' to out-slick Baretta
You see my baby up and hit the road
Where she's going? That's what nobody knows
I need to find her 'fore another man does
I wouldn't want him to steal my love
I'm just tryna be cool, cool, cool
Tryna be cool, what you expect me to do?
I'm just tryna find, find, find this sweet love of mine
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
Last name West and my teeth diamonds
She said "Yo, what's your occupation, crazy rhymin'?"
Listen to Wu-Tang, tryin' suits on
Accoutrements is Grey Poupon
Stuntin' in a high-top Louis, shorts is the Coogis
Open up the door when you take her to the movies
When you meet the parents, you tell De Niro
Her boyfriend a zero, she need to cut the weirdo
Next show, they gotta up the zeros
Nobody rockin' like this 16 years old
The hard drums and the Wally's somethin' that caught me
I'm tellin' you what Wu-Tang taught me
The young youth, rockin' the gold tooth
Pull up in a drop top, old school bumpin' to "Cash Rules"
No question, we the reason why the summer's blazin'
Then say, "You lookin' good, fly colored Asian"
Raw, I give it to ya, no trivia
She used to roll with my G-Unit like Olivia
'Til she caught me gettin' numbers and hugs
I guess that's the day she became a runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
Why can't I find you, love of mine
When you're standing in front of my face?
Oh why, I must be blind?
How did I let you get away?
Hahah, yeah
Leave it up to the most high, sittin' in ghost fly
Chillin' with two of my brothers
We both live on deck, baggin' 'em on set
This is how we roll independent, she a go, I'ma go get
Take that queen or shorty up
We can live it up every month, baby girl, just call me up
Wakin' up, restin' in cold sweats
Thinkin' of this , the videotapes, even the stress
My mind is a terrible thing to waste
No love lost, I know I'm goin' crazy, I can't floss
Me, my lady, left my homies, it's all baloney
Just like rockin' the old Ponys
So when I'm chillin', I'm just lost, no more feelin'
I need my honey in my life, get that? Feel me?
Take your time, Rae, Justin, yeah, you shine
My runaway love didn't mind, come on
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway love
I'm running out of time, where is my runaway love?
Searching low and high, know that I'm not letting up
I'd give it all up for us, but it'll never be enough
I won't stop until I find my runaway loveMy friends say I'm a fool to think that you're the one for me
I guess I'm just a sucker for love
Cause honestly the truth is that you know I'm never leaving
Cause you're my angel sent from above
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

Fool me, fool me, oh how ya do me
Kiss me, kiss me, say that ya miss me
Tell me what I want to hear, tell me you love me
People try to tell me but I still refuse to listen
Cause they don't get to spend time with you
A minute with you is worth more than
A thousand days without your love, oh your love
Baby you can do no wrong, my money is yours
Give you little more because I love ya, love ya
With me, girl, is where you belong, just stay right here
I promise my dear I'll put nothing above ya, above ya

Should I move in close or just be still?
How will I know?
Cause if I take a chance and I touch her hand, will everything change?
How do I know, if she feels the same, oh?

Can't deny it

Oh no, oh no, oh
I'll never let you goI never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us, and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer
But just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry, and cry, and cry, and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try, and try, and try, and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
And mommy, you were always somewhere
And daddy, I live out of town
So tell me, how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best
So tell me, why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away and now I just need you here
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
Back down to earth, back down to earth
We fell so far away from where we used to be
Now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to earth
Down to earth, down to earth
On our way back down to earth
I never thought that it'd be easy
'Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering howI always knew you were the best

But never knew you'd get like this, girl

And I'm just saying "deuces," I just need a new oneWell let me tell you a story about a girl and a boy
He fell in love with his best friend, when she's around, he feels nothing but joy
But she was already broken and it made her blind
But she could never believe that love would ever treat her right
But did you know that I loved you? Or were you not aware?
Well you're the smile on my face and I ain't going nowhere
I'm here to make you happy, I'm here to see you smile
But I've been wanting to tell you this for a long while
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
Well I can tell you're afraid of what this might do
Cause we got such an amazing friendship and that you don't wanna lose
Well I don't want to lose it either
But I don't think I can stay sitting around while you're hurting babe, so take my hand
Well did you know you're an angel who forgot how to fly?
Well did you know that it breaks my heart every time to see you cry
Cause I know that a piece of you's gone every time he done wrong, I'm the shoulder you're crying on
And I hope by the time that I'm done with this song  I'll have figured out
Who's gonna make you fall in love?
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself fall
I will catch you if you fall
I will catch you if you fall, I will catch you if you fall
And if you spread your wings, you can fly away with me
But you can't fly unless you let you, you can't fly unless you let yourself
Fall in love
I know you got your wall wrapped all the way around your heart
Don't have to be scared at all, oh my love
But you can't fly unless you let you, let yourself fall, oh babyBATMAN VS. SUPERMAN

Fellas just the moment you've been waiting for
Girl if you see something you like then let them know
Ladies I know you’re ready
Because you only got one chance, yeah yeah
For your first dance, you never forget about your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam
Tell them J.B., yeah, man
When I close my eyes, I see me and you at the prom
We've both been waiting so long for this day to come
Now that it's here, let's make it special
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, ain't no chaperones
This could be the night of your dreams
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
I couldn't ask for more
We're rocking back and forth under the disco ball
We're the only ones on the floor
I can't deny, there's so many thoughts in my mind
The D.J.'s playing my favorite song, now we're all alone
Here's the opportunity
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
Everybody says that we look cute together
Let's make this a night the two of us remember
No teachers around to see us dancing close
I'm telling you our parents will never know
Before the lights go up and the music turns off
Now's the perfect time for me to taste your lip gloss
Your glass slippers in my hand right here
We'll make it before the clock strikes nine
Only if you give, give the first dance to me
Girl, I promise I'll be gentle
I know we got to do it slowly
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetime
It's your chance take her hand to the floor, to the floor
Girl, if you see something you like then let them know
Because you only got one chance, for your first dance
So take advantage of the slow jam, yeah man
If you give, give the first dance to me
I'm gon' cherish every moment
Cause it only happens once, once in a lifetimeWith you, with you
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Now, Romeo and Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie and Clyde never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I both know it can't work
It's all fun and games 'til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam and Eve, tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny and Cher, I don't care, I've got you baby
See we both fighting every inch of our fiber
Cause ain't no way it's going to end right but we are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't want to let go, and I don't want to let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't want to fall, but we're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like just because this cold, cruel world saying we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree
And I ain't with it
And I don't want to be so old and grey, reminiscing about these better days
But convention's telling us to let go
So we'll never know
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
Cause everything we did, and everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time, I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space
Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with youI said girl
What you wanna do to me
I can be your fantasy
Tonight
I said girl
What you, what you wanna do?
It can just be me and you
Tonight tonight
People say it can't be found
Love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that babe
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Girl you know that we'll be fine
You can never leave my mind
Girl you know that we'll be fine
We're alright
I said girl
We can take it to the floor
I'm gonna have you screaming more
Tonight
I said girl
We can lay and watch a movie
Or we can jump in the jacuzzi
Tonight
People say it can't be found
Love is in the air right now
And you can tell I really care right now
When I touch you like that babe
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
I ain't looking for a heartbreak
Now that's a feeling that I can't shake
No time for the heartache
Too busy making love on the mattress
It's time for the mistakes
I just wanna say babe
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
Stay with me forever
Lay with me forever
As long as we're together
We'll be fine, we'll be fine
We'll be fine
Girl you know that we'll be fine
You can never leave my mind

Thinking 'bout what you gotta say
Cause I'm here to stay
Look at all the places, places that I've been
It doesn't come easy, you gotta have strength
And when it goes down and it’s all said and done
You gotta stand up so there’s no need to run
And now that I've made it
I won’t look back no
Sacrifice what meant the most to me
The most to me, yes I did

Yeah, only you shawtyYou called me, tried to shake the other line
In a hurry, know you didn't have the time
To wait on my broken promises
I sought you, the reason with no rhyme
We tried to work it out, we tried way back when
Your heart was spilling over without an end
I hurt you once before I hurt you again
You lost the faith that you had, had trusted in
So
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us
I don't want a break, I don't want a break from us

I don't want a break, I don't want a break from love
A break from love
A break from love

This burning will only last a while
First degree burns don't leave scars
We can turn this plane around

Keep wondering if you're too high maintenance
Look in your mind
Keep wondering if I'm just too famous 
Tryna shake the negative energy

Open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away 
Oh, wash away
21 years ago, it's never ever been the same
And all my life I never wanted to play the game
I'm not the same as Michael even though the hall of fame
I'm all hall of faith
Put me on the wall of change
I got a couple things I learned along the way
Figured out how to mean what I say
I just gotta be me...
Open your mind
Wider than the ocean
Life is but a moment
And every single time you wanna give up
Hold on tight to what you love, and don't let go
And every single time you wanna break
Break from your troubles
Take a breath, every step
Let it wash away, wash away 
Oh, wash awayIt's like every time you fall
No one's gonna lend you a helping hand, oh
Wondering will you spend your life facing four walls
Like standing in quicksand, oh
Don't let your guard down, hold your head up
Life comes at you fast, gotta stay strong
I know what you can be cause underneath
You've had wings all along
And you've been travelling the same road for a long time
Feels like you're burning rubber going nowhere fast
I mean to tell you there's no limit to what you can do
You just gotta believeNever say never, yeah yeah
See I never thought that I could walk through fire
I never thought that I could take the burn
I never had the strength to take it higher
Until I reached the point of no return
And there's just no turning back
When your heart's under attack
Gonna give everything I have
It's my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down, I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Never say never
I never thought I could feel this power
I never thought that I could feel this free
I'm strong enough to climb the highest tower
And I'm fast enough to run across the sea
'Cause there's just no turning back, oh no
When your heart's under attack, oh no
Gonna give everything I have
'Cause this is my destiny
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Here we go, guess who?
J Smith and JB, uh huh
I gotcha lil bro, I can handle them
Hold up, aight? I can handle them
Now he's bigger than me, taller than me
And he's older than me and stronger than me
And his arms a little bit longer than me
But he ain't on a JB song with me
I be tryna chill, they be trying to sour the thrill
No pun intended, was raised by the power of Will
Like Luke with the Force, if push comes to shove
Like Kobe in the 4th, ice water with blood, swish
I gotta be the best, and yes, we're the flyest
Like David and Goliath, I conquered the giant
So now I got the world in my hand
I was born from two stars, so the moon's where I land, I'm gone
I will never say never, I will fight
I will fight 'til forever, to make it right
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up
And never say never
Never say never
Never say never
Whenever you knock me down
I will not stay on the ground
Pick it up, pick it up, pick it up, pick it up up up and never say never
Never say never, never say never 
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never, never say never 
And never say never
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never and never say never 
Never say never and never say never
And never say neverI think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then holla
I think I found my girl, if it’s you then speak to me
Girl it’s getting late, the sun's going down
And it’s about time I shake my way across the town
But before I go I just want to say
That you stay on my mind each and every day
I think I'm starting to like the time that we spent
And when it’s building inside, then I can’t pretend
No I don’t want to fight it, I don’t want to hide the way I feel
So I guess it’s time for me to say
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better
Cause on nights like this
It’s good to know that you've got someone by your side like this
The more and more you feel like you can live your life like this
And then you say, hope this will last forever
Don’t know if it's love, it's too early to say
But if it’s something like it, I just want it to remain
Don’t know if you’re the one that takes a little time
But in the meantime girl, you feeling just fine
Cause the way you look at me never seen that look before
And if it’s a hint of what’s to come then baby can I get some more
Not tryna be too forward
But I think it’s best for you to know
That I got eyes for you baby
I want us to be together
And if you feel it too
Tell me no one will treat you better

Baby, you deserve everything you want, it's your night, oh
Wanna put my ear to your chest, girl

Baby, it sings to me, like fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Baby, I hear melodies when your heart beats
Baby, it sings to me, like now I know that it's Christmas time
You got on my favourite dress
You're looking, looking, looking good
Snow fallin' on your hair, and I don't, I don't wanna get it off
Even the stars in the sky can't outshine your eyes
I wanna be your biggest gift, whoa

Fa la la la la, fa la la la la
Know that it's Christmas time, yeah yeah 
Oh-oh-oh-oh, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ahh, yeahWhat? Wait
But yesterday we were
I don't understand
We started out it was perfect, nothing but fun
And my heart was convinced to say that you're the one
And I thought it would last for the rest of our lives
Boy was I in for a big surprise
With no doubt looking round, thinking that I'm so cool
Same place, same time every day of my life, could we meet after school?
Finally if I didn't make her cry
She wouldn't be with another guy
Nothing can cure my headache
Cause I'm experiencing what they call heartbreak
It’s gonna hurt worse as long as I stay here
I know but man just let me lay here
Cause this is something that I can't shake
I must be experiencing what they call heartbreak
They say it's only just as worse as you make it
I know but man just let me lay here
Now I'm all tore up taking back when I was at your door
The first time when you said, "Forever I'll be yours"
Started walking, your hand in my hand, feelings got stronger
We made a promise
And whenever I leave, it feels like you're still with me
But it all came crashing down
Sitting in my room I got to get out of here
What am I to do when I look up and you’re not there, woah?
Say I'm too young for love
I got so much life to live ahead
But, if only this is love I could get over
I know I have to deal with the painRest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like you
See my arms, were made to wrap around you
My heart, was made to beat for you
This love was made to adore you in every way
All of my time is made to spend on you
Life, gotta live for you
Wanna post it on a billboard till you know the world is yours
That's for sure
Rest assured I'mma be your guardian protecting you
Thick or thin, I'mma be parallel right next to you
Through winter, spring, summer time, I'll fall with you
Take my hand, we'll bring each other up together now
Can't believe God blessed me with an angel just like youOh, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing, as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Never known July to be so cold
Never seen a green light, that meant the end of the road
Never had a place in my heart, you couldn't call your own
Ain't no coincidence
I ran into you on the other side of the world today
It's one in a billion
Looking at the TV and I ran across your face
Oh, what a feeling
What's the odds of us being from the same place
What's the chance of us both having the same taste
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh woah, ain't no such thing as coincidence
Oh, oh, oh, yeah
Never known my eyes to be so red
Never had a night when I didn't toss and turn in my bed
And when we speak a word at the same time, are you in my head?
Ain't no coincidence, no woah
I ran into you on the other side of the world today
It's one in a billion

Drink a Red Bull grew wings see the stamina
Shout out to my boys, yeah, they're up there in Canada
I used to live there 'til I moved to Atlanta
Where the girls are so hot, here the girls are fine too
Catching Bieber fever, forget the swine flu

And we will never ever-ever be apart
Are we an item. Girl quit playing
"We're just friends"

My first love broke my heart for the first time
And I was like

Baby, baby, baby oohh
Like baby, baby, baby noo

Yeah, Yeah, Yeah
Now I'm all gone, gone, gone, ooh
I'm goneRockin' around the Christmas tree
At the Christmas party hop
Mistletoe hung where you can see
Every couple tries to stop
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voices singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck the halls with boughs of holly!"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way
You will get a sentimental feeling when you hear
Voicеs singing, "Let's be jolly
Deck thе halls with boughs of holly!"
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Let the Christmas spirit ring
Later we'll have some pumpkin pie
And we'll do some caroling
Rockin' around the Christmas tree
Have a happy holiday
Everyone dancing merrily
In the new old fashioned way, wayFor all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think it should be somethin'
That I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Now lemme start off by saying this
I never let another woman do what you did
And I held myself back from ever talking shit
Cause I swore to always be the bigger man and never diss
But what you've been doing has got me really pissed
So you better stop telling people that we fucking kissed
Cause we didn't and you know that's some middle school shit
All we were was just friends, good friends that it
So for all the times that you told lies about me
Or when you said I was cheating on Sky with Emily
Or even when you lied to about my sexuality
I don't have time to care and I couldn't if I tried
So girl, if your gonna talk shit get your facts straight
And it's a fact that we never went on one date
So if you think I'm still holding on get some help
Cause baby you should go and fuck yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low when I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourselfEverybody's laughing in my mind
Rumours spreading 'bout this other guy
Do you do what you did when you did with me?
Does he love you the way I can?
Did you forget all the plans that you made with me?
Cause, baby, I didn't
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on 'til you believe that that should be me
That should be me
You said you needed a little time for my mistakes
It's funny how you used that time to have me replaced
Did you think that I wouldn't see you out at the movies?
What you doing to me?
You're taking him where we used to go
Now if you're tryna break my heart, it's working cause you know that...
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on 'til you believe that that should be me
That should be me
I need to know should I fight for love or disarm?
It's getting harder to shield this pain in my heart
That should be me holding your hand
That should be me making you laugh
That should be me, this is so sad
That should be me, that should be me
That should be me feeling your kiss
That should be me buying you gifts
This is so wrong
I can't go on 'til you believe that that should be me
Holding your hand, that should be me
The one making you laugh, oh baby
Oh, that should be me
That should be me giving you flowers, that should be me talking for hours
That should be me, that should be meI was wonderin' 'bout your mama
Did she get that job she wanted?
Sell that car that gave her problems?
I'm just curious 'bout her, honest 
Know you're wonderin' why I been callin'
Like I got ulterior motives
Know we didn't end this so good
But you know we had something so good
So I'm wonderin'
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Aw, yeah Ooooooh 
It's hard when everybody out there
Just assumes we're still together
I just ran into your cousin
And had to tell her that we wasn't
Me and all my other exes talk
Why can't we?
Guess that's something you never really liked 'bout me
I gotta be careful when I text you
'Cause "LOL"s turn into "I miss you"s
Been told to keep it 100
I lost you and found myself wondering
Can we still be friends? 
Can we still be friends? 
Doesn't have to end 
And if it ends, can we be friends?
Can we be friends?
Can we be friends?You want me to trust you, but how much do you trust me?

First off this started when you broke in my phone 
And I know how you like to blame me for everything
Girl, but you were wrong 
But do it really matter though?
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all

If I was wrong then you was wrong too, you're the one I'm holding on to
You're the one that broke the code that was on the phone and started scrolling through

Girl I miss the days when it was just you and me
Me and you going through the storm, baby tell me do you still believe
Or is it all gone?
I feel like me and you girl, we had it all
I'm wishing on a star
Girl, tell me where you are or how you been
Gotta tell you now, we may never speak again

Bet you didn't think I'd go upstairs and call that girl huh, no
Bet you didn't think I threw your phone into that door huh, no
I expected you to have something there but not them photos
And I found that text, I really don’t know what we gon' do next

Been crying all night and my makeup ruined, boy look at this stress
Boy look at this stress, boy look at this stress

Careful not to bet this night away
Why things that are wrong feel so right?Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way to far away
T.V light blue and white
I just can't fall asleep tonight
Move over to the space where you should be
Even after you seem so far
Over mountains and diamond stars
Everybody has their own way home
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
All my life I’ve dreamed of love
Never thought it would hurt this much
Kiss goodbye await for your return
Oh whoa
So I’ll be strong and hold onto
The picture and the thought of you
Getting all the love that you deserve
Come home to me
Come home to me
Back into my arms
Home where you belong
Come home to me
Come home to me
If home is where you are
Then home is way too far away
If home is where you are
Home is way too far awayJust a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over again, oh
You're the light that feeds the sun in my world
I'd face a thousand years of pain for my girl
Out of all the things in life
That I could fear
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, woah
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Before your love was low, playing girls was my high
You changed the game, now I put my card to the side, ay
When broken hearts rise up to say, "Love is a lie"
You and I would stand to be love's reply, yeah
Out of all things in life
That I could fear, yeah
The only thing that would hurt me
Is if you weren't here, here, here, yeah
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
I can't imagine life without your touch
And every kiss that you give, you fill me up
And through all the heart aching, jealous females hating
I'mma hold it down for you, you
Oh, woah, oh, you're the common denominator
Oh, yeah, whoa, I don't want to go back
I don't want to go back to just being one half of the equation
Do you understand what I'm saying?
Girl, without you I'm lost, can't fix this compass at heart
Between me and love, you're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
You're the common denominator
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Just a fraction of your love fills the air
And I fall in love with you all over againSometimes we feel so nice when I'm with you it's the ecstasy 
Sometimes it feels like we, met for a purpose, we're meant to be 
And sometimes I feel like I can't
Sometimes I feel like I can't control it
Woahhh
One step, two step, three, fourth step - start to see
It's time to take things further 
And maybe you will be the one to set me free
I'm just waiting till I know for sure
For sure
Till I know for sure 
Till I know for sure 
For sure
Till I know for sure 
Till I know for sure 
For sure
I'm not gonna waste my time 
 just like Kobe Bryant
For sure
Till I know for sure 
Till I know for sure
Whenever you're in my arms
It feels like it's just a dream
Feeling you close to my heart and I'm loving you babeLyrics from Snippet
When I see you, you don't think I run up on you 
No way
And I don't want a text when I flex on you 
Get it, mic check, one, two

MSFTS
You are a g bro
You’re a wrap
You’re a wrap bro
Ah swag
Swaggy, swaggy, swaggy, swaggy
Oh, I ain’t never met a groupie
All I meet is ladies
And I like my privacy
So I got a Mercedes
Got these chokers shaking
Reminding me have hated
Sorry ’bout the security
It’s only for your safety
Cause baby I’ll be pimpin’
Holler if you see me
I’m probably in Miami
With my girl in a bikini
Text me if you need me
Touch me if you’re greedy
‘Cause you’ll probably be with Nicki
Walking while she says Waikiki
How we the illest and the youngest?
I really don’t know how we the killest and the dumbest
Swear it’s really early
But I don’t know where the sun is
And girl just take my hand
While I knock away these hundreds
Cause the crowd is going crazy
Money coming in bundles
Sorry that I couldn’t see you
It’s hard to see through my stunners
Dumb blondes be sayin’ I’m the funnest
All I’m hearing is claps
Though I don’t know where the drum is
Girl you like it
So just give me the mic
And I’ll get you so excited
Tell me what you want
I’ll go home and write it
To a old school beat
Baby take your lip and bite it
Oh jeez
Girl you got me and you gon’ make me work
Cause it’s usually a hobby
And no I really like you
And no it’s not your body
But trust me that’s a plus
Cause you’re hotter than wasabi
And I’m diggin’ on your kicks
Jokers talking ’bout karate
When I want a girl I just whip out the Maserati
No I can’t drive it
It’s only for the show
And I like to wear them diamonds
Watch them circus glow
Girl I’m on like a light bulb
Are you coming home from the night club?
‘Cause I tried to get in but I ain’t reached the height limit
That might be over but the night isn’t so I’m
So text me if you tryna chill with Wesley
Cause me and Mandy are chillin’
So don’t wear nothing dressy
Inside jokes are only funny when you get them
So  is the place to be  and I’m living in them dance halls
Alright J I think I got it from here
Justin Bieber
Headphones on yeah
Turn them up a little bit
Baby I’m the man
I felt that you knew that
I’m out in Japan
Just because I do that
So baby don’t you stop it
Baby can you drop it
I give you my chain
I style like Kentucky
Money on my mind
And you on my mind
Too much on my mind
Too big for my time
And everybody know that
Baby I’m the man
Can’t you understand
Keep you wondering
If I’m the wonderman
And you’re in wonderland
Hey my name is JB
I’m always rocking Vans
And if I was your boyfriend
I would love you till the end
I’d kiss your face in public
You can tell all of your friends
Baby girl you got that body
Would you like to go to France?
We can fly there on my jet babe
I can give you jetlag
I don’t do Jamaica baby
I can make you sweat babe
And if you ain’t in the crew
You’ll never get this
Posted at the crib with the MSFTSI never thought that it'd be easy cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us and we're wondering how
No one has a solid answer, but just walking in the dark
And you can see the look on my face, it just tears me apart
So we fight through the hurt
And we cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh
And mama you were always somewhere, and daddy I live out of town
So tell how could I ever be normal somehow?
You tell me this is for the best, so tell me why am I in tears?
Woah, so far away, and now I just need you here
So we'll fight through the hurt
And we'll cry and cry and cry and cry
Then we live and we learn
And we try and try and try and try
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
Ooh, woah, ooh
We fell so far away from where we used to be
And now we're standing and where do we go?
When there's no road to get to your heart
Let's start over again
So it's up to you and it's up to me
That we meet in the middle on our way back down to Earth
Down to Earth, down to Earth
On our way back down to Earth
I never thought that it'd be easy
Cause we both so distant now
And the walls are closing in on us
And we're wondering howI guess they want a reaction
But I ain't gonna give it to 'em
Yeah they tryna get at me yeah but I ain't gonna feed into it
Ooh they been persistent tryna break me down
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
Ooh I cannot be broken, I cannot be broken
They can’t take what’s mine
Someone like me is hard to find
Ooh I cannot be broken
Like I knew you were hoping
Hoping you would change me, hoping you would make me lose my mind)
Way too strong for that, you know you were wrong for that
So keep on chasing that 458 as I cruise on the smooth highway
I ain't even tryna' get away, I'm good, they try to break me
Hoping and praying I really won't make it, all of these dreams, they tried to forsake me
How you gon' play me? How you gon' break me? I've been in this ish since diapers and babies
All my life, been driving them crazy, there go the Blakey, thought of them ladies
Dreaming of Benz, and kissing Mercedes, living the life, the life is so crazy
I need some cameras, hundreds and ladies, how you expect me not to go crazy?
Never been lazy, never been shady, lost a few friends, the monies still gravy
We the new stars, that's why they still hating, money up front, we never be waiting
Save some and invest some, just let my money be patient
It's a cold world we that we live in, diamonds all in my pendant
They wish Satan tellers was in itthen they'd prey for me to be finished
Them haters gon' start tripping when you don't pay them no attention
And the obstacle I might face, I guarantee that I kill itMustard on the beat, hoe

Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Now you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
When you was just a young’un you’re looks but so precious
But now you’re grown up
So fly it's like a blessing but you can’t have a man look at you for 5 seconds
Without you being insecure
You never credit yourself so when you got older
It’s seems like you came back 10 times over
Now you’re sitting here in this damn corner
Looking through all your thoughts and looking over your shoulder
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
I just want to take my time
I just want to do my thing
Maybe we press rewind
Maybe I buy that ring
We could grow old together
Just share our soul together
Find out how to love, kiss and hug
How to roll together
I just need you by my side
Baby we could be alright
I just want to hold you right
We could go into the night
You're the one I need
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
You had a lot of dreams that transform to visions
The fact that you saw the world affected all your decisions
But it wasn’t your fault
Wasn’t in your intentions
You the one here talking to me
You don’t want to listen
But I admire your popping bottles and dipping
Just as much as you admire bartending and stripping
Baby, so don’t be mad
Nobody else tripping
You see a lot of crooks and the crooks still crook
See you had a lot of crooks trying to steal your heart
Never really had luck, couldn’t never figure out
How to love
How to love
You had a lot of moments that didn’t last forever
Now you in the corner trying to put it together
How to love
How to love
For a second you were here
Why you over there?
It's hard not to stare the way you moving your body
Like you never had a love
Had a love
I just want you to knowCould you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Yeah, do you see us in Vegas pushin' that Monte Carlo?
Bet that money on baby, bet she don't leave me, oh, no
See them, he wears in the desert, look like a lake in the sand
Would you watch the sun burn out with me forever, ever, ever, ever?
You still intimidate me, keep me up on my toes now
Better man, what you made me, made me aware what I was missin'
Been missin' the way you give me envision, babe
Never thought I'd settle down, I can not lie to myself
I was busy focusin' on bein' by myself
Set my feelings to the side they all got dusty on the shelf
You wiped them down when I had nothin' left
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?
Could you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Would you be here with me forever, ever, ever?
Wakin' up all alone ain't better, better, better
Every time I go the wrong way, you turn me back around
Turn me back like woah-uh-woah, woah-oh-oh-oh-oh
Woah-uh-woah, forever, ever, ever, ever
Do you wanna look at me forever, ever, ever?She don't like the flash
Wanna keep us in the dark
She don't like the fame
Hate it when we're miles apart
And she getting to the point where it's too much for her
Gonna throw us all away cause it's too much for her
She don't wanna think cause the world knows who we are
She don't like the lights, woah
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, woah
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the camera
She don't like the lights, woah, babe
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
Now she's giving ultimatums
She don't like this life, yeah
She said if I loved her
I'd give it up, won't think twice, I can't do that
And she's getting to the point where it's too much for her
Wanna throw it all away, cause it's too much for
She don't wanna live this life, yeah
She don't like the lights, woah
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights, woah
She don't, she don't
Don't wanna share with no one else, want me to herself
Don't want no love in front of the cameras
She don't like the lights, woah, babe
She don't, she don't
She don't like the lights
How can I choose between the two?
When all the lights are all I know?
I wish she could see how good this can be
I hope that she waits a little bit longer
Cause I don't wanna live life without her by my side
Cause she gives the light that's in me
But she don't know, she don't like the lights, yeah
She don't like the lights, the lights, the lights, the lights
Woah, no
She don't like the lights
Woah, babe, yeah
She don't like the lightsM-M-Murda
He laid down his life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil’ mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine then I sip that
I ain’t gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin’ till I met Jesus
And ain’t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe ’em
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain’t it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more , I need more 
How many crosses on my neck, let me check
I need more , I need more 
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more , I need more 
Holy water on the neck
And that's what I need more , I need more 
Holy cross, let me shake the demons off 
He lost that prize in the sauce 
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost 
Pay your ties, young man, pay the cost 
He laid down His life, paid the price, yeah, get that
Comin' with the drama, lil' mama I ain't with that
Breakin' up the bread, pour the wine then I sip that
I ain't gotta flex, I already got a six pack
This that Hallelujah
I ain't tryna break it down but I'll break it to you
Fake friends come around but don't let 'em use you
I don't wanna lose you
Let the spirit move you
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em
Ain't it funny how the money and the car and the clothes
Weren't nothin' till I met Jesus
And ain't it funny how they look up in the sky see the stars and the moon and still don't believe 'em

        Ha, it's Justin Bieber
I can take you to a new world, take your problems away
Tell me what you want to do girl, just come right this way
I don't never need a new girl, no cause you're here to stay
Lemme show you what I do girl and you'll never leave
You want me, girl, you know you want me
You want me, you want me
Girl, you know you want me right, go, right, go, right, right
Girl, you know you want me right
Yeah you said that you love me, yeah I said that I love you too
Let you know that you're lovely, flowers for nothing just for you
You know I got you until the whole world ends
You know I got you, won't you come and be my girlfriend?
Cause you're scared to fall, but you won't spread your wings
You know it's hard to fly when you don't try new things
And I'mma be the one to make you smile for a minute
Put your head down, lick it down for a minute
Baby, maybe this sounds crazy
Thinking about you lately
I just need a
I just need a lady, save me
 +  X2Walking on red dirt, no concrete pavement
Navy blue book bag on my back
Couple miles 'til I'm at the greyhound station
Hope they let me ride away with them
Got pretty mad at my father today
But I'm still thinking 'bout what my mother would say
As I'm singing an old song she used to sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't
So I turn around and headed to the old run-down building
Bells gonna ring before I make it back
I watch the upper-classmen drive right past me
Wish they'd let me ride away with them
Still haven't got over it yet
It's been playing in my ears all morning I swear
My iPod's the same tune my mother would sing
When things weren't going the way she wanted them to
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away, I do
I wanna run away, I do, I wanna run away from you
I wanna leave this school, I do, I wanna leave this town, I do
But she'll be worried sick if I do if I do
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't
Never get mad enough to walkout
If I do then I won't be gone for long
Never fed up enough to leave her
No matter what I'll love her just the same
That's my mama, yeah
So no matter what I ain't leaving unless she's coming soon
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boy
Just don't run off and leave my mama at home
'Cause I'm her boy mama's boys
Just don't run away, run away
Can't run away and leave my mama alone
'Cause I'm her boy
Mama's boy just don't

        What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind, what do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Tryna compromise but I can’t win
You wanna make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really wanna know…
What do you mean?
When you nod your head yes, but you wanna say no
What do you mean?
When you don't want me to move, but you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running outta time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
Don't be so selfish baby, yeah
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean now? Hey-ey
Oh, oh tudurudururu
Oh, oh, hey, yeah yeah
What do you mean?Let me start off with the old school flow
Let me start off with the old school flow
Snap back, backpack, rat-a-tat, go
Swagger at the knapsack, who know I could rap that?
Tell me where the cash at, I'll tell you where the smash at
Number one hits, I got number one flicks
And the number one kicks and number one chicks
Fast like Gordon and my jams like Jordan
And my Tims like Hortons and my jets all aboarded in
And my wheels are like a fortune and it feels like extortion
Is it for the fame or for the fortune?
Like this, mic this so I can re-sight this
People in their basements say that I didn't write this
People say I'm white so I couldn't do it like this
Checks like Nike. let me give you a good night kiss
Well I'm a little bit sick of it, listening to bickering
Like picking on a little kid, like taking all his licorice
I hate it when they littering, I hate to be illiterate
I literally am doing deeds, riddling
Cheese like Gouda and my soul like Buddha
And I'mma go right through you  and I'm so much cooler
And I don't need Luda
To know that I'm the ruler a
And I'm, so much cooler
You should call me Ferris BuellerI need you the, I need you, I need you the, I need you
I need y-y-y-y-y, I need you the, I need you, I need you the
I need you, I need y-y-y-y-you the m-m-m
I need you the most
I gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can't deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you the I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you, I need you the most
Where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me
Somebody pray for me
It's that Abe Lincoln  history in the making
Spirit filled, miseducation
I'm that new Jason Bourne, reborn a revelation
You gon' perfect your gift and I'm gon' perfect my patience
Unashamed to say the name, I keep it blatant in every statement
His name is Jesus and maybe you'll start believin'
I don't boast about numbers but I'ma keep it one hundred
Yeah, it's songs over sins, yeah I put God over money
Yeah, I know my name's Justin but justice is comin' Someday at Christmas men won't be boys
Playing with bombs like kids play with toys
One warm December our hearts will see
A world where men are free
Someday at Christmas there'll be no wars
When we have learned what Christmas is for
When we have found what life's really worth
There'll be peace on earth
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas we'll see a man
No hungry children and no empty hand
One happy morning people will share
Our world where people care
Someday at Christmas there'll be no tears
All men are equal and no men have fears
One shining moment my heart ran away
From our world today
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time
Someday at Christmas man will not fail
Take hope because your love will prevail
Someday a new world that we can start
With hope in every heart
Someday all our dreams will come to be
Someday in a world where men are free
Maybe not in time for you and me
But someday at Christmas time, someday at Christmas timeRide, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride
When I wake up, I first think of you
I really like you and I hope you like me too
The sky's the limit for me and you
I could be your queen, but you could be my boo
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you
And I just wanna ride with you
I wanna ride, by the ocean side, I wanna ride
I wanna ride, I wanna ride ride with you

Whenever I'm with you, you make me feel special
And all my problems, they go right out the door
I love it when you call me baby, baby
It's you I adore, adore
We could go anywhere, to the moon and through the air
We could go to the movies or the mall, baby I don't care
Yeah this is true, wanna be with you

And I know you seeing me calling
You say it's over, we're done
Tired of giving me warning
Girls sliding in my DMs

Telling you that we just friends
But flying them out on the weekend
I got a weakness for sweetness and everyone knows
I'm going crazy for ladies who dress in tight clothes
I know you're tired of hearing me apologize
And I can see that you're ready to tell me goodbye

Dem other girl way too bad to ignore

And I can see that you're ready to tell me goodbye

Take something and wave it

And every time you tell me that you love me
You take me away
Never ever felt so lucky
And every time you do it right there
You got me wrapped around your finger
And I wanna see your body next to mine to mine, to mine, oh
Let me know if you can do the following
If you can't, then please don't follow me
I won't give you half, I just give you all of me
I just need to hear you say it every time you're calling me
Tell me, tell me, tell me, again, again
Tell me, tell me, tell me, again, again
Girl, you know our love never ends never ends
So, baby can you tell me again

Don't think that I'll be a saint
But I might go down to the river
'Cause the way that the sky opens up when we touch
Yeah, it's making me say
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Running to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
I don't do well with the drama
And, no, I can't stand it being fake
I don't believe in nirvana
But the way that we love in the night gave me life
Baby, I can't explain
That the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know 
They say we're too young and
The pimps and the players say, "Don't go crushin'"
Wise men say fools rush in
But I don't know
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so holy, holy, holy, holy, holy
On God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second, on God
Runnin' to the altar like a track star
Can't wait another second
'Cause the way you hold me, hold me, hold me, hold me
Feels so ho-ho-ho-holyAs a young man, I didn't understand the power of certain words and how they can hurt. I thought it was ok to repeat hurtful words and jokes, but didn't realize at the time that it wasn't funny and that in fact my actions were continuing the ignorance
Thanks to friends and family I learned from my mistakes and grew up and apologized for those wrongs. Now that these mistakes from the past have become public I need to apologize again to all those I have offended
I'm very sorry. I take my friendships with people of all cultures very seriously and I apologize for offending or hurting anyone with my childish and inexcusable mistake. I was a kid then and I am a man now who knows my responsibility to the world and to not make that mistake again
Ignorance has no place in our society and I hope the sharing of my faults can prevent others from making the same mistake in the future. I thought long and hard about what I wanted to say but telling the truth is always what's right
Five years ago I made a reckless and immature mistake and I'm grateful to those close to me who helped me learn those lessons as a young man. Once again.... I'm sorryI say you gotta have it
You know I gotta grab it
Girl, my hands on you now
Stay calm, I had it 
And we took a look at it
Your body like a weapon, automatic
Girl, eyes on you now
Stay calm, I have it 
She fresher than recipes
When she walk rest in piece
I can see 
 she next to me
She whipped the whip 
Specially when she talk sexually
 for me
I'm done with that 
...
Confident
Oh is it down there
Right there
Crazy
Turning your confidence to crazy
Ohoh baby
The way you lay down 
They gon' call you 
Oh yeah confident 
They 
Baby they can  confident
 nothing girl  baby
Maybe cause it is you're confidentYou still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh no
If I bought you a beach house, you would ask for the ocean
If I take you  you would want to go higher, baby
And first I thought that you needed, acts of service babe
And now I think different, now I think different, oh
You still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh no
You still can't get enough, you still can't get enough
You still can't get enough, no
I'm giving you all my love, it still ain't enough
You still can't get enough, oh noOh, yeah, mm
I'd wait on you forever and a day, hand and foot
Your world is my world, yeah
Ain't no way you ever gon' get
Any less than you should
Cause baby you smile I smile, woah
Cause whenever you smile, I smile, oh
Your lips, my biggest weakness
Shouldn't have let you know, I'm always gonna do what they say, yeah
If you need me I'll come running
From a thousand miles away
When you smile I smile, oh
And whenever you smile, I smile, oh
Baby take my open heart and all it offers
Cause this is as unconditional as it'll ever get
You ain't seen nothing yet
I won't ever hesitate to give you more
Cause baby you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, oh
And whenever you smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile, oh
Baby you won't ever want for nothing, you are my ends and my means now
With you there's no in between, I'm all in
Cause my cards are on the table and I'm willing and I'm able
But I fold to your wish cause it's my command
Whenever you smile, I smile, whoa
You smile, I smile, I smile, I smile, I smile
You smile, I smile
And whenever you smile, I smile
When you smile, I smile
You smile, I smileOut of sight now, baby
But you're still not out of mind, oh no
It's like you're right here with me
And all my worries fall aside, woah
Planes, cars, and hotels have never been the same
Postcards and notes were, they're written in your name
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
And how do we start again
How do we start again?
They tell me love is blind
But baby I can see it all, tonight
And when the sun goes down
 to be the 
Planes, cars and hotels have never been the same
Postcards and notes were, they're written in your name
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
Where did we go wrong
And how do we start again
And how do we start again

        Now Romeo & Juliet
Bet they never felt the way we felt
Bonnie & Clyde
Never had to hide like we do, we do
You and I, both know it can't work
It's all fun and games
'Til someone gets hurt
And I don't, I won't let that be you
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
Now we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
'Cause I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like Adam & Eve
Tragedy was our destiny
Like Sonny & Cher
I don't care, I got you baby
See we both
Fighting every inch of our fibers
'Cause ain't no way it's gonna end right but
We are both too foolish to stop
Now you don't wanna let go
And I don't wanna let you know
That there might be something real between us two
Who knew?
And we don't wanna fall but
We're tripping in our hearts
And it's reckless and clumsy
And I know you can't love me here
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do
But fight with time and space 'cause
I'm still stuck in the moment with you
See like, just because this cold, cruel world say we can't be
Baby, we both have the right to disagree and I ain't with it
And I don't wanna be so old and gray, reminiscing 'bout these better days
But convince just telling us to let go, so we'll never know
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place
'Cause everything we did
And everything we have is stuck in the moment, yeah
I wish we had another time
I wish we had another place, oh no no
But everything we have is stuck in the moment
And there's nothing my heart can do, nothing my heart can do
To fight with time and space and space
'Cause I'm still stuck in the moment with youAs long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
We're under pressure
Seven billion people in the world tryna fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face, even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me
I'll be your soldier
Fighting every second of the day for your dreams, girl
I'll be your Hova
You could be my Destiny's Child on the scene, girl
So don't stress and don't cry
Oh we don't need no wings to fly
Just take, my hand
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, and I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me, love me
I don't need money
I don't need cars no
I don't need to shine if I got your heart
Beating right here
Here with me
Baby that's all I need
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum , I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love me, you love me, you love me, yeah
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
Please don't go
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love meWhere'd the love go?
Where's the passion, oh?
Why's it feel like
I'm better off alone?
Say it's my fault
That we're broken
You know the truth, babe
What should I do, babe?
I wanted you but I don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you
Where did we go from here
Did we throw it all away
Guess the end is finally near
There's nothing left to say
You got me open, now we are broken
My heart is frozen since we haven't spoken
You know the truth babe
What did I do babe
I wanted you but I just don't know what to do babe
I'm not gonna lose any sleep tryna know where you are
I'm doing just fine without you in my life at all 
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh
I'm so much better without you, you, you, you oh
With you with you oh without you
When I wake up in the morning and you're not right there
Girl I'm wishing that I never put your flight back
If I sent you a text, girl would you write back?
If I left you a voicemail, yeah could you like that?
It's all good, it's all g
'Cause I got more time, just to figure out me
In the meantime, girls be around me
And I was so lost, until you found me
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you, you
I’m doing better without you, you, you
I'm doing better without you, you, you, you oh 
I got nothing left for you, you, you, you oh 
Thought I was tripping on you, you, you, you oh 
I’m so much better without you, you, you, you oh 
With you with you oh without youFor all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl for goodness sake
You think I'm crying on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't but, you still hit my phone up
And baby I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin'
I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
And now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and fuck yourselfI gave you the key when the door wasn't open, just admit it
See, I gave you faith, turned your doubt into hoping, can’t deny it
Now I'm all alone and my joys turned to moping
Tell me, where are you now that I need you? Where are you now?
Where are you now that I need ya? Couldn't find you anywhere
When you broke down I didn't leave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
Where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin'
I gave you the shirt off my back, what you sayin'? To keep you warm
I showed you the game everybody else was playin', that's for sure
And I was on my knees when nobody else was prayin', oh Lord
Where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you the I need you, I need you, where are you now that I need ya?
I need you the I need you, I need you, I need you the most

        You keep playin games with me that's not coasta
Instead of blessin me now like you supposed ta
You take me aboard love roller coasta
Trying to get off when your on like Oprah girl
That's a negative
Like a pessimist
You say it ain't love
I say yes it is
Well I'm guessing this
The big question is
Why you sending me all these mixed messagesPicture this
Summer morning, breakfast
Sunrise, sunny side up
See me smiling when I see you rise up
Private island, tryna turn your life up
We don't need a night club if you're tryna get wifed up
Yeah, baby, do you wanna take it there?
Do you wanna take it there, take it there?
Do you wanna make it there, make it there, make it there?
Do you wanna just stay in there and then wait in there?
Can you wait in there?
Just lay it down, just lay it down, just lay it down
Lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Lay it down, lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there
Ayy, lay her down right here, but don't move
Hold up
Wawawawa, skeet off in a jet, skeet off in a jet like
Someone's in that bed like, oh yeah, that's a bet like
You be getting mad right?
You playing, but ain't mad, right?
I'm in New York with a mink on
I saw you at the Met, right?
I'ma skeet off in a Can-Am, I'm too
High to give a damn, yeah, I'm too
Fly to give a damn, yeah, I'm high
I don't give a damn, I'm from a
Place like Amsterdam, I just got some head in Rotterdam
I just got a lawsuit from my old manager
Look at my old clan tryna sue the man
Might go get a Benz, might go get the Ford
Might go get the Lamb' off the showroom floor
Bitch, I been ready, mark, set, let's go
I just do my thing and these ni‏ggas know
I take out a spot with leopard skin, last year ain't have a pot to piss in
Motherfuck what's goin' on, I'm just movin' 'round like I'm on some Ritalin
No time to fuss, no fight, I'm at the best place in my life
I'm just wilding out with ya babe, she just wanna wild out tight
Chillin' in the spot all day, bubblegum a new Kanye
I just found a whole new wave, Tony Montana all day, ayy
Picture this
Summer morning, breakfast
Sunrise, sunny side up
See me smiling when I see you rise up
Private island, tryna turn your life up
We don't need a night club if you're tryna get wifed up
Yeah, baby, do you wanna take it there?
Do you wanna take it there, take it there?
Do you wanna make it there, make it there, make it there?
Do you wanna just stay in there and then wait in there?

Lay it down, lay it down right there, lay it down, lay it down right there
Right there, right there, right there, right there, right there

Baby, ya estoy cansado de tu bipolaridad, yah-yah-yeh
Deja ya de estar peleando sin una necesidad
Valórame, bebé, yo
Con ese humor nadie te aguantará
¿Quién te entiende? Si conmigo no te falta na'
Cógela suave, ma', porque esta bomba explotará
Si te saco el genio no vuelvo a frotar tu lámpara
Y listo, te dejé en visto
Pero fue porque estaba grabando mi disco
Y tú pensando que yo estaba en la disco
Deja de pelear, que la pasamos más rico
Why you always in a mood? Fuckin' 'round, actin' brand new

Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Shout-out to your mom and dad for makin' you
Standin' ovation, they did a great job raisin' you
When I create, you're my muse
That kind of smile that makes the news
Can't nobody throw shade on your name in these streets
Triple threat, you a boss, you a bae, you a beast
You make it easy to choose
You got a mean touch, I can't refuse 
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter
Gorgeous, make 'em drop dead, you a killer
Shower you with all my attention

Stay in the kitchen cookin' up, got your own bread
Heart full of equity, you're an asset
Make sure that you don't need no mentions
Yeah, these are my only intentions
Already passed, you don't need no approval
Good everywhere, don't worry 'bout no refusal
Second to none, you got the upper hand now
Don't need a sponsor, nope, you're the brand now
You're my rock, my Colorado
Get that ring, just like Toronto
Love you now, a little more tomorrow
This how I feel, act like you know that you are
Picture perfect, you don't need no filter

When you feel it in your body, you found somebody who
Makes you change your ways like hanging with your crew
Said you act like you're ready, but you ain't really knew
And everything in your past, you wanna let it go
I've been there, done it, humped around
After all that this is what I found
And everyone of y'all are just like me, yeah
It's too bad that you can't see that you've got it
You got it, you got it bad
When you're on the phone, hang up and you call right back
You got it, you got it bad
If you miss a day without your friend, your whole life's off track
And you got it bad when you're stuck in the house
You don't wanna have fun, she's all you think about
You got it bad when you're out with someone
And you keep on thinkin' 'bout somebody
You got it bad
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-ho, ooh, oh, oh, oh, yeah
Want to, but I can't help it, I love the way it feels
It's got me stuck between my fantasy and what is real
I need it when I want it, I want it when I don't
Tell myself I'll stop everyday, knowin' that I won't
I got a problem and I don't know what to do about it
Even if I did, I don't know if I would quit but I doubt it
I'm, I'm taken by the thought of this
And I know this much is true
Baby, you have become my addiction
I'm so strung out on you
I can barely move but I like it
So then it's all because of you
Said it's all because of you
Said it's all because
Never get enough
She's the sweetest drug
She's the sweetest drugFor you I'd write a symphony
I'd tell the violin it's time to sink or swim
Watch me play for ya
For you I'd be running a thousand miles
Just get to where you are
Step to the beat of my heart
I don't need a whole lot
But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world
Or we can share mine
I know I won't be the first one
Giving you all this attention
Baby, listen

I, I don't need too much
Just somebody to love
Somebody to love

I just need somebody to love

But for you I need, I'd rather give you the world

Three, two, swagThings seemed strange this morning
As I packed my bag for school
The smiles I'm used to seeing just weren't there
I heard my father talking
To my mother down the hallway
Above the whispers all that I could hear  was
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I
I was feeling kind of helpless
About the words that I just heard
Could it be the family 2 doors down?
They said a couple months of bad luck
Had them up against the wall
And though it may seem small
I know there's something I can do
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at the table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I
Make room at your table for your friends and family
Take the time to share your day, just laugh, talk and eat
Set a place at the table for someone who might need it
Set a place at your table for someone to sit down and eat
Kick their shoes off, put their feet up
Forget about their troubles for awhile
When there's a place at your table
There's a little hope for you and I
there's a little hope for you andIf I was your boyfriend, I’d never let you go

Three, two, swagIt's been a hot summer in the 90's and you're kids are about to be in school or already are
You're home alone and now it's time to jam
You are listening to Skrip's remix of Justin Beiber's "What Do You Mean?"
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move
But you tell me to go
What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re so indecisive, what I’m saying
Tryna catch the beat, make up your heart
Don't know if you're happy or complaining
Don't want for us to end, where do I start?
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…
What do you mean? Oh, oh
When you nod your head yes
But you wanna say no
What do you mean? Hey-ey
When you don't want me to move

What do you mean?
Oh, what do you mean?
Said you're running out of time, what do you mean?
Oh, oh, oh, what do you mean?
Better make up your mind
What do you mean?
You’re overprotective when I’m leaving
Trying to compromise but I can’t win
You want to make a point, but you keep preaching
You had me from the start, won't let this end
First you wanna go to the left then you wanna turn right
Wanna argue all day, make love all night
First you're up, then you’re down and then between
Oh, I really want to know…

When you broke down I didn't lеave ya, I was by your side
So where are you now that I need ya?
I gave you attention when nobody else was payin', mm'

Standing impatient, all the walls are spinning
Rush to a plane to find it's been delayed
Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Stuck in the sands, still looking for an ocean
Rain on my face, but ain't no cloud today
Down on my knees to pray, it turns to hoping
So desperate in the worst way
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Wish time wasn't on my side
Oh, guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Like words in a book but they don't have an ending
Standing impatient, all the walls are spinning
Rush to a plane to find it's been delayed
Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Guess I´ll hurry up and wait
Ooh-ooh-ooh
Oh, guess I´ll hurry up and wait

Guess I'll hurry up and wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, wait
Wait, wait, wait, wait, waitAs long as you love me
As long as you love me
As long as you love me
I'm under pressure
Seven billion people in the world trying to fit in
Keep it together
Smile on your face even though your heart is frowning
But hey now, you know girl
We both know it's a cruel world
But I will take my chances
As long as you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
I'll be your soldier, fighting every second of the day for the change girl
You can be my Destiny's Child on a stinger
So don't stress, don't cry, we don't need no wings to fly
Just take my hand
As you love me we could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
I don't know if this makes sense, but you're my hallelujah
Give me a time and place, and I'll rendezvous, and I'll fly you to it
I'll beat ya there
Girl you know I got you
Us, trust...
A couple of things I can't spell without you
Now we are on top of the world, 'cause that's just how we do
Used to tell me sky's the limit, now the sky's is our point of view
Man now we stepping out like wow 
Camera's pointed shoot
Ask me what's my best side, I stand back and point at you
You, you the one that I argue with, I feel like I need a new girl to be bothered
But the grass ain't always greener on the other side
It's green where you water it
So I know we got issues baby true true true
But I'd rather work on this with you
Than to go ahead and start with someone new
As long as you love me
As you love me
We could be starving, we could be homeless, we could be broke
As long as you love me
I'll be your platinum, I'll be your silver, I'll be your gold
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love, love me, love me
As long as you love meFor all the times that you rained on my parade
And all the clubs you get in using my name
You think you broke my heart, oh girl, for goodness sake
You think I'm cryin' on my own, well I ain't
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
But when you told me that you hated my friends
The only problem was with you and not them
And every time you told me my opinion was wrong
And tried to make me forget where I came from
And I didn't wanna write a song
'Cause I didn't want anyone thinking I still care
I don't, but you still hit my phone up
And baby, I'll be movin' on
And I think you should be somethin' I don't wanna hold back
Maybe you should know that
My mama don't like you and she likes everyone
And I never like to admit that I was wrong
And I've been so caught up in my job, didn't see what's going on
But now I know, I'm better sleeping on my own
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
For all the times that you made me feel small
I fell in love, now I feel nothin' at all
I never felt so low and I was vulnerable
Was I a fool to let you break down my walls?
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
'Cause if you like the way you look that much
Oh baby, you should go and love yourself
And if you think that I'm still holdin' on to somethin'
You should go and love yourself
