You'll be the first to get robbed
First off, fuck the police, they want us on a leash
I ain't goin' for it at all
Your hoe wanna get the D, I fuck her 'til she sleep

Who gon’ keep it solid?
Who gon’ hit the house, and miss the car, and hit the body?
Who gon’ hit a line, take some molly, get to choppin‘?
Who gon’ put these drugs and money over the thotties?
Too much of the feigns and things all in the projects
Who gon’ put the Rolex and rings all in the Pyrex?
Yeah I’m countin’ these blessings I’m having so many talents
Who gon’ pick the Audi?
Who gon’ get the the Rover?
Got skinny jeans, we don’t tote a holster
Mainly rockin’ Gucci, but she fuck with Fashion Nova
Car came equipped with umbrellas and a sofa
Ian in Minnesota, but I hit with it the soda—
Then I whip, whip, whip, now it’s hard as a bolder
Plug really tripping, said he packed and sealed the odor but the truck got caught up it was a big, big, order—
God damn...
Talkin’ bout Keed, God damn
Got some cottage cheese in my jean, God damn
Ion give a fuck bitch cause got caught up, it was a big, big, order, God damnLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released

        Lyrics from Snippets
Why y'all niggas cap? Why y'all niggas lying?
You ain't the field, y'all niggas cap
Y'all niggas lacking, you ain't 'bout it, slime
Pull out the pussy, put it on her spine
Treat it like your life, don't press 
Acting like you trying me, I get it done
Cop a Richard Millie, I'll fuck time
Live a rich life, it's in due time
Trick a nigga out a bankroll, just know we wipe your nose
Treat a nigga to the love life then we go ahead, expose him
All them long nights on the block, yeah, it turned me to the pope
All thе  came untold
Drip like a unicorn, hell yеah, the real, real owner
Basic drip, basic money, I don't even got time to talk
I ain't sending  drop a tip, I ain't even lying
No cap, no kizzy, know that I dropped the whole line
No rap, no cap, nigga, I'm standing on mine
Treat her bad, like a lap, nigga run it so many times
She so in love with me, she show her behind
You knowRok on the track, yeah
Let's go
So many bitches, can't hit at a time
Yes, I'm a star, I got stars in my ride
 pennies and dimes, they all mine
Bentley we ridin' in, frog eyes
Opened my eyes and I realized
Niggas ain't with me, they all disguised
Don't care 'bout no money, I care 'bout my family
Shit, 
Tear that shit up in a red eye
These hoes with me, they all fine
Yeah, I remember standing in line
Drop to my knees and pray
I'm thanking God, shit, baptize
, that's what 
I don't play no games, I ain't in combines
Treat that lil' boy like a lunch line
I'm having diamonds that's gon' blind
That bankroll, man, I'm on mine
And I'm praying for a long life, yeah
I don't

Yeah, these niggas will never admit it that I put 'em on
Yeah, I'm stylin' on niggas, they know that I put it on
Can't kill that boy in traffic, go to your home
Put two shots in his dome, now he gone, gone, gone
Yeah, we going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin the block like three, four times and then we gone, gone, gone
I got shooters in the booth, it's like a hundred of 'em
We got , they in the booth, we got a hundred of 'em
And these chains ice box, it's like a hundred of 'em
I can't name a nigga we running from, yeah
I got vibes in New York, aye, know they trained to go, slatt
Fade, backseat, blatt, 10,  slime
Bra, go wipe your nose
Right before he leave our door
If I got a hundred rounds, I'ma bust it with the pole
I'm a bad boy like Diddy, and I'm squared up in these Dickies
And we put these niggas on,  in the city
And they away from Conley Road,  be sticky
I don't fuck no doin' hoe, why I nut all on her titties
Yeah, these niggas will never admit it that I put 'em on
Yeah, I'm stylin' on niggas, they know that I put it on
Can't kill that boy in traffic, go to your home
Put two shots in his dome, now he gone, gone, gone
Yeah, we going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin the block like three, four times and then we gone, gone, gone 
I fucked a hoe, yeah one time, told her go, no no
He think just 'cause he got paper, he won't get his head blown
.38 revolver going straight through a nigga dome
My young niggas takers, they'll run up in your home
Lean, Percocet, Percocet, Adderall with that lean
Heard y'all niggas bleeding pussy, niggas pointing fingers at the scene
Big choppas and short choppas, Glock .40 with a beam 
I don't fuck with y'all nigga, new roster, and I got a new team
Monkey lips on that Draco
Kickbacks, yeah man down
And you we grinding while y'all laying down
And you know early bird get the worm, y'all niggas out here playing 'round
Yeah, these niggas will never admit it that I put 'em on
Yeah, I'm stylin' on niggas, they know that I put it on
Can't kill that boy in traffic, go to your home
Put two shots in his dome, now he gone, gone, gone
Yeah, we going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
We going way up and I'm gone, gone, gone
Spin the block like three, four times and then we gone, gone, gone
