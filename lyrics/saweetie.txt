Can’t stop, won’t stop, get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip-flops
Manicures and pedicures, I’m always tip-top
When they say I’m not hot, all these lies need to stop
'Cause I’m icy, wifey, haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean, got some hittas moving sheisty
Ask me if I’m rollin’ with some Gucci, bitch I might be
It’s very unlikely my wrist ain’t looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey
Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe, you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror, I thank God for what I’m about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird, stay clear, I’m living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed? I’m tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I’m taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me, but that buffer molded me
So I take my time, 'cause I’m always where I’m suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I’m knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me? I’m probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that’s how I keep my sanity
Yeah, it’s my team's summer
Couple setbacks, bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I’m out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I’m chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G’s, let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses, never messy, always neat
Never ever, thats how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner, icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money, mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettucini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters

Too many excuses, I too many
Look at my to-do list, I got too many
Too many, too, too many
Too many niggas, too many
I swear my dreams keep me up at night
Cartis on, my vision came to life

If I'm at it too, not they invite
I been up all night for those who don't believe the hype
Probably thought they cloned me 'cause I went and did it twice
Had to cancel all my homies who was plottin' on the slice
Didn't go down without a fight, say I switched up my design
Bitch I'm doin' more than fine, I get money all the time
Hundreds on my mind, got some money, that's what's mine
Put my life right on the line if you come between what's mine
Boy I wish a bitch would try, boy i wish a bitch would try
Too many snakes, too many

Too many, too, too many
Too many niggas, too many
Too many excuses, I too many
Look at my to-do list, I got too many
Too many, too, too many
Too many niggas, too many
I don't lift a finger 'less I'm getting paid
Ask my niggas, I do what it takes
Free my kings inside the pen that caught a case
Hands together when I pray, we be countin' down the days
No time to waste, I let my ex go 'head and clear the way
Sacrifices to be made, I don't got no time to play
You can miss me with them games
Heard he askin' 'bout my name, this is all I got to say
Bitch I'm doin' more than fine, I get money all the time
Hundreds on my mind, got some money, that's what's mine
Put my life right on the line if you come between what's mine
Boy I wish a bitch would try, boy i wish a bitch would try
Too many snakes, too many
I done did too many favors, too many
Too many, too, too many
Too many niggas, too many

Then you slid in my DM's, I knew right then I had you open
By the time we spoke again you felt some way, I peeped your vibe
Yet you still forgave your girl, you understood, ooh you my type
I said that shit not cool, looked in your eyes, apologized
But sometimes life get crazy and I don't prioritize
Then you pulled up to my crib, a different whip and I hopped in
Said you wanna know what's up and still confused 'bout what happened
Damn you still on that old topic? why is that you still trippin'?
Then we made up, found an empty street, and lowkey got it in

And when I ever touch the bag it's never loud but discreet
I need the right amount of cheese before I leak out a seed
'Cause I'ma spoil all my kids and let 'em ride 'til they stink
Daughter in all pink, son with them gold links
Super mommy sweets, the kids in the backseat
Give 'em baby bottle drinks while I'm runnin' a business meeting
If I ain't a Icy girl then what do you call that?
The hustle is all that, the body is all that
Slim thick chick with skin that got no tats
If I'm in the 3-0-5, get blessed with that gold tan
If I'm in the 3-1-0, I'm finessin' a game plan
I'on see a hater, they just jealousy fans
They be wishin' they was me
In they fantasy land, girl who is you foolin'
All that hate just love, used to hate me all the time
And say wassup in clubs then you felt a lil threatened
Then you switched up 'cause I'm that chick
If you ain't on yo shit you get mad about yo life
And that's the shit that make you sick
See me and my niggas, we trained to go
I'on mess with dumb broads and these fake famous hoes
Bitches get a lump sum and forget where they come from
If these haters had a flavor, it's tasting like dumdums
Niggas with tart cum, sewers and fresh plum
Niggas mad at me, be mad at your income
Shit, 400 degrees but I'm the icy wifey
So I'm bringing the breeze if you feelin' the freeze
I ain't here to just tease, the fingers lookin' for me
'Cause I got what they needRich nigga, eight-figure, that's my type

Fresh out on my house, you can't tell is she ready?
- little butt with a T over M
I'ma hype her every time, that my motherf- friend
She been down since the jellies and the Volvos
Got me steppin' out the Jeep got Manolo's
When we pull up to the scene, they be filled with jealousy
If a b- in a key, she gon' bring that energy
I hit her phone with the tea, like, guess what?
All the rich ass boys wanna f- on us
All this, you can look, don't touch
In our bag, bust some bands every time we link up

If you need a freak

If she ride for me, she don't need a key
If you sideways, she straightens 
And she so bad that I just can't take that b- nowhere
She off her fish I said, mm mm, don't go there
Break her back, she protect and attack
Get the strap-like 'em buckle, foot on neck, get no air
Whole world wanna be us

Leavin' no spot not an option
It's finna be a pretty girl mosh pit
Putang ina mo
You think I ain’t know
All that hatin' shit
You got it from that hoeCan't stop won't stop get guap
Ten white toes in them Tory flip flops
Manicures and pedicures I'm always tip top
When they say I'm not hot all these lies need to stop
'Cause I'm icy, wifey haters wanna fight me
Never been the one get RIP up on a white tee
Keep my hands clean got some hitta's moving shiesty
Ask me if I'm rollin' with some Gucci bitch I might be
It's very unlikely my wrist ain't looking icy
Charging by the minute 'cause my time is very pricey
Yeah, I be where the bosses be
Judging from my vibe you can feel it in my energy
Stacking paper steadily so I can live in luxury
Looking in the mirror I thank God for what I'm about to be
You beefing with my enemy does not make you a friend of me
Girls so weird stay clear I'm living drama free
Never living comfortably, got a lot of goals to meet
My team is trying to eat so we grinding 'til our mental bleed
You tryna get a bag of weed?
I'm tryna get a bag a week
Put it in my savings and invest in the right companies
My dream is like a child and I'm taking all the custody
Obstacles be slowing me
But that buffer moldin' me
So I take my time 'cause I'm always where I'm suppose to be
Keep my niggas close to me 'cause I'm knowing they go for me
You can not get a hold of me?
I'm probably in a solo meet
Always making moves, man that's how I keep my sanity
Yeah it's my team's summer, couple set backs
Bounce back and recover
The clique real small but we making big moves
And we headed to the top so we can get a better view like
I'ma catch a tan overseas while I'm out the country
Let me get some Hennessy while I'm chilling on the beach
I'ma count a couple G's let the server bring receipts
Double checking my expenses never messy always neat
Never ever, that's how a hot girl do it
Number one stunner icy girl with a Cuban
Cash money mama that be dining in Bahamas
Eating Fettuccini pasta with the scallops and the lobsters
Huh, I don't got no time for these hoes
Speaking on my name like I'm someone that they know
I'm the big cat bitch yes these niggas love me
Is that Gucci on my feet? Shit, bitch it might be!
