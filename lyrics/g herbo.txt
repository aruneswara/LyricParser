Time to let these niggas know what it is in the streets
Aye Bibby, let's kill shit broski
Whatchu wanna do?
It's whatever man, just go on ahead and rip that shit
I'ma come around and clean that shit up
Let's get it
Know a couple niggas that's down to ride for a homicide
When it's drama time
Run up on a nigga with the llamas flyin
Leave his loved ones all traumatized
150, I'm really wit' it
I'll drop his ass and then forget it
I'm the man round my side of town
Might see a bitch and forget I hit it
Lil Bibby on the track with me
One mistake and he clap fifty
When I hit the scene hoes go insane
'Cause they know a nigga got them racks wit' me
No velcro but the strap wit' me
Let a nigga wanna act silly
I'ma let it off and then leave him there
Ride off and don't even care
Bitch I cash out 'till I pass out
Got a couple trues I don't even wear
In the game bitch I do my thang
Hoes scream my name I ain't even there
Lil Herb boy I do's this
Leave your bitch wetter than a pool pit
And I make bands like I make friends
Bought some Ray-Bans on some cool shit
But now it's back to some killa shit
Got some wild hoes that'll drill a bitch
Yea it's no limit, thirty years runnin'
Thirty years gunnin' and we still the shit
I never run 'cause I stay to fight
I'll cook a nigga like steak and rice
And it's hella real in the battlefield
Gangbang gotta pay the price
Hit a nigga with the forty fifth
Bet it make his ass do forty flips
M-O-B I don't love a ho
I'ma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
'Cause I understand how a nigga lie
Never snitch on a nigga dry
Yeah that's how a nigga die
Got a yellow bitch in the passenger
She gon' suck and fuck if I get her high
If I do the dash then my whip will fly
Foreign shit what a nigga ride
I ain't never snoozin', let a nigga try
Got the nine ruger on a nigga side
Lil Bibby, no limit
Yea I'm all about that sack bitch
My young niggas they clap shit
Let the MAC spit, we whack shit
Weezy in that cut
With that nina that's that black bitch
Rico wanna' get 'em I'm like, «'Cause man, I got this»
Shootin' shit, hittin' shit, four five extended clip
Y'all be on that snitchin' shit and y'all know what snitches get
No limit shit, we wit' the shits, I'm focused on gettin' rich
M-O-B forget a bitch, right after I hit the bitch
Like point me to the kitchen bitch, I be water whippin' shit
Whip it, Jeff Gordon whip it, hit it wit' the fork
Straight drop no shorts, shooters on and off the court
Shoot a nigga off his porch, turn a nigga to a corpse
Yeah, I'm bout that, rollin' up that loud pack
Catch me lackin'? I doubt that
'Cause I never leave without that
And that's real shit, got real hitters, they kill shit
You fuck around hit the kill switch
These hollow tips you feel this
And I'm tryna get real rich
'Cause my mama said I wouldn't be shit
Nobody never gave me shit
Like «Bibby hop on this remix»
That's five hundred, no free shit
'Cause I'm hot and I do this shit for my block
I got thirty off in that Glock, have my nina give you top
Bodies gon' drop and we ain't gon' stop, R.I.P Roc
Catch a few ops, send a few shots
Might hit a few blocks, fuck a few thots
I need two mill might seem like a lot
But I spit straight drop so its really not
My team gon' eat, R.I.P. to police
Fake niggas don't speak, cop killers in the heat
Catch me in the streets, shout out to broskiBaby, don't stop
Baby, don't stop
You couldn't make me this
I wanna get freaky, freaky
And let me lick you up and down
Up and down
Up and down
Let me making you soaking wet baby
Let me show you how the gangsters do it
I know you tryna get it off
Turn the Bryson Tiller off, let me fuck you to this gangster music
Body bangin' and I can't refuse it
Pussy good, so tight, know I gotta abuse it
One stroke, two strokes, same beat as the music
Aye and that shit so wet I took the rubber off, can't even use it
I love when you start screamin' out when I go deep into it
Know I'm goin' hard, I can't stop killin', in love with you moanin'
We go again, over and over, know she my opponent
Win, lose, or draw
She leave me breathin' hard, I leave her soakin'
I kiss your lips, we lick and suck, and let me bend it over
She throw it back, I'm in her stomach, know she feelin' it
So deep, she tryna run but can't because I'm still in it
She feelin' it, she lovin' it, she feelin' it
We wasn't deep at first but now we got our feelin's in
When I'm on the road she missin' me, yeah cause she not on that
When I land', I'm on my way, can't wait to put my mouth on it
Aye
Let me lick you 
You already know what is man when you callin' me baby
Just pull up, two, three cribs, you come whenever look
Baby let me get it fresh up out the shower
Tongue kiss your lips, caress you, stroke you for an hour
She leakin', soakin', bite her lips soon as I'm slidin' in
Can't get no deeper, she start scratchin', and she grabbin' me
I can take the pain, she say my name when I start grinding it
Fucked around and fell in love, I met her from around the land
First started off as my little bitch, wasn't even fuckin' then
Let me inside, I'll beat it up, and I've been busting since
Can't take it when I'm lickin' it, when I start suckin' it
She comin' in spread her legs, keep lickin', make her cum again
She know I keep it super real, realer than most of 'em
She know it's fuck them other bitches, can't get over her
Aye, like a roller coast with her
Haa, she ride, I'm holdin' her
And after that I told her
Let me lick you soakin' wet baby, haha

Besides us fuckin' baby, we just be kickin' it. I need somebody to kick it when I'm goin' through everything I'm goin' through. When I can just lay back, smoke a blunt, rub my back or somethin', you know I'm sayin'? Let me vent to you sometimes baby. Hoes ain't shit but pussies, haha I told 'em hoes ain't shit but pussies, hahaD.A. got that—
D.A. got that dope
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD
I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct 
Shootin' at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thing, tryna repeat 
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it, out the sun roof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast from police
Shots fired back, but his ass in the street
When I bought a forty, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call, it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lot of warfare, 17, had a 50 piece
Flexed on niggas so you know they wanna kill a G
 Posted in the hood with some Bentley keys
 Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean
I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head
My killers good, they know I'm hands-on with the bread
A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry and seeing red
How the fuck I'm 'posed to have fun? All my niggas dead
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again 
Don't stand too close to me , I got PTSD
Used to run home from the train stop 
Running so fast, dodging raindrops
'Member got robbed at the park once 
'Member thinking that that bitch probably ain't cocked 
'Member I was with my mama one time
Seen a nigga through the glass, hit a nigga with a bankshot 
Point-blank, head hanging off his tank top 
Walked off, we drove off, went to GameStop 
Quiet ride there, picked up San Andreas 
Certain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off
We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl 
Conceal and revealing to people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil, in case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets 
Please do not run up on me, not even as fans
Niggas get fanned down on the Dan Ryan
I'm flying, I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan 
The days seem longer as life gets shorter
We know sex, drugs, money, all in that order
Ain't no structure, no peace, we've lost our order
Leaving me with anxiety, fucking up my sobriety 
It's a war zone laying inside my head
I still think about all my niggas that's dead
I'm too paranoid, yeah, I know you heard what I said
I'm too paranoid, I make sure all my opps, they bled 
Draining all my energy, no, I cannot sleep, uh-huh
I'm affected by the streets, no appetite, I can't eat
I only see red when I see, I think it's my PTSD 
I think it's my PTSD , I think it's my PTSD, yeah 
I turn the news on when I smell death in the airYeah, ho! Yeah, ho! Yeah, ho! Yeah, ho! Yeah, ho!

So I keep my distance from niggas
Squad with me bet I won't get touched nigga
Got shots for him, shots for him
Niggas sayin fuck Rocblock, send shots at them
10-0 on the scoreboard, sent shots again
Keep going nonstop til we drop lots of men
And I swear I lost so many of my guys
So im sippin Remy, smokin 50's for my guys
Never let a nigga blow any of my guys
Ain't nobody fuckin with NoLimit in my eyes
Missin my niggas
Kushy and liquor, 4's of the lean
RIP Richie, hand me a swisha
Paint up a picture
Of me and the squad still on the block
Before it went wrong
And Kobe wasn't gone and Joc was still home
Man, I remember
Now my heart is cold as December
Get money the only thing thats on my agenda
Cuz its too many gone, but im still livin on
Stayin strong, put my farewells in this song

I'll give up the money, fuck the fame, all the jewels
All the hoes, all the clothes and all the shoes
Just bring my niggas back
But I know I'll never get em back
So if a pussy disrespect then he gettin wacked
And I hear niggas at my neck, I'm like "where they at?"
Cuz I be right there on the set with the biggest gat
Got so many niggas thats hatin, ion even know em
And so many fellings of hatred, I dont even show em
Can I just get some money? cuz I know niggas broke and bummy
They ain't even funny
I know they prolly wanna rob me
They hate me prolly
But they only gonna make Mally come catch a body
They won't get nothin from me
From the hellhole wheres its full of zombies
Where they catch the most bodies across the country
Where they took all of my homies from me
Man, RIP my homies, gotta get this money
SQUAD, RIP the L's
Free the L's why you niggas wanna be the L's
No Limit MB, bitch we the L's
RIP White Folks, I can't see a L
Squad, and we gotta stay winnin
Rollin in 4's with them semis and they tinted
Pull up on the oppas, pose' to be there and they hidin'
Cuz they scored when we ain't have them heaters
But they didn't!
HANN!Southside on the track, yeah
Gang shit, nigga
Yeah
Fuck you talkin' 'bout, man?
This shit's got the most views out of everything I've ever put up on my shit
That little clip, that shit got a million views
I ain't never got no views on some shit out
Who you think you ahead of? Not us
In the S or the Porsche Carerras somethin'
Fuck twins like Tia and Tamera somethin'
Yeah that boy gettin' bread, Panera, somethin'
Landed in the GT, leer or somethin'
Put Posto in the Air or somethin'
Marry her, she have an affair
I'ma spin that ho like Ferris
Born in the Chi like Ye
But I do crimes like Bump J, I ain't scared of nothin'
Passport stamp, young nigga ran up that sack
Might as well go to Paris, huh?
Woofin, got whacked you embarrassed, huh?
Pussy you act like you scared of somethin'
Gon' and shoot up the terrace 
Then they gon' realize it's serious 
I ain't even on that, period 
I'm makin' millions, I'm serious 
That money come in various 
Can't count it, I get delirious 
I bought my mama a mansion 
So I can't trip over materials 
But I'm still dipped in that fashion
Know I stay drippin', that's period
These niggas drippin', that's period
Nah, they can't find me and I'm serious 
They right behind, I'm serious 
And I'm straight off the 9, now I'm serious
Who you gon' send to fuck with me?
Take stuff from me or from any of mine? Now I'm curious 
Better think 'fore you bust at me
If you miss, I'll slap a 50 and, man, now I'm furious
Dived in that water, dived like Aquarius
Young nigga, we was breakin' the barriers 
If you grabbin' that torch, better carry it 
Tryna hide on that porch on some scary shit 
All I smoke is loud, you got that mild like Darius 
My son ain't gotta work because he gon' inherit it, uh huh 
We yell, "Gang-gang first," you don't even know your heritage 
Took the cash from verses, I give that shit to charity
Lovin' my city like Chano, I swear
Why the fuck I still gotta ride everywhere with it?
"Herb I seen you on the news, I was worried"
We was just jokin' with y'all, that's a parody
We don't talk too much, got D's everywhere 
We still fresh, double G's everywhere 
I put the VV's everywhere 
I do Mike Amiri's, every pair
And they know me for shittin' on everybody
I'm the one that do shit that you hear about
I'm the one that told y'all that I move like Obama
Then how the fuck they end up with my whereabouts?
Hold on everybody gotta clear it out
Middle of summer, hot like a sauna
We was laid back in the back of the Honda
Told young to sneak up, anaconda
It ain't happen, I wasn't there your honor
I was somewhere eatin' Benihana's
Get valet and Lil' Benny to park it
All my life I had been in apartments
Move to Bali, get a brib, I’m ballin
My bitch always primpin', keep ballin'
Yes I'm a lil' workaholic
Hit the crib with a 50 and all 20's
I'ma just make her count all of 'em
But I get the backend all blues
Nah don't fuck around, bruh, do all of it
Know it's goin' right to lil' dude
Already got a closet, all shoes
Bought 10 pairs of baby G-Fazos
And my bitch got a closet with some Loubs
Cashed out on the crib, I ain't get the view
I'm like, "Fuck it, no problem, it'll do"
Mama's crib got a pond, not a pool
We had roaches and rats, I ain't get to move
I survived through it all, it's true 
Slept on couches and floors all through middle school
Now I'm cool, now I'm 'bool
Now my car go vroom, 
Niggas hatin' on me, but it's bool
Guess I got rich too soon
Nigga, I've been rappin' like six years 
I seen ten niggas get killed 
What about me turnin' down them deals? 
Now you pissed off 'cause I switched wheels?
Uh, who run it? Limit
No Limit run it
No Limit man
No Limit
Who run it? G Herbo
I'm done with this shit
Who y'all think you foolin'? Not me
Y'all niggas really ain't airin' nothin'
This bust down, tryna scare us or some'
Your shit weak, tryna compare us or somethin'
What I made last week? Like a million or somethin'
Rich, mad 'cause your bitch ate my kids or somethin'
Man, I could fuck your wife like you sharin' or somethin'
Galore ass mansion with lira or somethin'
Nigga tried to get my ho, tried to fuck my bitch
You think I'ma miss that?
Man she sucked Mean's dick and she sucked Rock's dick
So you think I'ma kiss that?
I was in L.A., bitch powdered her nose
Told her I ain't with that
Boy you trippin', SI diamonds on your neck
Mean you better give your wrist back
Me no broke, Akademiks, yeah, that's where you get your news at
Ask your bros, Grammy-nominated songs just to prove that, uh
Know your bros told you, nah, you better not just do that, uh
I'm going mode, T.Y., tell me when to go, boy, you ain't rich, you a bitch 
Oh you T'd out? Bitch, you beat out
Y'all worried 'bout me, better get your lick back
Just like bitches, y'all all chit chat
Car so foreign got an engine in the back
Balenciaga with the Gucci and the Prada
With the Louis and the Pucci and it's all mismatched
Ho, it's Lil Uzi and I'm far from a goofy
In Chiraq, 150, be strapped
Got a 40 shorty, boy, better get back
Gun loud, backyard party, kick back
How I'm broke If I just hired myself a hitman?
Be quiet, bro, them niggas over there'll turn to six rats
Not lyin', bro, I been fucked this bitch for six racks
After I drop that shit, me, Herbo, Ari and my bitch is gonna relax
Prolly somewhere on a beach, prolly somewhere on an island
You know that my Rollie got XO diamonds in it, so that's that Perfect Timing
Said, "Elliot, bezel it," ice in 'em kettle chips, I run it back like a Heisman
Pull up, I'm swervin', I'm mergin', I got the whip, yeah the one right with the curtains
Got boys that be workin' their block to be twerkin', the Tesla pull up for diversion
On the beat, me and Herbo, we purgin', the Perky the molly the lean got us slurrin'
You call her phone, you think she sleep, but she suckin' my dick while her words keep on slurpin'
She said that my shit the same size as a two-liter ginger ale, why she keep burpin'
I take out my hair and I stand on my money, your bitch think I'm Julius Erving
Ayy, ayy
Yeah, yeah
Just a little somethin' to it, I ain't even rip the shit
Pull up in a Lamb' or somethin'
Peanut butter whip, yeah, jam or somethin'
Fucked your bitch on cam or somethin'
Pink diamonds think I'm Cam or somethin'I know...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, I'm determined to...
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
I be with pistol tottin', kush smokin', lean pourin' crazy ass niggas
Nigga want some work?
Just pull up, make sure you bring the cash with ya
I be blowin' money fast nigga
Try me that's your ass nigga
Nigga talkin' down bout Buckz probably
Cause I don't fuck with that nigga
I say I did this shit for my dogs
Just make a call, they'll risk it all
Or if it's that I just send 'em a text
Have my youngin's come through make it rain on your set
Sleeping on couches, had pains in my neck
Now I got three or four chains on my neck
Bitches be trippin', I can't fuck with that
Cut that bitch off cause I ain't for the stress
These niggas be set trippin'
Switchin' sides, set flippin'
Pocket watch, sneak dissin'
Why you worried about the next nigga?
Why you all in my pockets?
Why I'm always a topic?
Nigga get up off of your ass
Go and make you a profit
Buy the mall when I be goin' shoppin'
Got a habit, really need to stop it
We be tottin', Lil Squeak got it
These niggas know that he'll pop it
Niggas know I spit that ether
Bitch I ain't doin' no features
Bout to cash out on that Porsche just to ride past my teacher
And for Big Bucks I'mma go cause that's my big bro nigga
NLMB, never leave my brothers man
Day 1 niggas, no new niggas in my ass, ten year shit
Real shit nigga

Drug dealin' wild ass niggas

Worth a couple hundred thou ass nigga
I'm a Truey, Louie
I’m Truey Louie rockin, you can smell me before I come around ass nigga
Cause I'm a leanin' ass, loud ass, rollin' out the pound ass nigga
And I got it from the mud
Lil Bibby that's my blood
We was in the trap and we was in the stu'
And we was out there tottin' guns
Took hard work to run them bands up so we fuck it all for fun
And G-Fazo would be proud of me so I fuck it all for 1's
And we got choppers with the drums
All type of fuckin' guns
Know the Feds watchin'
Niggas prolly workin', I ain't talkin', I'mma run
When they find me, I be high
Chiefin', chokin', coughin' up my lungs
Robins full of Hunds
I don't check for hoes in the club
I buy crushes, fantas, dutches, swishers with my ones
80 dollar cups
But I'm through with that shit, tryna give it up
Yeah I fell in love
'Member saying I could never get enough
Bitches on me, they can't ever get enough
Call 'em up, any day I'm gettin' fucked
5AM, in the hill just me and Bucks
Who the hottest from the 'Go? Just me and Bucks
Take it how you wanna, I don't give a fuck
Nigga run up on me, all you hear is buck
Now somebody pick him up
Treat me notepad like it's Spalding ball every time I pick it up
Record labels calling now
Nigga balling like I'm tryna pick 'em up, nigga 
Ugh, hey, hey, hey Bibby what's up bro, you already know how we rockin' it man. 150 dream team the campaign man. Free all the 150 demons, RIP all our niggas man. Look. -
(Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry
Don't worry, don't worry, don't worry, don't worry)My hunger is equal to my struggle
I came from nothin'
Grindin' then I made it to somethin'
The age of a youngin'
Started hangin' and bangin' and hustlin'
Exchangin' the customs
To make it in this dangerous jungle
In a treacherous war
People dying, nobody crying
All the shit that I saw
You expect me to sit on the porch?
Every moment is yours
Freeze up and you fall by the torch where I'm from
Better not fumble in the city I'm from
Homicides on a Sunday in the city I'm from
Young nigga, always hanging wit them older guys
We was bangin', slangin' all the white
But we ain't Oberweis
Fantasizing, tryna be that trap nigga
Can't get to the money
We too busy tryna clap niggas
Standing on that block, where my mama told me
"Boy don't go right there"
But I was by that store right there
Learned everything I know right there
Me and broski, brought me to the block
He showed me the work, and he sold me the work
But nobody never told me to work
I used to post up, talk shit and tote guns
While we smoke blunts
We knew the price if we gon' live this life
But we like so what
Cause no one gon' make a way for none of us to come up
But I'm tryna make a way for every one of us to come up
When the sun rise I roll a philly up, and load the semi up
By 9 o'clock  I'm drinkin' double cups and gettin' paper cuts
We savin' up, sittin' on this money
Now it's raisin' us. We trained to buss
You can run dog, that's what this laser for
I think I need to, take a breather
Cause I'm hot as fever
I'm about to bring some type of demon
Right up outta me
Cause I been feelin' like you pussy niggas tryna plot on me
That's why I keep this Glock on me
Plus I got all this guap on me
But way before the flex you still could catch me
On that block out east
Lost my homies, now I feel like God just dropped a rock on me
But I won't stop, I can't stop
Gotta go hard, till my rate drop
Spittin' all this fire make my face hot
Now I can't wait till my tape drop
And I'm still up on the 8 Block
Late night me and J. Dot
Better think twice for you ride past
Let the 9 blast now the Jakes hot
I was bout to take a rest but
Smoke told me, "Bro it ain't no let ups"
So I'm working hard like I'm in the pros
Make a nigga bitch lick my sweat up
She suckin' dick and I just met her
She know a nigga next up
She hope I don't neglect her
And she know I don't respect her
And I might forget my sweater
But never leave the house without Berettas
Still the same nigga from the gangway
Tryna flip a ounce into a Phantom
Catch me doing shows filling stands up
You know the gang turn the fans up
And you know we got them cans tucked
Hope nobody don't get blammed up
I be leanin' I can't stand up
And this bitch asked me why my jeans sag
Cause they tryna hold my bands up
Heard somebody wanna rob me
Well you bett' not give ya chance up
2 seats in the 50 shot
I just hope I don't get jammed up
And this 50 bett' not jam up
I seen niggas get in jams and
They ain't even stay to pick they mans up
I seen niggas shakin' hands
Then make the same niggas put they hands up
I seen niggas change and changed
Niggas that was cool since the sandbox
So I gotta keep my head up
16 and I got one head up
And ion talk, I let the gun talk
And she don't never really understand nothin'
Let a fuck nigga ask somethin'
Give a fuck nigga every one
Gave my young niggas couple .38s
And some shells let em have fun
Young niggas spend a lot of cash
Cause growing up I never had none
I'm like, "Oh I gotta get me some"
Cause being broke wasn't any fun
We got choppers for everyone
Who want problems with anyone
I be tired of tryna tell y'all niggas
Where a nigga really comin' from
And why a nigga gotta go hard
Cause ion really come from nothin'
And I never been a runner up
Cause it ain't nobody runnin' us
And Lil Mally got that sit em down
If somebody ever runnin' up
Imma always bond them killas out
What'chu think I got them hunnids for?
Crazy James just knocked his sentence out
Yeah the state done let a menace out
So I'm showing up at my nigga house
Like the cop that move the tenants out
I see lil niggas want some Twitter clout
But I ain't tryna put ya business outTen
OZ on the track
Gang
Ayy
I just been feelin' different lately man
I been pouring eighths every day and popping bottles in the stu' and shit
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind 
All I really want is peace of mind 
I'm so deep in the streets know some secrets I won't ever tell that could get me some time
Seen so much in my life I got demons in me I don't fight I just keep em inside
Ain't no fear if you seek I won't hide
Hardcore guaranteed I'ma ride
Growing up I had poor nigga dreams just to be on TV shooting threes throwing dimes
Then I learned wait oh no no nigga dreams will chase yours, what I just spent on drink was a dime
Used to live in the slums, dishes all in the sink, none to eat cry and sleep all the time
Now I live in three states and I fly to LA to get high on the beach all the time
And I hate coming back cause when I'm in Chi-raq gotta ride with them  heats all the time
Niggas say they want me all the time 
Lord Father God forgive me for the sins I commit all the time
Gotta load up that clip all the time
I can't repent all the time
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind 
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
My whole family pray I stay safe everyday they be checking on me all the time
And I swear man I hate seeing tears on their face
Keep two hammers on me all the time
Why it got to be my life at risk everyday?
Type of shit that I think all the time
But it is what it is I'll be fine
Until then I'ma get dollar signs
Niggas killing for Neims and they killing for fame and I'm like
When they gonna get dollar signs?
Used to sleep in the streets didn't see OG for weeks and won't come back until I get dollar signs
And that's by any means for my family to see every meal I'ma miss some of mine
Yeah put that on my life cause that's all I know
When I write I don't fake not a line
Tell myself I'm the truth all the time
Grandma hit me on the phone ask me what I'ma do all the time
Told her just trying to stay out the way cause I think about you all the time
Some my niggas got years of they life took from them
And I just wanna see all of mine
About half of my niggas they not even here
Pour a Four up it keep me from crying
Doing shows made me miss Grandma birthday this year
Who I don't even see all the time
Trying to balance out family and my career
All I really want is peace of mind My feet can't touch the ground, touch the ground
And it feels like I can see the sins on the horizon
Every time you are not around I slowly drift away
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cause they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go
But that's the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
This the life I signed up for yeah I know, yeah I know
So you wanna be a dope boy, yeah I know

They ain't believe, thought I wasn't gon' be shit, be rich, yeah I know
Never gave me shit, got it all on my own, nigga G shit, yeah I know
I smoke me 2-3 to the dome soon as I'm alone
Just thinkin' bout my life I'm happy that I made it home
Cause Lord knows I've been doin' wrong out there all day long
But Lord knows that I'm just tryna put all of my people on
Lord knows I got some issues, miss all of my people gone

Stayed focus then I made it happen

Ratchets, got me wishin' that I stayed in Cali
Ever since that day and even before, hit a bitch everywhere I go
But ever since that day I think of you tellin' me I need that
Yeah I know, yeah I know
Tryna stay afloat
Gotta tell the rap industry cuz they don't know
Keep protection on me everywhere I go

Paid two stacks for the jacket, straight off the rack, and a rack for the jeans
I was on Essex with ratchets in my jacket, you know what's brackin' with me

When you gon' get with that racket, you know what's gon' happen, we clapping the scene
We ain't with the dissin' and rappin', you know what's gon' happen, we clapping your team
Ride with the team , in traffic with beams 
Rollin' off beans , you know what that means 
Already masked up, when we pull over you know it's a green
Police know me, already know not to ask nun 
They already know I don't know anything
Get fucked up, roll up
Rep yo' shit, throw it up
What you drinking? Pour it up
Now it's going up, you throwing up
'Cause you drunk as fuck, what the fuck?
Tell her I wanna fuck, she know wassup

Get fucked up, roll up
Rep yo' shit, throw it up
What you drinking? Pour it up
Now it's going up, you throwing up
'Cause you drunk as fuck, what the fuck?
Tell her I wanna fuck, she know wassup
Yo' bitch get tore up, she want another cup

This just bars right here
No Limit MB, 150 Rock Block shit man
Ball Like I'm Kobe, the mixtape
Self-made, no nigga never gave me shit man
Self-Paid, on my own, me and my niggas
My squad, you know?
Bitch I’m still the hottest, I’m just being honest
Turn me up a notch, I’m on supersonic
I ain’t been asleep, bitch it's 8 o clock
When you finish noddin’ me meet me at the top
G Herbo in your city, fillin up the spot
Leanin' off the drop, Mally got the Glock
Everywhere I go, Robin, Truey'd be up
Louis, Gucci’d up, all the newest stuff
While my diamond dancing and my robins glancin'
Pocket full of Jacksons, shoebox full of Franklins
Smoking on Jamaican, all my clothes be stinkin’
I know niggas hatin', choppas like the Haitians
I ain’t single-chasin’, I’m just bein’ patient
Everything I’m saying, history in the making
Listen what I’m saying, I get in my zone
Offer me a milli I won’t even take it
Where I’m from man, mill look like a nigga made it
When I milk the game it's gon' change up
Feelin’ like a nigga made it
Run it back, there ya nigga made it, huh
And I be ridin’ down Lake Shore, gettin’ faded
Dutchies, double cups, gettin’ wasted, thinking
I know ain’t no nigga fuckin’ with me
Hottest, youngest in the fucking city
All the bitches wanna fuckin’ lick me
Cause I just left the Summer Jam with Nicki
And she just helped me book a couple shows
I might hit the road and go chuck a fifty
Hundred niggas and we got them poles
And they gon' unload, you better not come near me
I be in the streets, catch me over East
When I see police, I don’t talk to any
When you basic all the bitches complicatin'
When you getting money they start complimentin'
When it come to bitches I done ran through several
You get on my level, nigga now you pimpin’
I be doggin' hoes, never callin' hoes
Pillow talkin’ hoes, nigga now you trippin’
Coppin’ and I’m flippin, smoking and I'm sipping
Fucking and I’m pimping, package and I'm sending
Rapping and I’m trapping, earning and I’m spending
Make a broke nigga learn to pay attention
If I do not fuck with you it’s my decision
Die a real nigga, true to my religion
You might go out snitchin', I'mma go No Limit
Everywhere he go you know his .44 wit him
All that I remember is a .44 hit him
I was off the lean, bro was off a bean
When we in the scene 30's with the beams
Leave a murder scene, we ain’t heard a thing
Niggas hatin', act like they ain’t heard of me
Call my phone for verses like emergencies
Swagger-jacking, they committing burglaries
I’m a trend setter, I'll set it off
Desert Eagle same one as Queen Latifah
It's a bitch, press her, I'll let it off
These lil niggas, man they can’t compare to me
They ain’t gon’ step to me cause I’m gon’ get it on
Every day I leave the crib and sacrifice
I might go to prison, I might die tonight
'Till that day I’m livin’, nah, I ain’t scared
Lotta niggas bitches, don’t know how to fight
Leave ‘em wit' a right, bro go get the pipe
Look out for the cops, don’t see none in sight
All my niggas hustle, barely gettin’ by
Stressin', smokin’ ounces barely gettin’ high
Out here seen a lotta real niggas die
Prolly reason why a nigga get so high
Get so high feel like I live in the sky
I'm so high I could tell all my niggas hi
Wish I had a chance to tell my niggas bye
Hate to see my fam and my niggas cry
Bodies dropping Summer to the Winter time
Lotta niggas never see the finish line
If I’m by my lonely I still got it on me
That’s on every nigga I got tatted on me
In the battlefield I lost my brodies
CMOE, Peewee and I lost Jacoby
I will never ever leave my brothers
He got on but he forgot his homies
Know you brothers we all need each other
If I got it then you got it homie
Believe that
All my niggas demons we still on the same shit
Drop 'em,' where the weed at?
150 dream team, all my shooters heat check
And we all on top, I ain’t even peaked yet, huh
No Limit MB, 4L
Ball Like I'm Kobe, the mixtape
R.I.P all my niggas man, free all my niggas man
Shout out my squad
Shout out South Side, you already knowAyye, ayye, 150 Dream Team, huh
Packs came in, roll a wood to see what the gas like 
Welcome to the fast life, buy Hemi to see what the dash like
Used to ride Buicks, Tauruses, now I get 10k for choruses
Pull up hoppin' outta foreign shit, splash brothers with me, scorin' shit
Foe nem sluttin' hoes, all on tour shit, fine freak bitches, don't want boring shit
Remember youngins sleeping on the floor shit, check my bank account, my shit enormounis
I mean enormous, big books on me, no thesaurus
I never lied even back when I was broke, these other rappers act C.B.4. shit
Hundred thousand, probably saw like four of them, back up on my shit I need some more of them
Never satisfied, I need millions, niggas sitting 'round, it's civilians
It's civilians, niggas killin' 'em, old ladies, man, even children
Real street nigga, I ain't feelin' it, but when it come to beef, I ain't feeling shit
Niggas say they see the opps, they spilling 'em, everytime they see the opps they missin' 'em
Hit the innocent, go do sentences, we don't play around, lil bro finish 'em
Soberer than a bitch, I ain't been sippin' shit, stacking hundreds, making forties, little shit
Shit ridiculous, used to shop at corner stores with fifty cents, probably died trying not to mention it
I had beef up in my hood like Fifty Cent, but I ain't ever have to make a many man
Know my death was wanted bad,  by many man, so you know I gotta keep it with me then
Forty glizzy with me, come and get me then, kill a nigga
Lord, oh forgive me, foe nem fuck around and get me him
And sometimes, shit, it just remind me of nights at the club again
No security was searching me, you know that I'ma get the burner in
150 Dream Team behind me, always looking grimey
And as far as trouble, we don't want none, but we still a find it
I'm from Chiraq, this the lifestyle, I don't even mind it
Hollows in the forty-five, X.D., beam on the side of it
I can't trust these hoes, see yo house, put niggas right on it
Fuck that bitch in a hotel, kick her out, I put my life on it
I ain't worried about no niggas, you know that I keep my pipe on it
I ain't saying nobody can get me but I see suspicion, I'm right on it
Let a nigga catch me slipping, you know I deserve it
Rather go out in the foreign, on the e-way swervin'
When I die, don't let no pussy niggas in my service
My view be so high in the sky, my phone don't got no service
I get high and think of all them nights when I was serving
Never went through no peer pressure, lived my life on purpose
If you alive and don't get paper, you ain't got no purpose
What the fuck up with the world, everybody savage
Nobody wanna be no doctors, all the shorties get clapped at
Ain't nobody going to college, all of the shorties on SnapChatGang!

150 Roc Block Man
R.I.P. them niggas
Welcome to Fazoland coming soon
Just be patient
I know that's what ya'll been waiting for
Let's Get It!
Free them niggas
Look I wake up every morning with the same state of mind
Bitch I'm running to this money
Let the lames wait in line
I'm impatient
Bitch I'm chasing
This first place and we not racing
Now I'm cashing
Riding Astons
Went from sitting in the station
But I'm up now
All the neighborhood hoes wanna fuck now
I can't let chain me up like a chump now
I just call my lil bros let her bustdown
See Jackie at the top when you touch down
I done lost a lotta niggas to this street shit
Had to duck a lotta triggers to this street shit
I done seen a lotta niggas do this street shit
But the streets talk when you in deep shit
Taught me get rich cause you can't beat this
Gotta stay afloat niggas getting seasick
Gotta get the dough I ain't with the cheap shit
For everybody ever said I wouldn't be shit
Seen my homie hit twice coulda been three
Almost seen Christ twice coulda been three
I'mma burn these pipes 'fore they get me
I had to earn my stripes coulda went sweet
Now I separate from niggas I don't trust
Niggas that ain't starve with me
And all them bitches I ain't fuck
Cause I was working hard
Mix matching words straight in that booth attaching verbs
Herb gon' get what he deserve and I deserve it all
Got some shit a couple labels heard
Now they want Herb to ball
Get me out the hood and in them hills
Man I done heard it all
But honestly, my niggas honor me
Won't leave that hood at all
And honestly, No Limit sponsors me
Me and my hood gon' ball
Responsibly I keep my promises
No need for compliments
I do as I please like the G's
Fuck the consequence
You boys ain't in my league
Got my speed or accomplishments
Might catch me overseas smoking weed eating Lobster tail
Or I'm probably over East where they pop you over beef
Dissing 'bout them L's boys until they spot you in the street
Now they got you in the streets
With nun' to block you from that heat
Ain't no boxing over East
My youngins pop before they speak
That's the way it go in my city
They trained to go in my city
We dream of sunny days
But it rain and snow in my city
Them things will blow in my city
Them boys be feeling anger
Can't just be hood on hood
Them boys be killing strangers
Everything ain't good all good
It ain't the same when your mans draw blood
Niggas change when the gang draw blood
When it's cold in the game
Niggas don't know your name
Have you posted on the block
Giving blows in the rain
16 toting Glocks thinking those are the things
Now you on top riding fours on a range
Everywhere niggas claim yall cuz
Nah it ain't all love where I meet you at
Niggas want Herb man that's why I keep a strap
Posted over East man where them heaters at
Run up on me bro let them heaters clap
And dear Lord I pray
That on the day when you take me away
I got enough money laid in the safe
To make sure my moms and my sister they straight
But the Lord coulda took me today
Let a nigga run up on me cook me today
It wouldn't be easy I stay with the Eight
Or I make one call have them K's in his face
Catch me in the mall spending K's on my waist
All I know is ball
And I do it harder than ya'll
In the club, throwing racks got your broad off the wall
Off the Po' up leaning so hard I could fall
Codeine
Pour me up
Triple cups
Fours a night
Smoking dope
Sipping lean
Purple sprite
Hold the ice
Me and broski riding in that challenger high as fuck
Any nigga challenge us
Duck when we riding up
Buck at the nigga back
Buss till the nigga flat
One to his fitted cap
Watch how the nigga act
Skeet off
Drop the heat off
Call an ass to hit
Pick her up smash the bitch
V12 fast as shit
Dooski call it Activist
I'm gon' off a six
I ain't lackin' while it's crackin'
Something long on my hip
Big pole nigga
You gotta be strong just to live
Quick soul lifter
This will get him gone in a jiff
Leave a nigga right there on the block where I'm at
Riding through kids and Marley in a lot with the Mac
Riding through trigger we gone leave you stinging from the black
Nigga lay a couple bricks on a mat
We on that
Apologies you don't want that
Run upon us with the chance you ain't blow that
Too bad man I feel for you
Say you eating man I hope your squad got a last meal for you
Catch a nigga in the store we blow him
Catch a nigga with his ho we blow him
Catch a nigga he don't got it we smoke him
Catch a nigga out in traffic we on him
Niggas think they want static do they really?
Ask me why I start rapping do they hear me?
But this shit ain't only rap cause it's in me
We ain't worried 'bout your stack we got 50's
Put No Limit on my back for the city
And No Limit's where it's at in the city
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me
Right on Essex where I'm at come and get me

Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
13 I'm in the books, I'm playing basketball
By 16 I'm cool with crooks and lettin' ratchets off
But let's rewind, go back in time, this how it happened ya'll
On the east side of the Chi, straight full of madness ya'll
Straight full of pains, snowstorms and rains
Straight target practice dog
But back to story, me? I was just a shorty
See stayed in the slums, two parent home
But moms that's who was close to me
Pops was cool but I was everything I wasn't supposed to be
In the streets, ditchin' school, murder, drugs around me
Rappin' it just found me, thank God it wasn't the county
Buncha shootouts, lucky that them bullets went around me
God was with me, jumped straight in that water, it ain't drown me
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Long live G-Fazo, Vito, Cheeko, C-Mo, Pistol, Kobe, Roc
Blizz, Richie, white folks, cracks, playboy, yeah my broski Capo
The herd is real, the couple of names I didn't say I'm gone and stop
The shit I've been through made me heartless
All my feelin's on this Glock
And damn Cap, we was just ridin' through the town
Smokin' out the pound
30-40 down
Heard that shit, it made me sick
I'm still fresh from out of town
If I'm comin' home to that how I'm supposed to put it down?
They don't understand my struggle
They don't care what I've been through
Kobe they don't know me and you was on the block
Up tweakin' all night right before they hit you
And your moms still calls all the time
Said she wanna hear the tape soon as I get through
And she know what my shit gone do
So she don's mind waiting till a nigga get through
All this shit on my mind and I'm only 19
Can't believe how a nigga get through
Every line that I spit shit true
They like why you ain't drop shit new?
2013 songs I ain't ever even drop man
And me and Cap got some hot shit too
'Member bein' in the stu' all day
At the hood all night on some hot shit too
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life alone
Love and live your life
Make it lavish long
And I can't right my wrongs
So I just write my songs
How would I live if God guaranteed my life was long?
And when I sin I pray that God don't leave my life aloneFirst off, I'm still sorry for the stuff that I did
All the lying and back talking shit I did as a kid
I was bangin' when you told me not
Hustlin' when you told me stop
And all the stupid shit I did
The love you gave me never stopped
You always came through for me
Not one thing you wouldn't do for me
Sad to say when you heard 'bout them shots that day
You knew it was me
I worried you so much that you got tired of me
I knew it. So I grew up, I ain't screw up
Now you proud of me
I remember, comin' in
Middle of the night my eyes red
You asked me why, and I ain't wanna tell you
Cause my guys dead
You so intelligent you always kept up wit' what lies said
I'm so pathetic I could never keep up wit' my lying ass
And raising me you never thought to worry, 'bout me dying fast
And growin' up I never thought, my actions made you cry sad
I just wanna say, you made me everything I am today
And after all I put you through, I wouldn't have it no other way
Ma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Look, I promise mamma I'm sorry
Definition of a woman
When our problems was taken over you brought us from under
As a youngin' you always told me I won't need for nothin'
I just never settled for less cause I can't see you strugglin'
That's why I got it on my own and I stayed away from home
Cause I ain't want my sister growin' up watching me doing wrong
And at the end of the day, it's my life
I gotta learn from my mistakes
All I wanna do is move you and my grandma out the state
Put y'all in some nice estate, name on ya license plate
So I grind like it's my time, even if I die today
So even if I die today I just hope you see brighter days
You always made sure I was straight
Not a meal I never ate
Jepordize our friendship, that's a chance I'll never take
All the times that I would scare you
You would never run away
Now every single day I wait to see a smile on ya face
All the rivers of tears you could probably cry away
Ma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Mamma I'm sorry
Look, I promise mamma I'm sorryYeah, Swervo

Take care of your children, take care of your niggas, stay out that drama 
Go watch everybody, the moment they do somethin' funny, then fuck 'em 
Nigga run up on you, then buck it 
Kill a fuck nigga, it's nothin'

G Herbo, "Humble Beast", man
150 dream team, 150 Roc Block, bitch
79th, Essex
Niggas talking all this gangsta shit
It's real gangsta shit over there
When I was up on 78th, you was scared straight
Before Roc died and Gilly caught that fed case
Remember Roc died, every morning shots fired
You was never in them trenches, pussy, you was dead weight
Never end up reminiscing, watch your homie hemorrhage
Even though you want to kill 'em, never play them bitches
Always came up with the blueprint, never had to listen
I had a bunch of detentions, too many pink slips turned to suspensions
Now I just walked in the car lot
Holding my pink slips, rocking Givenchy
If I had my life on the line
I'd take the shot but I'm not a Nowitzki
Chi real hot like a shot of the whiskey
If I'm not ducking, how could you miss me?
Glued to the blicky, keep my shit with me
I get the back end, still I get back, in the back of the truck
If the club try to frisk me
I get so high just like I'm a hippy
Back in the '60s, Percs got me trippy
I did two thirties, I'm off a sixty
I'm in a Range Rover Sport on the road
Tryna lose control, no I'm not Missy
I'm quit the drank, and I do not miss it
Won't even pour it up when I'm not busy
I'm on a mission, I'm always busy, counting up benji's
Tryin' get some more some more bread
Look at my cars right now, I got for-show bread
Lil nigga, Lindsay, he got the Lohan
I put the work in like I got four hands
And I got love for a few
Respect for a couple niggas
But ain't no fear in my heart for no man
Woo! Woo! Keep my sword on me like Conan
Before the rap, I swear I was poor man
Now my cribs and shit gotta door man
Niggas stay hating like "Herbo a ho man"
"How yo gon' show man? Whatchu gon' blow, then?"
"I heard he toting his pipe everyday and he shot some before"
"What, you knew him before then?"
I heard he the realest, and he be with killers
They sound like gorillas, and ride 4 wheelers
They waving the 30s  and yellin' "No Limit!"
If you ain't with it then bitch mind your business
Got bulletproof vests, just like armadillos
I'm on the corner, with nothin' but dealers
Clinching a .40 when I'm on the block
Water whippin' my wrist when I'm under the ceiling
Guess I'm a hypocrite, 'fore I got shot
We was sending 'em out, give a fuck 'bout they feelings
And when I got shot, I was back on the block
With my crutch and my Glock, give a fuck 'bout the healing
From the start of the day to the finish we was drillin'
Guess we was mentally illing
Couldn't even stop, we allergic to chillin'
Had to wake up and think like a villain 
Now my whole thought process different
Wake up and think bout a million
Sometimes I don't talk I just listen
Can't never be nothin' I ain't missin'
Some shit you just learn on your own
I taught myself how to not go to prison
They want us to be all alone
They tryin' divide us off in divisions
Tryin' divide us by our decisions
Take advantage of our kindness so that's why I'm vicious
I seen ballers rise and fall that's why I'm ambitious
Locked in shackles or they gone, most of all my niggas
Pour out all my liquorUhh
You know I come from a city of sorrow, man
Ugly introduction, red snow
Heartaches, heartbreaks, headache, look
Growin' up it wasn't no joke, 'member all we had was hope
Nigga all we did was soak, no detergent, wasn't no soap
I caught on to my environment, I had to, I had to grow
Thought she asked if could see, but she really want some smoke
I've been stepped on, pushed over, pissed at, shot
I've been bitch slapped, only by the police with my handcuffs
I've been spit at, smell the piff' all on me, know you got it
Where that shit at?
In the back seat of the Crown, thinkin' 'bout my homie Kobe
Why you walk off from the crowd? Bro you let me down
'Member mornings, I'd call you 'til you pour me up
Even though I'm broke as fuck, bro know you never let me down
Why you let me down? 
See me countin' all these racks, you lookin' at me now
See me fuckin' off at Sak's, in and out Maybachs
Most of all ain't like these actors, lying in all they raps
Ooh I'm nothing like these rappers, lying in all they acts
I spit all the facts
I put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out it's dancing
I hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'
I had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then
I have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then
I put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancin'
I hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'
I had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then
I have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then
I'm that nigga' now, don't roll no Swishers now
I'ma spend at least 250 when I'm gettin' high
'Member drinkin' up six ounces just to get me by
I stopped sippin' on the deuce, that shit wasn't gettin' me high
Now I'm riding to the clip, jumpin' on G5's
'Member puttin' on the 15, rollin' up three fives
'Member doing shows and features, splittin' it with my guys
Stickin' to the G-code, didn't see nothin' wrong in my eyes
I looked the devil right in the eyes and saw my niggas die
Can't get caught at the light, I wrote that song and I cried
I ain't emotional, you know me, that's another joint for Kobe
Smokin' 50 grams of OG, 420 just for brodie
I'ma wish you happy b-day, tell the world to smoke the dodi
Look like everyday our birthday, Dolce, Louie, 'Sace, Balmain
Bitches wanna' tag alongside, your little hoe got all the jaw game
She want me to fuck it raw, gang, I ain't trying fuck at all, gang
I put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancing
I hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'
I had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then
I have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man then
I put some ice on my wrist, everywhere I pop out is dancing
I hit the crowd with some shit, soon as I walk out they standin'
I had to be patient for this, I'm the man now, was the man then
I have my way with a bitch, I'm the man now, was the man thenHello?
What's up?
I'm in the studio
No, hell no
No I don't got nothing
I'ma call you back, man
I'ma call you back, I'ma call you back when I leave the studio
Alright, I'ma call you back
She want shopping sprees
Oh, she want designer jeans
Oh, she want a wedding ring
Oh, she bringing anything
She give me anything
She want control of me
Oh, she want a hold on me
Oh, she want my soul from me
She tryna fuck my mind, but I don't have no time
She a scorpio
Oh, she like the devil though
Oh, but I can't let her go
She used to be my homie though
Now act like she don't know me though
And when I met her it was regular, just sex with her
I'm doing shows, but I'm still calling and still texting her
She fuck with me 'cause I stay real, no I don't flex to her
In states with different hoes but she couldn't tell when I laid next to her
But minus that she fuck with Dex, he got that check put up
He used to trap and cop them grams from a connect with her
A lil' down bitch, he think she a rider
But she think he a provider
Keep her dipped in designer
Really only fuck with dope boys, couple athletes in the lineup
Let her have the keys if you drive something
She don't let him fuck if he ain't buy her nothing
I'm MOB and I let God be my witness
Feds snatched her, she told everything, don't let 'em know your business
These bitches
She want shopping sprees
Oh, she want designer jeans
Oh, she want a wedding ring
Oh, she bringing anything
She give me anything
She want control of me
Oh, she want a hold on me
Oh, she want my soul from me
She tryna fuck my mind but I don't have no time
Say she ain't never going back to not having shit
She say she ain't gave a nigga her heart who ain't damage it
She say she can't stand niggas, she say we so scandalous
She say she can't fall in love, her heart like a mannequin
This bitch just a sack chaser, she got me panicking
Might let a nigga air me out, money all she care about
She just want a new car, she want a new bag
She don't fuck with last season, she want that new swag
She almost fooled me, I gave myself a news flash
Dex put her on Balmain, ain't even buy his ass a du-rag
When that paper dried up, that's when she moved back
These bitches ain't shit dog, I already knew that
She want jewelry, clothes, and bankrolls, and bank hoes
She just want control in your mind, in your soul
In your time, stop your grind, no more shine, no more hoes
That's a double wrong, what you focused on?
She want shopping sprees
Oh, she want designer jeans
Oh, she want a wedding ring
Oh, she bringing anything
She give me anything
She want control of me
Oh, she want a hold on me
Oh, she want my soul from me
She tryna fuck my mind but I don't have no time100 days, 100 nights

100 days, 300 nights
100 days, 300 nights
I gotta get my money right
It's hard growin' up in the struggle
Apartment buildings, low budget, I turned nothin' to somethin'
My mama lived with her mother, I grew up with my cousins
In the streets been through soo much, cause I ain't runnin' from nothin'
Lil nigga with big attitude, I'm gon' do what I gotta do
You don't know how good it feels it to throw my mom's a stack or 2
Be gone for months, come back with food and right back on that avenue
Spent years on that avenue, shed tears on that avenue
My niggas made decisions and did bids for  that avenue, free Crazy James
Go to sleep, wake up with nothin' to eat, yeah that's a crazy thing
Sometimes I think I can just blink out this crazy dream
But reality it really ain't easy as I make it seem
Lost my nigga, why they off, my nigga?
I give it all up, what it cost, my nigga?
I ain't really ever give a fuck 'bout shit, but now  I ain't ever gon' cross my niggas
Say Kobe, without you in these streets feel like I'm lost, my nigga
Shed soo many tears, make me feel weak, but I ain't soft, my nigga
100 days, 100 nights
100 days, 100 nights

We ignorant, we immigrants, we murders, we prisoners
We burglars, we hustlers, you start it off, we finish it
Like fuck this rap, I'm in this shit, it's over, cause I'm killin' it
In the trap I'm like "fuck this", but I'm right back where I finished it
I'm a fly nigga, fuck a sack up, If I like that, make it right back
For my niggas, keep my mouth closed, I'mma make bail, I'mma fight that
Free T-Slick, free Lil Bruce, free G Gill cause he ain't tell
Took 20 years with no fear, then like 4 year get no mail
Like A money might call real, know it's all bad, but he's all well
But back to me, as long as I'm alive, that's all I got to be
I swear where I’m from, I'm happy from all the years a nigga got to see
All the bread I got to make, all the hands I got to shake
I'm tryna live it up, cause sad to say, I know I got a date
But for my mama sake, I just pray that it ain't right away
I got to see her better days
All the shit I put her through still put smiles up on her face
She worried when I leave the house with them cals up on my waist
Like she she know what's goin' down
Keep one in the head cause when it rains, I know what's pourin' down
I love my block, but when they ask I say I do it for my town
And money niggas hate, but then they mad when you don't come around
My niggas know what's up if you don't then move the fuck around
Move the fuck around, fool, 'fore lil Mally buck you down
My niggas know what's up if you don't then move the fuck around
Move the fuck around

From Stony to Rainbow if you ask me goddamn it
Eastside you already know, look
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Where I witnessed all those killings at
Where I left all of my feelings at
Still be in the same hood
Post up flame woods on the 
Early ages grew up on the east
Young nigga in the hood still innocent
Buncha niggas that came up with me
Either missing them or they got sentences
Back when I used to play Sega genesis
I was born on a building on Bennett
And free my bro shorty foe like my blood
Fighting first degree murder with witnesses
Sometimes i get high and i think about what my life would be if i didn't go get this shit
If i dropped out of school and just sat on my ass and depended on niggas to get me shit
But you know that's not me that ain't nothing like me thats why niggas say they dont like me
And they know they'll get hit up if they beefin with me because there no telling where I might be
I know I gotta stay on my feet
I'm 19 and if i want to see 21 I know I gotta stay with my heat
My mama told me stay away from the east
Right back there on the 9, I think its the Essex in me
Lost my nigga rock on the 9, Pistol got hit on the 9
Lost Kobe right there on the 9, lost G Fazo right there on the 9
Fresh off a plane and I'm straight on the 9, I think its the Essex in me
I'm from where young niggas turn into killers because there ain't anything better to be
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Where I witnessed all those killings at
Where I left all of my feelings at
Still be in the same hood
Post up flame woods on the 
Caught my first pistol case over east
And i wasn't even up on the block
It was going to happen eventually
I don't leave the house without my Glock
Except for the time when i got shot
And that time I was on the block
But you know we was tottin them jocks
Rock block bitch you know how we rock
I'm thinkin the opps called the cops
Cuze right before that we got stopped
Of course all the slammers got tossed
And that shit happened on the next block
But anyways that type of shit happening anyday them people listening anyway
Reminiscing about my niggas missing G Fazo and makes me remember  them center days
But I can always got back in time anyday
Man this rap shit all make believe anyway
Man these niggas all mis-believe anyway
And these niggas are all snakes anyway
Niggas thinkin my lifestyle is cool
If I could would have stayed in school anyday
Every year all the niggas i lose
Wake up and think about that shit everyday
Jail time and I'm ducking that shit  everyday
Niggas say they going to kill me, I'm not afraid
Pistol loaded I'm tuckin that everyday
Run up on me I'm bustin it every way
And these niggas show love when you up with a smile on your face and do drugs when you up
When you down bet none of them niggas around, but fuck it I knew that shit anyway
Where I grew up so thats where you see me usually
Where every nigga from I know going shoot for me
All the shorties violent ain't no guidance
No more chiefs left in the hood, fuck who you used to be
Where I witnessed all those killings at
Where I left all of my feelings at
Still be in the same hood

Verse 1 
I remember growing up tryin get it
Gotta eat by any means, for that green I was with it
But I had to humble down I learned
Money come around now I'm tryin to raid the town
So my clips scrape the ground
If I'm riding round ima get that
Petty stains i ain't with that
Never fed in to the chit chat
Cause these fuck niggas they'll act hard til the mac spark
Leave em flatlined in the backyard thats a quick hit
Scratch the hit list
My lil niggas gone flip shit
Don't tolerate no bitch shit
Mossbergs that's 6'6 better duck from the bucks
Buck after buck, 1 leave em stuck 2 leave em slumped Throw the pumps in the trunk
Knuck if you want if he jump he a chump
Better watch how he move if he clutch he'll dump
I ain't worried bout em, I ain't taking no L's
Only heard about em cause the old heads told stories about em
And Rel just told me, Herb man fuck em up
And that's what ima do, so if you riding, man buckle up
You know its goin down, so the guys gone knuckle up
We booming on the work, so on the first they come and fuck with us
They know we got that drop, yall rocks playing double dutch
Stepped on concrete, washed out like laundry
Pharrow in the cut Dooski twisting up the blunt
And Remo in the garage and grab the ozz so we can stunt
I be getting money, keep it coming, new joints on my feet for nothing
Bitches always staring at me, trying to get a piece of something
And they can't get a piece of shit, still i make them eat the dick
I'll never be a stain, and I'm always Fazo Land so ill never be a lame
Niggas playing hard to kill, That'll never be a game cause if we catch you we doing you
Farewells at funerals, hollow tips get to chewing you
Let him see the light
Ain't no time to revive he gone rest in peace tonight
Make him fight for his life
Pussy nigga should have never brought a knife to the fight
Tell his moms her baby boy lost his life to a pipe
Thats gone break her whole heart
Have her all on the news like my bae was so smart, he should have took another route
Then she tried to testify, so we took the mother out
Bitch we grimy on the 9, we get reckless on the 8
We the reason why they got all them detectives on the 8
But we ain't snitching, so we safe
No face, no case, The rats get the whole thang
Cops snatch me up, I don't know shit but my whole name
Sweep off the 8, blow one and back to the dope game
Flip a ounce and cop a drop top whiter than cocaine
With my doe up, the strip gone blow up like propane
If we deep in the streets, we taking up both lanes
John walking with the thang
He shooting like D Gaines
Don't get it brought to your front door
Jamal on Muskegan posted up like Mutombo
Thrax packs for the low, them 7's go for the honcho
If he short, he in debt
He don't pay and leave em wet
Overtime in the trap, im tryin make this nina stretch
If you front us for a dime, put some ether in his neck
Maintenace man hate the block, cause we always leave a mess
And they call us hotboyz, but we always leave em wet
And the ops don't come outside cause they always need a vest
I'm on the Ave. all night, so i always needa rest
I got a couple of keys to stretch
So my trap on D's and F's
My niggas on they P's and Q's out here wilding squeezing Tecs
And my bitches fiend for sex cause i leave em steaming wet
Lets get it man Fazoland
Roc Bloc Vito City, be real
Nothing, welcome to Fazoland the mixtape, L'sScared I wasn't gon' make it home some nights
Wondering, "Am I gon' be a homicide?"
Kill you quick if I decide
Crazy, guess I get that from my mama side
Niggas beef with us, don't even come outside
30 in the Glock, I keep that on my side
Ain't no questioning, my nigga, I'ma ride 
Out there like some monkey bars, I'ma slide
I know one day I'ma die
Made some millions for my son so I'm a'ight
And I'm in that Bentley truck that's parked right outside
I know one day I'ma die, but right now I'm alive
Need a Purple Heart for the shit that I survived
Better be alert if ever you and I collide
And I ain't limiting myself to shit, I gotta strive
It look like a light show when I arrive 
Straight up out the trenches
Had to squeeze that bitch least one time
Me and all my niggas
We was young and dumb, I ain't know how to fucking listen
So pay attention, hopefully I get to teach you different
All you young niggas wild 'til you meet the district
He ain't even get due process and this nigga snitching
Get around a nigga like me and they turn bitches
He ain't never did no street shit, I see through him instantly
Gotta take everything come with this shit, you gon' be like that
Gotta have that bail money, gotta be ready to fight that
Blood ties with my niggas, I got shot with Project
Mally, he was with me, too, but we did dirt on top of that
My left pocket, wasn't no phone in it, my baby Glock in there
Summer Jam in front of 20,000, I wish Roc was there
Seen't you in there witcho bop, you know I got the top from her
Anyway, that's off the topic
We talking 'bout them blocks, shootouts, and Glocks
And what about the opps?
Shit, what 'bout the opps?
Shit, what 'bout they bops?
What pop out they top?
Gang, you know how we rock
In clubs, am I not?
At shows, am I not?
Iced up, am I not?
Amiri's with knots
I ain't hard to find
All you gotta do is apply
I'm ready when you are
Riding back to back, two blacks, we like the mini bar
Lotta shots, keep one up top, send them bitches at any car
Ayy, ayy
And I'm on the E-way like Andretti, my new car
Loaded like I'm ready for Armageddon
Boy, I came too far to let a nigga take me out this shit, now he a star
Nigga make me a block
Nigga make me a bar
I'm all in his raps, smokin' me in his cigar
I know a nigga so cold, he shoot at the opps out his sister car
And it's over a bitch, your life ain't worth that pussy boy
Know you been getting played out all yo life, you pussy boy
2Pac told you first, "I ain't no killer, but don't push me", boy
So don't push me, boy
You know I'm gon' pull it boy
Here go a bullet, I ain't a bully
My auto fully
I rep that No Limit shit to the fullest
Hop out in public, I'm thinking 'bout leaving the blick out
I'ma tote my lil' shit in a hoodie
Came up from nothing, I still can't believe I'm legit
Everywhere I go I'm the shit
Been out here swaggin' like I'm that nigga ever since I was six
Ain't gotta ask a nigga for shit 'cause I'm fucking rich
Ain't nobody give me nothing
Want a handout? Suck a dick
Bitch
SouthsideGang!
Y'all ain't heard that in a minute
Huh?
I said I wasn't gonna do no more 4 Minutes Of Hell's, man
This gotta be it, though
This the last one
I'm from the jungle, lions, apes and gorillas
Lions the police, nigga we the apes and gorillas
Go ape and gorilla
Boy, don't turn your face on a killer
Fuck the system, man, we going back to racism, nigga
Look, the department suffer fake-ism, nigga
Black police try not to notice, like they ain't killing niggas and hate killing niggas
Seen a million bodies, I done shed a thousand tears
Niggas just turn thousandaires, been selling rocks a thousand years
Two time felon nigga, one more like a thousand years
And the average pussy nigga out here ain't gone ride with his
He gon' switch up, he gon' fold, he ain't holdin' shit back
He only got a year back and now he can't forget that
You done sold your fucking soul for 400 days
Niggas got their kid starving for some fucking J's
Life too short, better not get caught up in your fucking ways
I be feeling like Phil Jackson, all these fucking plays
I'm just riding through my city, getting blazed, in the rain
I been stressing, feel like I'm a couple days from insane
Don't know what's got into me, I just been saving the pain
The devil tryna' enter me, I just might let him into me
But I know when he finna' leave that that's gon' be the end of me
And I won't let that finish me, 'cause I got too much energy
I be right back in effect like I just got a injury
Pourin' up that purple happiness, it give me energy
Sip your happiness, forget your problems; that's the remedy
Sippin' Activis straight out the bottle, shit's so good to me
I be leanin', I be smoking, poppin' beans then I be rollin'
Hop in steamers and we rollin, hop in Beamers and we rollin'
Pull up on your block with glizzies and them beams and we be blowin'
We ain't shooting for no reason, clear the scene when we blowin'
Then we high, in the sky, tellin' fo'nem 'bout the story
Got a lot of niggas gone that I been knowin' since we was shorties
That alone just made me stronger, got my chrome though I ain't worried, boy
Posted on that curb, boy, early off the syrup, boy
Chill, if you don't know me, give a fuck 'bout what you heard, boy
Niggas see me when I fly past like, "There go Herb, boy!"
Rappers wanna know the way that I play with the words, boy
33 up in the clip like I play with that Bird, boy
And niggas know that Lil Bibby my bro, got the shit for the low on the birds, boy
Real nigga shit, we ten year niggas, bitch, so imagine the numbers  for Herb, boy
And we go ham every month on the first, junky walk up and just empty her purse
Don’t work with feelings, my money come first
And no, I'm not a hypocrite so therefore, I don't go to a church
God still with me even though I'm out here doing my dirt
It's a lot of times when I know I coulda been threw in a hearse
So I'm dropping 4s in my soda every time I'm through with a verse
Please do not try to act crazy my nigga cause rugers'll burst
They ready, they on it, they aiming at niggas, my shooters so thirst
G Herbo my name, so a pussy, I can't be
I hang with them menaces, free Jamaes and free Maneski
If it was still slavery, I know the mastas' a hang me
Cause I only respect my momma and granny and aunties
I'm just a young nigga, from the 'go finna blow
And I'm still in the streets, so you know I will take blow for a show
Just let me know, as long as don't nobody search at the door, cause you know how we roll
If anyone try to act like they want smoke, then the club will be closed

You know, this a letter to my son
I had to write off the pad 'cause I done broke my phone
I ain't even gon' get another one honestly
I don't even care 'bout that type of stuff no more
That's slow stuff, it don't even matter
I got a shorty on the way so
I gotta change my ways
Might as well start to watch what I say
I grew up a bad example
Lately I can't smoke where I lay
I don't wanna set bad examples
All good, ain't no smoke with my lady
We at peace in the house burning sages
She just walking around saying prayers
In a few months, you'll be here in April
Brand new room for you, right now we making it
Even though I know you'll never stay in it
On the 48th floor where we staying at, that's just my lil' way of saying we making it
Daddy still gotta go hard to stay with it
Family all out of harm's way, we safe with it
Don't spend no more, lock the safe up, we saving it
Just so you straight, ain't it
I give you all that I can
Teach you all of the things that I learned on my own, but they minee me a man
You ain't gotta grow up in the streets like I did, I lost the bestest of friends
I did make sacrifices for them
I did everything for everybody but myself and I felt like less of a man
Ain't gotta tote gats on Essex again
Lord sent a blessing, amen
Mama ain't stressing, amen
Put family first as long they do the best that they can
Just watch for the snakes, everybody that hate, wanna smile in yo face and watch what you make
Just 'cause you born great, in the womb eating steak
Car seats in the Wraith and estates
Yeah, I bought yo mama a Range, 90K
I bought my mama a Benz, 60K
Just got pulled over in that Bentley today
Police trying to talk to me, ain't nothing to say, ay
I was just brought up that way
My dad taught me that at a very young age
Say, I want my lawyer today
Say, I want my father today 
Everyday saw my Dad I was still on that A
Rebelled on my father, dived in that water
He instilled fear in me everyday
The more older I got, the less I did what he say
Ain't trying to teach you that way
I ain't trying to beat you I ain't, I'm gonna give you the game
Can't wait to see your lil face and meet you
I love you, you came from the blood of my vein
Give you food out my belly, clothes off my back
Plan your whole future I spend every stack
Hustle to get every bag, hustler, when you of age I'll tell you 'bout that
Just so you can understand my life
I got tired of wrong and started doing what's right
Ain't no more pouring codeine in my sprite
And now I'm just up until 6 every night
No question, for you I'ma ride
Play with my kid, homicide
All that bullshit to the side
I'ma be there 'til I die
And when I die, I'ma still be right there with you, just hold your head to the sky
All you see red in mine
But it won't be no pain in your eyes
That's why I'm here to wash away your cries
G-Fazos in every size
My lil niggas swag gotta match mine
Baby, rollie time if I'm shining, then you shine
Daddy on the grind, ain't gon be there all the time
Make your Momma happy, I don't see mine all the time
Things people say I don't believe all the time
That's cause someone using me all the time
Only people I put my trust in is mine
Only people I'm stuck with is mine
And I only got money for mine
It ain't too much my money can't buy
My limit's the sky, this like a letter to mine
You ain't gotta come up and make all those stupid decisions like I
Ain't gotta thug to survive
I sold drugs to survive
Hurt some of my love ones, I lied
Me and my big cousin is fine
Still holding grudges in mind
Life too short son, just take your losses and ride
Life super short, son I'm just happy I'm alive
Yeah
It's crazy man, I'm finna have my first born son
You know we only raise young kings and queens, ya know what I'm saying
Gotta bring my son up how I was raised even better times 10

Wake up thinking feeling on some lil herb shit you know no limit
R.I.P them niggas man Vonny, Slim, Wet Mouth , One Eye, Chico, Vito
I seen Kobe die that was my young nigga, he was laying front McDonalds​ with them slugs in him
I had blood all on my nike's wasn't no blood in him
Couldn't handle it but that wasn't like me crying rip my white tee
But I'm balling now just like em oou i'm lit i'm icy
VVS can't clear this stress I need my bros beside me
7 am rollin riding me and my bros was sliding
No deciding homicide him, all them niggas hiding
Can't show love in these streets you get your feeling hurt
Put your trust in these niggas that got my nigga murked
Lil Roc was with me in this shit but now he in the dirt
Cap was with me hitting niggas they just hit him worse, why they get him first
And earlier that day we just was talking, how the fuck you let a nigga catch you walking, why you ain't have that missile up and spark it
How you go out right infront of Squeek apartment
When I look in Wop eyes its like he lost it, I look at Lil Mike eyes he really lost it
In these streets so much he look exhausted, and if he need anything I tell him call me
I can't forget about Big Losk thats like forgetting Mally
I was driving cars stolen tryna get with Mally
Now I'm riding Rovers,Royces tryna get with Mally
Lil No Limit Mally thats my dawgy
And I rap about the struggle cause thats all me
I remember shooting niggas all week, standing over niggas catching all B's
Trying to fill a bag up like I'm Aldi's
And no wonder niggas gettin called sweet
Slim, Wet, One Eye bitch them all G's
Pull up on his block we shooting all three's
If its 3 niggas standing we want all 3My momma used to say, "Never quit, baby that just don't exist!"
And just cause she'll suck ya dick, don't mean you could trust the bitch!
I'm just giving you the real
Cause I don't come from Hollywood or Beverly Hills
I'm from where mothers don't care and babies get killed
Where you gotta rob and go steal for stomachs to fill
And it's hard for a young, black nigga like myself
Where the police compare oneself with everybody else
So that means if you yourself they think you're everybody else
So I don't care 'bout no one else
Just my family and myself
Yeah, that's just my way of thinkin'
In my city and it helps cause no one gives a fuck
About me, you, or nobody else
And it's cool
I'm still livin' over East
We still chillin', sippin' lean
Smokin' swishas, stackin' hunnits to the ceilin'
We still winnin'
We just fightin' to survive
It's a shame I gotta ride with this nina on my side
They used to say...
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
Lil Herb, I'm the actual
Hottest young nigga comin' out the murder capital
Spit lyrics that when real niggas hear it they just capture you
But don't let it capture you
They like, "Fuck who went before you, who the hottest after you?"
That actual answer is unanswerable
Haters try to answer, but who the fuck was askin' you?
And it's true, I'm the truth
I just grind, no excuse
And broke niggas I won't stoop to a level low as you
I gotta get it, I ain't down with it
All the shit I did, I can't slip
So I'm dying with it
Any nigga try and get it!
They try to be with it
See me? I gotta be with it!
Won't ever leave my squad, but I can't put my family in it
My family in it, can't confuse family with business
NO LIMIT MB, we'll fuck ya family nigga
It's family dinner, break bread everyday
Pray my circle never break
And I can hear my momma say, "Look..."
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give inI don't even wanna
Southside
Gang shit
Gang gang
8-8-8-8...
It's five in the morning in this bitch
Can't believe I made it
Used to wake up get faded
This Hollywood shit was foreign to me like I just hopped off the slave ship
These niggas signing two million dollars, 360 deals
Getting on some slave shit
Popped out on the opps with the Glock in my hand like, "fuck it"
I was on some brave shit
Me and lil' bro hop out, blaze shit
We ain't need no special occasion
Now I go do two shows and come home with 80, this shit brazy
This street shit out here changing
Niggas signing affidavits
Want beef with me?
I'm supposed to be a street nigga, street nigga how I played it
I was on the block daily, 'fore I got famous
77th to 79th, Yates to Kingston, it was all Rangers
8 A.M. we up, on the way to target practice, them was our ranges
Them lil' No Limit niggas, stay away from em, they ass dangerous
They don't need no anger, they'll kill a stranger aim
We ain't shoot from no angle, put that bitch in your brain, boy
Bang, boy
Gang gang, boy
Exotic pack, new thing boy
It's going down in Illinois
Them boys shooting like Villanova
Ballin' like Kobe
Herbo, what you do?
Get bored, hit Saks, spend 24
Swervo, why you ain't got no feelings? 'Cause I'm gangsta to the core
Perc' 30 make me fuck 'til she sore
Gotta go get a Plan B from the store
'Cause I just had a lil' boy, closet got more Gucci drip than yours
Keep at least a lil' 50 ball in the drawer
Withdraw 100, deposit 4
Ain't gotta look over my shoulder no more
We went way, way up on the score
My crib way, way up on the floor
Like 50 of them bitches above yours
And I get right off the plane, hop in the foreign, bonjour
Pull up in a foreign, bonjour
Who got a Bentley sprinter? I'ma take that bitch on tour
Who got a new Draco? I'ma take that bitch on tour
Just got a brand new money counter, I'ma take that bitch for sure
They tryna ride my wave, they gon' take that bitch to shore
I'm living thug life like 2Pac Shakur
Swervo, you always rap about 2Pac Shakur
See you in the black Benz, I hope you got that Glock in yours
Niggas ain't taking care of business, you on top of yours
These hoes fucking up they paper, they ain't stopping yours
Bought a portable studio, I'ma take that bitch on tour
Everybody claiming they in they bag, when you gon' hop in yours?
Oh you in the Jag'? I ride G12
Fuck is that, a Ford?
Laughing at the rear view, high speed with the Jakes
Fuck is that, a Ford?
Soon as we jumped on the E-way, they ain't even wanna chase no more
But I ain't been to the hood, they don't see my face no more
This shit got way too good to be true, I wasn't fighting the case no more
Fuck would you do? Chiraq ain't safe no more
Lost Cap, I can't holla at my ace no more
Mad zips to the face no more
Had Porsches and  straight did dirt out accords, switch whips, hit Lakeshore
Seen what happened to that boy, I had to pour a four
Deuces wasn't doing shit for me no more, I had to pour a four
Sodas and juices wasn't doing shit for me no more, I had to pour up raw
That shit get the best of me and I be riding snoring
Wake up, think 'bout my dawgs
Next thing I know I'm dropping some more
I was 18, riding foreigns, bonjour
Fucking cougars, would've tried to put this dick in some more
Still was fucking bitches my age, might've put dick in your daughter
Some days was broke as fuck
No homo, had my dick in the floor
Had to get shit in order
30 in the Ruger clip, I wish that bitch had some more in there
VV's in the Dweller, look like I hit that bitch in some water
BD, GD, Stone, whatever
Get some money, 'cause I ain't have a quarter
Long Live that nigga Zack TV, heard he had a daughter
The police here ain't solving murders, this ain't Law & Order
Southside
8-8-8-8...Look, once upon a time around the Southside
A young black man grew up in a house
Had a pops he never knew, with a mom that's strung out
His granny careless just about, say he'll never make it out
Of the hood and had a handful of aunties that can vouch
Young nigga named Malcolm, all his homies called him Malc'
His big brother off in college, Malcolm took another route
From gang banging, 'caine slanging, moms threw him out the house
Stuck on probation, on and off since thirteen, been in and out
Soon as he turned seventeen, shit got super wild
Still a juvenile, he just totin' Rugers now
He shootin' now, streets got him, Malcolm ruthless now
Mom still gettin' higher than a motherfucker
Malcolm used to cry at night, shit a motherfucker
Ask hisself why every time he lie at night
Sometimes he even pray to God and wish he die at night
He grown now, had to get it on his own and
He know nobody gon' be there when he alone and
So fuck it, he just gon' continue doing wrong then
One day he woke up, left the house and he forgot it
But somethin' inside told him "Malc', don't leave the ratchet"
But he ain't worried, he been lettin' niggas have it
All his life he been bangin', stealin', robbin'
Killin', livin' heartless, foolish, Godless
Stop to get some swishers from the supermarket
Usually leave the car in neutral but he parked it
Looked in his rearview, two niggas, black Charger
Black hoodies, black masks, black carbons
He know it's over, try to duck, they start sparkin'
Shells poppin' everywhere, Malc' get out of there
He goin' crazy 'cause he knew it, Malc' gon' fire
Car hit up, windows out but that was minor
Perfect setting, it just wasn't Malcolm's time yet
Rush in the house, yell out to moms, "Where my iron at?"
And now he gettin' high, don't know where his mind at
Niggas was masked up, he don't know where to find 'em
Was getting out and he ain't know who was behind him
But when he catch a nigga slippin', gon' remind 'em
Two weeks later, Malc' right back in that action
Whip fixed, new tints, painted, slidin'
Malc' ridin, late night, 'round three somethin'
A youngin focused, he just lookin' and he peeped somethin'
Charger parked, car on, he see the heat runnin'
Bitch hop in the passenger, he tryna freak somethin'
Malcolm ready, his adrenaline just keep rushin'
But he ain't buggin', he don't want homie to see him comin'
He gon' wait cause when he run up, he ain't leavin' nothin'
Fuck around and hit the bitch up, he ain't even bluffin'
Look what Malcolm got now, yeah this his lucky day
He on a mission, watch the Charger pull off right away
Sweet as fuck, nigga pull right up to where he stay
Ain't even watching, Malcolm trail a nigga all the way
He super geeked, been tryna catch some action all the day
Charger pullin' in, parking in the driveway
Malcolm parked some houses down, he finna violate
But somethin' tell him "Malc', you might as well go all the way
You came this far, before you spark them, might as well rob him"
Walked him right into the safe, it was a piece of cake
Gave him 300K and Malcolm blew his face away
Ain't give a fuck, that nigga up, he gave that bitch a break
But feds watch the whole thing while they investigate
They had surveillance on a nigga's house since yesterday
Malc' runnin' out the back door with the cheese
K's pointed in his face, "Don't move, freeze!"
His mind racing, "Run, throw the gun, shoot, squeeze"
But Malcolm came right to his senses, got down on his knees
The saddest thing about life it keep revolving
Same story, different niggas, same apartments
Same gutter, same group of people starving
Malcolm could've stayed in school and got a job though
But this was all that Malcolm knew, he from Chicago
Compare and contrast if Malcolm's from a rich town
His whole life was planned out since he was six pounds
Let me break it to a core so you can focus more
At the age he started puberty, he was smoking weed
His eighth grade graduation, he was toting heat
His freshman year of high school, he was posted 
Before he saw his senior year, his life was over 
Over, it's over
It's over, overMe and bro just left the store, we ain't leave the Versace store
Squad
This ice got me rocky like I'm 'lluminati without no Versace 
I don't rock Versace, but don't get me wrong if I did I could cop it 
I stay in designer, my shirt by Givenchy all white like I'm Gotti 
You know I get money, I run through them hundreds and no one can stop me 
Bitch it's Lil Herbie, I think I'm the hottest I'm just bein' honest 
I want it I cop it, that's why yo bitch on me man tell her to stop it 
These niggas keep screaming Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace 
No wonder I'm cocky, Versace shit barely cost more than my Robins 
You bros must be stupid this Louis this Gucci you know I been doin' this 
I'm broke man that's Ludacris I stunt so much I can go and buy you some shit 
Mixtape in the making and I got some old shit as well as my newest shit 
Nobody fucking with Herb I'm the best if I rap bout stupid shit 
But back to the basics catch me on the 8 with them racks in my truey fit 
Got a mac and a ruger clip, naw this ain't rap man I really been through some shit 
R.I.P C-Moe and Peewee I just lost the guys to some stupid shit 
The opps started scoring they must be getting lucky I swear all they do is miss

I'm trying to get all my niggas up outta here first class on some movie shit 
Might grab me an Audi with all of these thousands, don't know what to do with it 
Got so many killers with 30s act stupid ain't no tellin' who shootin' shit 
No Limit 150 the squad, new niggas no we not recruitin' 'em 
No Limit 150 go hard, without them I might not be doin' shit 
My broskies they savage 50s in the ratchet right through you can have it 
Might drop us a body the police start snatchin', I swear I forgot it 
They ask me some questions bout opps I'm like fuck em them niggas some faggots 
My niggas they savage, hit yo bitch from the back send her cause she average 
Just know I ain't talkin' bout soul food, but you can get whacked for that cabbage 
All this dough, gotta have it, bitch I had cash way before I was rappin'
Way before I was snappin' don't know what happen but bro 'nem was trappin' 
In the field ain't no lackin' and maxi a savage be safe cause he packin' 
Moody, Lil Mally n' Rammo in traffic with four automatics 
Lil Mally he smaller than average but bet he can hold up that ratchet 
He gon' drop ya just as fast as them Migos be sayin' Versace 
Lil Mallys gon' pop 'em, Versace, Versace, Versace, Versace 
And then we not stoppin', puttin' bodies on bodies on bodies on bodies 
My Mom say she pray everyday, that I'm safe and she always ask god that he watch me 
But I still keep that rocket
Cause they plottin' and angels ain't always gon' watch me 
And they wanna drop me, but still gotta get it can't worry bout shit but my wallet 
No I'm on a mission if you ain't 150 the please stay the fuck out my business 
I'm all bout my digits came from the bottom of bottoms let god be my witness 
Niggas hate how I'm spittin', only the realest can feel it just shut up and listen 
Y'all money been missin'
Labels start talkin' them millis feel free to come get me 
But today I'm still chillin, smoking dutches and phillys and fuckin' these bitches 
Bitch you suck dick who you kissin' yo' bitch next to me and she bout to come missin' Look... My squad!
Do this shit for my momma and my lil' sister, man...
All my niggas man...
Everybody I lost...
Let me introduce myself
It's G Herbo, I'm that youngin'
I be flexin', I love stuntin'
Cause I grinded up from nothin'
I grew up in an apartment
Wit' my grandma and my mother
And my sister and my auntie
So my cousins like my brothers
Used to stay up in that basement
It was dark just like the dungeon
Close my eyes, pretend I'm rich
Wit' all the cars and all the money
Now I let my money talk
'Til I decide to change the subject
Make my bitch order my food
Cause I ain't tryna wait in public
Used to post up wit' that tool
I got tired of goin' to school
Cause that calculus and algebra
Wouldn't buy my clothes and shoes
Wasn't tryna wait to graduate
Yeah they said I was a fool
Now they screamin' out my name
And they sayin' that I'm the truth
Bitches suckin' on demand
Take second looks like, "Is it you?"
Used to be broke, got off my ass
Got to some cash, wasn't no excuse
Cause where I'm from, you dead broke
Or you just dead
1 of the 2
You better choose before the wrong one choose you
Nigga...
On the road doing shows, but it's still fucked up
I'm gettin' older Lord knows, that it's still fucked up
Yeah everybody know my name, but it's still fucked up
On the road to the fortune and the fame, but it's still fucked up
Everyday I wake, say hey to my mother
Flame me a blunt up
Give a couple words to my sister
Bang wit' my brothers
Young boy, I left the house
That block was my home
Couple homies, now they gone
Yeah, it feel like I'm alone
And I pray that I stay strong
So I gotta keep it right here
Grippin' on this heat
I can't sleep, it's a nightmare
I know it's gon' get betta
So I gotta keep my head up
I'm just sprintin' to this cheddar
And a switch up I will never
Gotta ride, I'll die for my niggas
No homo, yeah I miss 'em
Couple fucked up in the system
Or got bucked up by that trigger
In the field
Where it's real and you'll get killed
Roc and Kobe was my niggas
How the fuck I'm gon' forget 'em
In the streets I understand that it's a chance
That they might get the upper-hand
But I'm like still them was my mans
We can't go like that
Something gotta give
Cause every time tho we gon' go right back
To sittin', sheddin' tears
That ain't gon' never bring my bro right back
Damn...G Herbo, young nigga been through it all man, everything under the sun man. I do this shit for everybody that come from the struggle man, the gutter, what I come from man. That can relate to my struggle and everything I've been through and what I put in to get to where I'm at. Cause this shit for who it for
Roaches, rats, and apartments
Mama smoking, babies starving
Pistols loaded, discharging
I grew up in all of it
Ghetto, hell, slums, bottom, what you wanna call it?
Nobody role models, everybody alcoholics
The shorties either gang banging or they basketballing
Where niggas get left slain, stinking, cause they chain swangin'
And them kids won't see they moms again cause homie ain't aiming
Damn the streets changing
These lil niggas dangerous
Don't even mask up no more, these lil niggas brainless
I got so many fallen loved ones, nigga out here painless
Don't know when it's my time to go, I keep that I'ma flame it
Wanna see me dead or broke, I know I need that motivation
Like if I blow my shot, lose everything I got
Put my hand out on that block
Become everything I'm not
Been through that life, I blew that check, lost everything I had
This shit just left me looking silly and my mama sad
No nigga never gave me shit when I was down bad
I was by myself in a 6 foot room, right there on my ass
And now I stack that shit and mean it like I'm on my last
I stay so low from fuck niggas like they on my ass
You know if I don't fuck with you, better not cross my path
Niggas thinking sweet ain't seen me in the streets, I've been in my bag
Better stay lowkey but I can't wait to let 'em feel my wrath
Still trained to go, start doing backstrokes in the bloodbath
You wake up, flame up, pop up, post up, chill, don't clap folks crack jokes
Still lakeside killers for white folks
Fuck the whole 75th, RIP black though
Started gettin' real money, I was 17, I'm 20 now, I'ma take it way back though
Fourth grade I was tryna be Ivo', shooting ball, playing round, singing rap notes
Grammar school shit been throwing Ls up
Never knew what we all headed out for
Young niggas having real life shootouts
At my grandma house, had to move out
Started rapping, wasn't tryna be a star
I was speaking what I live, what I knew bout
17, had labels tryna sign me
Thought I might as well speak so I flew out
Flew back, had to see what I was worth
Hit studio, I know what I'ma do now
Meanwhile tryna make it in a war zone
Matter of fact, let me hold that thought
My city know, I ain't even gotta talk
Pull up, hop out, white chalk
Now you see me, smell money when I walk
Humble with it no I ain't tryna floss
Every real street nigga took a loss
Took a few, bounce back, shake it off
Had an X by my name, took it off
150 Dream Team, I'm the boss
I came from gambling, toting, rolling stolen transportation
Police station
Look at me now, tell me congratulations
I got this shit straight out the mud, yeah no exaggeration
I just been focused lately, money got my mind on greatness
Can't stop my grind for niggas, bitches, extra aggravation
And every nigga can't be with me, I just gotta face it
Every nigga ain't yo' nigga, read they bodies 
Don't fuck with snitches, bitch niggas catch them bodies cases
Gotta leave my city, too much talent, catch a body, waste it
Get homesick, I'm right back, where that pipe at?
Same shit, snap right back, yeah it's like that
The murder capital, everyday welcome to Chiraq
Born and raised, homicide on the morning day
Red tape, mama's crying, it's just the morning, wait
Bodies drop here probably more than babies born a day
Son and daughters dying, all the families torn away
The whole judicial system set to have you going away
This just my life, I spit the shit that I was born to say
Love or hate me, niggas bite me, bitches wanna date me
Say they ain't groupies, they just like me, wanna have my baby
Tryna trap me, be my wifey, bitch you must be crazy
Bullshit and problems just come my way on the daily
Till I'm like fuck all that shit and just keep getting paper
More money, all this paper, solve all the problems later
They say more money then more problems, I want all the paper
The problems come along regardless, what solve problems? PaperThis Gucci, this Louie, these Fendi, these Robin, Givenchy, and Truey fits

Better watch how you act cuz the mac'll go BRATTT and they can't bring you back
Now its after the fact
Put the mac in the trunk while we smoke and relax
While I thumb thru these racks
Man I just spent a stack on a belt and a hat
Never thought I'd see the day I go from State to State and I fuck all these hoes on my way
Never thought I'd be that nigga every time I step out I got all these hoes in my face
But fuck all these bitches
All I know is get these digits and flex
And stay real with my niggas
Kill for my niggas
Max been gettin money, but believe his finger still on the trigga

Look
1995, Fall night, October 8th
Most people would say a star was born but nah, that's when I was born
And I wasn't born a star, nigga I wasn't born on top
I remember walking cold from school when mom's ain't had no car
Me my cousins 6 deep, walkin back to grannies spot
School in another district so that's like 11 blocks
And on that walk is shooters, niggas sellin rocks and hella cops
Fast forward 10 years later and that shit ain't never stopped
I became a product, all my niggas sellin' products
Growin up they want them dolla's
Birthdays without no fathers
And i had my dad so i couldn't really understand they pain
You don't even see his face but you got that nigga name
And my problem with my pops is we don't communicate
I see his face all the time but its just hi and bye
He know I love him, thats my nigga, I ain't gotta lie
But you can't give a bird his wings and teach him how to fly
I'm hard body, heavy thinker, Imma handle mine
He taught me that, I'll give him that, yeah Imma handle mine
And nigga I was 16, livin like a grown man
Never needed nobody, nigga I'm my own man
And my momma loved me for it, she would tell me she proud of me
I always had it in me, she like how I brought it out of me
She stay right by my side, back when everybody doubted me
And thought i would end up in the pen or the county see
But now I'm in a penthouse suite on the balcony
I used to think a million was for everybody, you gonna grow up and have a house, that life for everybody
But wait 1 rich person can't take care of everybody 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
Man I used to post up, early morning, soon as I woke up
Went to sleep at 4 something, used to skip breakfast, swishers and doughnuts
With the same niggas, everyday the same shit 
War with the same suckers
Fuckin' on the same bitches
Then a thought came to my head sayin you gotta expand
You passed the ball enough, it's time to keep the rock in your hand
I know all the pressure like you got the block in your hands
Can't forget about them, yeah I know Rock was your mans
But can't forget your sister, mother, brother, pops and your grans
Don't owe nobody shit the lifestyle come after the fam
And Never Leave My Brothers thats for life, the block is my fam, damn
Who I sacrificing for? The block of my fam?
But anyways i miss my niggas
So thats why I'm getting twisted, I don't sip the liquor
I'm just high pouring sixes and I'm ridin' with my 45
Cuz I ain't tryin' to end up victim of a homicide
Not my momma crying
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
Understand that I can relate to everything that you sayin', because I grew up just like you
It was me and my lil brother, pops, OG, and momas too
My grandfather, one auntie, two uncles and their childrens too
All them people under one roof, but we took that and we made do
Back in the day my folks had cake so people thought that we was on
But truth be told shit more than half of that was gone before I was born
Three years old thats when moms and pops relationship was torn
Them not fuckin' with each other made me father my lil brothers
From the city to the burbs we was goin back and forth
So I was in and out of schools, lived everywhere but West and North
Eatin' pork and beans and noodles not by choice but more so force
Til one day I told myself I can't continue on the course
Now lets speed it up, 2005 I came back to the hood
Started hustlin' lil packs and everything was goin' good
Plus I had my own gun so I wished a nigga would
Try to take anything from me, I'd have left him where he stood
I grew out that state of mind, the games I was playing was kiddy
Yeah here comes 2009 all I hear is you and Bibby
I had faith in y'all but who'd have thought you'd take over the city
Used to think y'all forgot about or just wasn't fuckin' with me
I was rappin' at the time, but y'all was puttin in that work
And shit I ain't even gonna lie, when you took off shit I was hurt
Cuz I expected a handout, that's where I fucked up first
But I thank y'all cuz y'all the reason I go cray on every verse
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain 
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave 
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave 
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave 
I just wanna smile, I just wanna ball
I just wanna do it all, I just wanna leave 
The world is filled with pain
The world is filled with pain
I know you fell me, you got to feel me, please feel me
The world is filled with pain 
The world is filled with pain G Herbo.... G HERBO!!

And when I went broke, I saw my last
I dont know what to say
I didn't do no crying, got off my ass, ran up a 100K
I had that money running laps like I'm late
Them packs were outta town, I don't remember her name
By the time my 18th birthday I was up a 100K
Rubber band up at my momma house
I don't have no fucking bank
I remember my sophomore high school teacher said what I couldn't make
She made like 24 a year, my Bezel 38 
Niggas know that I been havin' shit
Know that I've been havin' shit
Blow a hunnid K, on a habit bitch
Waitin' for a nigga to try some shit
Niggas know that I've been savage bitch
A hunnid shot can in my mattress
I been gettin' hoes, riding foreigns
And countin' all this dough, cause I been tourin'
Like 20, 30 shows, just got some more rich
Count up and count some more, it's never boring2012 I started getting money, I was like 16 going on 17. 50 in my face  touch. That was an important period in my life cause it made me what I am now. I'm just having fun, getting fresh air,  up, I spent that shit
Look I won a race, 100 miles and running
They was stopping, I ain't jog or nothing
I ain't lag or nothing
I was 20 laps ahead of y'all, I ain't brag or nothing
Gang rooting, under pressure, I ain't let them down or nothing
Everybody got they cameras, hand me a towel or something
All my hard work, all them days in
Y'all know where I started
All them late nights going retarded
Running with the wildest youngings
Smelling like 1000 onions
Damn that shit don't count for nothing
When I told 'em I was coming
They just thought that was I bluffing
Now my fans out overseas pay me 20 thou to touch 'em
Pretty ladies, yeah I love 'em
Come backstage, they let me fuck 'em
Free Of Charge don't owe her nothing
I was rushing, I was getting ready
Make her hold my luggage
Met her once, she let me fuck her twice
She know I might fuck up her life
Too lit to have a fucking wife
She fine enough to wife tonight, so fuck it
She can board her flight
Love Ruth Chris might get her something to go, I guess I'm sorta nice
Never been on dates, I risked my life
She see me blowing this pipe
Baby I'm not regular, no I'm not your average dude
I grew up a hard knock, that's not up my avenue
Gotta move something like the president
Can't leave no trace or evidence
Or location, if I'm there too long I gotta move
Fuck it, you just stay right here cause I don't like your attitude
Big G Herbo, don't leave the G out when you say Herbo
Never leave the G out
Glock on me every day I leave out
Only way I be out, niggas know what we bout
Condos downtown, cribs in the suburbs, finna cop a beach house
Gold on everywhere, foreign whips everywhere, pull up skrt out
And I got more coming, got another tape dropping
Got another tour coming, yeah I made more money
Finna do more stunting, 120 lane switching, still ain't push the sports button
Back to the program, niggas hating but they whores love me
Still getting tour money
15 for a 16 so yeah, it mean a 8 like 4 something
Put a couple little racks in the old school but it still ain't running like the Porsche running
Remember yelling 47 with the torch running
Hittin cuts on the ops block
Lakeside pistol run up on the porch gunning
All my niggas all about money
In the middle of the war hustling
Hustle homies and you know it touch us
Shut the whole block down, no more hustling
Start all the wheels up, load the steel up
Everybody on the team tryna score something
Flat on the ra-ra, they on high-high, rolled up out in traffic, dropped four or something
Yeah, them killers like Jon-Jon
But we ain’t going out sweet, no, cops dying
That means ain't no cops killing us
Ain't no ops killing us
Some say I might sound cocky
Some say I might sound scary
But I know that I'm gon' get home where I'm from that's slim chance very
Where I'm from shit get scary, niggas get buried
Riding up on your block, bloody mary
Don't you double dare me
I'm from the Eastside of Chicago
I'm Gucci where I go
Niggas know me where I go
I'm an OG where I go
You can't help what you born with
But it's on you if you die broke
If I die before I wake
Have a party when I go
20 Rollies in a roll  if I wake before I goGoin' hard for my niggas that's all I got
Man whatever mine is yours that's all I got
And all I know is the hood that's all I got
That's on everything I love that's all I got

Young nigga always on that gang bang shit
Bag it up, slang piff, different day same shit
This fame shit came quick, but I can't switch
They try to come and change shit but I remain this
Real nigga from the start to the finish
All my whips are tinted, and all my niggas winnin'
Yeah, you could tell the difference, i'm the realest in it
Don't make me call them killers get you gone in a minute

All I count is bands, tryna touch an M
When I touch an M, touch an M again
Niggas come around like some immigrants
Ain't no new niggas don't remember him
Who is you nigga you ain't cool nigga
You ain't shoot nigga, just a few niggas
Heard when you get money niggas change
I ran through a lot of that i'm still the same

We brothers nigga
And don't no money come above you nigga

Dipping your head in spaghetti lobster
Ja-Rule these niggas no holla, holla
They know that I lead and these niggas follow
Kill a nigga and won't feel no sorrow
Catch a nigga, won't see you tomorrow
Stand over a opp fill him up with hollows
Money over bitches, that's the motto
Jackpot like I just won the lotto
Glock 40 and a semi auto
Smokin', sippin' out the Remy bottle
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell, heaven or hell
Dead or jail, dead or in jail, dead or in jail
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell, heaven or hell
Dead or jail, dead or in jail, dead or in jail
Probably lost money, my mind, my time
Man, I done lost guys to this street shit
I go hard and I grind for mine and people who said I wouldn't be shit
I can't fuck with niggas, I don't trust a soul, gotta stay on my defense
Got my Glock everywhere that I go
Give me a reason, I'm squeezin
G Herbo and Zuse, real niggas and killas from Chiraq to Kingston

Shittin' on them, call me feces
Caught me a opp in the bleachers
Herbo with me got the pieces
Mac 11 on me, you know I'ma breeze it
Send a bitch to kill you, who you gon' sleep with?
Hollow to your face, I know you gon' eat it

Heaven or hell, heaven or hell, heaven or hell
Dead or jail, dead or in jail, dead or in jail
Heaven or hell, heaven or hell, heaven or hell
Dead or jail, dead or in jail, dead or in jail
"There was a count of causalities that could have been from Afghanistan or Iraq
But it was here in Chicago
A place some have dubbed 'Chiraq'..."Yeah, ayy you hear the pain soon as the beat come on
Thelonious, man what the fuck you tryna do?
Get me to create the hood bible or somethin'?
Hold on, look, Humble Beast, uh-huh
A street nigga like me at least, gotta keep it G at least
If I ain't standing on my own two, then I must be deceased
A street nigga like me'll be mostly dead or gone
But I'm at the stu, and when I lay this track I'm headed home
I been starving for this long, keep the plate, I'll wait for the feast
Watch them eat in front of me, don't act like I ain't want a piece
Now all the birthdays and funerals they comin' to me
Everybody running to me, want somethin' from me
I'd be lying on this money, if I told you it meant something to me
But I'll still do what I can for you, if it's comfortably
And for me, out there in them trenches, it was ugly
Some of that pain still stuck in me, so that mean don't you fuck with me
Street niggas, where they be? Nowhere else but the streets
Only place some niggas been besides the block was custody
In the richest nation ever, that's just so fucked up to me
I'ma show my dogs the world if they can put they trust in me
Clutch the heat, even when I'm dolo, ain't no touching me
Niggas see me all the time, I know don't even fuck with me
Say what they gon' do but don't walk up to me, they ain't street
"I heard you did that right there 'bout fo'nem house", naw that ain't me
All apartments, never had a house 'til I moved mama out
Racist neighbors, that's the only drama now
Told her what I do for you, you owe it to my sister, ma ain't nothin' free
Besides the fact life get harder, everything lovely
They movin' in a bigger crib right up the street, you know me
Same Herb, just a triple-double-G
Still got some G Fazo's right here on my fucking feet
Honor Hov, study 'Kiss, I fuck with Meek, street nigga like me
Shit I be like fuck the streets, ain't got no love for me
Took everybody I love from me, ain't never did nothin' for me
200K I can make in a day, still gotta keep a gun with me
Know I'm on point if they run up on me, man that shit ain't no fun for me
'Member I was leaning, niggas almost had me
Really though they had us, but his pistol jammed up
Made us youngins man up, gun up, run my bands up
Just did a news interview cause they don't understand us
Why I gotta tote my heat? I be on BET
You don't wanna see me free, be great, can I do me?
A street nigga like me at least, always wanna see you eat
Even if we got some beef, come get face to face with me
Yeah I'm right here at the top, come get face to face with me
And you guys get to some guap, you gon' be any place with me
I flex every chance I get, still humble but that don't mean shit
Bankrolls on me and Rip, hollow tips in his stick
Hit the stage, lights on now I'm lit, probably three, four thou' for my fit
Off the Percs geeked, wylin' and shit, fuck around, get violent quick
Gon 'head, make 'em mad real quick, post up on the 'Gram with my bitch
Player nigga, I be chillin' with her, 'cause I fucked 'em all
Especially Chicago, she know I slutted y'all
I'm just tryna live, go out, eat, can't do that at all
Know I love the fans, I get rushed in every other mall
Street niggas should always wanna be bigger
You satisfied with thousands you a cheap nigga
Satisified living off his guys, that's a leech nigga
Heard he set his goals off satisfaction, yeah that's me nigga
If he satisfied with clothes and hoes that's a weak nigga
I'm just a street nigga, I'm an extraordinary thinker, I'm a three percenter
I'm like a prophet, I know magic, I could speak a picture
I make harsh decisions, but I'm smart and listen
I'm a killer, I'm that nigga, I'm just me nigga, I'm everything
I can't let nobody label me nigga, I go and meet the label
Like I'm from the label, I brought cake and bagels
How I'm so discreet and got the gat, that's how I'm able
I got married to the streets and let her drive me crazy
Know she had affairs with me, can't let go my wedding ring
Whole world dying for the truth, I'm here to save it
The youth dying 'cause it ain't shit to do, we gotta save 'em
You in the streets and die tonight, who gon' be there to raise 'em?
Not the streets nigga, this for the street niggas
You a street nigga, you like me, ain't you?
This for the street niggas, 'cause you a street nigga
This for the street niggas, you like me, ain't you?They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive
Hope it all pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive
See my face pop up on Channel 5, talking about a homicide
He was caught laid out on Essex Ave gunned down a bunch of times
No gun on me so that means I lied in all them fucking rhymes
I ain't tryna go out like that, how the whole city run they mouth like that
Got a .40 cocked back, hollow tip magazine, yeah I leave out the house like that
Gotta stay lowkey, I ain't been off lean but I'm ready to bounce right back
Getting tired of everybody putting stress on me, fuck around and relapse right back
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
Tired of being around my homies dying, seen too many homicides
Kobe's last breath was right before my eyes, shit had me traumatized
I'm so sick and tired of being tired, I don't even exercise
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive
I tote me a big .45, I'm tired of eights, I'm tired of nines
Niggas got my name in they mouth, guess they ain't never gonna get tired of dying
I'm tired of trying, I'm tired of flying, I'm tired of niggas lying
Bout to move down south, cop a big ass house, I need some peace and quiet
I was always silent, grew up violent, adapted to my climate
Fly as a pilot, please come try it, I stay with my sidekick
I already cocked back, pussy nigga top back, put a bullet hole in your Sox cap
Niggas wanna start rumors like I ain't got shooters, tell 'em hating ass niggas stop that
I know real drug lords and I really fought war why the hell you think I bought these guns for?
40 Glock with the beam, pull up on the scene, I make all the niggas run for it
See me out in the town, got at least 30,000, so them hating ass niggas come for it
I ain't worried about the bread, put a hundred on your head, make all my lil niggas hunt for him
They say Herbo don't come around no more, I wonder why
Maybe I'm just tired of having the iron everywhere I ride around
I got so tired of nickel and diming and seeing my mama crying
So sick and tired of niggas that ain't got nothing, want some of mine
No I ain't broke no more, I ran it up, I'm tired of lying
Gotta hide the Mac, can't worry about niggas no more, I'm tired of trying
I be on the grind, I don't get no sleep so all the time I'm tired
Hope it pay off, mama said she tired of wondering if I'm alive
I said if you wanna get ahead sometimes you gotta go without, you feel me? You have to make a lot of sacrifices for this shit man, you know what I'm saying? A wise man once told me, he said Bibby you want something you never had, you gotta do something you ain't never did. You feel me? He said Bibby you having too much fun, you know what I'm saying? It's grind time man and I like niggas to be on my ass sometimes man. Look, push me, man, push me to go harder, you know what I'm saying?Aye, it's G Herbo

78th man
Come get it
Roc-block
I be in that gangway, where we slang yay
Catch a body and bond from the station in the same day
Money out the way but our location in the same place
I remember days when we stayed by that gangway
Young niggas, but we never played by that gangway
Cold hearted killers get you blazed by that gangway
They like "y'all gone get enough of hanging by that gangway"
Trappin' hard, but we still bangin' by that gangway
Them niggas from that gangway'll put in work
No problem only your conscious could get you hurt
If you try to hit us up, we gone come and hit you first
Team full of solvers and problems come with a shirt
I from the side where they found Derrick Rose
He made a name off jump shots, we was out there shootin' poles
Hustle hard stackin' 0s, we was tryna get the dough
'til they started snatching 0s then we started snatching souls
We grew up right by the store, young as shit and we was runnin' shit
Started gettin' respected quick, earned it with a hundred clip
Ran into some beef then my youngins started dumpin' shit
Cut some niggas from the circle, they was on some other shit
My dogs was trained to go, they was blowing out they mother shit
We grew up on loyalty, EBK a brothership
Or should I say ya brotherhood, either way my brothers good
And if nigga wanna play pussy, I'mma blow em down like a﻿ brother should
And you know I got the ratchet on me, if I'm ridin' round in another hood
Smokin' 3 5s out a blackjack, tell white Shawn roll another wood
And my niggas up to nothing good, every day is like the same day
And if a nigga out here looking for me you can find somewhere by the gangway
You can catch me on that 8 block where we bang at 
If a nigga try to send shoots then his forehead what I aim at
And a nigga got that straight drop, all they wanna know is where the cane at?
Have my young niggas hit and kick doors, all they wanna know is where the stain at?
Run up in a nigga trap house with the macs out, where the keys at?
Pussy nigga wanna act up, he get clapped up cuz' I need that!
Take everything we can get up out it and forget about it, where the weed at?
And a lot of niggas out here hatin' on me, if you heard something don't believe that, straight-up
Niggas out here need to get there cake up
Gettin' to the money when I wake up
I get all the cash I can take up
And if I'm missing money then I make up
But if I don't eat it's a drought in the street
So early in the morning I'm out with this heat
And I'm all about the check, 'til a nigga disrespect
Like a day with LeBron, bitch I'm out with the Heat
A lot of these dudes don't be out in the street
I ain't in the house, bitch I'm out you can see
Let a bitch nigga act 'bout it to me
Have my young goon punch 'em in the mouth 'til he sleep
Ridin' round town with the strap in the seat
Run into a opp put the Glock to his cheek
Thought he'll make from the bottom to the top
Pop a shot from the Glock knock his top on his sneaksLook man, Ball Like I'm Kobe the mixtape coming soon man
Young nigga done grew up now though but let me tell you something
Take me way back, way way back
Back to 87th Rink with the wave caps
Back to 72nd street that's where I played at
But 79 essex block where I was made at
East side, only side where I was raised at
No cease fire, disrespect us you get blazed at
Take me back, way back to elementary
Lost G Fazo in 2010 the rest was history
And ever since its been "murder all my enemies"
And ever since it's been "never show no sympathy"
I'm in this by myself, niggas don't mean shit to me
And money don't mean shit to me
I remember nights, when it wasn't shit to eat
And ever since it's been "niggas can't get shit for free"
This world fucked up my nigga, so good luck my nigga
And once you in that state system then you stuck my nigga
Better get some bucks my nigga
You only got yourself the rest don't give a fuck my nigga
And I'mma live it up my nigga
Don't be mad at me your bitch can't get enough my nigga
But back to basics, you want that bank just hit me up my nigga
Smoking OG to the face I'm high as fuck my nigga
You know G Herbo keep some codeine in his cup my nigga
Roll up to my show we got 4 FNs in the trunk my nigga
And we got them slammers in the club
You know Lil Marley blammin' nigga mud
Just went to see my big bro Maskey in the county jail
He was out on 25 but he tryna make another bail
When I was 17 I seen my first 100 racks
I turned 18 seen it again and blew that 100 back
But now I'm wiser bitch I'm master making money stack
I'm tryna win a grammy I got fo' nem out there sellin' crack
What you need? You know we buy that store
Big bucks my bro, he got it for the low
Fuck the law they tryna send a nigga up the road
Passing out conspiracies they snatch me up bitch I don't know I don't know
Free my nigga Crazy James, shout out my big bro perfect 8
And ever since they took the game shit ain't been the same
Free Lil Merch and wet em up see shorty n them be duckin treys
Roll around with all my ice on me
I got 24 for Kobe and this pipe on me
Boy you better not risk your life on me
We in the club might get your head shot, pull a knife on me
You standin' in the line paying for your mans and all
I don't show up to the club unless the bands involved
I'm sick of these hating niggas, all you snaking niggas
Pocket watcher tryna see how much I'm making nigga
Why you wanna see me fail? I'm tryna make it nigga
Why you want me to be broke and stay a basic nigga?
Why niggas wanna see me dead? Tryna see me down
Same niggas shake my hand when they see me 'round
Let you know for you gotta watch em
They gon drop a dime or kill you for a dollar
And I gotta watch my back cause I know niggas plottin'
Same nigga who say he ya partna' he'll pop-pop
And I'm ridin' round tryna ease the pain
Smoking on dutches drink a ace of lean
High speedin' and I'm switching lanes
Tired of talkin, Ballin Like I'm Kobe on the way
RIP all my niggas man
Free all my niggas man
Ballin Like I'm Kobe on the mixtape
Coming real soon man
You already know what it is man
Pistol gang, 4L
You already know how we rocking man
PPP Man
Let's get it man
We don't fuck around we gotta get this money man
Fuck all that other shitI grew up just a fucking screw up
I'm talking way before the money, when a nigga blew up
I'm talking nothing in my stomach, water what I threw up
I came from under, in that gutter, where it rain manure
Where don't nobody want a future, all the shorties shooters
But you can't judge that young man just by what he doing
You don't understand the circumstances, how he group up
He ain't never had a father, watched his momma toot up
I came up with them hot boys, everybody knew us
15, 16, niggas tryna' do us
Can't trust a soul cause for that cash yo niggas turn to Judas
I'm telling you the truth, my nigga, cause I really do this
Now Herbo always on the road, I guess I'm a tourist
Scream my name at all my shows, I guess I'm the truest
Let me stop acting like I don't know, yes, I'm the truest
To put this rap game in a choke hold, yes, I'm the newest
But still that youngin' from the bottom, started off with nothing
And now I'm all about my dollas all across the country
I'm working hard because I'm starvin' and you niggas lunch meat
I get respect in every city, dare a nigga touch me, i's gon get ugly
I was hateful now I'm living lovely, it's marvelous
Everybody screamin' "gang", but they don't know who started it
That's a shame how my city the same, some fucking followers
Keep the fame and don't mention my name, unless your dollars up
Nigga
Free my homies, a couple doing almost life in that shitter
Life ain't shit, and they bitch getting piped by they niggas
I know niggas that got they life snatched right by they niggas
You think he got his life back cause no fight from his niggas
Fuck niggas, don't do right by they niggas at all
I get jammed up, believe I know what niggas to call
I know my niggas that's gon ride, I know which niggas gon' fall
But sad to say, I know I just can't fuck with niggas at all
Jumped off the porch and then I hit the block, the rest was history
They murdered Roc and ever since the street shit just been into me
And for Kobe Squad it's fuck the opps, kill all my enemies
To ease the pain I pour up eights of lean not pints of Hennessy
"Ball Like I'm Kobe" the mixtape man
Free all my niggas man
R.I.P. all my niggas man
This real shit right here man, this real shit
150 Dream Team the campaign man
NLMBMan
You supposed to be no stress in a world of stress
The one relaxation in a world of chaos
How it was when we first met
How it was, I can't recollect it
And I feel what you said when you felt neglected
If it’s gonna be like this, gotta just accept it
When you dealing with a nigga like me, you just gotta respect it
Ups and downs and shit, all that's expected
And when we argue back and forth, I let you get the best of it
I be more like, "What's all that for?"
You know I ain’t with that extra shit
All the time I look at my phone like, "Damn, why you texting?"
Matter fact I ain't even texting back
You know me, I ain't even stressing that
Spend a 40, you can have the rest of that
You ain't even ask for that
You ain't even gotta ask where the cash at
Just throw that ass back
You know I like when you ride that
Yeah, I like when you grab that
Yeah, a week at the chiropractor
All your friends know why you got a bad back
And you know I cock that slab back
Made the whole crowd back, back
I don't even care who right there
You know I'm gangsta like that
Yeah, you still my baby
Even when you mad, you know you still my baby
Pull your hair and I smack that ass
You like how that feel, huh, baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I drive you crazy
But we still ridin', we crazy
And she like when I drive fast, no I ain’t driving Ms. Daisy
Then she like to ride it fast, we doing that on the daily
And she’s still my baby
Girl you're still my baby
Don’t nobody do it like you when you put them heels on baby
And handlin' all this money, I ain't got nothin' to feel on baby
So take them heels off, baby
You know I love to watch them panties peel off, baby
Where you about to go, baby?
In order to get all this money, you know I got to go
Always think I’m up to something when I'm on the road
You know I walk in this bitch with a hundred, let's hit the store
Listen up, why you tripping though?
Who was with some hoes?
You know I miss you, though
I'm always with the bros
Always gotta hit the studio
I always got work to do, you know?
I'm getting back on the road, wish you could go
I got some secrets you should know
Not no shit deep as the hood go
Shit about going deep as I could go
Come hop on my mic and blow
Then I'm hoppin' inside the sauce
Yeah, you could do what you want
But I feel I got the right to know
Yeah, you still my baby
Even when you mad, you know you still my baby
Pull your hair and I smack that ass
You like how that feel, huh, baby
You know you drive me crazy
And I drive you crazy
But we still ridin', we crazy
And she like when I drive fast, no I ain't driving Ms. Daisy
Then she like to ride it fast, we doing that on the daily
And she's still my babyUh
Dougie on the beat
Still, still
Still feel the deal
Still, look
Talked to my kid mom today, that was kinda hard
Sick of all the drama in my life, we ain't gotta start
How the fuck we still holding grudges, you ain't got a heart?
Either way a nigga life a movie and you got a part
I was in a lotta dark
I don't never make excuses for myself, but how I came up was kinda hard
I was havin' battle scars
And I'm never speakin' on the shit I did, 'cause when you bite, you don't gotta bark
These the years now when he young, but my jit watchin'
Just 'cause we fell out of love, that ain't his problem
Every kid want a mami and a papi
But how we gon' co-parent when it's sloppy?
Bet' not act like I ain't that nigga, but I ain't cocky
Everybody watch me, I'm duckin' the paparazzi
Life was hittin' heavy, now I'm steady takin' Oxies
Hate it or love it, my life faster then a Masi'
Public record, yeah, but you ain't gotta sabotage me
Even though I'm more than generous, gotta rob me
Instead of doin' what you 'posed to, you try and dodge me
I'm gon' be here regardless, won't do me like DeMarcus
I don't want no problem, but just stop me when I'm flaugin'
Can't accept the fact you love me, keep tryin' judge me
Granted, you gon' stay in position, but that's because me
Still feel me, I was real but this the real-real me
Hope you still feel me
All my real niggas gotta feel me
If I don't talk about it, it'll kill me
Hope you still feel me
I got love for you still, literally
I hate that we seein' shit differently
I can't let it get to me
I stay focus, I see shit vividly
Built for tough times that weren't meant for me
I don't want no sympathy
I can recognize whoever here for me
If I weren't the nigga I was meant to be
They weren't even here for me
What it is? Go on, make it clear for me
I don't pay attention to the rear of me
Nah, they ain't hearin' me
They respect me more than they be fearin' me
When I wasn't winnin' they weren't cheerin' me 
Lost my brother, almost been a year for me
Go on, shed a tear for me
And I love you, nigga, still feel me
And your son can always and chill with me
He can come and live with me
Gotta still feel me
Gave 'em the real me
Help him out but he'll still kill me, damn
Never seen a nigga real 'til me, damn
And this gave me the chills
Lil' bro know I didn't fold when he gave me the wheel
'Til this day he like the baby still
But he'll hit the switch and turn it to a Navy Seal
I got diagnosed but I don't want no crazy pills
I'm a real hustler, I don't want no lazy deals
If I execute this time, I'm makin' crazy mils
They tryna book me every day, I'm havin' stage appeal
I got burned once again, but I paid it still
I don't wanna tell you what a nigga made for real
I don't wanna tell you where a nigga came for real
All the hunger, all the doubt and all the pain was real
They know my name for real, Herbo made a change for real
And I got aunties that ain't met my baby still
But it's all good
I walk around with a smile like it's all good
I'm at a million dollar meeting, smell like all 'Woods
I know they'll make a way for me if y'all could
I been to war, but I'm still good in damn near all hoods
I could hear a nigga diss me, it'd be all love
They wanna ask me how I feel, I give a small shrug
I was top ten, front line, all thugs
I was locked in, ten summers, all blood
Uh, still feel me
I don't even want no adlibs on that
Uh
Still feel me
If we at war, you gon' still feel me
I don't really talkin' much after this song 'cause I want you to listen Got on all black posted in the club like a bouncer
Baby girl, the way you bounce it makes me arouse up
Really you the coldest in the room and I’m a browser
But I can’t dance with you I got this tool in my trousers

Glizzy up, do not talk, all you see is masks
And I just told the gorillas chill, but I might let em spaz
40’s and them 45’s get right on yo ass
And all we know is green light, when we on yo ass
Decide if you might get a pass, when we see a badge
Still lil bro don’t fuck with badgers, don’t fuck with badgers, honestly the blue and white really ain’t my swagger
Post yo ho but I ain’t tag her I’m tryna bag her
Hit her, Quit her, not a bragger, but she a nagger
If that hoe disloyal I despise her
I come from the mud, had to rise up, shed tears I done shed blood I advise it
Stack that paper, why you gotta run put your guys up
I got street smarts but I’m wiser
All these nigga’s suns where my visor
I don’t fuck with niggas like a master
If he disrespect me it’s a casperI just told 'em turn my headphones all the way up
Uh, huh
Yeah
Uh, huh
Yeah
Damn, Sizzle, it's hard for me to rap on these raw ass beats

Alot of time my fans try to say with music I wanna make 'em wait not tryna make 'em late but, ain't even the case I'm tryna really change the world with this shit the way I drop shit it's like a system, its systematic I try and give it to you but its a meaning. It's a meaning behind why I give it you you, when I give it to you and what I'ma give to you next
Look, they say a coward die a thousand deaths 
And every time you and try and kill him why its always a thousand left? 
I heard a real nigga die come back a thousand times
Go broke now 999 count up a thousand times
And these is real facts I ain't just saying that
What if Fred Hamp was president I woke up praying that
'Cause if Trump become the president he might bring slavery back
Been on black folks eighty years might as well bring Reagan back
Meanwhile, I'm just riding with this desert eagle

Before I rat I'ma lie down and roll
Lay down and die before I fold
Hoes and bankrolls, ain't nothing but a bonus

Coulda got rich, I was 18 had some minor setbacks
Street nigga, if I don't do nothin', I'mma run that check back
Couple bitches used to play me, now they get the message
You can keep that pussy, baby, I'm not interested
Cross my heart hunnid times a day, I know this shit a blessing
Never gave me shit, got up, made a way, learned life from all my lessons
I guess more money and more problems, why a nigga stressin'
About no paper I ain't stressin, bitch ain't no depression
About no paper I ain't stressin, bitch ain't no depression
I was 16, made 250 off a 14, bought a Smith & Wesson
In the trap house, 20 to a 100 when the door ring, gotta stay awake, no more lean
Walk in gram's crib lookin' like a zombie from a horror scene, off a 4 of red and a 4 of green
30 on me, run up and you know what it's gon' be
Spray the boy head like oil sheen
Bitches love to whore me, they adore me, ride me like a horsey
I can't marry you, girl, you's a coho, been one way before me
Want a big house, bankroll
Purse cost 4 G's, know you wanna see my Porsche keys

About no paper I ain't stressin, bitch ain't no depression
My OG told me, "If you want some better get at it and if you fail better keep at it"
She'll tell you, "You couldn't get the bag, you was fumbling"
Sooner or later, though, he got it
I thought my destination was straight to the paper, but fuck that, I learned how to re-route it
And you say that it's there but G Herbo trust nobody, hand it to me, gotta re-count it
And if you want smoke that shit south, gotta sleep 'bout it
All that gangsta shit, we 'bout it, niggas don't wanna see 'bout it
Actin' like he 'bout it, ain't show us nothin', so we doubt it
And this watch really made to wear on occasions, but I rock mine on the regular
.40 Glock in my Ethikas
Don't try no extra stuff, turn that boy meat to a vegetable
I was broke, I was stressin', bruh
Pockets negative, now I got zeros with decimals, commas, I mean
Don't think cause I got the cream, we ain't toting choppas with beams

My only ambition is money, cause I love it when I look like money
No, you better not play with my money
Fuck around and get killed 'bout that money
She want me cause I look like money
Cause you ain't me and I look like money
These benjis, them franklins, them hundreds
I look so much like money, I'm money
I'm chasing, got my money runnin'
Bitch don't ask me, what I look like money?
Bitch don't ask me for money
It's G Herbo, I'm the man
Mr. 'Thumbin' Through Them Bands'
Nothing but hunnids in my pants
Keep it coming 'bout that money, I ain't playin'
I don't want nothing but that money, fuck a friend
I just came up on a couple hunnid bands
Get yo "lemme hold a hunnid if you can"
I put hunnids in my blunts, not a hand
Couple hunnid in my Crush with my mans
Be like twenty something cash in my denim pockets
18 hunnid on my pants and forget about it
And 200 on my dash, so don't get behind me
Smoke on the E-way, man I can't see shit behind me
Can't remember shit but money, so lil' bitch remind me
Besides me, I don't spend my money on shit but family
Don't spend money on no niggas, all my niggas family
And all the niggas that I trust, yeah, they still grimey
Katie Got Bandz
You not talkin' 'bout money, can't hear what you sayin'
Hitters strapped in that van
If you fuck with my money, we clappin' like hands
Robins stuffed with the bands
100's and 50's, you mad your shit empty
Got it on me, don't tempt me
Lil Herb got that ratchet, he blow till it's empty
Spent 10 bands on some red bottoms
Free my nigga Rusty, he a damn shotta
Gold hallows slipping out this chopper
If I hit a opp, he gon' need a damn doctor
Droppin' my set then you got a problem
Katie Got Bandz, so I talk guala
Don't be calling my phone unless it's 'bout dollas
I'm with the team and we balling like we got a sponsor
Bandz!Cannon
I do it for the haves and the have-nots
All he had was a half and a glass pot
Gotta race 'til he the first one with the last rock
Every day you see his face just like a mascot
Trapping out the Honda, no, he never had a stash box
Stuck to armed violence, that was at the last spot
Ever since a kid, he seeing coke all around him
Born to hustle, that's his only hope all around him
Went to school stylin', middle school's wildin'
He ain't care for school 'cause he knew his true talent
How he gon' survive in a world full of savages?
Born to get some money, but'll kill, gotta balance it
He can't fold under pressure , life full of challenges
'Cause he know how to move, he a fool with analysis
Seen dudes in a pool of his fluid leaking out of 'em
He breathing but his body cannot move like paralysis
Really seen catastrophes, I be rappin' average shit
Homie had some tragedies, probably why he act like this
But back to the shit at hand, rap 'til you get advanced
Holmes got a different plan with 550 grams
Strapped with it in his hand, trap, just a ceiling fan
Finger on the trigger, take a tap just to kill a man
Push 'em to the limit, watch him snap just like any man
Steady poppin' Percocet, he blacked off them milligrams
You don't live how he live, you don't feel the man
Ain't no lil' bitty pill just gon' heal a man
He can't chill, he need a pill, guess he too militant, uh
Oh, you just like us, they robbed you of your innocence, huh?
Real menaces, we grew up like Dennises, huh?
Played with pistols, we ain't have no Sega Genesis, uh-uh
No curriculum, can't punctuate our sentences or nothin'
Niggas 'posed to been on prom doing sentences
That's fucked up, better get your bucks up
'Member I was fucked up, daddy said I lucked up
But it wasn't no luck for us, nobody had none for us
I was with some real niggas, but it wasn't enough of us
Held the whole hood down, niggas had to toughen up
He gangsta, but can't ride with my crowd, he ain't rough enough
I'm humble, but my city in a headlock and a uppercut
Don't talk about no millions or nothin' 'cause you ain't touch enough
My head race, I'm riding alone, just my mind and this chrome
Used to live in all apartments, now I'm riding to a home
And I spend like one point five on my diamonds alone
Only count on who gon' still be by my side if it's gone
Just a handful, you can't never have no win if your mans lose
Exploitation off your mans, that's a fan move
F&N have that man doing dance moves
Keep your friends cool, don't be no damn fool
Gotta stay ruthless in the streets 'cause ain't no damn rules
Just staying free, gave half a million to them damn Jews
Now why the club just let us in with all these damn tools?
And all these bamboos? Sticks
We ain't worried 'bout no opps, yeah, they could suck a dick
I just stayed a extra thirty minutes taking pics
Trigger happy, we been buyin' licks since jits
G-Money always been the one that had a sixth sense
We ain't never get pinched, no coincidence
We was supposed to get rich 'cause we was meant for this
Now all we know arithmetic, but everybody with the shits
I hope it ain't no incidents 'cause everybody in some whips
And we'll trip, rip clips, flip shit
Dip, split, switch whips with new tints like ain't shit happen
And ain't no niggas in this shit doin' shit like this clique
Ain't no more room for you pussy boys, quit rappin' I'm just koolin til my tape drop
Welcome to Fazoland the mixtape

Knee deep in them streets with nothing to say, I ain't playing no fucking games

All I ever knew was get cream
Only other way was hit fiends
Made my mama cry to get this shit, nigga I'm from the streets

Remember nights I cried, I think of that and that's what humbled me
I know that my life always at risk, I keep that bitch from me

Started from the bottom now i'm getting figures, but
Way before this rap shit bitch i been that niggaG Herbo, Swervo
Humble beast man, you know I'm just doing me, I can't complain
A product of my environment, of course I am
Walking with this torch I am
Still smell like gunpowder, straight up off that porch I am
Youngest nigga got up on his grizzy, without force I am
Go and cop that new Ferrari, 700 horse, I am
And I told my big bros, "let me see you run it up"
I don't give a motherfuck about them if they ain't one of us
Niggas, they ain't nothing like us
They wasn't on that block like us
They don't tote them Glocks like us
They won't die for Roc like us
Understanding, overhanded, get that money rubberband it
Count it first before you spend it
I don't think they comprehend it
Thinking about my big bro Crazy James, he got apprehended
All we know is blocka-blocka-blocka then the coppers had him
Can't forget my bro Da Roe, I love him like my mama had him
That night we lost Kobe on the 8 block, had that Glock beside him
Can't forget about them days and nights cause they made me
We survived the trenches, we was crazy
I was lonely, I was hungry, almost drove me crazy
Walked out the house and got right in the streets, that shit was crazy
Bullets flying right in front of me, that shit was crazy
Shooters diving right in front of me, my niggas crazy
Don't know how but I made at home, shit was crazy
Turned me out then eventually I just start going crazy
When I say I don't give a fuck they think I'm crazy
Don't blame me, I'm just a product of what made me
Used to post up on that corner
It was after midnight on a school night
30 clip right on us, Lord I promise, I'm just tryna do right
Tell me how you grew up, this my story, let me hear what you like
Bullet wounds in middle school, he just tryna protect his new bike
Now I did the presidential, I might go Patek with blue light
I might go Ben Frank the Mueller, make it work, curse out the jeweler
Golden links like Rick The Ruler
In your club, might build a room up
Walk outside with sticks and rulers
Pull shit, be so quick to do ya
Anyway, I've been straight since a teen, literally
Fuck shit up, walk out tell 'em bill me, Hillary
You starving, we eating over here B
Get a piece
Closed mouths don't get fed, you a pussy, don't come near the G
And they say I'm crazy, me I say I'm brazy
Mom, pops, at home, the street life, that's what raised me
The streets they love me one day and the next I know they hate me
I love what I've become, I'm just a product of what made me
I was lonely, I was hungry, almost drove me crazy
Walked out the house and got right in the streets, that shit was crazy
Bullets flying right in front of me, that shit was crazy
Shooters diving right in front of me, my niggas crazy
Don't know how but I made at home, shit was crazy
Turned me out then eventually I just start going crazy
When I say I don't give a fuck they think I'm crazy
Don't blame me, I'm just a product of what made me
Almost drove me crazy
That shit was crazy
That shit was crazy
My niggas crazy
Shit was crazy
I just start going crazy
They think I'm crazy
I'm just a product of what made meFuck next up, I took off a while back
And all I ever do is fuck bitches and count stacks
Yeah I spazz, I just run through them digits and bounce back
Niggas mad, pillow talking to bitches about rap
No limit and it's no limit to this street shit
Got the whole city on MB dick
Since I threw Reese on the remix
But I been doing this rap shit and street shit
You can always catch me over east with it
And my niggas shoot for no reason cause the opps got poor defense
First off bitch it's EBK, GDK
Terror Town, slam the rakes
Grab the eight, blam his face
That's how I handle shit
Fazoland, candles lit
Seven-nine, Essex ho
Shit'll get hectic, ho
If you lowkey, better hope it last, cause we on that
And I don't think y'all want that
Leave a nigga stinking on Colfax
Speeding in the Lincoln, no throwback
Now I'm back up on the Essex block
.30 poppers with a extra Glock
My niggas got 47 sweating hot
So you better run when that Beretta cocked
M-O-B I don't love a ho
Imma be this way 'til I'm forty six
Matter of fact 'til a nigga die
Smoke kush blunts 'til a nigga cry
And I never feed off another man
Cause I understand how a nigga lieL's
I swear to God, know a lot of niggas fu as hell, hear me?
And they so real I swear to God on my kids
Imma let niggas know how I feel about them, you feel me?
Started with nigga when niggas ain't right
You ain't real, lil nigga you ain't right

And you claim you my brother, you gettin' exposed, lil nigga you just ain't right
You ain't right lil nigga, I'm see the fake in you
Got plenty of snitches lil nigga, ain't nobody makin' you

I don't put my trust in a nigga
I don't fuck with niggas, I know they ain't real
150 my niggas, I know they gone kill
Aimin' slugs with my niggas we tryna suffer end
No choice but to deal
And for me they gon' ride told me put down the steel
G Herbo get you a deal
The harder you work it's so easy to get to them bills
House on the hills, coupes on some shit on wheels
Herbo I didn't grow up with a butler in LA with my Uncle Phil
No I was out of Chiraq posted up doin' drugs duckin' hollows
I know how they feel
If you ain't front line with your niggas you know you ain't real
They steady keep slidin' on No Limit don't know how to chill
They steady keep slidin' on No Limit don't know how to chill
Lost so many niggas don't know how to feel
You niggas don't know how to feel
Started with nigga when niggas ain't right
You ain't real, lil nigga you ain't right
And I hold my own, when I keep my pole, lil nigga I'm just that type
Where was you at when we starvin' at night?
No place to sleep at night
And you claim you my brother, you gettin' exposed, lil nigga you just ain't right

Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
You ain't right lil nigga, you ain't right
Know lil niggas ain't right, ain't right
I don't fuck with you fuck niggas
When you see me in the street don't say nothin' to me
I ain't taking your word I know niggas ain't real
But that shit ain't mean nothin' to me
And you know you weren't out here with me in the field
So damn right, ain't nothin' for free
I got forty on me, I keep it on me
Don't run up on me
Used to pop out the house, go to school with my gun up on me
8 o'clock on the block with my hand in my pocket
It's already one up on me
And you know how I'm rockin' ain't duckin' on action
Them fuck niggas know where I be
But I can't trust a soul
Gotta watch out for niggas who know where I sleep
Swear to God keep my gun right under my pillow
Don't know til the pull, I don't sleep
Wicked shit, can’t control how I think
And I been on the streets all my life
And I seen my day one niggas die in front of me
Kill a fuck nigga right in front of me
When the cops question me I don’t know, I just blink
Started with nigga when niggas ain't right
You ain't real, lil nigga you ain't right
And I hold my own, when I keep my pole, lil nigga I'm just that type
Where was you at when we starvin' at night?
No place to sleep at night

Where I'm from in my city lil nigga, it's easy to make the news
You ain't right lil nigga, you ain't right
Know lil niggas ain't right, ain't rightReal street nigga
I'd done been shot
Shootouts
Went the school route 
Been broke
Tryin to get rich, nigga, look
I'm feeling blessed, I hit 4 cities in the same week
I'm worldwide but lost my niggas on the same street
I never changed, I got some change but that ain't change me
Yeah I'm still the same me
Y'all know how that thing be 
The devil trying to bring me down, G Herbo I'm still standing
Gun in hand and I ain't going out til I buy mom's a mansion
Fucked up that check a thousand times shoulda bought moms a mansion
But I was young and I was dumb thank god for second chances
I know some niggas facing life without no second chances
Ain't too many second chances
Niggas better take advantage
And I woulda been signed a if I was trying to chase advances
I seen niggas with a million cash and watched that paper vanish
Only twenty things left, so I gotta make it manage
Send em to your front door, but you gotta pay for transit
Never sure however much to order, that's how much I handed
Keep it sharp, sloppy with the business stop your shit from landing
Use your heart
If you got that feelin homie ain't your mans then
Ain't no rules to the streets except for keep a cannon
And it's going down over east, I gotta keep a cannon
Take a piss, I eat with Cannon, ask my bitch, I sleep with cannon
M-O-N-Y after the E the only thing I cherish
Free my big bro Murder Manski, sleep tight my little sister Cherish
Blowing smoke thinkin bout my life and how I came from nothing
Not only how I came from nothing bitch I made it something
I gave my mom the whole deposit for her pain and suffering
I grew up seeing my momma struggling so I started hustling
Probably coulda stayed in school got a job or something
But by the time I turned 16 didn't ask my mom for nothing
OG was staying by the enemy I had to move out
Cuz anytime we see each other it's going to be a shootout
Soon as that check came through she had to get a new house
Now she fin to get a new house, let her see what two bout
Might stash them hundreds in the floor, call that one the blue house
We ain't in the hood no more nigga, take your shoes off
On Essex block baby, 78th, 24th, for Kobe we shoot 24, shells outside that 24
Niggas know I'm in the streets, know I don't got shit to prove
Big Bro told me leave the city, you got shit to lose
I don't reply to beef with tweets, street niggas gotta feel me
I'm in my hood with all my ice, who said they tryin to kill me?
Like 30 on my wrist, like 60 plus my neck, like 80 plus my L, 200 plus this tech
I keep them killas with me, they tryin to roll shit
I can't control shit, let off the whole clipI know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They stealin', robbin', living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snow
Look, I was born in the slums, with the drugs and the bums
Lookin' up to thugs with the guns
Why they want for us to settle every first of the month
All the way until you tired of the crumbs
Kids getting up for school, they ain't setting no alarms
They wake up to the sound of the drums
And respect don't go too long nowadays
Man, a nigga run a hood with a gun
I remember i was young, running wild with my niggas
We'll run around the hood just for fun
By eighth grade year, we was trapping stacking ones
Staying out for parties, packing guns
.22's, .380's
.32's under the jacket, thought we was the Navy
Man we took on the hood, made them old niggas fall right in line
Man they thought we was babies
Back then had to think and react
Like a man as a boy that's what made me
I was ridin' for mine
We gon' die for the cause, I'm No Limit crazy
I was out in the field
Committing sins with my dawgs
Disobeying the law
Bitch no respect for the jakes, I won't rat if they paid me
And these fuck niggas lower than rats
In the streets, doing hits whackin' babies
You won't catch me with no gat in the streets
Niggas say they after me
Niggas say they whackin' me
But so far ain't no one got at me
G Herbo ain't with no rapping beef
If a nigga want me, clap at me
I used to have dreams with degrees
Growing up becoming a athlete
But instead I just ended on Essex
Lil' Roc rolled the swishers and Cap had the heat
Pistol gang I keep my gat with me
Glo Limit, I got Cap with me
Kobe squad I still got Act' in me
Roc block ain't just a tat on me
I know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They stealin', robbin', living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters harsh cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, you either dead or dead broke
And all the young'ins know is blow and sell that damn coke
They daddies dead or on death row and moms don't care or know
Where eight year old's get killed at candy stores, no damn remorse
Babies, mothers, grannies, aunts niggas don't fear no more
They ain't in the streets forreal, they don't care no more
These niggas ain't forreal, they ain't trained to kill
A lot of niggas really bitches, they just life takers
And they take the wrong lives, they ain't life savers
They ain't tryna get no money, they ain't bout paper
These niggas know me lowkey, lil' bro toting Glocks with lasers
He lost his heartbeat, doctors had to feed him anesthesia
I'm everywhere from Lakeshore to Cicero, nothing major
He told you that he run the city, yeah he might have played ya
Don't know nigga run the city, we all from the city
The murder cap, closing your eyes'll get you gunned down quickly
And all my niggas gun down quickly, catch you run down empty
Get high off lean, smoke pounds of OG for our fallen homies
I'm gone off Remy, smoking pasto, got that blammer on me
Bro'nem told me, "Yo G Herbo, can't be by your lonely
I know I rap a lot 'bout being dead or dead broke
But my city starving, it's the 'Go, that's just the way it go
They still in robbing, living heartless, never hit they target
The summers long and winters hard cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
The summers long and winters hard cause we got red snow
Red snow, red snow
Red snow, red snowGANG!
Louie what'chu on bro?
Another day, another body droppin'
If I go broke then I'mma rob somebody
A fragile body can't survive a shotty
Pump a nigga, I'll slump a nigga
And I been shot at by a bunch a niggas
But I'll still  never run from a nigga
Catch a nigga hollows flyin' for dem niggas
50 hit every last one of niggas
Got some old heads that'll slump a nigga
But you still can get killed by my younger niggas
My young niggas hungry, put 'em on a lick
And they'll take every last thing from a nigga
I got hittas wit' me rollin' off a flat
Now it's hittas in me, ridin' wit' this 30
I might high speed, so I think that I might go get me a Hemi
Lil bro gotta 30 now it's me and 60
We ain't goin' in 'til them bitches empty
Mally tryna make his Glock go empty
Ridin' on them oppers but they block so empty
Kobe make me wanna catch a body
Seeking for revenge, but that's not forgiveness
My niggas ridin' wit' it, they on business
Shoot a brick a hunnid times, put that on Guiness
My hittas know they don't condone the snitchin'
Fuck a trial, broski dome the witness!
Lookin' for them niggas, why they keep sneak dissin'
See him in the field, up the nickel
Niggas act like they pretendin'
Bitch I'm in the field wit' the steel
Niggas say they wanna kill me, act like they forgettin'
Lil bro keep a Glock wit' 30 shots for any block
Wit' red beams to help them pay attention
Another day, another dollar for me
Wake up and get to the money
Money on me so that tool is on me
If I want him gone, I'll put money on 'em
AKs wit' them hunnids in 'em
Let 'em up, bring out the runner in 'em
Ion bop I do the money dance
Pack louder than an ambulance
I be goin' dumb wit' my big head friends
Them new hun duns make me feelin' friends
I spend hella bands on my Robin jeans
Gotta get this green by any means
Cop killas in the magazines
From the block to the magazines
I'm Mike, yo bitch Billie Jean
Make her best friend lick her belly ring
My life like a Belly scene
Catch me flexin' in that Pelle thing
Bitches want me like a wedding ring
No answer I just let it ring
No time to talk baby 'tml'
And ion set up no voicemail
M.O.B. 'til I D-I-E
Wit' a beam on tha heat, I could shoot a bee
Shoot a creep in the eye and tell 'em, "see"
I told yo dumbass not to fuck wit' me
No love for a bitch I just fuck and leave
She just suckin' dick, and she ugly
I'm sick of gettin' bands I got counterflu
Killas a hit up a carnival
Get shot hella times like its lots of you
We DOA they can't doctor youYeah
I done spent the night in the stu'
Man, it's 11:30
'Til I feel it's done and shit
I been in this bitch like, thirty-six hours
Ayy, you know, Meek be callin' me the golden child and shit
Yeah, it's probably 'cause, you know
I was built for all this shit
Everything, like, I just
Whatever I do, man, good or bad
I just lay down on my bed, fuck it
I just lay down in my bed, fuck it
Wopskino ask if I want him dead
And I'm like, "Yeah, fuck it"
Them shootouts and high speeds
I made it out, but I ain't lucky
Had to walk home on the opps
They see that bitch 'cause I ain't tuck it
Jdot used to call my phone, tell me "Pop outside," I'm already comin'
He was thirsty to pick me up
'Cause both us tryin' to score a bucket
It was no one man above the group
We gon' fall together, fuck it 
But it's always just that one
With the biggest head, LeToya Luckett
Remember Rell turned himself in?
We was droppin' Aca, tweleve or muddy
Fell asleep standin' up in front of my mama
She knew I was up to somethin'
Then I dropped out of school to get this money
She knew I was up-and-comin'
Then I walked in the house one day with a Wilt Chamberlain
All hundreds
Since my first hundred K I was focused and kept savin'
All hundreds
Everybody tellin' me do this and do that
Nigga, this ain't y'all money
When I was young I couldn't wait 'til I grow up
And I got my own money
Now I'm grown and got a son
Gotta keep it comin'
Soon as I get done, back on the run
I can't sleep for nothin', uh
They gave me a million bucks to talk
So at least I speak for somethin', uh
Told them boys I wanna race
A hundred miles and runnin', uh
God forbid it's my time to go
Then I'm just gon' keep gunnin', uh
I'm just gon' get money, uh
And when I make two hundred, uh
And my bitch got a bank account
With nothin' less than four hundred, uh
You know I'm big dog, everything paid for
She ain't gotta spend no money, uh
Don't no female in my life
Get up and work for nothing, uh
My son grannies don't need nothin', uh
Aunties don't need nothin', uh
None of my brothers need nothin', uh
'Cept for probably a lawyer or somethin'
Probably somebody to watch their daughter or somethin'
Smokin' v-line, need a quarter or somethin'
Still know how to boil water, uh
Hit a bro if you need a order or somethin'
He asked me to hold on tight to my past
Like a hoarder or somethin' 
Can't trust all my homies
Feel like Rich Porter or somethin'
If your mind was right
I might go have somethin' cross the border comin'
But niggas ain't ready to eat
I ain't goin' to war over nothin'
Lost too many of my brothers to this shit
I can't afford another
You know I'm gon' go, right or wrong
So at least keep me informed or somethin'
My mama must have prayed to gangsta God
Before I was born or somethin'
You know I'ma hit a nigga but before I see the nigga
Just gimme a warnin' or somethin'
Everywhere I go somebody recordin' somethin'
Poppin' 'em all when I'm bored or somethin'
Really I need an award or somethin'
Bitch put me up on that boy for somethin'
The shit I was doin' in the streets
I ain't never seen you, but I'ma ignore it, it's nothin'
Niggas say they gettin' their shit out the mud
Like my streets aren't as dirty as yours or somethin'We was young rebels, renegade heavy, war ready
Niggas wanted our respect 'cause they old
I'ma get it on my own, I ain't one to mold
We like, "Why be under niggas when we know they hoes?"
Had they back out selling coke, man, I know they told
I ain't get enough supply and I oversold
We was posted with the siege 'til the cells came
Get the bundles out the fridge now I know they cold
I be all over the bread like provalone
I been balling so hard now my shoulder blown
Get it back, I'm in the trap house, overlong
All the Ziploc bags and the soda gone
Niggas go on missions, mindset on going home
Then they don't have no idea why it's going wrong
If you out here with the squad then be smart with 'em
Don't play no part in it, you ain't got your heart in it
Couple niggas killers on them prison yards with it
Shooting hammers in them cars with a broad in it
What you thought she was gon' do for ya?
Not time or support, nigga, she ain't waiting two for ya
She ain't come through on the books with the loot for ya
You go to trial, she won't even buy a suit for ya
Win or lose on that verdict, it's the finals nigga
Pick a bitch 'cause that jury ain't 'gon root for ya
Ya know, trials and tribulations, man
That's what life about, ya know what I'm saying?
The fails, the falls, ups and downs
It's only to keep going, keep staring
Make you stronger, ya know what I'm saying?
Only the weak give up, but anyway
I know that I was destined
Ain't no coincidence, I know that I was blessed with
Too intelligent, I know I ain't to mess with
Rob me if you desperate, sure to get your chest hit
I be to myself just tryna get a check 'cause
Everybody else just pussy boy infected
Now my family and real niggas feel neglected
But I feel like if they love me they gon' respect it
Money on my head, how? I ain't get the message
Glass restaurant with my bitch eating breakfast
If you starin' too long, I ain't second guessing
How long you think it take to up this bitch, just a second
Hating on a nigga 'cause your bitch and him were sexing
Still got the hoe home, tryna get her pregnant
Mad at the world 'cause you hiding your affection
Worst thing of all, kill a nigga 'cause he flexing
Let a nigga flex, mad 'cause we rich
Mad and you sick, really on my dick
You know me as G Herbo, worry me 'bout shit
Turn up my flex a bit, have another fit
Curry on my hip, get hit 'bout your lip
Filled with hollow tips, that's just off the rip
Glizzy got my palms all sweaty off the grip
Fingertips sticky, I just rolled up a zip
Boulders and shit, I was like twelve
Cuz told me, "You will learn more the older you get"
Soldiers and shit, I was in the field
That's the reason I be rapping all soulful and shit
Load up the whip, this one for my niggas got hit
Pulling up top, hold up the clip
This some whole other shit, living like this
Have a nigga 25, looking old as a bitch
G Herbo, uh
Ya know, gang shit, man
Ya know, 150 dream team, 150 Roc Block
Humble Beast, Essex block
79th and Essex, Roc block
Kobe squad, cap or die, niggaUh
I call it heart music
No, not H-A-R-D, H-E-A-R-T
Heartfelt shit, you know?
Yeah, um
You know, we go through painful shit with painkillers 'cause we soldiers ourselves
I'm just staring in the palm of my hand
Thinkin, "Should I pop this Perc?"
"No, it might kill me"
If you got PTSD, you feel me
Dead or in jail, you will be
What the cop told to the little me
Fast-forward time, not literally
If I go on tour, I'll make a mill' at least
Ma didn't have much, we didn't really eat
Therefore, I was always in the streets
You didn't hear who hit at me in no tweets
That's 'cause it was some real beef
E'ryday a shootout for four weeks
Four thirty clips, we four deep
Can't hug the block 'cause we ride with Glocks
So you already know this is real beef
Yeah, since I got rich all these people in my life depend on me
So you know I gotta smoke weed
Quit gangbangin', got more cheese
I don't know buddy, he know me
And you know we shinin'
Everybody with me got a Rolly 
Nigga rich, you know he smashin' 
Security freak like roadie
And I miss my brodie 
Slap stickin' my forty 
Still exotic smokin' 
Got something that I owed him 
Spit hood bibles
For niggas that get bumped, sons go pick it up
That's the hood cycle 
So I'm tryna go flyin', ain't got no opps
I don't want no lil' rivals
That's the hood cycle
When you ain't got no money
Everybody in the hood like you
When you start makin' some money
Everybody in the hood get excited, too
But ain't nobody did nothin' for you
Now they lookin' like, "Damn, who invited you?"
When you can't give 'em nothin'
That's when they start to feel somethin' 
Gimme some space, I don't trust nobody
Gon' make me kill somethin'
And they all love me
Deep at shows when I was this broke nigga
I ain't seen all of you
Not a call from you
Moved out grandma crib
Right out front used to get in shootouts
I was just a kid
Shoulda got some money, bought you a house
And now you dead, I regret all the time I spent without
I was deep in the streets
Jack that kid, tryna ball, who out?
Foolish things I did
Sorry for how I lived
My mama lost without you, she ain't gotta tell me
I look in her eyes and see it
Walkin' in my house, my eyes was red
Demons talkin' inside my head
Glock was out of lead 
So evidently I had to spread
When God got me out of bed 
Let me hop out right on my leg
Oh, I know what you sayin'
You must want me to go chase some bread
Nigga, talkin' 'bout what you hear
I thought you was the man 
Sayin' that ho gave you some head 
Where all that shit in my bed? 
I'm just tryin' to come in the house and fuck
I don't wanna come in no house and fuss
Girl, why you gotta get loud and cuss?
Gon' head, pull that blouse all up
Let me get it from the back or somethin'
Fuck it, gonna put you on the couch, now what? 
I done fell in love 
For the month
Now we in the club
All these diamonds on
She got a fat ass, climbin' the pole
She lookin' like a muh'
Just to walk up in this bitch that gave me some rolls
Why don't I throw some money?
You gettin' ones back up off the floor
Charlamagne, you fuckin' donkey
White teacher at school caught me as a flunkie
'Cause I was a fuckin' junkie
And I admit it, coulda wrecked the whip
I fell asleep, I'm lucky
Had I listened to him
'Coulda fell a victim to the streets, I'm lucky
Now I ride past in a Bent like, "You fuckin' honkyJust a nigga off the block tryna chase them dollaz
You boys broke, I thank the lord I dont face them problems
Im at the table, full plate eating steak wit goblins
Walk in the shop counting them knots
Like "I'll take the Robins"
Herbo just a young nigga
Love 2 Stunt nigga

I hope it come quicker
And they hate that im up nigga

At 14 it was cool, me and the guys was hoopin'

Of course by 16 we was trappin', then I started rappin'
At 17 I started cashin', don't know how it happened
But i wouldn't call it magic
I spent it all like magic
More than I imagined
And ain't no nigga gave me shit, but they always askin'
And I don't owe a nigga shit

Now I'm the first born son my mama proud to say
And now she all smiles I had to take the frowns away
Used to be a wild child I had to calm down
My Grandma used to worry pray for me I'm grown now
Success leadership I gained it on my own wow
And now my Grandma gone they want me to be strong how
I might just loose it all you say somthin' to me wrong bow
Don't stare at me too long don't come through on my phone foul
I fuck around curse out the courtroom at my own trial
Like fuck the judge you never wanted to give me a chance
Don't wanna see me greet the people see me shaking hands
Don't want your kids watching my shit on MTV jams
So if I honour any honour nigga I'l be damned
I'm fighting' cases now the judge want me to go to school
I graduated from the street what I'm supposed to do
You don't understand my lifestyle what I'm goin' thru
Just think about if you was me and what if I was you
A nigga try and take my life ain't I'm supposed to shoot
If I stay in the hood will I grow up as old as you
When niggas raise they own sister gotta mold her too
You mother had a nose to smell their had a nose to toot
You feel me

Couldn't take a bus we ain't had no pass
Moms at work we ain't had no ride
Now I might be in Bermuda on a beach house riding' scooters
I just might jump in the Bentley

Nigga know I still be with them shooters
And the road ya I keep them on standby
Real street nigga I ain't never goin fold

And I been on road like err' night
Doin' shows like err' night

Remember 2012 I was in the van high
Ridin' wit a couple pf my guys
Couple of my niggas dead now
See a lot of my niggas disapear before my eyes
Couple of em in the feds now
If I kill a nigga dead would it make me the bad guy
And they actin' like I'm scared now
Don't think that you won't end up on the red eye
Still running' them hittaz now
I don't wanna relax

Last thing great Granny said is why

Granny please would you stay alive
Start praying' up to God tears running' down my eyes
Could you please help her stay alive
Right side of her body still parazlized

Everybody that been through something man, cause I'm from the struggle so that's who I do it for
And all my fans, look
Remember me? Yeah I came from nothing
Stayed humble on my grind, stuck to it, now I wake up stunting
But I had to humble down on my own
Fuck niggas I'ma die on my own
So thats why I'm alone
Remember Me, Fazo, and Manski used to hoop at the center
Now big homie gone and broski eating tuna for dinner
Then they really ask me why I'm a sinner
Cause I'ma already gonna die by the system, So why abide by the system
Ain't nobody did shit for Herbo
So ain't nobody getting shit from Herbo, But a clip from Herbo
I'm just tryin to live good man and take care of my family
Never hated I just waited shouldn't be no nigga mad at me
And I gotta stay strapped cause I know niggas after me

I stayed up late and when day, came woke up early
Early, I'm starting to feel boxed in
Losing my conscious
What if I'm trapped in?
What if I'm locked in?
These bars can't hold me
The Lord consoles me
Tryin to make it right but wrong is all around
And I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm down, I'm down, I'm down, I'm down
I'm 19 years going on 39

Then where we at, back on that fucking 9
Fiends and detectives trying to see who got that pack jumping on the 9
Momma told me stay away
My Grandma told me stay away
But right back out there everyday like that crack on that fucking 9
Young niggas don’t listen just load up they pistols and stunt for them bitches and front how they living indictments on pictures
Nah I ain't fucking with them insta-feds
Unless they lock me up for sipping lean, fuck around and get the chair
Cause I be pouring this shit everywhere
Like Wayne said so I don't feel it when it hit but I ain't never scared
Cause when its time to go its time to go
That's why I'm going hard now to leave my granny and my mom some dough
Pay to get my sister through school
You know some shit like that
Not the cars, clothes shit you lose and get right back 
That's just the way it is man

Free all my niggas man, RIP my niggas man
I'm just going to let the beat lead me out man, that's all I got
Cause am I worthy?
I stayed up late and when day, came woke up early
Early, I'm starting to feel boxed in
Losing my conscious

Niggas don't be on they block so we ain't clapping no mo'
But just like we was in a war I still be strapped with it though
30s they wait on me right at the telly everytime I'm traveling though
And I want 20k for a show, 10 or 15 what I'm averagin' though
My big brother be copping them O's 10 or 15 what he averagin' though
Yay he usually be breaking them down but that's 50k if you grabin' them hoe
I heard you got your chain snatched then you snitched on a nigga
So you can't go to your hood cause you switched on your niggas
I got niggas in the prison you can ask them how they living
If they tell you that they eating everyday like thanksgiving
If you see that nigga with the squad treat him like a god
I ain't never cracked a card, I was out trapping hard
Junkies knocking at my door but everything sold out
Think 'bout running in my trap it's guns in the whole house
So you acting like a bitch you steady running your mouth
I should slap him with the 45 knock him cold out
Ambulance have to pick him up, he get rolled out
Bibby nice you playing with G Herbo you get blowed down
Blacking out, yeah I'm blacking out

Flood my wrist I did that, came out my whip I did thatThis song go out to anybody who lost one of they homies man
You ever lost somebody
That felt like you was in this shit by yourself
But you gotta fight man
It's hard
My momma used to say
"Never quit, baby that just don't exist!"
And just cause she'll suck ya dick
Don't mean you could trust the bitch!
I'm just giving you the real
Cause I don't come from Hollywood or Beverly Hills
I'm from where mothers don't care and babies get killed
Where you gotta rob and go steal for stomachs to fill
And it's hard for a young, black nigga like myself
Where the police compare oneself with everybody else
So that means if you yourself they think you're everybody else
So I don't care 'bout no one else, just my family and myself
Yeah, that's just my way of thinkin'
In my city and it helps cause no one gives a fuck
About me, you, or nobody else
And it's cool, I'm still livin' over East, we still chillin'
Sippin' lean, smokin' Swishers, stackin' hunnits to the ceilin'
We still winnin', we just fightin' to survive
It's a shame I gotta ride with this nina on my side
They used to say...
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
Rings and watches, kings, deposits
Chains that seemed preposterous
Gettin' paper never seemed monotonous
Time is money, the streets is watchin' like a scene from Clockers
Fiends is nauseous, chicken wings they gossip
Niggas wings is tied up in dreams and product
The block gets hotter when the streets is dried up
We react like shottas when niggas is fired up
On some James Brown shit, I'mma take you higher
To stay live niggas still livin' like The Wire
A tight rope so they steppin' on that white dope
I ride with my niggas cause that's the cycle
Suppliers, buyers, leaning like they biased
This is circus, niggas and broads wearin' wires
The eye of the tiger in my iris
Eyes on the prize, I'm a fighter
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
Me and my pops shared the same home phone number
Called us "single parent home," sorry, wrong number
I did my push-ups, and my homework, and my house work
And my dirt, talk back until my mouth hurt
Daddy furious, Trey hopped in the car though
Close the car door
Wonderin' why our father God couldn't spare Rod for
Spoiler alert
Trey get out the car and walk home with his heart broke
My poppa love me, opps left me
Stains fed me, and they dressed me
Come home freshly dressed and he addressed me
And he pressed me
Called me a thief, called me a boy, called me a coward
At least he ain't call me from county
With an hour worth of advice on 5-day
Why Doughboy couldn't have the same pops that he had on Friday?
I'd rather be a real man than a real nigga, real talk
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in
I've seen mommas treat their daughters like the scum of the Earth
Snake niggas put their homies since they was young on a shirt
It's your life well, tell me what it's worth
Cause when you come across that death you don't get another birth
You better live it up
Haters want me dead, they better work, I ain't gonna give it up
Fuck around get hit with every one like you ain't feel enough
Pussy niggas gotta feel the drugs before they start feelin' tough
In the streets I'm tryna feel the love but I ain't feelin' nothin'
I love my squad, I love the hustle
I love success cause I'm from the struggle
I used to think that I could go back what I used to do
Now I cry less and less at all my homie's funerals
It's hard but it's gonna get harder and harder
Why momma always tell me just be smart and keep your guard up
I said to myself: check your back, put your squad up
Bibby tell me how to keep your head above water
Never quit, never give in
Hey, don't you quit
Never give in"I'll call the cops!"
"Yeah baby, you call the police and tell them we got two imposters up here running a scam because I'm Ms. Frankie Lymon!"
"I'm Mrs. Frankie Lymon!" "I am Mrs. Frankie Lymon"
"Jesus Christ, it's a God damn game show!"
Gang! Ballin' Like I'm Kobe the mixtape
They like "Herbo you so fly", that's everywhere I go
They like "Herbo you so high", and I'm like "yeah I know"

I'm so high, I may O.D, I feel like Frankie Lymon
I might spend a couple grand a week and stack enough to buy a couple diamonds
I might buy my sis a couple 'fits if she get an A on her assignment
I'm a young nigga, I'm a businessman, I take care of business, man
And I and a slap a bitch in a minute, man, so yes, I'm a minuteman
Keep my pistol on me everywhere I go, don't give a fuck about no sentence, man
Off the drink you know it got me moving slow, I'm leaning like I'm trynna kick a stand
Sippin' drank, smokin' pack, wishin' I could get my niggas back
Rollin' up the thrax, pour a hi-tech, but I really miss the act
Fuck a nigga bitch, then I give her back
Don't want her to get attached
A nigga shoot at me, bitch I'm shooting back
Make sure you remember that
I don't gotta worry bout who finna' blow, all my niggas into that
I don't look at tags, while I'm in the store, all I do is spend a sack
I don't trip about it, I'm a hustler, I know I'mma get it back
20's, 50's, 100's, Herbo thumbin' through a check
Want a feature? Hit my jack, I ain't hoppin' on it if it's wack
Fuck a industry catch me in the streets, might not send your money back
And my gun up on me if a nigga run up on me, he ain't running backOh my god what is this? An L beat?

We let off shots every time they come outside
And if you looking for G Herbo, I bet I'm outside
You niggas rap about respect, well I'mma die 'bout mine
7-9, Roc Block, that's where I reside
Seen a lot of niggas die, but I'm not traumatized
Catch G Herbo on the 8 Block with a whole lot of savages
Lil' cuz in the cut posted, toting .30s and the Mac and shit
Bet not ride through, if we don't know you cuz poppin' out and he clappin' shit
Lil cuz only 16, really with the shits and he ain't average
Run up on you with the Glocks, send a couple shots, oso accurate
Spin again around the block, empty out the Glock, ain't nobody miss
And free Lil Mally, you know that's my lil' bro, he my other shooter
Mad Max, that's my big bro, you know Lil Merch'll do you?
I'm a Robin, Truey fiend, Gucci, Louis fiend, Herbo do his thing
All my jewelry, hundreds in my pocket, broke boy, miss me with the foolery
If you ain't No Limit, you can't cool with me
And I'm that nigga, I been fuckin' bitches sayin' they went to school with me
Catchin' feelings, that ain't got nothing to do with me
Verse 
A lot of niggas actin' funny now cause I'm getting money now
Just cause all my niggas countin' hundreds now, niggas wanna come around
I don't fuck with niggas, only with my 10 year niggas, them No Limit niggas
We 150, gotta keep em with me, cause for me they'll kill a nigga
When I'm in my shows, bitches run up on me soon as I hit the scene
Pourin' up a sixth of lean, smoking dope, sippin' drinks
Ferragamo belt hold up 20 racks stuffed in my denim jeans
And when I ride off, Glock 40 sitting on my lap with the beam
All these drugs that I'm off, I really need to quit
Off the shits right now, I call Maneski, I'll tell him bring a zip
I make money outta state, take it to the store or put it on the strip
And we ain't fuckin' with the jakes
Snatch us up, bet you we don't remember shitUh, I used to be trippin' like a motherfucker, uh
That's 'cause I ain't listen to a motherfucker
Used to take a Crush and pour a six up in that motherfucker
Ran it up and now I'm richer than a motherfucker
And I'm glistenin' like a motherfucker 
I say fuck 'em all, 'cause they don't got no love for us 
We way up top, I don't see nobody but God above us 
Get so high, I feel like I'm in the stars
Matter fact, pull a Wraith out the garage
I just might fuck around, buy eight cars
Know it's gon' only be one I'ma drive
I'm the one who made me everything I'ma be
Chose my road like the Wizard of Oz
Pop out, I look like a blizzard, my God
Look at my neck and my wrist, oh my God
This all the shit I worked hard and I prayed for
Know I deserve it, that's word to Yah
Love all my fans, and that's word to y'all
Twenty a verse, yeah, you heard the ball
Been stackin' and grindin' and stackin' and grindin' and stackin' and grindin' 'til somethin' tell me, "Herb, just ball"
Ten thousand ones in the VIP, watch it fall
Ain't gon' see only me shine, watch us all
No, I ain't here all the time, but they still show me love
So this bitch on my hip, watch your dawg
Ain't with that drunk shit, we ain't come to brawl
Aww, you know lil' bro lettin' it off
Really it took me to stop him to keep him from droppin' you
Should've just let him get off
Bitch, I go hard in the paint, but I still'll pop out, start shootin', I'm Steph and Gasol
They tryna copy my swag but they can't keep up, they just gettin' what's left of the sauce
They like, "Damn, Swervo, what the fuck? Why you keep switchin' up?"
Ayy, I'm the king 'round this bitch, listen up 
And it cost nothin' to get you hit up 
Get a nigga crib lit up 
Walk up, hit his rib and up 
Two to the head, he shakin', he checkin', they want you to live, get up
That's the shit I live, it's nuts 
I'm alive 'cause I don't give a fuck 
You tryna slide, it's nothin'
I seen homicide, it's nothin', they said they outside, he stuntin'
It's 4:30 somethin', he on Live, but bitch, we been ridin' since one
And we gon' ride as one, we all goin' down as one
Got three thirty clips, that's a hundred
Cops had me, I ain't say nothin'
Told 'em to suck it, fuck 'em
Still in this shit, I ain't duckin'
Worth too many millions
Foenem say get from around here, you trippin', you buggin'
I'm just so used to thuggin'
Grip in this bitch, I'ma buck 'em
Up with the ball, I'ma truck 'em
I gotta ball like the Rucker
Game on the line, I'ma snug 'em, fuck 'em
Guess I'm a by-any-means type of motherfucker
We not in a frat, but we step 
I got more stripes than a ref 
The police behind me, I left 
I'm runnin' 'til I'm out of breath 
I told 'em I needed some help 
They looked at me like they was deaf 
We tried to be like BMF 
But niggas was all for theyself 
You get extorted for playin' tough
Nigga, no cap, I was on the move, shots went off and my Glock had jammed up
We ain't even makin' no R.I.P. post 'til we come hit a couple y'all mans up
I don't even bring my niggas 'round rappers, I know they gon' fuck my face up
Know all my niggas gon' take somethin'
Say that you a dog, nigga, shake somethin' 
Broad daylight, nigga, face somethin' 
Fuck school, we was in the hood tryna make somethin', you was with a bitch tryna cake somethin' 
Fix my plate, bet I ate somethin', you was lookin' for a reason so that you can hate somethin' 
You can't keep all of that shit bottled in, I wish your lil' pussy ass say somethin' 
He did, we slid 
We don't give a fuck 'bout your kid 
My brother like Glocks and FN's, but Savage gon' keep him a SIG 
The coroner thought he had a lacefront on, the way this Draco split his wig 
You a baby when it come to this gangster shit, somebody get this nigga a bib, pussy

Gangster 
My Rollie finally dance, OTF a family plan
We ain't had no car to slide on opps, I used my family van
Lost Iris I died, Nuski died, it's like I died again
Fresh out the feds, can't talk to you, they gon' try to tap me in
I'ma put my money inside this music 'cause I can't buy a friend
I tried like three, four times when they got locked, can't try it again
I choose you over you, I won't decide again
They having a gangster party in Heaven, I wish they'd let us in 
Niggas in Heaven havin' a gangster party

Gangster 
I was on a mission with my mans 
Gunpowdered up, now I'm pissin' on my hands
We just pickin' up on what them older niggas and them was sayin'
Sixteen we got fanned down, caught us with our pants down
I was on the block last, Glock nine, rocks, glass
Stop signs, hot cars filled with gas, black masks
If he makin' rap disses, he can't get no 'Raq pass
Fail, how you think you gon' excel, with yo' black ass? 
Crack baby pops left when it got bad
Layin' palettes, all your clothes in a black bag
Almost drove that boy insane, so he got a bag
Now he hopping off the plane, he got jet lag
Saw a murder, just a kid, he was traumatized
Kept his Glock, now he locked for a homicide
And he ain't trippin' that he's sitting in a box
'Cause it is what it is, and it's not, what it's not, nigga
Niggas in Heaven havin' a gangster party 
See, this right here, this a gangster story 
Gangster 
I was raised around gangsters , fell in love with danger
Deep up in these streets, might have to fall in love with strangers
House party, thirty deep, we came strapped, all bangers
It was more than five shooters so we clapped all angles
Where I'm from, a nigga die, the whole city'll try to claim
Where I'm from, you don't make it, you gotta die to be famous
My little cuz walkin' with a gun, I wish he stayed with gamin'
I can't say I'd die for y'all, for real, 'cause I see the streets change
When the worst enemy died on the other side, I ain't feel it
I don't talk to Master P, just 'cause of Herb I claim No Limit
Then I seen't him with his new girl, text his phone, like, "Bro, you winning"
One-fifty and one-fifty, that's 300, ain't no difference

This a gangster party, this a gangster party
Niggas in Heaven havin' a gangster party 
See, this right here, this a gangster story

Five to nine, yates back to colfax terrortown was on the map
Niggas know there ain't a bitch we ain't fucked, taking hoes back
Used to do pelly coats with the screw back
Chrome buck 50, matched the new gat
Leather  with the wheat timbs
Fazo had one that was blue black
G Fazo, no need to say more
Punch so hard, make you wanna shoot back
Shawty off MB don't do that
Fuck that, I ain't even wanna talk about it
Miss all my niggas, white chalk about 'em
Naw they ain't like us, niggas bitch made
Lil nigga, big gun, that was Lil Gage
Fucked up, lil bro was lil sis age
Made 1800 on a good day
"You gon end up dead or broke
Or in jail like your dad and uncle," shit, that's what the hood say
Might as well sell dope, rob, steal anything tryna stay afloat
I'm on point like an arrow
Aim the Glock like PeeWee, tell the opp, "hello"
Got smoke like Dero, remember walking down Marquette, me and G Ferro
Hoodied up if we got to blow
Still fuck the opps crazy, RIP Alamo
79th Street raised me, some of my niggas since babies
No Limit crazy
Remember nights off the lazy
Mom's telling me to slow down, steady tryna persuade me
I was deep in the streets, she calling and getting no sleep
Scared for her baby
I was running the east
Turning into Herbo G
The big humble beast, ay'Member when I used to skip school, hit the block instead?
Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to slang under cameras like "Fuck the feds"
Diaries of a knucklehead
And if you out here in these streets, you can understand
Diaries of a knucklehead
I put my life up on the line cause I love my mans
Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to stand up on that block like, "Fuck the feds"
Hustle hard, we was stackin' every buck we had
In that field, 24 but we was duckin' lead
Bullets flyin' close range and they was lucky legs
Young niggas, dumb niggas, we ain't listen, had to learn
Killed my homies, now we grievin', load the heaters, let 'em burn
Gotta keep it, I don't know when it's my turn
So I'm ridin' through my hood, and I'm grippin' on it firm
Niggas say they gon' kill me, be a man of your word
.40 burst, hit the dirt, call a hearse, get a shirt
And the hood ain't see me lately, I'm like, "Y'all gon' get this work"
Niggas diss about me crazy, all that shit gon' get 'em murked
Don't do that
Found out where you hang out and have my shooters come through there
'Member I ain't have no gear, now I can't think what to wear
Used to tote them Dillingers, man how'd I get to here?
Now I'm signin' signatures and fuckin' bitches everywhere
'Member when I used to skip school, hit the block instead?
Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to slang under cameras like "Fuck the feds"
Diaries of a knucklehead
And if you out here in these streets, you can understand
Diaries of a knucklehead
I put my life up on the line cause I love my mans
Diaries of a knucklehead
And I'm a product of screamin'
And got a lot just off the top if it's the topic of demons
We talkin' weed cause I need it, niggas faded and deep
If you need a fade then you get it, blow an 8th, then I speak
These niggas playin' for keeps,  the rain ready to make you go inside
Muzzle up and shovel up, just keep your gold in mind
Shoulder cold, he hold the 9, doggie I know your kind
I missed the boat, I understand, been in it 'fore the fuckin' cash
Since minute phones was in, and every bitch would let you cup her ass
But none of them was suckin' dick... see now they're suckin' dick
My niggas got the upper hand, cop me a couple grams
Taught me to stuff the Swish, papi just up and dipped
Tight grip on the shit that I'm drownin' in
Can't step in my momma crib without counselin'
Dip, and my face on the kicks to the south of me
Let me say you're lookin' out, but I know you got it out for me
'Member when I used to skip school, hit the block instead?
Diaries of a knucklehead
I used to slang under cameras like "Fuck the feds"
Diaries of a knucklehead
And if you out here in these streets, you can understand
Diaries of a knucklehead
I put my life up on the line cause I love my mans
Diaries of a knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead, knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead, knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead, knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead, knucklehead
Diaries of a knucklehead
Diaries of a knuckleheadI remember wishing and hoping that one day I could have it all
Now I walk in the mall and I could buy it all
Lebron, Carmelo, Chris Paul, D. Rose, young nigga I ball
And I won't settle for nothing cause once I had nothing at all
I'm flexing, I'm stuntin' on y'all
Young nigga, I didn't have nothing and that's why I want it all
I need to wake up and in a mansion with chandeliers and marble floors
Fly in a jet, go spend 80k on my neck, and open up Ferrari doors
Can't settle for less
Young nigga done earned my respect
Now what you gon' do to get yours?
I got off my ass and got on my way to a check
I'm getting money, now go and get yours
I be riding in foreigns, pouring up 4's in 20's
With 30 clips hanging out .40's
Me and my brodies, duck at high speeds from the police
Cruising and smoking on OG
I'm thinking of millions, movin' my momma out them buildings
And under a 80 foot ceiling, nigga
I used to look up to them niggas who was hittin' licks, that was gettin' dough
Didn't making a difference to me if them niggas was wearing a jersey or whipping that snow
Young nigga from the hood, do whatever to get to the pros
Give 'em the dope, zip it, he flip it and go
And after my 8th grade year at school, never planned on getting a job
Young nigga watched Paid In Full, had dreams on gettin' the Saab
Rocking diamonds and gold, Murcielago's on ForgiatosI can feel it in the air
85% communication nonverbal, man, you gotta stay sharp
That might be pussy to the next nigga
But this game we play about durability 
Who gon' last the longest?
You're only as gangsta as your accomplishments as a man, nigga
So when I say I'm goin' gangsta, that mean I'm workin' on somethin'
Straight up
I can feel it in the air
I can feel it in the air, ooh-ooh
I can feel it in the air, the air
I didn't hear it in your voice
I can feel it in the air
Re-spin the block, we just seen the opps 
Now we ain't finna go back inside 'til we send some shots
I don't get to talk a lot, but I seen the most
I don't know if it was an angel or I seen a ghost 
I could have saved my bro that day, got caught up with his pole 
I was supposed to yell "four-seven" first, but I couldn't even clear my throat 
When some shit ain't right, I swear I feel it in my soul 
I'm still under investigation, I wouldn't have been if had told 
We was loaded, unlocked all the doors 
If one man show any weakness, then we all exposed
Hit the safehouse, had a local spot with all the poles 
Quick shit, switch whips, those was audibles
Everything Max told me, I guess only God'll know 
My whole vision fell in line like dominoes
I'm just tryna rap and grind, but I'm in the streets 
I gotta separate from my bros, I'm way in too deep 
We got enemies, whenever we meet, they poppin' the iron
So tell me what that say 'bout us if we on top of the line 
And the police gon' forever try and put stop to my shine
Pyramids, they got my face up at the top of the sun 
Mad I'm always able to pay all these impossible fines 
Come from sacrifices, hard work, investments and time
And my gut, I follow it, I'm never neglectin' the signs 
Appreciate the lessons and the blessings I keep catchin', they're mine
My biggest accomplishment as a man was acknowledgin' 
What I was doin' wrong 
When the world around me was full of chaos
Not pointin' a finger at nobody but myself 
For not takin' control of my destiny
I see people all around the world sayin' what they wanna be
Askin' why they ain't there yet 
And it's two reasons to me every time 
Either you haven't fully committed yourself to where you wanna be
Or your time just ain't come yet
It's that simple 
All I know is loyalty 
Been a gangsta morally 
I'm still here 'cause I ain't care 'bout who was gangsta more than me 
Act like they forgot my past, shit must be historical
Ever seen a gangsta die? Nigga, that's rhetorical
Watch too many gangstas die , seen too many mama's cry 
I'm gon' chase a hundred-million, I don't wanna be no homicide 
Look at all these niggas laugh and smile and his mama cryin' 
I can feel these niggas' love fake, but I don't wonder why
I don't wanna tote the gat no more, but I know I don't wanna die
I just feel my intuition tickin', I don't wanna slide
Youngin' was just itchin' in a blink, and I ain't wanna drive
Granny shit got hot, I'm at the spot but I ain't on the five
Sergeant pulled my Tesla over, got my gun on the side
Can't take off, she eight months pregnant with my son at the time 
Fuck it, gotta take a charge, borrow money, extra large 
Ain't this some shit? Look at God 
He ain't even wanna search the car 
You can't separate or compare freedom from peace 
Because no one can be at peace unless they have freedom 
And we're not even born free 
At least that's where I'm from 
Everything I seen growin' up was poverty-stricken 
Shit was damaged, taken from us, or taken advantage of already 
And this is what we exposed to all day
That's what damaged us 
And if you don't understand what I'm talkin' about
You never been through it
I guess you one of the people I'm sayin' this to and not for
You feel me?
Ooh-ooh
I can feel it in the air
Ooh-ooh
I can feel it in the airAnd we sippin' purple nigga, yeah
Honestly 
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Wannabes, they under me
Honestly I wanna be
On the beach, Hawaii sand up under me
Comfortably 
I just want 100 G's , foreign V's , Louis V 
They like, "who is he?"
Honestly when I was broke as fuck, you ain't notice me
You thought days I was posted up
At the county jail where I'm 'posed to be
Now young nigga eating overly, I got hunnids old as trees
And money don't grow on trees
But I'm gon' blow it like leaves, ayy
Pull up with turbo V's, ayy, two-door AMG's, ayy
I started witnessing some of the shit
That felt like it was make-believe, ayy
Lil' nigga neck on freeze, ayy
Spent 100 racks on these, ayy
Seen't 'em tryna keep up and then lost everything
I can't let that happen to me, ayy
Feeling alive, I'm so happy to be, ayy
You killing my vibe, fuck how long you bitches you see me
Be happy for me, ayy
I'm fresh all the time, but you know my kicks ain't Buscemi
Capital G Fazos, Nike need me on the payroll
I just took these off a day ago, killers gon' do what I say so
Angels gon' give you a halo, and we got money to lay low
Now when it come to the bread, I go with it like mayo
Can't let it go to my head. I had way too many days broke
Honestly
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Wannabes, they under me
Honestly I wanna be

They like, "who is he?"

Get rich and I make my mama proud of me
A young rich nigga, that's what I'm 'bout to be
Rolling gas, boy, yo shit not loud to me
I'm getting used to the fake niggas crowding me
I got demons and these niggas brought 'em out of me
I'm on my boss shit, ain't no clowning me
Let's fuck up Saks Fifth, hit the town on me
Me and Herbo pull up in a Bentley coupe
Ain't not telling what we'll say or what we'll do
Smoke Gelato out the zip, feel like jet fuel
We'll never let a fuck nigga know our next move
Run up them big bags, that's what we into
We just some real niggas, look what we been through
I put Gucci on my backpack, but I don't like school
I know you may love me, but bitch I don't like you
Honestly
Honestly
Everything I wanna be
Gotta work 'til it come to me
Ain't wanna be no wannabe
Wannabes, they under me
Honestly I wanna be
On the beach, white sand up under me

Foreign V's , Louis V 
They like, "who is he?"There's a million downfalls in this shit nigga
Just keep your head up
Listen homie, if you gotta go this way about it
Just be smart and know it's a different way about it
Put your game plan together and go play about it
And when that shit get real, just make your way up out it
Youngin' play ya part, know your role, guard your heart
Stay away from the ratchet ass hoes and the narcs
If you gotta keep the ratchet, only show it when you sparkin'
If you riding in the whip keep that shit in your compartment
You wanna be a hustla, wanna be a menace, nigga?
Better listen from the start to the finish, nigga
You see them clowns put they business on pictures, nigga?
Watch how they gon' have a record like Guinness, nigga
But listen though, fuck that other shit, just get the dough
Stay to yourself and always treat the hoes like the ho
Don't underestimate them, treat the pros like the pro
It's some heavies in this game that took their fate to lames
Don't be out here chasing gangs, just stay in your lane
And no such thing as day ones cause niggas ain't the same
Don't ever fold once shit hits you, gotta take the pain
And pay attention to who's with you when that paper fade
Listen nine, only roll your pint in the crib
If they get you and yo niggas, ain't no snitch up, do the bid
Hold it down, grow your mind, do the time, make it big
Play it safe, never wild, you got a fucking life to live
Get the Audi cuz it's classy, get yo lady friend a Benz
Only smoke it if it's gas, you way too grown for mid
You gotta make something shake young nigga
Get it in, only love her if you trust her
But be cautious even then
Stay on top of all your taxes, IRS, they don't be playin
Don't you ever make a move and let that money in yo hand
Be good to all your peoples, boss up be a man
And if you ever need advice, you can hit my line againWhere I come from, niggas greasy , you deceive me 
I got rich, I motivate my niggas like I'm Jeezy
I could leave the house, get caught without my gun, easy
Honestly, I know nobody but my son need me 
I went broke to see you eat, I know you don't believe me
Just be patient with me, bae, I know you wanna leave me
Took my heart from off my sleeve, replaced it with some freezie  
Knee-deep in them trenches toting .40 Glocks with Deezy
Walking through the valley of the shadow , all these niggas shallow 
I'm with apes, these niggas snakes and shit, I see they rattles
Niggas singing like A Boogie, man, I hear they high notes
Hit my niggas out in High Bridge if they wanna battle
You ain't really living like that, pussy, why you lie for? 
Eye-for-eye, so the same shit I cry over, I die for
Make you famous if we pull your name, something like a raffle 
How you trust her? Adam told us she gon' bite the apple
Glass in the face , Rolex fucking up my eyesight
I'll make yo' ass look away 
Fuck it, if they put a bag on my head, I'll put a bag on yo' face 
Baby, you ain't got to take a cab, nah, I'll put yo' ass in a Wraith 
I don't wanna go in the club if they ain't letting me in with the ratchet
I can not even trust again again, 'cause I know niggas nasty
You know my jacket is Balmain and I got the denim to match it
I swear, I don't wanna be broke again, nah, I can only imagine
I remember I— I— I ain't have no money, standing on the block
Yeah, I remember why— why, nigga wasn't really tryna make no money
I was chasing homicide 
For the mob niggas died, nigga, yours can't come outside 
I ain't really thinking like that no more, I listen now, it's a million or more in my vision now
Got a big ass crib out in Bel Air Hills, everybody get a plate in my kitchen now 
I been setting up plates for a whole lot of M's, did the same last year, and I'm richer now 
Last time seen bro, had a bust down Patek, now he got somethin' to live for, richer now
And my car go whoo, like a whistler, pop out, ten chains on like a prisoner 
Man, I could've been a statistic , now I can teach a young nigga 'bout business 
Speaking of business, please do not be no witness , no, we don't leave no witness 
How the fuck is it hard to find nigga like me? I'm not hidin'
Glass in the face , Rolex fucking up my eyesight
I'll make yo' ass look away 
Fuck it, if they put a bag on my head, I'll put a bag on yo' face 
Baby, you ain't got to take a cab, nah, I'll put yo' ass in a Wraith 
I don't wanna go in the club if they ain't letting me in with the ratchet
I can not even trust again again, 'cause I know niggas nasty
You know my jacket is Balmain and I got the denim to match it

Everybody depending on me and shit, man

All my life I had to fight, that's why I sip the purple
Smoking OG, tryna get to me some Oprah money
Young nigga don't put nothing but family over money
But ain't that funny how your family fuck you over money?
Take the food right out ya mouth like they weren't over Sunday
I spit that real shit, ain't no exaggerations or nothing
I been through it, I get through it, no excuses, just get to it
I get smarter, I go harder, I'm into it
I remember momma mad at me
She found out I was smoking weed
Now when my momma hear my voice outside she know it's me
She never thought I'd get from over east to overseas
But I gotta stay in the states cause I'm still fighting cases
I swear them crackers try they best to bring you back to basics
Don't wanna see you shine, they hate to see you grind
Smile all in ya' face but they can't wait to see you cryin'
No hater, you can't bring me down but yeah, I see you tryin'
I'm in that Hemi flyin', smoking, thinking 'bout my niggas gone and doing time
I keep in touch with my all my niggas, yeah, they doin' fine
Free Gillie, free Maneski, free James, free Bruce, free the gang
Celebratin', all my niggas, we got chains but we ain't changed
Still the same, only thing we see different is the lanes
Niggas switch up just to get to mine
These niggas quick to switch up, I ain't with that picking sides
All my brothers still my brothers, good or bad, right or wrong
We get jammed up, bet my brother do his bid, ride along
That's that shit, I wouldn't trade it for a million bucks
How the fuck you eat with niggas you can't even trust?
It's this bitch named Karma and she mean as fuck
You do enough dirt and watch, the score gon' even up
I'm in the booth, it's 5 AM, you ain't even up
I might not leave till' 9 to 10, I gotta clean it up
This shit too easy, don't believe me? You ain't seen enough
It's G Herbo, I'm the hottest, I'm just being honest
I swear I say that shit so much that I can't even stop it
If I tell you my next move, you can't even stop it
And this bad bitch I'm with look Belizean tropic

DJ Victoriouz with me in the building 
C-Sick
I had to run it up again
Lost that shit so quick, I'm thinkin' back like, "What the fuck I spend?"
My homies in the pen', I'm talkin' to them like, "How much I send?"
I just ran it up, couldn't even complain, I was built to win 
Sometimes I think why God keep blessin' me and I'm committin' sins?
How come my bitch keep stressin' me? Man, look at the crib we in
Hell yeah, I'ma live it up with my niggas, look at all the shit we did
And my neck start hurtin' when I put my chains on, 'cause them bitches big
Bitch, it's Herbo, you know what it is 
Everything I do big 
And you might think I'm this big time rapper, but I still gotta pop out with the SIG
Before rap, I was tryna be a big time trapper, and stay in the trap, I did
When I played in traffic, that bitch on my lap, and I put it on Cap, I did
Late night, E-Way, off an eight of the Act', it was just me and Cap out speedin'
I remember it was snow everywhere on the ground, left the jakes in the alley, high speedin'
Snatch a Perc' from somebody, I need it, uh
I don't feel like fightin' my demons
Yeah, that's why I was pourin' them eights in them Sprites, I ain't even feel like fightin' my demons
Missing studio sessions and meeting with labels back then, I ain't like intervening
Now I was at the meeting with Epic
How did it go? It was epic 
But, Swervo, you said you still independent, how you was at the meetin'? You flexin'
Just know I'm eatin', I can teach you a thing or two, baby, come here, you sexy, uh
Brought this shit off Essex
Now I go sell out in Texas
You 'posed to be real nigga, try to confront me, pussy ain't call, you texted

And you know we gon' pull up, you know everybody got bullets and we rockin' vest-eses

That shit comin' in, shout out my folks gettin' in, we fuckin' with Mexicans
And that shit gettin' out, shout out my folks gettin' it off, got chickens and breast-eses
Who know how to whip? Lil' bro done fork with the soft and they want a lil' less for it
Hurry up 'fore they dip, out of LA, fuckin' off, givin' white hoes the rest of it
That shit real deal, they ain't touchin' it

Thief, I'm a hustler, had a hundred at my mama's, boy
Jumped in that water and I turned into a piranha, boy
Boy, and my slime gon' kill like an anaconda, boy
Pop a Perc', get superpowers for real like a Wakanda boy
Let a nigga disrespect you, man, what kind of boy?
Boy, smokin' Sherb', Gelato, this ain't marijuana, boy

And I'm a rapper, but I move like a don dada, boy
And I'm a savage, but they love me like Obama, boyI keep my pistol on me only at night
Because the haters be tripping,that's right

Late night I'm servin' fiends

If you run up on me you get blazed holmes
And I been learned that
You can't get caught without one
Especially from where I'm from
And if you get caught without that
Then you might just get your scalp cracked
Know a couple niggas that got left behind 'cuz when it's crunch time they was steps behind
It was clutch time so I kept the nine
And you never know when it's reppin' time
Yea the last time I slipped
I fuck around and got hit
Bitch niggas fuck around with the wrong clique
Must be fuckin' 'round with that shit
Yea it don't feel great but it feel safe when I walk around with the steel eight
So don't play with me cause I will spray
You'll be walkin' 'round with a steel plate
And that's real rap
Try to play me like a fuck nigga and get peeled back
Ion' trust niggas keep 'em real back
In my two-seater with the steel Mac
Pull up on 'em let the steel clap on my own shit
Drop a nigga fire the block up and get locked up at my own risk
Rather catch me wit' it on me
And I do my dirt by my lonely
I'm a real nigga I got real killas'
If I hit 'em up then they'll deal wit' 'em
L'sI made all the sacrifice

Really had to risk my life
I went down the wrong road
Sorry Ma, but this my life
I went bought my own pole
You already know what I'm on, blow

Probably thought it was my phone though
Never panicked, I didn't get it
Nigga I seen a hundred killings

Cap' died, I'm like fuck it, get him
Way before rap I was real, no limit
Fuckin' hoes who I can't trust a nigga

Matter fact I ain't gon' say nothin' else
Heard it turned out bad luck for bruh, though
Know I got everything under my belt
Tote a lil' .40 Glock, that's for my health
Remember it was just me and Max on the block
Packs came in, put thrax on the block
Overcharge niggas, get a tax on the block
First nigga with a hundred racks on the block
Could pop out without my fuckin' Glock on rock
Don't lie, they went up top
I remember them nights up top
You gon' die, they one up top
It was like 4AM on the morning of August 10th
We was on the block shootin' dice, yeah, that was when Kobe went

Wake up in Sicily, on it and sit on, open my mouth like a dentist

So used to get high outside all night, just tryna mind our business
We get caught doin' this shit, gon' get a life sentence
Bitch, my heart cold, and my ice glisten
My bitch tell me I'm too high and I'm just like, "Listen"
Gotta stay high 'cause I think too much, I get to trippin'
Gotta stay high 'cause I blink too much, I get to blickin'
'Bout a hundred million, when I get a visit
I can't let no nigga trick me through no Twitter mention
Gotta leave the hood right now or you gon' be a statistic
Gotta leave the streets right now, like that's a big decision
I make rich decisions
Graduated in the streets I'm trappin', call that payin' tuiton
And on Capo, whatever I'm worth, my niggas seein' it with me
I need a hundred-fifty
I made sacrifices for niggas who really wasn't even with me
That's why I ain't friendly, is you really with me?
'Cause I feel the envy, and this bitch a semi
And I keep it with me, like this bitch was Jimmy
Told 'em, "Bail out, nigga," I'm sittin' here, this bitch a hemi
For Big Wet and Slim, left and right hand pour out Remy, Henny
And this Draco a mini, I know you heard about Kenny
I know you heard about Benny, nigga, I ain't heard about any
Benz, bread, get niggas dead, shit I done did for plenty
I just hate that all my real niggas dead, now I got my bread up
I'm in the 'Raq so every day I still gotta keep my head up
In my boxers, finger cloth my tips and load the lead up
Say you gangbang, pussy nigga, what you scared for?
Slept in traphouses 'fore I got rich, filled up with bedbugs
Slept in halls on 78th, that's just because my mans was
For my dawgs, I done did it all, back against the wall
What you needed? It was just a call, I wasn't rich at all
Same niggas since day one, they still with me, ain't switch at all
Suck a dick, I told them people question me, can't snitch at all
And these street niggas make the rules, now they switched the law
Can't respect 'em without no capacity, a bitch involved
And I'm still with my dawgs, and we duckin', ditchin' laws
We already beat this shit, nigga, we just tryna stay rich, that's all
We already beat this shit, nigga, we just tryna stay rich, that's all
That's all, uh
Yeah
Street niggas with me, you know
Gang shit only, man
You know we bringing the stu' out
Right next to the buttons and all that other shit
It's ganged out
Southside on the track, yeah150 DreamTeam
Gang shit
Aye
Big G Herbo, I must say I came a long way
'Member posted on the 8 Block and that hallway
Hustlin' we serving nicks might get six for the dub
Now I need 15 for a show plus my stick in the club
We hit your club 150 deep 150 guns
You know that's about 2000 shots Whips like they straight off the lot
We pull up 50 whips Forgiato rims my coupe got somethin soft on the top
We got your hoe in the passenger but I'm not smashing her
She just know I want the top
Everywhere I go know I tote the GLOCK
Run up and I'm blowing shots
My Rollie a plain and it costs me a block
No Bezel I said, "hold the rocks"
Remember nights I was restless posted on Essex
Toting them jocks ducking shots
Never signed me deal I was out in the field
Over east looking for opps
And my homies ain't never cashed out on a grill
But they had a mouth full of rocks
Me and Lil Bro was sixteen slidin' off pills
No Limit don't know how to chill
Niggas fighting that drama and ain't take a deal
Free Crado, Free James and Free Gill
Gilly call all the time, know I'm on the grind
He just wanna see me run up a mil'
Ayee and I'm right back at it fuck how you feel
Smokin on dope by the pillows and ounces
That Posto shit reek out the seal
When I get it my mood I feel like Deuce Bigalow
On a roll I gotta chill
Everywhere I go in your city foreign hoes wanna freak me like I'm Seal
In Miami the white hoes gettin' off cocaine
I pop me a perc you do yo' thing
And the two seater cocaine
Swervin' through both lanes
Hop out G Fazo no Balmain
Tell lil mama to chill I don't wanna know yo' name
Just let me check out yo' jaw game
Keep the magnum on me never going in raw
But I don't wanna fuck If she ok
When I bust in your face, let Lil Bro slay
Since I cut out the lean it's been Remy, Patron
Smokin' on dope sippin Rozay
Rollin up back to back
Perky's and flats buying up Backwoods for 4 days
And I'm still on the road doing shows to and fro studio
Bitch an off day is no day
While you still tryna study how I pick-n-roll
Bitch I'm up late and I'm making more plays
Ayee and these bitches with me they go both ways
They digging each other and Dusse, I'm getting drunk drinking Rozay
We do what adults do
I ask what they wanna do they say "We gon' do what you say"
And I met her at KOD did that on Monday
Now that ass going up on a TuesdayI'm that same nigga from that gangway tryna' kill shit
I wanna buy my mom a bigger home, put my niggas on and be still rich
You don't know nothing about that cause you a fuck nigga, I do real shit
If you in the streets got to watch niggas shooting Glocks with you, they a still snitch
Everybody finna' feel this
I can't trust a soul, niggas suspect
When I had no money, I was yo buddy
Started counting commas, now you upset
Where was niggas at when I was low budget, no buzz, out here doing nothin'?
Niggas love to bring up when they was around back when you was down, now you stuntin'
Fuck niggas, I don't fuck with niggas
All my niggas know what's up
No Limit MB, 150 dream team, we the gang, free the gang
RIP my niggas, it won't never be the same
I'mma jump in the game for the dollars and I want money, don't need the fame
I'm riding and smoking and speeding and sipping on codeine to ease my pain
I'm honest
I tell everybody, they know that I need the lean
Fly nigga
I stay in designer, laced up from Paris and Italy
Foreign belt holding my Robin's, filled up with all of these Benjamins
Young nigga
I came from the bottom, didn't ask nobody for anything
I grinded my way to the top and no, I don't owe no nigga anything
And when I get outta the game, fuck nigga you better remember me
Pour a 6 of the drank and that fanta in my cup almost darker than Hennessy
Weapon is on me for all of my enemies
Go get you some money lil' nigga, don't know why you envy me
I get to the cake, don't got time for no silly beef

I remember that corner
Momma told me, please stay off that corner
They sell weed from California on that corner
Plus that liquor store is right there on that corner
Ooooo, rest in peace my homie died on that corner
Youngin caught his first case out on that corner
I advise you all to stay up off that corner
Shout out all my niggas on that corner
My momma told me, baby, please stay off that corner
Yeah, it's crazy, she knew why the police stayed on that corner

But shorty'nem out there they gon' blow for me, that's on that corner
You ain't for nothin' ova here, gotta keep a gun ova here, boy don't come ova here
Cause we got them drums ova here, let it drum ova here, you don't wanna hear
The drum in your ear
Fourty rounds, lay him down, told the bro'nem ain't for nun ova here
You don't wanna see the lights in your face, I ain't talking a parade walk
Talking real pipes in your face, lights flyin out the pipes when they spray
It's nice when they say, how they'll kill a nigga, 'till they gotta kill a nigga
Roll a dice, play it safe
War down on the block, pull one up on the Glock
Hit the lights, watch out for the jakes
Niggas plottin, know the streets watching mask up
Niggas gotta wacked if they a problem, fuck the opps if we spot'em then we got 'em
Please forgive me, Father!

Every day in Chicago
A lot of bodies getting dropped all type of shit, man
Every day in Chicago 
Look, I'ma tell you the truth
Growing up in the Chi, I ain't got nothing to lose
I done seen a lot of mommas cry, I done had a lot of homies die
You can't walk in my shoes
Out here in the field you don't do what I do
Ma ask me every day, "Boy, what you gone do?"
I'ma get to this cake ma, we gone be straight
But I told her either way I ain't going to no school!
You can catch me on the 8 with the 8
Lil Bro got the K, either way still got that tool
Eyes open everywhere, boy, I know I can't snooze
You a real street nigga then I'm just like you
Between my squad and my family, I hate to choose
Granny tell me all the time, “Boy, I pray for you.”
Don’t wanna change the channel and see I made the news
A lot of bodies getting dropped and they don’t make the news
If you out here in the streets then you know wassup
Everybody wanna know why it’s so fucked up
Wonder why the young niggas don’t give no fuck
Cause we know don’t nobody give a fuck about us
So we shoot guns and we gangbang
And we post up each and every day
Fuck the police we gone sell weight
Till the people show us a better way
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
They got gangstas on that side, It’s savages on this side
Them junkies on the block robbing ladies for a hit now
Never ever ever did I give a fuck about no bitch
I was too busy tryna' make a 100 off a flip
Bought all the choppers niggas had when lil bro coming out that dip
They start running, lil bro gone let off 100 out that clip
Why they snitching, why they snitching?
Why all these niggas snitching?
We don’t want prosecution, we execute the witness
A nigga get whacked probably over chit chat
Hollows push his shit back
Now his homies ride around with the tech tryna' get they lick back
It’s still the same shit, bitch, I roll with the same clique
Pocket full of Ben Franklin’s no change bitch
And I’ll never ever change it
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in Chicago
Every day in Chicago
Every day, every day in ChicagoAy man ya'll better put Herb on that muhfucking XXL cover man forreal. Only a few muhfuckers on there probably deserve to be on that muhfucker, that deserve to be on there, so salute to ya'll on that muhfucker. But Herb supposed to be on that muhfucker so shout out to Herb, go crazy
I'm like the under overdog y'all commercial and y'all marketable
But I'm over y'all I was born a star, just ask my mom
It's like I'm posed to ball
Pull up, hop up out that drivers seat don't got no chauffeur dawg
OG Kush I'm smoking on
In a daze, pushin blow, early morn
By the store 20 thou for a show I ain't hurting no more
And I'm only 19 but moms ain't working no more
She ain't hurt no more
Told my mom she ain't never gotta work no more
She ain't never gotta hurt no more
And I move like a boss so she ain't gotta worry bout her son on a shirt no more
Eating hundred dollar steak, young nigga I ain't wait for the lick on the first no more
I'm recording in LA right now, so the local niggas can't get a verse no more
Sike, I'm still hood rich, still up on that hood shit
Even if I could switch, I don't think I would switch
Always do my own shit, always keep the wood lit
Money and the fame just changed the way I understood shit
And all the time I grew up looking at the gangster rappers
Ain't met a gangsta rapper yet since I became a rapper
I look at myself as a threat and I endanger rappers
Go back and forth bout this and that, oh them my favorite rappers
Indite they self in tweets and shit, them be the lamest rappers
Words behind the internet I don't exchange with rappers
I got some niggas if I say so, they gon change a rapper
Don't mention me, don't shout me out, don't say my name with rappers
I missed that freshman cover twice, like I ain't a factor
And still your favorite rapper's favorite rapper
I'm just a humble nigga can't let nothing get to me
15 I was broke as fuck, rolling up that Swisher Sweet
Love that shit so much, I spent my last and didn't buy shit to eat
Then I hit the bed, it's time for school and I ain't get to sleep
And I got it on my own, niggas ain't give shit to me
They ain't always drop them videos, and always sending beats
I spit that true shit for the street, so fuck it, I remix the Meek
Y'all don't really hear me tho, nah they don't remember me
G Herbo, you already know what it is man 150 Dream Team the campaign
Ball like I'm Kobe the mixtape, never leave my brothers
You already know what it is man, free all my niggas
R.I.P. my niggas man
Working non-stop man, I'm still grinding, ain't no days off man
I don't know what the fuck yall thoughtRoaches, rats in apartments, mama smoking, baby starving
Pistols loading, discharging, I grew up in all it
Ghetto, hell, slums, bottom, what you wanna call it?
Nobody role models, everybody alcoholics
The shorties either gangbanging or they basketballin’
Where niggas get left slain stankin’ ‘cause they chain swangin’
Them kids won’t see they moms again ‘cause homie ain’t aimin’
Damn the streets changing, these lil niggas dangerous
Don’t even mask up no more, these lil niggas brainless
I got so many fallen loved ones, nigga out here painless
Don’t know when it’s my time to go, I keep that, I’ma flame it
Want to see me dead or broke, I know I need that motivation
Like if I blow my shot, lose everything I got
Have my hand out on that block, become everything I’m not
Been through that life, I blew that check, lost everything I had
That shit just left me looking silly and my mama sad
No nigga ever gave me shit when I was down bad
I was by myself in a six foot room right there on my ass
And now I stack that shit and mean it, like I’m on my last
I stay so low from fuck niggas like they on my ass
You know if I don’t fuck with you, better not cross my path
Niggas think it’s sweet, they see me in the streets, I been in my bag
Got to stay lowkey but I can’t wait to let ‘em feel my wrath
Still trained to go, could start doing backstrokes in a bloodbath
We wake up, flame up, pop up, post up
Steal dope, clap folks, crack jokes
Still ain’t sad, kill us some white folks
Fuck those if it ain’t real black though
Started getting real money, I was 17
I’m 20 now, I’ma take it way back though
4th grade I was tryna be Ivo
Shooting ball, playing ‘round, saying raps though
Grab my school shit, been throwing L’s up
Never knew what we all headed out for
Young niggas having real life shootouts
By my grandma house, had to move out
Started rapping, wasn’t tryna be a star
I was speaking what I lived, what I knew ‘bout
17 had labels tryna sign me
Thought might as well speak, so I flew out
Flew back, had to see what I was worth
Hit the studio, I know what I’ma do now
Meanwhile tryna make it in a warzone
Matter fact, let me hold that thought
My city know I ain’t even got to talk
Pull up, hop out, white chalk
Now you see me, smell money when I walk
Humble with it, no I ain’t tryna floss
Every real street nigga took a loss
Took a few, bounced back, shook it off
Had an X by my name, took it off
150, dream team, I’m the boss
I came from gambling, totin’, rollin’
Stolen transportation, police stations
Look at me now, tell me congratulationsAsk about G herbo, even Lil herb
Been Having shit
Toting pipes on Roc Block not the suburbs
Been savage shit
How I'm not a capper, Me and Capo
Been clapping shit
Designer Clothes
Average shits
Big Bank rolls
Trapping Knicks
Way before this rapping shit I has A niche
In 2006 I could've fucked yo bitch
In 2006 I probably fucked yo bitch
Me and foenem running shit she probably bust her clit
Any who, Present Tense, I'm that nigga now
My ID a passport cuz I get a round
Caddy Trucks and Fast foreigns how I transport
Got my gang plus another 50 on the dashboard
That's 200 for the stupids that ain't with the movement
958 Young Sizzle and G herbo had to do it
Yeah that's 808 plus 150, I can't lie I'm high as shit
I been counting so much money lately I'm just adding shit
Skinny Jeans, 40 on me, somewhere reach i'm grabbing it
Much as I still be discrete, everybody know I'm riding with it
Chopper let off start rattling
30s on me when i'm traveling
Bond money on bond money and I ain't tryna hit no gaveling
Every where I go real niggas with me it's a gathering
Going Under running outta money that's embarrassing
You ain't have it acting like you got it man that's even worse
Head and body full ain't even win call ya Steven Kerr
Told young sizzle go getchu a lamb let me keep the vert
Told him just to Dash
Fuck around and Crash
And pay for another one, bitch you know we cashing
This rollie a 41 diamonds on me splashing

Soon as I walk in any mall, everybody high off contact
Coppin shit

Even though ion like Politics
Trump you can suck Osama Dick
Hillary can suck Obama Dick
Ion even know shit they did for us, all I know get money bitch
My bezel frozen, but when I wanna switch em up my schedule is golden
Bitches be choosing but none of these bitches I'm chosen
Gone off the potion
Got a shirt open
Don't even want it get behind baby start slurping and sloping
I ain't tryna do no romantic, I don't know what you was hoping
And they love me In Toronto like I was Demar DeRozan
And I ain't even go yet 15k that's the least for a show
But really though they ain't need no check
Count that shit up all day, like a cashier
All in the express lane flying past yeah

Nigga living like a thug like I'm Pac, though 
I knew I could hit my cuz for that Glock, though 
When them times got hard, I was sellin' coke 
Wanted mama on my side, had to let her know
Seventeen I bought a nine, had to let it blow 
Now a nigga on the grind, I got five on my schedule 
Herbo really quiet, I get loud 'bout my cheddar tho' 
Really was outside on the nine with Berettas, oh
No bap, I ain't lyin', I got five on my schedule
So if I text "Outside", come outside how I tell her 
I ain't regular, I knew she was a vibe when I met her
I rock thousand dollar sweaters, bitches love me like Coachella
Tell her give me some
I respect you don't address me like I'm anyone 
Bitch is messy thick, she there, she got her titties done 
Oh, she a dime in her city, huh? 
She like lemon lime with her Henny, huh?
You ain't choosin' niggas, you get diamonds from any em'
'Round the way girl, I can line up with twenty 'em
But that ho so fine, it don't make me nothin'
Broski tried to smash, she ain't give him nothin'
Still gotta slide in my ride with a fifty drum
City dumb, I can't have no fun, I got fifty guns , nigga
I was on death row
I ain't never met Snoop, I ain't never met Suge
Nigga living like a thug like I'm Pac, though

When them times got hard, I was sellin' coke 
Wanted mama on my side, had to let her know 
Seventeen I bought a nine, had to let it blow 
Now a nigga on the grind, I got five on my schedule
All that dumb shit I did really wasn't worth it, though 
Don't define me by my past, ain't nobody perfect, though 
I wasn't thinking 'bout the consequences, it was workin', though 
I jump head first in the trap, but I had that bitch twerkin', though 
Who you workin' for?  Tell me what you lurkin' for? 
He just gettin' money, what you gotta murk him for? 
Seein' niggas fakin', that shit irkin', though 
But I'ma pull up on 'em when it's perfect, though 
I can tell you what I'm worth, or you can search it, though
Hands greasy by that chicken like I'm Churches, though 
City bad but my block was like the worstest, though 
I can't lie I took my Glock inside the church before 
Summertime like the hood havin' curses 
I ain't never lied in my verses 
I ain't never lied when I'm merchin' it
Couple opps ain't survive out them surgeries, uh
I was on death row
I ain't never met Snoop, I ain't never met Suge
Nigga living like a thug like I'm Pac, though 
I knew I could hit my cuz for that Glock, though

It was me and him, just him and me
Ridin' with two felonies 'cause we got one apiece
Glock 27 Compact, kept that one with me 
Anyway, we was just out ridin' 
It's like 3 AM, I don't even know why we still outside 
Think we was on our way in the house, too high off lean, I keep goin' in and out
Bro on bond for somethin' right now, that nigga keep goin' in and out
Nineteen, move my mama out the city, so we been in route
And everybody always wonder why we swerve and ridin'
'Cause if they followin' us, we gon' see just off how they drivin'
And he doin' 120 in the Audi, we gettin' a lot of money
It's a car behind us speedin', I think somebody comin' 
And they switchin' lanes like us too, I think somebody want it
Now he tappin' me like, "Lil' bro, look in the mirror, who that?" 
Thinkin' that it's an opp or somethin', clutchin' the Glock and I'm on it, I wanna do that
Start lettin' my window down, I'm like, "Slow down, let 'em get on my side"
They flashed the lights, damn, I'm ready to blam, they did that just in time 
Another high speed for this week, now this the second time
Already on the e-way, so fuck it, we rollin' now 
And we in route , and now they goin' whatever we goin' an hour
Now either we gon' get home or you know what else, so nigga, we goin' for ours
Turnin', bussin' U's, now the strap done fell from off my lap 
Tryna find it just in case we gotta park this bitch and get out
Broski say he got us, I ain't trippin', I already shut my mouth
But if he go to jail, he on double bonds, he won't get out
I had made a million dollars and I still ain't changed the route
Voices in my head sayin', "Man, when you gon' chill this shit out?"
And I know I'ma take the charge, like I ain't already made it far
I was just gettin' ready to let it spark, like I ain't already became a star
Soon as we gettin' off the expressway, missed the curb, I'm thankin' God 
If we had've touched it in the slightest way, would've flipped the car 
Now we gettin' away, they far, can't see the plates, it's way too dark
And I'm used to being in chases, but my heart beatin' a lil' way too hard
Somethin' fuckin' with my conscious, I ain't trippin', am I, dawg? 
I ain't gettin' tired of this way of livin', am I, God? 
Thought I could do this shit forever, I went hard from the start 
If I tap out this shit with you, I ain't trippin', am I, dawg?
I ain't loyal no more, like I wasn't just drillin' with my dawg?
Like I ain't fuck off a quarter-million, chillin' with my dawg?
On the ride home, I ain't noddin', feelings from the lean gone
Thinkin' hard for real long, man, I gotta put my team on
Don't nothin' come to no sleeper but a dream, nigga, dream on
I'm up 5 AM, you ain't doing a thing, nigga, so you ain't on
To calm my nerves, I fill a Backwood up, now I'm like ching-chong
Opps hit us, we hit, hit back at us, shit goin' like ping pong
But we hear somethin', we rackin' up, run the score up and we packin' up
6 AM, catch a nigga lackin' us, fire the block up and we backin' up
I beat the streets, you know?
That was a story about my last high speed, man, I was on, for real
Shit was really only like two years ago, you know what I'm sayin'?
But it changed me
So close
So close, but not close enoughNow I'm the one who pay the bonds and all the lawyer fees
They gon' try to take advantage of your loyalty
Drag my name all through the dirt, they tried to soil me
In this kingdom, teach my son he come from royalty
My brother gone, now he can't hop inside this Royce with me
How I keep escapin' death, like he avoidin' me
Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak
Ain't choose the streets, my circumstances made that choice for me
I'm so post-traumatic 
Yes, I'm 'posed to have it 
Gotta stay close to ratchet
'Cause bronem died when they ain't have it
September 3rd, I lost a savage 
I been through a lot, so I walk with a 'matic
Shawty and them gon' go, they ain't talkin' 'bout it
Lay on the house, you run up on whoever walk out that bitch
I been No Limit, I'm 'bout it, 'bout it
Go like I'm pussy, I doubt it, uh-uh
Walkin' on hits, we was scoutin', routin'
You see 4-7 and shout it 
But when I got some money, ain't stop wildin'
Runnin' it up, it's a lot, pilin'
Runnin' these streets, I got mileage
That's bro mama car, but he hopped out it 
My new life ain't violent though
Chrome and Hearts, I'm stylin'
Paid some M's in taxes, but made a lot, so fuck it, I filed it
Made some M's, changed my surroundings
Then I bought some diamonds, ayy
I ain't gotta ride up Stony no more to be on a island
Now I'm the one who pay the bonds and all the lawyer fees
They gon' try to take advantage of your loyalty
Drag my name all through the dirt, they tried to soil me
In this kingdom, teach my son he come from royalty
My brother gone, now he can't hop inside this Royce with me
How I keep escapin' death, like he avoidin' me
Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak
Ain't choose the streets, my circumstances made that choice for me
Shots fired again, like last night
Back out on the 8-block, you damn right
Age of fourteen, I was playin' pipes
We're at war now, made an attempt on my man's life
New to this shit, gotta play it right
Whoever tote the pipe gotta stay in sight 
Get caught, sacrifice, stay and fight
Everybody know they gotta pay a price 
Gotta get high, get my head right
How the fuck you sleep? You ain't seein' faces every night
And who want life doin' fed time?
It's already hard tryna see my little mans now
Show like thirty, forty grand now
Miss fifty of 'em, how you still got your hand out?
Tryna execute what I planned out 
Help 'em move the sack, probably why I never ran out 
Basketball courts got fanned down
Next thing you know, it's your man down 
Niggas I was on the court playin' ball with got killed
Prolly why I don't play around
Niggas I was growin' up with, real savage
Kill shit, don't run, they'll stay around
I'm from 79th, I'm from Terror Town
I don't wanna fight, I'ma spray around
Now I'm the one who pay the bonds and all the lawyer fees
They gon' try to take advantage of your loyalty
Drag my name all through the dirt, they tried to soil me
In this kingdom, teach my son he come from royalty
My brother gone, now he can't hop inside this Royce with me
How I keep escapin' death, like he avoidin' me
Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak
Ain't choose the streets, my circumstances made that choice for me
No matter what, when it get rough can't let that shit break you
When you faced with reality, it's hard to shake the truth
You only real as them circumstances that make you
Seem like they hate on you for everything that they can't do
Growin' up, it was just hoops dreams and AAU
Now it's county visits and burials, why they take you?
So, let me guess, your homie's dead, and you caught cases too
Still paranoid from all them wars, 'cause everyday they shoot
Can't believe it when you get that news, you wish that shit ain't true
Them soldier's mamas breakin' down, they took away my troops
Want my shit red, for all my bloodas, when they paint my coupe
I'm Gucci gang, that's how we bleedin', but I ain't Piru
Now I'm the one who pay the bonds and all the lawyer fees
They gon' try to take advantage of your loyalty
Drag my name all through the dirt, they try to soil me
In this kingdom, teach my son he come from royalty
My brother gone, now he can't hop inside this Royce with me
How I keep escapin' death, like he avoidin' me
Demons in my head, and I trip every time them voices speak
Ain't choose the streets, my circumstances made that choice for meYall know what the fuck this is
Yall know exactly what this is
My lil cousin in the county fighting quadruple bodies
But when he beat it, we in Egypt, need a newer hobby
He beat his robbery, went back faster than a Maserati
Everybody in the race, I'm tryna cop Bugatti's
Lost my Sky Dweller, yeah, but ain't nobody rob me
We'll come shoot up the party, ain't no Lodi Dodi
I got niggas calling my phone from the federales
Told me niggas breaking bad, ain't sent him 20 dollars
I remember breaking bread with like 20 heads
Imagine me behind the walls for like 20 years
Feeling like I'm dead, I couldn't even make my bed
I ain't have no spread
Project still 10 toes bitch and only got 1 leg
Niggas only had 1 life to live, never got no bread
Can't think back on his decisions now he ain't got no head
Niggas don't really be clapping that lead
Yeah, really be scared
My niggas gon' hop out killing instead
Make sure you cover them dreads
You in the streets better cover your tracks
You can't talk to that hoe when you going to bed
Wonder how you end up shot in the back
Same way she was for you, that hoe going again
Next thing you know that hoe going again
Yeah gone with the wind
Bitches don't know when I'm calling again
Next week I'm all in her friends
.40 Glock all in my drawers again
To walk through the mall again
I made 50 songs, had to ball again
Bitch go leak em all again
I'm making songs like Future, I got a future
And I be up with the roosters
Fuck niggas really be losers, really be using
Thats why I'm dolo as usual
And that's why I tote my own pole with the shooters
I can't be in this shit snoozing
If a nigga ain't shooting he ducking or running
And I can't be in this shit choosing
I remember I used to just play with a 100
Then graduated to 2's
I remember I used to just bag up them onions
Then graduated to moving
And really my life is a movie
Real diamonds and gold in my jewerly
If you think you gon' make it, nigga come take it
It do not matter, got Uzi's
Told my Jeweler to make it, 80 point bracelet
Now ain't no wonder she naked
Told lil bro to get closer to knock off his face
Cuz we don't get niggas mistaken
Yeah we fry niggas like bacon
We find niggas like Taken
I'm from 0-7-9
I'm dropping 5's
And I'm still slamming the rake's
Still grippin four nickels and S 550's
This what ima slide on the jakes in
They can't catch me cuz them squad cars basic
Me and foenem up in our cars racing
Ain't no pulling over, so we in hot cars daily
And we ain't instagraming shit, ain't no HaHa Davis
I got the gun with the light and the laser
I live my life and the light is amazing
I used to lean on a lot of the lazy
I would just lay back literally lettin her lick me
She did it long like my lady
I think her name was Lindsey, Lala, Lisa, Laura
I'll get with her later
But I know I'm gon get this to this paper
Yeah I gotta get to the guap
If I don't ima get on a caper
Soon as I used to get on the block
Police tryna give a nigga the vapor
Why they thinkin I'm gettin niggas knocked off
I'm somewhere way out here in Jamaica
Now I'm gettin a nigga knocked right off the map
Cuz' my paper major
Everyday of my life I talk to Cap
He said don't go to no major
So I ain't go to no major
Still get major paper
Ain't got no events, we hit a 100 bands
I been fucking hoes that had another man
See 2 50's on the weekend, that was running in
We still counting rolls, traveling for shows
30 in bulk, 20 and 30 a show
Ain't' fucking no dirty hoes
No I ain't broke no more
My mama don't live in the hood no more
I ain't in the hood no more
I barely pop out in the hood no more
And it ain't even worth it no more
Nah I ain't working no more
I ain't tryna blow 30s no more
You can't see me in person no more
I ain't just Lil Herbie no more
Yeah, I ain't just Lil Herbie no more
A lot of shit ain't worth it no more
Can't see me in person no more
Nah I ain't working no more
Them lil disses ain't working no more
You lil niggas ain't worth it no more
G Herbo, back on my old shit man
You know I'm still on some new shit
You know I'm bossed up, embracing all my power
But I'm back on my old shit man, I don't give a fuck
Bout none of that shit niggas talkin' bout
We still on gangsta shit, we still seeing niggas
In public, in the club, smacking the shit out niggas
Hittin' niggas with bottles, pistol-whipping niggas
All that gangsta shit, with all this ice on
All these VV's on, Rollies on, all that nigga
We got 30's on us, Glocks, FN's, all that shit, you know
Still dropping 4 Minutes Of Hell on you fuck niggas
This part 5 right here, in case you didn't know
You know what I'm saying, free all my niggas
R.I.P. my niggas man, I'm in the studio right now
Got my big bro in here, Sizzle, with me, top in here
You know, brazy, Big B's, you know, G-Squeak
In this bitch, uh huh... for real, and we got more guns
Than us... for real, for real, for real, for real, for real....
Them bitches ain't never touching Instagram
Nothin, none of that, never seeing Instagram
Snapchat, none of that silly ass shit you niggas
Doing, cuz we out here for real ...I mean that boy sound real to me, really real to rap, you know. It's like the diaries of me, you know? It's like the chronicles you know of what I've been through. So they can't say that's nothing and I'm the only to live my life the way I live it, you know? And we just moving, you know tryna teach the people, all the people that showed us love. That album gold, we pushing platinum so we just tryna reach out and go to shows, do our thing, touch all the people that showed us love and supported us
You know I brought my pain, my good and band, my happiness, my sorrow, and brought life to my fans and everybody else in the world listening to G Herbo
Used to wonder, will I ever count a million or obtain 100?
And every time when I went broke I still remained 100
Supported niggas doing good, I never changed or nothing
But why they hate on me? Try to close the gate on me
Why do niggas wanna throw they extra dead weight on me
Still gon' ride until the wheels flat, until my tank on E
When I was the underdog, still I put the bank on me
What was there a handful? You ain't drop no damn jewels
I ain't get no motivation, they ain't wanna see me prevail
They ain't wanna see me in there, they'd rather see me in jail
They don't want me to be with fans, they'd rather see me with mail
When I grind, I stick to that, now they just see me and yell
Riding Aston-Martins, Vanquishers, flying '72 Chavilles
Flashing money everywhere just so they see me with bail
All the guns I had to load, all the weed we used to sell
Shoulda been a man of Harvard, coulda went to school at Yale
But I chose my own fate, so I may see you in hell
And you know I tell 'em all the time man, that's all I ever wanted to do is just be the real me and bring my real life to the audience man, whether they like it or not. And not for me to be judged or looked at any type of way cause I know that one day they love you for your own reasons and the next day they hate you for a decision you made that only affect you. And I still rap and do everything I do for my niggas man and of course my family too but they'll tell you the shit that I say to y'all I say to them. No side of me I don't show y'all through the music and none of that, I still get the same motivation, my same motivation. I love my fans, they know I love 'em man, they love me because I bring them me, the real only me, nothing else
They remember I was gang banging in the gang way
So don't try me if I'm anywhere, I'm still the same way
Nigga you still'll get flamed up for bringing my name up
Sometimes I be cuckoo, still shoot you when I'm famous
All my niggas dangerous, never got my chain tucked
Always got my Rollie on, even when I'm all alone
Draco drum go on and on
Break all of your dollar bones
I ain't tryna work shit out
Ain't no peace, don't call the phone
I ain't really into that, save the stress, I'm tryna go home
Jump right in the game scoring, pacing though, I'm tryna go long
They really tryna chase it here
Four years then be lit
When I die, them folks forget
Man I know this life a bitch
I'm just tryna plan it out
Hit that dough and spread it out
Fuck it, cop my bro a whip
Then go buy my mans a house
Know it come with the gang in it
Know it comes with the things in it
Baby mamas and mans in it
Know you can't be a lame in it
Humble beast man, G Herbo, Swervo. You know it's strictly for my fans man, that's what, that's really where my brain at, you know? I get the motivation from my fans and just everybody, just I don't know this might sound crazy for me to say, I wish everybody brain operated the way mine do but really just for people to understand me. Really the people on the outside, my fans, theres people that can't understand me, understand shit on a level . Strictly for my fans, my family, for my niggas. SwervoUh

Pullin' up in B's
And young nigga you don't owe nothin' to me, I just wanna see you eat

Fuck 'round and buy you a new crew
Fuck 'round, let you meet the crew

Pass out all the 20s, keep blues
I pull up 250, I'm rolling the pressure, yeah
She suck it and swallow it, that be the reason I'm calling her special
I'm balling for real
Blow me a mill', lil' nigga, it's levels
And I'm off a pill, bitch it's for real
They dig it, no shovel
This perky be having me itching
This money be snatching they bitches
We pull up to Barney's, no riches
I beat up a jawn, then I switch it
I grind for that paper, I'm gifted
I'm geeking lil' baby, I'm lifted
And nothing can't make me stop getting 
No matter the status, I'm with itKill a street nigga, get a dime
Kill a rap nigga, get a dub
I heard you Kodak 
They be like, "Ayy, Herb, we got PTSD or what?"
Told him you gon' live but he ain't live, my nigga died
Thinking 'bout it now, the last time I really cried
Shut 'em tight, now I see red when I open my eyes
That's the only time I told my nigga a lie
'Member he had that bitch on fire and it wasn't even hot
I'm surprised we won that gun fight, it wasn't even a Glock
I was right there in his face and I ain't even get shot
Watch my comments 'cause the fans gon' say I got him got
16, I'm young as hell, we going on the opps
That's why it's lil' bro 'cause he don't talk too much, that nigga plotting
Please don't let Maneski influence him, that nigga rotten
We put in work for Kobe and Roc so they don't feel forgotten
6 AM I had my pen jottin'
C Money called me like "Pop out, we on it again, ándale"
I know the opps like, "Damn that's them again, they coming again it's ugly"
Mikk had the stu booked for me but I'm on the block with my killas 'cause that's where I wanna be
Went on my first hit but I ain't make it a body 'cause I saw a lady in front of me
I had a dream that I saw the nigga killed Roc with a gun in my hand, he was under me
I was naive chillin', ain't wanna go get it, thought I could just wait 'til it come to me
I went and got it, now I got a lot, nigga, everybody know I got dough, go wherever I wanna be 
Thousand-mile races through my head, now I can't sleep 
Let me just relax, the Devil playing wit' me
Angels talking, I just can't hear what they saying to me 
Suffering from anxiety, I'm fighting insanity 
In the streets, I saw them fiends more than my family 
I been seeing so much blood I need a Xan' to sleep
I can't even get no sleep unless you laying with me 
And I got faith I'm gon' get home, I know you praying for me 
I don't wanna lean no more, now I can't even sleep
Sweating out for weeks, if I ain't smoke weed, I couldn't eat 
I was drinking syrup before I heard of SoundCloud 
When Lil' Black was in his prime, you niggas wasn't around 
Before the Instagram had my city going down 
Back if you ain't know a junkie wasn't a four around 
I was tryna ease my mind, stop it from going 'round 
I seen buddy laid down, holes in his crown 
All you niggas wanna be kings but doing peasant shit 
How the fuck he want commission? Ain't even selling shit
Niggas still out in these streets like they ain't telling shit 
Ain't a hustler, he can't eat unless he nailing shit 
If he want smoke, I love pressure, I'm inhaling it
Nigga, I'ma strike at whatever
I got my pipe, I'll do life, nigga, try us, whatever
I ride dolo 'cause I found out niggas wasn't solid
I thought you was riding forever
90% of these niggas is bitches
They find theyselves snitchin', tryna lie to detectives 
Thousand-mile races through my head, now I can't sleep 
Let me just relax, the Devil playing wit' me 
Angels talking, I just can't hear what they saying to me 
Suffering from anxiety, I'm fighting insanity 
In the streets, I saw them fiends more than my family 
I been seeing so much blood I need a Xan' to sleep 
I can't even get no sleep unless you laying wit' me 
And I got faith I'm gon' get home, I know you praying for me 
Thousand-mile races through my head, now I can't sleep
Let me just relax, the Devil playing wit' me
Angels talking, I just can't hear what they saying to me
Suffering from anxiety, I'm fighting insanity
In the streets, I saw them fiends more than my family
I been seeing so much blood I need a Xan' to sleep
I can't even get no sleep unless you laying with me
And I got faith I'm gon' get home, I know you praying for meHow? How'd he save Chiraq?
How? Where's my brother?
How? Bitch, we been to war
I can't, I dont talk that Chicago shit
I don’t know nun bout that
I know about everywhere I go I gotta have my muhfuckin' gun period
I know about **** big homie —
I don’t call them niggas, "Big", they ain't my big homies
Them niggas ain't never did shit but finesse me, for real
But what I'm telling you don’t get finessed
All them shorties that wanna beat a 100 — niggas up
Man, check niggas out
Come on, just think about it before you kill about it 
See what's really 'bout it
Chill out and analyze, tell me how you feel about it 
But one thing about it, I'm really 'bout it
Did shit, ain't trip about it, think about it, but we wasn't just doing it to anybody 
Nigga, you don't get no points for no innocent bodies 
Pussy, you ain't even hear who you shot at 
In the jam, he grabbin' a bitch to shield his body
All these new street niggas, they really rotten
Same niggas riding around, getting high outside, killed his bro with a smile, niggas really plottin'
Lot of niggas 2019, getting killed with they partners
And niggas stories mixed with they body language, don't be adding up how they really rockin'
In that lil' pouch, is something, arm reach where my Glock at 
Streets got me paranoid, what you staring for, pacing back and forth, I'ma need you to stop that
I could turn nothing to something, how you top that?
If I want something, it's nothing, I could cop that
Humble, but you know my shit, I'll pop that
Stand up straight in the Maybach, where the top at?
I'm inspiration for niggas who trappin'
Voice for the niggas who always get shot at
I'm living proof you can get off the block
It's for every hood, I don't care if you not black
Man, do not get finessed
Even the best get finessed
I got finessed, that's why I am the way I am
I ain't callin' muhfucker no big shit, big who?
Fuck
La Música de Harry Fraud
I been from the snake pits, to a lion's den
I was in a Benz, riding with my friends
Riding with FN's, cried with my mans
Lives in each other's hands, this is not pretend
I ain't playing with emotions, I won't show my hand 
Give the hustle my devotion, so I know I can 
I ain't dealing with promotion, just so they know what I'm sayin'
Need the back end, eight to four hours before the show when I land
I hit a bug before school, bought three bags of chips and soda in the can
Now I'm getting 30 a show and the strip club just want me to show for a 10
All these millions touch my hands, that's from taking chances
Oh, they telling me I'm the man? I ain't even settle in yet
Gotta get a youngin' together, they starve on the regular, uh
I came from sparkin' competitors, my life was never no regular-degular
Way before records, etcetera, I was with felons and narcotic peddlers, uh
Tell them just weather the weather, the longer the storm then the better the grass gonna grow
We was in the middle of wars, had guns on our waist, we was selling our bags in the snow
But can't live the street life forever, it's bread or Berettas, I keep on telling 'em
For my niggas in jail and who bitches stopped reading them letters but kept on mailing them
Do this shit for the bottom, as long as I stay on top, I'ma keep y'all relevant, uh
For all my lil one's, all my friends and family, everybody I love, everybody I call Blood, my people
Man, I catch y'all stupid ass out here tryna kick it on these blocks, I'm hot poppin' out and hittin' you in your shit
If I love you, I'm hittin' you in your shit 'cause that shit over with
All them holes in the walls, all that weak ass shit where niggas putting them calls through, texting, all that goofy shit, man
Niggas gotta play it by the rules, man
People that's losing they life for shiesty shit cause niggas is scared, niggas ain't getting up tryna hit they man
Niggas shootin' some craps and all kind of goofy shit and I can't be a hypocrite
I can't, you know, talk about nothin' nobody doing, but all this shit is cancelled
Summer is cancelledCash , I made that shit fast 
Fuck around, spend my last
Now I'm back in my bag 
I pulled up in some shit with a cat on the side, but it ain't no Jag' 
Used to post up with some killers, my hat to the side, we ain't wearin' no rags 
I used to sleep in the bed with my brothers at night, but we ain't no fags
I pledge get rich or die tryin', I ain't know nothin' 'bout American flags 
I got a story to tell you, a memory vivid with niggas that died
I got so immune that I was confused and ain't know if not I should cry
I'm too real to fabricate my life, why would I lie?
Malice and betrayal, jail, or how should I die?
How could I prevail? Tell me, anything we do well fail
Say you been through hell, barely
Sleepin' in them cells scary
I can't see the cemetery, rather be preliminary
They'll kill me voluntary, that's why everybody carry
Internet got niggas' business, that's why everybody scary
And my money varied, me and millis married 
Seen 'em kill 
I done seen 'em ill 
They ain't seen a meal
I done seen a mil', damn
In the field , ain't know how to feel
Shit was fucked up for real
They ain't know how to chill, damn
Gangbangin', gangbangin', gangbangin', gangbangin'
Chain swangin', Glock hangin', watch blingin' 
Cop hatin', opp slayin', rock slanger
Block hangin', crooked like a wire hanger 
Violator, neighbors, everybody racist
Can't say everybody racist, can't take everybody favors 
Cops still blazin' us
When you gon' start back tazin' us?
Block been raisin' us
Shit you doin' ain't fazin' us
Killin' kids 
How you feelin', know you killin' kids?
You was drillin', now you squealin' 'fore you chin a bid 
See that man and ain't gon' tell him how you feelin', you a pussy
Killed the innocent, not your enemy, you a pussy 
Seen 'em kill 
I done seen 'em ill 
They ain't seen a meal
I done seen a mil', damn
In the field, ain't know how to feel
Shit was fucked up for real
They ain't know how to chill, damn
Gangbangin', gangbangin', gangbangin', gangbangin'
Chain swangin', Glock hangin', watch blingin' 
Cop hatin', opp slayin', rock slanger
Block hangin', crooked like a wire hanger 
Violator, neighbors, everybody racist

G Herbo
We been making it very scary on blocks, No Limit
RIP Ms.Afeni
Aye who in here with me though
'Twan, Look
I ain't no killer I just be with them
Fuck nigga better not push me
I ain't pussy leave you gushing
I once realized upon a time when I escaped demise
I possessed the heart of a lion
Looking homicide right down the eyes
Murder, blood money on my mind
Trapping selling dimes in a line of fire
Shootouts broad day on the 9
Swear I could rewind to those a thousand times
This the life I chose that's fine guess I'ma tote my iron
Through this lifestyle we still smile
See who got the rawest gat around the guys
Young niggas living and grew up wild
Walk up manistee just to see who down to ride
Remember niggas couldn't come outside
See clips straight through blocks down to 5
Yes same routine everytime riding round mask, 2 Glocks
No gloves hell nawl we ain't throwing no guns
These brand new Glocks, I might go to hell
When im smoking mary nigga im a young 2Pac
50 guns everybody clipped and ready
I dont even know who shot
Look like nowadays everybody stretching
Real in the life of Armageddon
Go and hold tight on my .357
Thinking am i still going to go to heaven
I know my granny there , lord let me in
Yeah you know that'll be a blessing
Send me with the demons all in hell scheming
It'll be just like I'm back on Essex
Iced out horns on my necklace
War where I'm from had to learn nothing less
Then a TEC gon to protect us
Al Capone "baby face" Nelson, Biggie Smalls, Pac resurrection
Come With Me!
Never watched a Homicide
Run quick see
No where to run to now, we gone let them choppas ride
La dadadada dada dah
Come With Me!
Never watched a Homicide
Run quick see
No where to run to now, we gone let them choppas ride
La dadadada dada dah
Looking down that barrel of that 40 caliber
You could see the ghost of Lucifer
Looking like he coming after ya
I done did the streets before feel like I'm on another chapter
But everytime I'm in my city
Mo blood get shed then West Africa
Murders like the boston massacre
Just another day with my savages
Ducking penitentiary chances went against
All them odds and averages
I was on the 8 block everyday posted up
Had my own lil .38 cocked
Me, Crazy James, J dot, CJ took ten, Weezy still on the 8 hot
W2FL had twitter going up hashtag when the tape drop
I was in the streets 24 nights down no love
Lil Herb, give a fuck if my face hot
What a nigga gone do to me, who is he no he ain't true as me
Murder on somebody nigga, If they ever shoot at me
And they say I ride like I'm bone thugs and harmony
When I start flowing with fluency
People asking me herbo how i remain humble
When niggas stay talking bout doing me
Focusing on the road, had to pull out some shows
A couple still talking bout sueing me
Young Pac in the flesh, Glock on my waist
Gold chain on top of my vest
Hit'em up and soon as i get around my ambitionz
As a rider yall know the rest
My ambition as a rider in a black S550
Flipping through Nevada
Do the strip like it dont matter
Anything for the cake fuck around and take yo batter
And I use to have dreams of being above the rim
On the court shooting hoops but instead I was posted on Essex
Me, Capo, and Lil Roc toted jocks with the juice
Come With Me!
Never watched a Homicide
Run quick see
No where to run to now, we gone let them choppas ride
La dadadada dada dah
Come With Me!
Never watched a Homicide
Run quick see
No where to run to now, we gone let them choppas ride
La dadadada dada dahYou know since day one, we probably never ever had shit
But I know everybody feel like a king or queen in they own way
You know, look
Wake up, wipe the coal out my eyes
Look in the mirror, see my hunger, view my soul in my eyes
Brush my teeth, snatch my sister sheets, I know she sleepin' deep
And feeling geeked, tryin' get to school, first day of the week
Super Donuts warmed up for breakfast, wasn't much to eat
Remember moms' hand-washing clothes, sweaters in the sink
Now the chain and my watch is gold dweller with the link
I'm making cheddar, what you think? Gettin' better by the blink
That's every second for the dickheads that don't know how to think
I'm getting better, never second, I can't let up shit dead
They couldn't hear me, I was snoozin' when I used to sip red
I was flexin' everyday, ran through my little bread
You know young nigga never had it, do what I want now I got it
But that don't define you as man, what you gon' do without it?
Know you ain't got a dime, now what you gon' do about it?
Whole family from the slums, how you finna move 'em out it
We need our crowns
G Herbo, tell them shine them bitches up for us
Chief
All black strap, White Sox cap the crown
My dawg slapped the ground when them laws clapped 'em down
The dicks slid through in that all black a-Crown
And I might fan that bitch if it crawl back around
That toy on me but I ain't finna play
I've been this way, hoppin' on and off of them interstates
Remember days baggin' up on my mama's dinner plates
I'm sorry but I'm starvin' and my mama's rent is late
And I gotta' chase this bread, fuck what a hater said
Mad 'cause we poppin', look how they watch us like they the feds
They comin', they comin', just know I sleep with that K in bed
The clip hangin' outta' that bitch, as long as a baby's leg
Wrong one, grind and your time gon' come
They say when you chase the money, the money gone run
But you so impatient, feel like you need a home run
They died, they locked up, it's normal, I've gone numb
And that's why I'm not sober, hello pop culture
We should start pulling these cops over, ya reign on the top's over
Pussy we need our crowns
My king blood is heating up, nigga, we need our crowns
G Herbo
Aye Chief, let me get some more
Hold on, what I tell 'em
Look, we need our crowns, I was cursed at birth
I made the best out the worst, grandma waitin' for them checks on the 1st
Picture days hustlin', tryin' get fresh was the worst
'Member fresh up out of school, gettin' arrested and dispersed
'Nother day I'm not in school, just to post up with my tool again
And I'm tryna blend, but they still think I'm a hooligan
Now I'm getting dividends, all about them Benjamin's
Feds in the islands, Gilligans, Philippines​
Free my niggas in the pen, I just spoke to Gill again
Told him I'ma heat up and I sent him somethin' to chill again
I'm just tryna be up in a hammock with my feet up
Until then, I'm still hungry, gotta eat up
And I'm gettin' greedy, ain't no mouth above mine, I can't praise a nigga
Then they start feeling like they made a nigga
I don't wan't no favors nigga, yeah, I'll blaze a nigga
And I got some aim lil nigga, bet I ain't gon' graze a nigga
Probably ain't gon' need it but my Glock still got a laser nigga
Any day we both ain't gotta gun, I still'll daze a nigga, fade a nigga
Ate up on that shit when I was younger, guess I'm aging nigga
21 I feel like I'm a OG, shit amazing nigga
G Herbo, you know man, gang shit man
Man Eastside shit real, real Eastside shit, 079, you know
And this shit crazy man cause

I'm starstruck on some street shit like "This Bump? This Bump?"

Bless the youth, you know, bless poverty, bless our people
You know what I'm saying, we need our crowns
Let's get itYeah
Uh-huh
Reminiscin', sat in county a week, was in there chillin'
How the fuck I ain't end up in there when we was really drillin'?
Can't afford to take a loss again, I know the feeling
Damn, why the fuck you always in your feelings?
I been bangin' with Wopskino fair since we was children
They killed Tracey that same night when we was out there chillin'
I started rappin', how the fuck I end up with some millions?
Me and Cap was sippin' drip like we ain't have no ceilings
Nigga, Max was on them hits, so he couldn't have no feelings
All them bitches under his belt and ain't got no civilians
Just like eeny, miney, moe, he hop out right there, get 'em
Damn, how you know? 'Cause I was right there with him
If I'm in interrogations, I'ma claim my innocence
I won't pay you back with vengeance, kill you, count these Benjamins
Spittin' similes, foenem listenin', knockin' out they sentences
Labels tryna meet me 'bout, uh, handle with due diligence
Go'n and raise your hand, went to war with no limit
Don't see too many, we militant
Had that new foreign, bent the wheel on it
Park it in mama garage and just chill in it
Got bullet holes in it, who been in it?
Tint it, be right back in a minute
Niggas hearin' stories, they thinkin' we finished
Next day, we was back out on business
Got nothin' to prove, I'm just reflectin', God be my witness
Don't disrespect 'cause I'll wet you and won't seek forgiveness
The world really wanna know just how I'm livin'
Gave it to 'em raw, so now I'm one of the realest
And I still got the same killers rollin' with me
Got my Glock, I'm playin' Nip, feel like a Rollin' 60
I already mentioned Duwop, I still roll with 60
Still got a temper, lose control, you would think I roll with Missy
Niggas still mad, they pissy
Know my block sad, they miss me
Mama always said I'd be ridin' with heat
So every time I slide, gotta kiss me
Lil' bitch mad I bought wifey a Patek, ain't even gonna buy her some Tiffany
I won't never let 'em catch me slippin' 
So I'm ridin' with it 
Yeah, I'm ridin' with it 
Gotta ride with it 
Fightin' cases and shit, I still gotta ride with it 
Yeah, I'm ridin' with it 
I'm still ridin' with it 
I'ma die for this shit 
And I love my hood, but you think I'ma die for this shit? 
All the niggas already died for this shit?
Candlelights, niggas sneak diss on me, out there cryin' and shit
All these bitches talkin' 'bout they love me, out there lyin' and shit
Keep my heat, I don't like surprises
And I see the envy all in your eyes, shit
Devil in disguise want me to meet my demise
Ain't no love in this shit
Niggas watched me starve all in this shit
Now I'm eatin', nigga say they hungry, got low carbs in all this shit
Give no fuck, nigga, suck my dick
You wouldn't be hittin' me if I wasn't rich
Miles away, be hearin' this
Then I come back 'round and niggas don't say shit
'Cause I ain't no bitch
You wasn't ridin' 'round with them licks tryna get your lick back
When this shit crack and see an opp, it feel like Christmas, nigga finna gift wrap him
And I spent so much stackin' this shit, I forgotten it
Hit the A, they love me, I feel like I'm Dominique 
Did some Louis kicks, I mixed the Virgil top with it 
Urus truck, I copped the whip, then slut, your bop in it 
So I'm ridin' with it

Bitch, I never cared, to die, was never scared
Never ever am, what I never did
You was never there, no, you never was
So I never cared ’cause there was never us
You was never us, that's why I'll never trust you
Tried you up on my money bust, nigga, go fuck your mother
I was too busy chasing bread, I was like fuck the butter
Now these bitches smell like butter all on them, motherfucker
And my niggas, they my brothers, fuck them other motherfuckers
If they don’t let us in the line, we gon' cut a motherfucker
We might up this bitch and pistol gun-butt a motherfucker
We got pistols, but them bitches drums, dah-dah-dah-dah
And when it's 'bout my young money, I'm Gudda Gudda, the Devil's brother
But I still gotta keep my angels humming, the Devil's brother
When I was young I used to look up to niggas with a deal, whatever, I love you
Now I'm a rebel, I’m living renegade, I’m like, "Whatever, fuck 'em"
Until that point when they just in the way, I’m like, "Whatever, buck 'em"
In the field, better keep that helmet on, I'm like, "Whatever, truck 'em"
I get high all day to fight the same devils, I must be stuck with ’em
They like, "Damn Swervo, don't get to see you never," I must don't fuck with him
He think he tough, I call him Eazy E, gon' let his nuts kill him
Plug send them bricks, I call up Weezy We, I make them trucks trucks fit 'em
Believe him like Lil J-Rod fuckin' with Ray-Ray, let them bucks hit him
Ain't got no more opps, we let them flux hit 'em
Bitch, I never cared, to die, was never scared
Never ever am, what I never did
You was never there, no, you never was
So I never cared 'cause there was never us
Bitch, I never cared, to die, was never scared
Never ever am, what I never did
You was never there, no, you never was
So I never cared 'cause there was never us
Alone, gotta go strong
No emotions from kings, pressure on me, so I can't do nothin' wrong
Challenge this nigga, I'm taking him on, act like we ain't all grown
Niggas got it all wrong, how I'ma put us all on?
Sometimes I don't turn my phone on, fuck shit all in my call log
Baby mama trippin', I call home, man, matter fact, fuck all y'all
Fuck niggas on Instagram, I don't even log on
.40 in my hoodie pocket from the block I used to jog on
They in his bushes, in his back, we on his block, I want 'em all gone
Like every day was on attack, we couldn't stop 'til they was all gone
I remember that day when they hit Rocky and it was really on
If it ain't no snitches in the hood, tell me how Gilly gone
Bitch, I never cared, to die, was never scared
Never ever am, what I never did
You was never there, no, you never was
So I never cared 'cause there was never us

You ain't never walked in your mother room, seen her tied up
By a hundred goons, then get fired up by a hundred goons
If you try us then it's coming soon
That cash flow I don't play about it
Hawk a nigga all day about it, stomp a nigga all day about it
Chalk a nigga I don't play about it
Drop a body we don't say about it cause that snitchin' shit we don't do that
Bitches sweatin' me like a crew neck, cause I gotta eat where the food at?
Niggas hate on me why they do that? I got old beef but a new gat
Pockets green and my coupe black, red Pradas with the blue strap
I'm a Prada fiend, Gucci shirts, Robin Jeans, make a nigga baby Mama scream
Take a nigga baby mama dreams bitches love me

Pockets full of faces on me, diamonds looking racist on me
Yeah that's all white
You don't like Herb? Shit that's all right

Hundred fiends at back door
But they don't want blow they say they lookin' for that krack flow

Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry , uh
I stayed up the longest when my nigga died
I poured up some more so I can stop from cryin'
Relapsed after quittin' like my second time
But I know I just wanna numb the pain that's inside
I know I just wanna clear the rage in my mind
My younger days will I still feel the same all the time?
Growin', granny used to yell my name all the time
Like the same as if I'm on the stage yellin' lines
And I might surprise you, but I never tell you lies
If you knew what I knew, just be thankful you alive
Grown men game, now we racin' with the wise
He ain't bein' patient, now he facin' his demise
This shit what you make it
Popped out every day with my head high in the field, even though I'm achin'
Honestly, I never thought I'd take shit where I'm takin' it
I was way too busy on some fuck shit, I wasn't chasin' it
Now I'm drivin' that shit real fast like I'm racin' it
Guess I'm tryna duck my past, had enough of facin' it
Nigga still won't test my gangsta tho', he know I'm acin' it
I deserve myself a victory so much I'm tastin' it
This for all of mine 
Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
How I cry whole ride, folks funeral?
That day, a nigga would've died if I did what I used to do
Wanna stop myself, I try, said I will, I lied
Swear I ain't did nothin' all these years but that shit's still inside
Won't advise you live the street life 'less you wanna die
Can't come on no hits with us unless you wanna drive
That boy young and full of pain, look him in the eyes
All he know is gang bang, that's why his Sox hat to the side
Whole war was a game changer, they hit Lil Rock on the 9
And of course we still gon' slide but I'll be cryin' for one of mine
Ra and Roshawn only sixteen this year, now they totin' iron
But been losin' loved ones since a baby, how they gon' decide?
Love the streets so much, I cry to ma, "Why I can't go outside?"
Hidin' pistols in the house, puttin' on my side to go outside
Since I lost Cap, been full of anger, homicide stay on my mind
I adapted, if everybody savage, how I'm gon' survive? 
Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
Have you ever seen a gangsta cry? 
I see nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry 
It ain't nothin' wrong with seeing gangstas cry , uh
 It ain't nothing wrong , it ain't nothing wrong, no
 Go 'head and cry, my nigga , it's okay to cry, my nigga
 It ain't nothing wrong , it ain't nothing wrong, no
 Go 'head and cry, my nigga , it's okay to cry, my niggaIt's no limit to this street shit
Free all of my niggas that got caught up in the street shit
And shout out all the niggas that was brought up in the street shit
R.I.P. my niggas that I lost up in the street shit
But still I love that street shit
Addicted to the street shit, no snitchin in the street shit
No bitchin in the street shit, just killin in the street shit
No feelings in the street shit
Im always in the streets
And I always got the heat
And I'm always over East
Got no limit and it's no limit to this street shit
Got the whole city on MB dick
Since I threw Reese on the remix
But I been doing this rap shit and street shit
You can always catch me over east with it
And my niggas shoot for no reason
Cause the opps got poor defense
If we hit a nigga no breathing
This street shit, it got into me
So I'm ridin' out with my enemies
Finna' do a nigga like Kennedy
That's assasination, pull up on him that's a scary sight
My young boys be all on that
Tryna' wack a nigga like every night
Pick the mags up better mask up
These niggas singing like Barry White
Yeah they snitch niggas
And alot of niggas tryna get with us cause they know we finna be some rich niggas
But I only fuck with my real nigga
That I been with since lil niggas
If they want war go deal with 'em
It ain't shit for us to go and kill niggas
But I ain't never ran from no real niggas
Catch him snoozin then run him up
We scorin' shit we ain't ever losin'
The beretta shooting then you better duck
I ain't lying neither
Alot of niggas out here getting shot
Say you on the block I ain't hiding either
And I'm posted up with 150
Gotta couple techs
Gotta couple macs
Gotta couple k's
And a couple semi's
Off a lot of loud smoking out the pound
With a 4 of lean and a cup a remy
Probably gettin top from a white bitch
While a dyke bitch come and suck her titty
Paid 450 for the Robin Jeans
Aain't another young nigga fuckin' with me
They like Lil Herb? He a street nigga
You want beef with em better sleep with em
And a lot of niggas on the same thang
Saying bang bang just 'cus Keef did it
L'sHan, ayy look Bibby
We gotta take 'em back to what we know man
What's real, that street shit, look
I come from where it's rob or get robbed, kill or be killed
The main goal just try and get home like Wrigley Field
Shells old, pop out revolvers, they hit him, he still
Can't trust a soul, they act like you owe 'em, don't hit 'em be still
I say I rap shit I really done did, really done lived
Every time I step in the booth, I tell 'em the truth
Glock forty with the clip, hangin' out the bottom
You get faced with all these problems tryna make it from the bottom
Hollows pop soon as we spot 'em
Spin the block, I think we got 'em
Street nigga hustle
War that's all I know, that's how I'm rockin'
Ten thousand in the pipe
The size my phone inside my pocket
I always cock it, I know niggas plottin'
Pray I won't drop 'em while everybody watching
Young nigga all about a profit
And I post up on the block with them goblins
Lil nigga starvin', lookin' like a target
If we see a stain then we gon' rob 'em, ayy
I was tryna stack a lil green
Go hard for the team, live a young nigga dream
I swear these young niggas
They'll probably go crazy if they seen all the shit that I've seen
Thirty clips, fifty clips, new MAC 11's
AK-47's with beams
Pull up on your block and straight clear the scene
Purposeful, ain't miss a thing
And now we get money, might blow out a beam
Used to just hop out the veen
Been rocking designer way before a teen
Triple OG the brand new miskeen
And I just might pull up in that new machine
I used to post up like a king
Herbo like Magic, I told him to pass it
I come with the hook like Kareem
You fuckin' with bosses, I can't take no losses
If you double cross me, you better be cautious
I'm going crazy, I think I done lost it
Talkin' 'bout money then step in my office
Pop me a Perc, roll a 'Wood now I'm off it
Me and Bibby in L.A. fuckin' the booth up
It's three in the morning
And my outfit be always Givenchy and Balmain
My belt got Medusas
Got your bitch in my whip, gettin off Patron and hookah
And pourin' the juice up
And my shawty 'nem searchin', they riding with Rugers
They ready to shoot somethin'
In a Corvette, two gats
Ride with the roof back like, "Fuck nigga do somethin'"
Bitches see me, go "Who that?"
Yeah, big G Herbo, that nigga don't do that
Fuck bitches, get money, already knew that
Play with No Limit like play Russian roulette
Real nigga drew that, Nino from "New Jack"
These Hollywood dudes wanna kick it
But I'd rather chill with my niggas
I'd rather post up in the trenches
I just fit in with the killers
I come from where shit'd get serious
Niggas be lying on wax, I ain't feelin' 'em
Can't rap about shit you not livin' it
You should not spit the shit, you did not witness it
I use to post up with the green
Saw all the fiends, smokin' and sniffin' shit
Totin' them Glocks with the beams, bro let it ring
It boost my adrenaline
Niggas be all in they feelings
They actin' like bitches, I swear they so feminine
Play with my niggas, get burned up
Man they be so turnt up like they did some Ritalin
Pull through the opps like some villians
Nobody innocent, hop out and finish 'em
Niggas ain't give us the benefit
Don't care his age, if he bangin', we killin' him
And I grew up a lil hustler
Bumped to a plug, started off with a middleman
Riding the hood in a minivans
You ain't gon' blow guy, sit in the middle then
Free Crazy James, he been gone for like three
Tryin' give him fifteen, that mean he gotta sit for ten
Was gon' stand over a nigga and give him the clip
But fo'nem told me he a little man
Ain't even worth it, I had seventeen
Coulda got half, I'ma give him a little then
Your boo a ho, he don't go on no hit
Can't show him the scene, he gon' sing like RipertonChill out, man, don't worry about that
Don't worry about it, ain't no safety

Riding with yo mans, take 16 shots together
Run for the lead, gun in my hand
30 on standby and one in the head
Tell bro when I want a nigga dead by, Lil Marley slid by and put one in his head
Lotta y'all niggas talk to the feds now but the cops can't tell y'all nothing that I said
Lemme tell y'all something that I said, everyday I wake up, burn one to the head
Grinding, gotta get money 'till I'm dead
Fuck around, start running from the feds
Y'all know I don't fuck with the feds
Man I ain't got nothing for the feds
Look like I got lumps in my legs
Came from all these 100's in my pants
Make it sound like thunder when they spraying
Yeah you better take cover when they're spraying
 take cover, up your lead
AK go off real quick 'till my finger gets stiff like it's fucking up my hand
Y'all niggas ain't gotta hate me, I don't want your bitch, I just fuck her cause I can
Everyday I think of a master plan
Some shit I just can't understand
Why can't I save up 100 bands?
I don't need nothing but a rubber band
What I'm going to do with my other hand?
I'ma use it to count some other bands
Run through it then count my other bands
.40 long so I shoot it underhand
Let it off, watch him do the running man
My shorty say cribs, I just call 'em brotherman
What you need? We got pounds of the gas
Stack 100's, put the 1's in the stash
I keep Ninas on me, I keep 40's on me
I keep Nickels on me, you ain't gotta rap
Just let me know you want beef and
I just be low key just cause these niggas police
Ay, ay, ayEveryday I wake up, I just I expect the worst that's just how I prevent shit from happening man. That's how I move how I move, you know well protected. It's G Herbo
Look!
Every night I sleep, I dream of niggas plotting on me
Catch me smiling, joking, smoke me with my Glock on me 
I don't fuck with niggas, RocBlock only
But Kobe told me " fuck the opps, you gotta watch homies."
I'm the type to keep it cool and just watch them slowly
I learned how to read niggas when I was a shorty
Better watch your shorty, I got this bitch right on me
I feel like Robert Horry, I can't end up a story
Get on that beat and spit my life, tell them just record me
That's on my niggas ask about me, think I'm telling stories
G Herbo been the man 7-9 RocBlock that's where I stand
Catch me on E.A that's Fazoland, black .45 Glock like Fazo had
And my respect still go to you, I got your name lit
And ever since you left we still been on the same shit
Said we got hundred rounds cause we getting money now
But I'll still gun them down and get bond out for a hundred thou
150 Dream Team the campaign it's G Herbo
RocBlock, Fazoland, Pistol Gang, Long Live King Cap
I don't know, I just been grinding
I don't know what I'm working on, a tape or a album ya feel me
I just been reminiscing about my niggas look though this real shit 
Remember Fazo hit a lick for a hundred thou
That shit wasn't nothing then and still that shit ain't nothing now
I might have been like 12 then but shit I'm 20 now
And in the last couple weeks I spent like 20 thou
But you know if I spent 20 had to save 40
Get that paper stacking, I can't hustle backwards
These niggas more in love with stunting than they love the money
These hoes the reason why one day you gone wake up with nothing
We link up fuck it, make her suck it, hit these hoes with nothing
And I'm recording in New York now so that's word to mother
I left the house at 8AM ain't give that word to mother, skipped school I wanted bread I had to serve the butter
I serve ya sister, serve ya granny, I'll serve ya mother
This information vital, it's all about survival
I wouldn't respond to Twitter beef, I don't like going viral
Cause if a nigga get at me it might get homicidal
I don't even.. I-I feel like I got to much to lose man so
I don't even anticipate all that fuck shit man I'm on defense
Niggas know what it is G Herbo man I keep it on me
And I don't even like doing none of that talking cause
I already know the spotlight already on me
I'm trying to provide for my mama
My sister, my family ,all my niggas
You know what I'm saying look this what im on right now 
I eat sleep ,shit and piss the grind
I put in hours with no sleep trying to get it
That wasn't for shit but for my wrist to shine
I'm talking list of rhymes, minds spinning, switch the lines
Roll up and get high a minute then I take my time wit it
All I knew was money, hoes, go buy clothes, money, hoes
Now I just want to do my dope
I just don't want nothing from no bummy hoes
Niggas chasing bitches man I had them since a runny nose
Mama say she thought I was a baby with another soul
Grew up in the hood all my life, seen a lot of shit
Hollow tips, fly out that Tre pound make his body flip
Niggas get caught with that shit, pop out act like they not a snitch
I been through a lot of shit don't give a fuck about a lot of shit
I been broke was stressing wanting to give up and all kind of shit
Got up on my grind now I gotta pay my mama rent
Fly to L.A for a month I rent a crib do what I want
Buy Balmains, smoke 50 blunts, lifestyle 10K a month
And all the real bitches put your hands up, all my Trap niggas put them bands up
All them down bitches put your hands up & if you gone ride wit him put your hands up
Put them bands up, real niggas put them bands up
True Story, G Herbo, 150 Dream TeamI speak the truth, I live the truth, I respect the truth
I respect the grind man
Niggas who be they self you try to force yourself upon some shit that you ain't and you never been
I just can't relate to it, look
The rap game kill niggas, literally
It turn gangstas into drag queens
They look down on workin' hard like it's a bad thing
Shit I'm the last man standin' if you ask me
I was just broke not long ago, it feel like last week
Remember niggas in they Benz's ridin' past me
I never hated, used to see that shit as motivation
And I was lost up in the streets, I needed navigation
Ain't wanna be no doctor, lawyer, ended up a patient
Young nigga said, "Fuck Jordans" went and copped a Sauer
Ruth's Chris three times a week, I got tired of Goya
I'm from Chiraq but I got killa niggas in the Nola
Go get that money for tomorrow, fuck who did before ya
Don't put yo focus in this bitches, they just gone destroy ya
Don't put ya trust up in these niggas, man fuck these niggas
Cause when you ain't so beneficial they stop fuckin' witcha
That's why I just be wit my niggas, fuck them other niggas
And every nigga always put they niggas over niggas
But I know my niggas ain't nun like no other niggas
If you ain't grinding, you just hating, you a sucka nigga
No we don't do no Twitter beef, we really in these streets
We ain't trippin' bout no bitches, cause we know they freaks
And we really getting money, but we stay lowkey
If niggas really getting money, they gone let it speak
Can you break down your whole grind, and still keep it brief?
Instead of tellin' Instagram what you make a week?
Ten-thou', twenty-thou' that's what you make a week?
On my mother, fly nigga, spend that shit on briefs
Fifty for a pack of three? I spend that shit on tees
Fifty-thou', hunnid-thou'? I spend that shit on jeans
Stunt on me? Lil nigga please, I do this shit with ease
A thousand on my G-Fazo's I don't do Giuse's 
Still 1500 for my jeans, bitch I love the B's 
200 for my Backwoods, you know we smokin' P's 
But I ain't tryna stunt my nigga, run it up, Imma run it up
Tryna see 30 with a hunnid-mill, boy I pray to God I don't fuck it up
Couple hunnid-thou', I done fucked it up
Went and got it back told myself "enough"
Had to slow down I was in a rush
Two or three hunnid' always in the cuffs
Spent 500 when I woke up
Young nigga living I ain't give a fuck
Spent 10 thou' like it wasn't nun

Might tell you 'bout some shit I done really did
But hell nah, you might think you a killer then
You ain't never seen money to the ceiling then

I grew up with gorillas and killers and
I just gotta say when and I send 'em in
You would think they go fishing and reel 'em in
'Cause they always come with who I send 'em in
If I wasn't born in poverty, I wouldn't be a sinner then
How the fuck we gon' eat without dividends?
You ain't never met me, I ain't do what I had in the streets to get 'head, don't be bitter then
And I was dead broke, I remember when
I taste good in your mouth like cinnamon
And you know I'm still the man like gingerbread
I'ma roll a Backwood while I'm gettin' head
And he broke, he ain't never seen six figures
So don't tell me 'bout nothin' no nigga said
Hang with nine rich niggas, you gon' be the tenth one
Yeah, I think that was somethin' that Jigga said
You ain't rich until your niggas rich with you
Yeah, I think that was somethin' I should've said
Ain't gon' never get up 'less you go without
And I think that's the reason I get ahead
Gotta pick that bitch up when I leave the house
Then put one up and pray I don't end up dead
Off a Perc', that's the reason my eyes red
Gotta stay high 'cause I don't wanna feel the lead

Verse 2:
Was never a dummy, I ain't have to drop out
Went on the road just to rock out
Wanted money, got tired I had none when I popped out
Rollin' up blunts at my ma's house
I ran up me a check, fell in love wit designer
Still saw them deals, and ain't sign em'
I can see I appeal to yo ho like I'm Santa
Spit somethin' for me, I'll sign her
And when my teacher sat in the classroom
I had it, still could complete my assignments
When she ask me if I been to sleep and I hadn't
Couldn't had been, I was grindin'
Remember niggas addin', I was just static
But what they be, I was shinin'
Just go back on my record of history of hatred you
See come from me, underline it
And the average nigga got half of the patience as me
I go from A to the Z, wait out his house in the bushes
From 8 to 3, hop out give him 8 from the G
Call me "G Herbo", or say "Herbo Baby" for sweet
But don't take the H from the G

If she ain’t suckin on no dick I don’t want conversation

We vibin

The state don't care why you was crossing borders with them grams
Nobody gon' support your daughter, ain't gon' feed your fam
And ain't no jobs for you but you ain't gon' starve, are you?
I come from the slums, none but murder, drugs
All the mothers addicts, all the daddys thugs
I rise above that
But all my people fuck with this so I show I love back
I ain't forget where I come from and I shed blood at
It's tatted on me nigags right know where my hood at
And it wouldn't mean shit if I can go back where I'm good at
I'm by the cornerstore where Lil Roc caught that slug at
And matter fact my nigga birthday just was yesterday
You, Kobe, Cap was on the block feel like it was yesterday
Can't forget about my niggas cause I miss my niggas
Way before this rap shit, every day I was with my niggas
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
Now when I reflect on my past life it keep me humble
Help me balance out in my fast life
Woke up with no heat, no gas, middle of December
Mom's boiling bath water nigga I remember
I ain't even liked baths but I couldn't take showers
30 minutes, getting the water hard at school late at hour
Now I'm in the towers, pool by the shower
Smoking out the pound, always smell like sour
I hit the ground a 100 days forreal
And my shit is still ain't over
150 Dream Team, I'm tryna run that bitch like Hova
Always remind myself, not to get beside myself
If this rap shit fucked me over, I'd be right back on that sofa
In that trap on 78th street fucking up that baking soda
No sleep, when I hear police gotta make it out the backdoor with the toaster
But them days ain't take me over
Now when I'm in a plane looking down tryna see what state we over
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laugh
Can't forget about my struggle with my past
Every day I gotta think like it's my last
Be distinctive of new niggas in my path
Through the stress I gotta smile, I gotta laughEverybody asking me to tell them my story but i don't know where to begin
Everybody asking me to tell them my story but i don't know where to begin
Cause too many people outta my life i'm conscious of letting them in
Back when I was in the streets told myself when I leave I won't miss it at all
And I lost some people in my life meant so much to me i'm missin them all
I was running the streets wit my dawgs, I got niggas and family gone
R.I.P yeah i'm missin them all, now you see me i do it for yall'
R.I.P missin my uncle gone, R.I.P missin my auntie gone
R.I.P man my grandpapa gone, all my niggas I can't name them all
Through the madness i'm still standing tall
I been losing my homies since I was 15 thats the reason I know that i'm strong
Thats the reason they live through my songs
 I be stressed but counting my blessings I wish I could just fly away
Thats the reason I woke up and got high today
And I know niggas just gotta hate, but go count you a check
Why you watching how I calculate, Lot of school mornings I never ate
They ain't wonder if I had a plate, imma go get me some anyway, Shit as long as my lil sister straight
If you got it and ain't have to go through the grind niggas like us will never relate
I be on the go I never break, for the paper I don't hesitate
Kobe said on the 9 one day better grind till your time you gon' shine one day
Never thought he'd see me crying one day
And ill never go to church on sundays, I was posted right there on the one way
But god still with me like its sunday, with my Glock 40 like a gunplay
And I know that it might sound crazy but alot of days niggas could of blazed me
Murder rate like the 90's and 80's, but this my lifestyle I can't let it faze me
Gotta talk to my momma all the time, She be on the phone saying that im crazy, know I keep the hammer on me all the time
I can't lie if i tried its cause she raised me
She tell me she proud of me all the time, I just wanna see her smile all the time
Remember I was in the streets I was wildin, thought i knew everything I was challenged
Committing violence
East and Stoney Island
Ay
Back when I was in the streets told myself when I leave i won't miss it at all
And I lost some people in my life meant so much to me i'm missin them all
I was running the streets wit my dawgs, I got niggas and family gone
R.I.P yeah i'm missin them all, now you see me I do it for yall'
R.I.P missin my uncle gone, R.I.P missin my auntie gone
R.I.P man my grandpapa gone, all my niggas I can't name them all
Through the madness i'm still standing tall
I been losing my homies since i was 15 thats the reason I know that i'm strong
Thats the reason they live through my songsZaytoven
Uh, I make real music for the pain and struggle
'Cause that's where I come from
Look
I was in the trenches with my gun
Now I'm gettin' cake, I made a savings for my son
Thank you for this paper, God, I can pay my bond
Judge got me on stuck, he think I'm tryna make a run, uh
Puttin' digits up, feel like I'm tryna make a fund
I will not go back to where I came but it was fun
All the weight I took on by myself felt like a ton
Made it out the ghetto with no help, feel like I won, ayy
Yeah, jewelry hittin' in the sun
Water on my neck and wrist, I hid it in a pond
I'ma be the last nigga when it's said and done
Move like a pimp, was sippin' drank, but I'm not Bun
Came up with crack but made it big, feel like I'm Pun
Niggas on my back with hands out, ain't help me none 
My brother was a legend, he in Heaven now
Should've been right there, feel like I let him down
My brother was a legend, he in Heaven
All my faith in God and my weapons
My brother was a legend, he in Heaven now
Should've been right there, feel like I let him down
Rappers goin' hard but they life a facade
Gamblin' with my life, the devil playin' cards
In the street all night, that's the shit that left me scarred
Situations like my first one, that's what gave me heart
I ain't never carry heat, but that's what made me start
Hoodie on, it was dark, all I saw was sparks
I ain't ever been afraid of the dark
Brave nights I lay, put the car in park
Paranoia every day, yeah, that's how it started
Why I don't feel safe? I got a bodyguard
Hard times tested every nigga 'round me
Everybody ain't ready to lay a nigga down
My brother was a legend, he in Heaven
All my faith in God and my weapons
My brother was a legend, he in Heaven now
Should've been right there, feel like I let him downIm a no limit nigga
That's my motha fucking gang
Who I'm riding with?
All my hittas

Who I'm riding with?
All my hittas
Where my niggas at?
We on 79th, we on 79th
Big bucks i get bucks
You got bucks we stick up
Act tough get hit up
Get laid down then picked up
I be riding in my new thang
Listening to my old shit
Catch a nigga lackin'
I'ma feed his ass the whole clip
Dump and tell him "hold it"
Better stay focused nigga
You don't really want them hittas on yo ass
You don't wanna see Lil Bibby in a mask
Hopped out broad day and bust a nickel on yo ass
Riding in the Jag and I gotta bad bitch
No Limit the team we got shooters like the mavericks
Gotta have a lot cause I ain't really never had shit
Pull up on sixes have the haters on that mad shit
Bitches wanna taste me, say I look tasty
Yo mama wanna rape me, haters wanna erase me
Niggas scared to face me, all my niggas hittas man
Just copped me a ruger man, y'all gon make me shoot a man
Riding through the hood bitches yelling out "you the man"
Go into the booth and just change like superman
Marcus got the hammer, Folks is gone nail 'em
Shout out my boy Herb, broski what you gotta tell em
What they call me? Young killer Heron
Light a nigga top off, leak him like a tampon
That's I'm a Boss shit, this ain't I'm a boss bitch
Cock off me some thousands, you go in a coffin
Catch you in the dark and clap
Hit you with the largest gat
.44 park it back, you ain't gotta answer
What shorty go as hard as that
Now I'm gonna tell you, nobody other
Under 18 fucking somebody's mother
Leave a grown bitch wishing somebody loved her
Never raw dog I'm using somebody's rubber
I be on the block where you watch for under-covers
We don't rock with the police, we don't call them motherfuckers
Anti-CPD, if you think you flossin' we might cross you; CP3
Running with the cannon do some damage, rest in peace
Shells fuck up your face and visit your wake just to see
Bring a couple cans or two, maybe extra hands to shoot
Case he got some friends to shoot the streets say I'm grimy
Well bitches think I'm handsome too, mami got a baby tech
We could be the handsome crew
Clips the size of dynamite, I'm ready for the title fight
He say he a die for this, fuck it he gon die tonight
40 with a laser, up the paper or you die for pipe
Send him to the after-life, doctors not reviving him
Stupid, you gone die for life, wait how can you die for life
Just know that you gone lie with Christ
Sell a couple bricks now my wrist looks like its mackle ice
Y'all ain't never heard of a shorty this hot
Seen a 120 thou through a 46 shot
Ride up on a nigga block, let the 46 pop
That's a nigga gettin' dropped, bada-boom and his watch
That's 2 birds with 1 stone, if you heard then I'm on
You leave me with 3 now its 2 birds and 1 dome
I gotta eat, so in the street I'm taxin' niggas ass
And I'm a beast so if you want beef I'll max a nigga ass
Bitches love the fact that I'm a rappin' nigga now
And my pockets getting fat now so I'm attractive to bitches now
No LimitWhen they was workin', I was workin' harder than 'em
I was smarter than 'em
Bench me, no never started with 'em
Still went farther than 'em
They like "boy be cautious near em
Herbo keep that carbon with him"
Standin' firm to what he speakin' so you can not bargain with him
Everything I learnt was in the streets
I was turnin' to a beast
Had to humble down cause I was over East
Every lion can be killed
Any object can be built
Any ship can sink it's all about the balance and the tilt
And it's all about survivin'
All about providin'
Dead presidents the only thing I recognizin'
Tryna jeopardize mine I can't reconcile with
Niggas on that foul shit, My lil niggas wildin'
Bodies steady pilin'
I told 'em they too violent
He blamed his environment and we all just started laughin'
But really it's the truth and that's why all the youngins blastin'
All the youngins slidin', they catch some they gon' smash 'em
How you gon' help 'em, if you ain't gon' help 'em
Ain't got nothing for 'em to do, know they got somethin' to prove
Backpack half full but he not comin' from school
Hustlin' on the block, he ain't want nothin' but shoes
Pistol on him cocked like he got nothin' to lose
Like his moms ain't at the house, thinkin' he in after school
You the type to have her clueless when she cryin' on the news
You the type to have her clueless when she cryin' on the news
He was in the trenches, bookbags trappin' by the school
He got hit up, crowd split up
Pick the shit up like a sit up
Once you go down it's hard to get up
That's the game, I don't make the rules
So I'm just chillin' in the hot spot, sellin' cool off
I can never take the tool off, take my jewels off
I'll work on any holiday
Give me April Fools off, cause these niggas clown
I'm high can't bring me down
Promoters want me outta town
They just had to get me down
Evere since a nigga stood up, they been tryna sit me down
Every time I throw my hood up, they go crazy in the crowd
You see L's everywhere, gold chains everywhere
Started somethin', we shot it up
I tried to tell 'em they don't care
Got a 50 in the glizzy and the draco they ain't fair
Playing Call of Duty get a halo, let 'em wear it
Black mask, black Glock, whole month of the February
For the love of the set
Caught a lil' action, got a lil' reckless
Shootin' niggas, let 'em live deliver the message
Catchin' felonies cause they tellin'
Learned our lesson
My partner he just beat two bodies, caught a lil' blessing
I'm in Bali, ridin' Maserati like why I am stressin'
My momma she don't need nobody
If anything, got too much time prolly need a hobby
'Member nights I got so fucked up, said I need a robbery
I ain't trippin', yeah i toughed up had to get my bucks up
Get my Gucci, Fendi stuff, get my Hemi trucks up
These lil' niggas talkin' too much need to shut the fuck up
I spend eight bucks on my uber truck for me to slide in
Glizzy by my side that's just how I'm ridin'
Turn a 8 to a 20 when I slide that mag in
Window rolled down until I get high again
They like "Herbo all you spit is hot shit like a dragon"
Carrying that bag shit I had to drag in
I been catching plays like I'm up in Madden
Herbo caught his wave, I got niggas mad againUh

But I stayed bumpin' heads with my mama though
Started gettin' money, now she think she my homie
Bought a Glock, I ain't get it from Carlos
I was livin' two blocks right up off Stoney
Shoot this bitch broad day if you run up on me

Couldn't even bury yourself, pussy, run along, then

They offered me 200 racks to wear this clothing line, I should've took it
I told 'em I need a milli' 'cause I stay fresh as fuck, I was bein' bumptious
Really I was bein' silly, 'cause that shit was wack as fuck, I ain't even want shit
Belaire sent my money a couple months ago, I ain't even touched it
Told 'em I want it full when I go on tour, but that's another subject

Foenem eventually made me quit
Picked me up every day with like two, three glicks
And we might do a hit, uh
We just gon' ride a bit, uh
We just gon’ ride and keep gettin’ high
We gon' decide who we see outside
Shootin’ already, now I just spin it one more time
This Glock 45 stay right by my side
We in the front and the back in the van
The slide just stay on the left, I hop out on the right
Why you fold? Look me in my eyes
Nigga, how you told? Look me in my eyes
And we ready to go
Soon as I get that money, I'm ready to go
And we ready to blow
Tweak on the road, they gon' think 'bout takin’ your soul
Long live Pistol P, that's on my soul
I remember white folks had the Regal on the fours
Rock know he couldn't hustle, why the fuck you sell him blow?
I was rollin' bummers, back when Real was sellin' dro
Spent a hundred summers totin' that OK Thunder
We just ride them cars to get there, hop out, run up on 'em
And I spit that street shit for my niggas out here on defense
Stand your ground and defend it
Nigga, if you made that bed then sleep in it
Still out here on that street shit
Just for everybody said I wasn't gon' be shit
And I spread the love 
Still blessed, niggas ain't never gave me shit
And I ain't stressin' shit no more, I'ma let shit be shit
Still gon' stay down on that G shit
Still fresh as fuck, I don't rock that cheap shit
Who you know rock Mike Amiri like me? Shit
Shit, nobody, not me, shit
I been buyin' this bitches for three years
Walk in Barneys, get at least like three pairs
Sometimes I be off like two or three pills
I wan' feel like he feel
By the end of the end, need at least another three mil'
I want a Ghost like Meek Mill
16, I was ridin' with totes
We ain't care where you from, nigga, we want smoke
Give no fuck, I'm ridin' with folks
And I ain't shoot 'til I got close
And we seein' the oppers from afar, out my lil' ho car
Skeet off, bail out, throw the shells out
And I did some shit with bro I ain't gon' tell you 'bout
Ain't take advantage of me no more, I ain't gon' bail you out
Had a grown bitch, like 24, used to come and get me out
I was too young to bail out, go to her crib, then wear it out
That Glock was like my shirt, cock that bitch and wear it out
Ask your homie them, "Do it work?" Cock that bitch and air it out
Goin' to jail every damn summer, I just ain't care about
Now you gotta be somebody to know my whereabouts
Clap shit up, they ain't hear about it, they heard about us 
2AM, we ridin', mamas worried about us
In this bitch, it's lookin' like we robbed Cabela's
Ridin' with ladders, these bitches gon' sound like propellors
You pussy and I smell it, coke, I used to sell it

Roll the Runtz, inhale it
Remember I was waitin' on them to mail it
Pourin' pints up in my belly
They tryna throw me on probation, I can't piss test, I'ma fail it
I might never see Toronto 'cause I might end up a felon
Sat in county for a week, I'm givin' pizza to my sellers
And Cap know he took a piece of me when that nigga left me
And he know he's 'posed to be with me, I let that been a lesson
That just mean we 'posed to stick together, add some more Smith & Wessons
More niggas on security, that's just more niggas to stretch you
Wopskino stay on security, 'cause I stay with all this jewelry
And we stay away from the fuck niggas, 'cause we ain't with all of that fooleries
And we ridin' with fullies, and we all some bullies
We ain't got on no mask, but we all in hoodies

Ain't no killer 'til you push me, and I'll point it right your way

Fuck a ho all night 'til the next day

That's one thing I had, 'fore I got that bag

Hundred days and the nights, I got no sleep
Sixteen, tottin' pipes, fuck the police

Ridin' dirty, no lights, and we four deep
Hot boy, gettin' trapped in the cold streets
Late night, havin' fights with my OG
And I know it wasn't right, but I know me
I gotta eat by any means, I can't go to sleep
Life hard when you young tryna get it
Posted up with my thugs, sellin' drugs and we in it
Summer time on the block, smokin' bud and we sippin'
Hate when my squad lose cause I love when we winnin'
I lost a lot of niggas by the gun in a minute
Now I keep it close, haters won't catch me slippin'
Cause I'mma throw them slugs til I'm finished
Tryna rob me and these slugs goin' with 'em
I remember
Young nigga tryna roll with the biggers
All my niggas real, never roll with pretenders
D's tryna make a livin', gotta get it in the kitchen
I was livin' for the moment, gotta get it or I miss it
All this money, I'mma get it
Never save it, I'mma spend it
Cause it ain't goin' with us, no it ain't goin' with us

And I just wanna see your faces now
Cause all your bitches on my dick, tryna take me down
But I can't go, give a fuck about a stank ho
She only want me cause I'm young with a bankroll
Money come and money go
But I can't give my money to a money hungry ho
You know that
Yeah I'm still MOB, gotta quote that
But I used to be broke, that's a throwback
Now I walk up in the store like I want that
Did a lot up in the past, I don't want backs
But I want you to think like a Kodak
Catch me all white Wraith with the pro black
Middle fingers to a lame, where my boys at
Pull up on my boy , where the smokes at?
Roll up that loud
And let it hit my chest to relieve my stress
And I'm high right now
Thinking of a way out cause I believe I'm next

With DJ Victorious
We turn them racks to Bentley keys, nigga
Nigga, uh, uh, uh, uh
Turn them racks to Bentley keysI grew up smart as fuck, bad as shit
But really like the least baddest kid that I was with
'Cause foe nem been wild and shit
Been violent and shit
Been came home from them interrogations, silent shit
Now we fly with felonies and no ID's, private shit
I make money just appear and disappear, magic tricks
I was on some savage shit when I wasn't really havin' shit
I was callin' home from police stations, no one answerin'
I wanted shoes and mom was broke so I ain't even ask her then
I was way too young to hustle, told cuz' let me bag it then
I was in them trenches every night
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my head right
I gotta get my head right
I'm just tryin' get my bread right
But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my bread right
I'm just tryin' get my head right
I'm just tryin' clear my head
Takin' meds, chasin' bread
Got so many niggas dead
And in the feds, you know I got to send them bread
Everything on the outside, all in they head
Other niggas with they bitches, all in they bed
I just tell them think 'bout this, we still on this mission
Tell them rock if you gon' rock but jus' don't block the vision
Just don't plot against me, just don't turn against me
I grew up learnin', listenin', had no problem playing my position
Even if that came with ridin' benches
Just so we make history on our adventures
Just so we have victories in our endeavors
Put my life on line before when I would never
Told myself if you gon' live life, it's now or never
I was in them trenches every night
I'm just tryn' get my bread right

But first I gotta get my head right
Gotta get my bread right
I'm just tryn' get my head rightI remember when I was much younger than now
I used to sit and listen to the news
I was the only child
Another day, and another night
Wishing Daddy would come home
Me and Mom couldn't sleep at night
Roaches, rats everywhere, what you know about it?
Shit got normal to a nigga, had to go around it
Wanna get some money, tell me how I go about it 
Everything you ever loved, you gotta go without it
Niggas strugglin', I know about it 
Ma could only cover rent with her check, ain't get no allowance 
Niko showed me how to hustle, I ain't know where the pound is
You get all that for that? I was so astounded
My mama told me not to talk to strangers
But Ma ain't know every time she watched me leave the house, her baby life in danger
Most of the niggas you grew up with be acting strangers
It be the strangers who genuine as life changes
I'm full of anger, but I don't wanna be angry
I live in Bel Air now, I'm off the e-way in Topanga
My high anxiety, I gotta ride with the bangers 
Fly as a salary, three hundred thou' on some hangers
Ridin' like a Wrangler, dyin' like a gangster
I don't trust no nigga, how I'm ridin' with a stranger
Street nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
But I stand on what it is, so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'
Grindin', ain't put nothin' to the side in a minute
Three, four mil', I'ma be up five in a minute
Do I wanna sign? I'll decide in a minute
They get fifteen, we get eighty-five independent
I been sliding for a minute
Thankful I ain't seen a homicide in a minute
Put my niggas on, I've been trying for a minute
Diamonds on the face, ain't checked the time in a minute 
Valentine, can I get your time? Just a minute
Hit the line, I'ma be outside in a minute
Take my time when I'm in it
She replyin' in a minute 
If I start something, I take my time, gotta finish it
Way before the rap, was on the nine on some killer shit 
Bite me all the time, I don't mind, I invented shit
Could've been rich, but I ain't signed on some trippin' shit 
Guess it was divine intuition, I'm still killin' shit
On some independent shit
Now we all rich as shit
Cuz doin' a bid, told him, "Chill," he ain't missin' shit
Still at the beginnin', we just really gettin' into shit
Anything possible, they using us for instances
Niggas own businesses
Ridin' like a Wrangler, dyin' like a gangster
I don't trust no nigga, how I'm ridin' with a stranger

She replyin' in a minute 
If I start something, I take my time, gotta finish it
My life really lit, don't need no witnesses
I don't got a Instagram, shit, I'm really in this shit
Niggas havin' shit, I'm serious, hope you experience it 
Thirty K just for appearances, I got like six of them this week
Might buy a Richard if I tweak
I don't clout chase on the net, that shit ain't losin' me no sleep 
They ain't shittin' what I eat, and you can't get rich off of a tweet
I record shit so much, like eighty hours in a week
But the street's dry, might get a nigga rich just off a leak 
Don't look in my eye, I hit a nigga bitch just off a peek
I knew all them hoes was on the same shit since Dominique
He won't shake my hand, he know I know his baby mom a freak
Used to give my ma a G, now that ain't shit but Prada sneaks, ayy
Ridin' like a Wrangler, dyin' like a gangster 
I don't trust no nigga, how I'm ridin' with a stranger 
Street nigga, I ain't been outside in a minute
But I stand on what it is, so I'm dyin' how I'm livin'

Where would I be without rap? Nobody really knows
Me and Gregg was sharin' clothes, but we weren't really bros
We was tryna impress them hoes, kept us on our toes
I had 25 in high school like I'm Derrick Rose
I had a Glock when I met Pistol P, that's on my soul
Hat always cocked, bang to the left 'cause I grew up with the Moes
And I was thuggin' hard with shawty like I'm one of the Fours
I had some shootouts with my bronem, I had to give it and go
Shit got hot, we start swapping most of 'em, still got one of the old ones, though
Might hang that bitch in a frame for show
That's the one that my big bro used to throw
We ain't learn how to blow in no range, no
Pop out, flame out the Wrangler door
Might could've blew out my brains, though
Niggas must ain't got no aim no more
Niggas left me in the rain some more
I found some gold in the rainbow, though
They say I got money and changed the most
Please don't forget I'm still dangerous, though
Still'll walk up on a stranger, though
Gangster shit run in my veins for sure
I wanna change 'em, though
Know how to channel my anger, though
Oh, we ain't gone save 'em, no
Where his hood at? We gon' name him, though
Oh, yeah, I'm famous, so?
None of my killers want payment, though
Oh, we don't 'posed to be bangin', no
Me and my niggas, we hangin', though
Oh, I don't wanna be slangin' dope
This bitch don't ever stop rangin', though, uh
I don't panic, uh
Whips be panoramic
I was sellin' dope at my granny's, uh
Xanny's, yeah, I need a Grammy, uh
Need another big-ass mansion, uh
Big yard, big-ass hammock, uh
Wrist all wet, Atlantic
Bitch, it's big bucks, no whammies, uh
My bitch need attention, she bad as fuck
And she got lips like Angela
You know a young nigga done ran it up
Damn, I could buy her a Phantom, huh?
Where that come from? That was random, huh?
Die for respect, I demand it
I was dead broke, now I'm rich, can't stand it
Tell me why niggas hate Randy
G Herbo, fuck niggas can't stand me, huh
Worth a couple mil, I'm branded, uh
Special nigga 'cause I'm left handed, huh
Niggas namin' shit, I had it
I ran through that sack like I must've forgot it
I helped niggas out when I should've bought a Patek
They sneak diss a lot, but they don't want no static
You savages should be no rumor, you ratted
I bought my first pipe, cuzzo said I could have it
At G Fazo house, me and Fair in the attic
Kay Fazo was here, used to sit and imagine
Then pull on they block just to shoot what we averagin'
Ladders and horses and carriages, you know we clappin' shit
Opps, we embarrass 'em, ayy
We ain't gon' hop out no caravan, ayy
Foenem might fire up yo' cameraman, ayy
Real street niggas I represent
Long live Bapo and Hellabandz
Ain't nothin' but trappers and bappers in here
Who the fuck let all these rappers in?
We ain't with none of that chitchat, uh-uh
You ain't never hear no click-clack
Shawty and them ready to kidnap somethin'
Send his arm home in a gift wrap for 'em
Push a nigga shit back some
Homie and them might want some get-back for 'em
We finna slide tonight, heard his homie and them tryna have a kickback for 'em
Broski the driver, got my window rolled down in the rear back some
Just havin' fun, that's the type of shit I did, I was young
I shed a tear for my young
Nigga, I kill for my son
And before I met him, I was numb
Let a nigga feel my drum
A lot of niggas think I'm dumb
I'ma just let 'em think what they want
They probably think I'm a punk
Niggas probably really think I ain't gon' dump
I'm the type to let 'em front
Leave a nigga ass all in Nieman slumped, uh
After I feed a nigga hollow tips, I need a blunt
Sick and tired of smokin' all this Gelato, shit, I need some Runtz
Finna get another 150 charm real quick, I need a font
40 thousand go out every first of the month

Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'
Big G Herbo been signed but never had me a big deal
Grew up with both parents, never had me a Big Wheel
Instead I had my momma, that's what keep me sane
And can't forget about my poppa, he taught me the game
Always told me to stay focused and make me a lane
Be a leader, don't you worry about being lame
You know niggas only worried bout makin' names
Chasing after bitches, don't want money, they just chasin' fame
But I'm a kid, who the fuck wanna be a lame, pops
I'm just tryna play ball, I ain't in the game pops
It ain’t my fault that everybody round me know my name pops
And I seen a lot of shit so I don't act my age pops
Gettin' older, I'm just graduating eighth grade pops
Soon as I turned 13, trouble with the cops
Soon as I turned 14, started seeing Glocks
Fazo toting 30 shots in the middle of the block
We used to post up by the light pole waiting for the Ops to flip
Lil bro got that banger on him, run up and start flamin' on 'em
On the 8 we a hundred neighbors down the street keep complaining on us
We ain't goin' nowhere, we in this shit til it start raining on us
When it rain, put a hoodie on, now we slidin'
Catch him while he blindin', bloah, perfect timing
I left that life behind me but best believe that I'm still grimy
East side of Chicago where you found me
And them other niggas wanna blam me but they don't really understand me
I'ma shoot it out like Kyrie, gotta make it back to my family
Told Capo when my tape drop, watch everybody try to sign me

Elevated, do this rappin' shit with ease
I got a brick on my sleeve, you dissin' me, please
Comparin' me to different MC's, stop it
I'm really in the shit so I don't pop it
Before Twitter was a trendin' topic 
I was on the block with thirty shots and Glocks had the spot hoppin' , dummy
But they actin' like they don't remember that 
Been a leader with that heater, I got right up into that
You can never take a killin' back
Whole hеart was in the streets, I had to leave hеr, get my fuckin' feelings back
Same spot they shot my brother, next day I'm chillin' at 
I ain't lyin' they was winning 'til we started spinnin' back 
But anyway, said enough of that, let's talk about this paper 
Let's talk about them jets, yeah, let's talk about Jamaica 
Ask about me, I ain't never been a fraud , I went hard from the start 
In my city I'm a god, motherfucker
If you know, you know
Never been no phony though 
Rollies for my brodie though
Barely know Joe rodeo 
Heard they lookin' for me, I'm like, "Oh, I'm on the way"

They like, "Swervo stay safe", I'm like, "Man, y'all late" 
Y'all like, "Free me", I'm like, "I've been in the crib all day"
I'm in Cali thinkin' how I come from pissy hallways
Long as I never go back, I'm that nigga always 
And you know that
Been havin' these M's but they taught me not to show that 
Before that, like a throwback 
As soon as the shit go left, I'ma throw back 
And I could've bought the Rolls last year but instead, I bought a four-flat
That's no bap 
Pro Chicago, I'm pro 'Raq 
I'm motivation for the trenches 'cause I'm Pro-Black 
Real No Limit so we don't play by the rules
How the fuck I catch a case? We bought a school 
Don't be fooled, you niggas fools 
On the 'Gram readin' comments I'm like, "Ooh, cool, so they want me to lose"
I can't break like I'm bulletproof 
And I can say what I wanna say, all I'm gon' say is before fame, bitch I been the truth 
And when you put it on my name, gotta send some proof 
They like, "Charge it to the game", I got feelings too

Shoot long range like Fazo
Run up just like Pistol P
I might go out like I’m Roc on the block where I be

We know the truth it be messing with me
Just cause I ain’t in the hood no more do that make me less of a G?
Niggas wanna see me up top with the rest of the Gs

Or I’m at the  jumping off the Japanese
I’m in my black truck
Smoke one and I’m catching Zs
All I hear a bunch of fuck shit got me catching Zs
You rap niggas need to go out to some spelling bees
Killing yourself fucking with that fake promethazine
No it ain’t no clean
I used to drink on hella lean
Don’t let Instagram and fame infiltrate your team
I went home to 50k I was just a teen
If they head ain’t in the game then adjust your teamYeah
This my second time doing this
Like this song type deep
Different beat different vibe
Almost, a difference
Yeah
Negative energy
That's all I was surrounded by
Negative energy
Oh you the best
When it come to that negativity
How come we ain't living positive?
Riddle me
I probably touched a hundred thousands souls
Little me

Little me
Somebody told me
'Let that sh*t be and it'll be'
We almost there, so imma take us over
Get with me
Used to grab toasters
Now I ride Rolls-es
Lost my broski
Cried to death last time I grabbed roses
And for you, I'd part to sea
Like I'm half Moses
Bel-Air gave me all them Gs
I don't grab roses
That's just bad promotion
Hit the light in granny kitchen
See a thousand roaches
Niggas still got to eat
But imma die of hunger
And by the end of the weak
I'm bout to die of hunger
Balled up and can't sleep
I got to cry to thunder
Living on the 1st floor
I'm hearing shoot-outs
Might as well be thunder
Everybody on the floor

One night she with my sister
They was undercover

Jumped on the bed

2010 I'm 14
I'm trynna hold a hammer
This bitch a go off any min

Nigga not erectile, but I keep one up in the head 
Niggas fucked up in the head, you get one up in your head
Feel like I'm one up in my head, niggas like, "What's up in your head?"
Oh, that's just tough luck 'cause he scared? Niggas gettin' tucked up in they bed
Oh, you a killer? Why you ain't slayed? What's them face tats and them dreads?

When I'm on some boss shit, I gotta embrace my power
I had to go black for a moment, no IG
I wasn't in these streets
Man, I couldn't tell my friends from enemies
It was all good, I was off them Percies, sipping lean
'Til my mind told me stop or you ain't gon' have anything, anything
You ain't gon' have anything, yeah

So I'm the last nigga to show you some sympathy
Cock my shit back, blow it 'til it's empty 
And I commit murder if you would tempt me
Fuck bitches, leave 'em, make 'em resent me
Bitch, I'm a sinner, I'm not repenting

If you ran, got shot in the back for playing

Come party with the gang-gang, you gon' have funOz, you're big time
I was young and used to think of cap guns back when I was havin' fun
Now I'm caught up in this rap shit, gamblin' my life for one
Lookin' back at shit from my past, it ain't much I haven't done
Tryna learn from mistakes like my last one 'cause I got a son
Started off just shootin' baskets, then we was ditchin' classes 
Smokin' gas and havin' fistfights later turned to blastin' 
Grew up, got immune to madness, you couldn't even imagine
Broski ain't get to see my mansion, I carried his casket 
Went and did time, until he got back, I carried his ratchet
I was trappin', ain't unwrap it, it stayed in the plastic
Tellin' broski, "Wear a mask," 'cause it played with his asthma 
Gage wasn't even five foot seven, he carryin' plasmas
Could've went to school in Dallas and played for the Mavericks
Instead, I adapted to Essex and stayed with the savages 
Mama said stay where I'm at, don't come back, she ain't havin' it
Now when she ask for the racks, it's five k on the average
Look at how they had us , look at all those tragedies
Hell yeah, we start trappin' shit, look at all us raggedy
Thank my OG for havin' me 
Fried bologna when I had to eat 
All of my teens, I was ridin' the streets 
Now we the richest they got over east 
Never forgot who was laughin' at me
Know before rap, I was strapped with the heat
Know all the niggas was clappin' at me 
Never told police what happened to me 
Ninety hollows when we clap at the G 
Never reply to who rappin' to me 
Never was askin' for drama
Just stayed in a spot where it's that catch me lack, shit'll squeeze
One to the back, he collapsed to his knees
Ain't have to give him that extra fifteen 
If I would've died in my prime, news would've said that he just was a teen
But I was a teen out doin' some reckless things
I had a strap in my jeans
Shout out 2013 
That's when I lost Kobe and Peewee 
I kept a Glizzy, a 23
Folks saw the opps with the 3D 
That's my kinfolk, we ain't GD 
My chain got rocks like BBs, Maybach seats got TVs
My C Money rose with VVS
The opp hoes know all my CDs 
The opps damn near wanna be me
Gotta go the other way when they see me
If a nigga broke, how he gon' see me? 
Gave niggas hope, why else they need me?
I be everywhere, probably Bahimi 
Bitches partyin' all in bikinis
Baby, I don't even drink martinis 
Exotic pack, got a hat like a genie 
Smokin' Backs for my stress, let it ease me 
Gotta make this boss shit look easy
But you know it's everything but easy 
Money over everything, it please me 
Money go and everything gon' leave me 
Where was they before my watch was freezy? 
To get what they want, watch 'em deceive me 
They don't even know me, how they believe me? 
Sometimes I be thinkin' from me to me, it be hard for somebody else bein' me
Back and forth, tryna balance the Ms, my lovers and friends, I'm caught in a frenzy
Thinkin' what my mama was sayin' about all of my friends, now all of 'em dead 
Wishin' I can call them again, do it all again, but it's all in my head 
Was it really wrong what we did?
If we ain't go as hard as we did, probably all'll be dead
Lean on each other, came through for another, that's all that we had
They don't understand, so callin' my lawyer again, that's all that we said
Everywhere we stand, them people was on us for playin' them corners again
But they don't understandFuck niggas, if you a fuck nigga... I don't fuck witchu!
Hook:

Fuck niggas stay up in ya lane, you don't know me

No new niggas, there's a 30 on one of two niggas
Run the streets, if a nigga try and shoot at me
Fuck you think I'm suppose to do nigga?
And I know half of ya'll won't shoot for me
That's why I don't fuck witchu' niggas
On top of that, you ain't never did shit for me

Now, I got bitches out here like Beyoncé
And I feel you got just had a lil boy
Got his future mapped like I’m Lavar, ayy 
And you know I cap, I'm cappin' hard
And I get the strap like I know Lloyd Banks
And I come from apartments, 'bout to move to LA
And I'ma cop me a AP Skeleton on my b-day
If it's 'bout a check, I'm runnin' through traffic, whatever, I'd never be late
And for my respect, kill whoever for that, bitch I'm EBK
I'ma keep it 1k, lotta shit don't faze me 
Uh, me and Herb in the stu' right now and we goin' crazy
Love my lil niggas, how am I gon' replace 'em? 
Uh, take they ass onwards to Jamaica

Keep silent, it's potato, we turn 'em into tomatoes
Soon I get tired of home, probably take my shit to Vegas
Be hurry up and weight it, hurry up and get the safe
It's 6AM, my nose stopped up but I'm still smokin' wood
I know they bad but they make me feel good
Your bitch bad but she make me feel good
I popped a Percocet, they made heal good
Ridin' fast, and she got a fat ass
Handle mine, I'm ready for that, bet I get the last laugh
Still ain't got no life, see light, flash, smash
Niggas all on my dick, they hatin' on me 'cause I get it fast, cash
See 12s, I'm smashin', the bitch think I'm smashin' her
She wanna fuck 'cause I'm cashin', to be fresher than a mannequin
Call a play John Madden, I come make a mess, no napkin
Ooh, I'm countin' cabbage, ooh, that boy fantastic
She gon' call a cab, because I ain't drivin'
I ain't got the tab on me, I ain't finna cry
I'm gon' do the dash in it, that's why I ain't tryin'
I feel like 'Pac in this shit too, but I ain't dyin'
Coolin' when I'm ridin', crusin', I ain't hidin'
They gon' try find me, they ain't gotta try
Act like I ain't ridin' with that Tony Montana
Clip look like banana, you know I ain't lyin'G Herbo that's my name
Where I come from brazy
I seen way more shit in shootouts
But it never phased me
My little lessons made me
Mama, Essex raised me
I might take the easiest route
But I'm never lazy
I get fly like the first day of school
Freshest nigga in the room
Bitches seem to lose cool when they see me
Although I'm a cool dude
Trick her mind, spit her lines
Get behind, block her line
Fooled you
Bitches love to run their mouth
To see what they can figure out, blues clues
I'm just tryna stack green 'til I get a big amount
Blues too
Fuck her good, getting head
Pop a perc, show you what them blues do
And if it ain't getting money
Bet not ever let a nigga accuse you
Stay a 100, play your role, draw the line
Don't let no nigga abuse you
Fucking hoes, counting money
Fresh as fuck, that shit's just to use you
Gangways, traphouses, shootings
That's the type of shit I'm used to
Fill the sprite with a deuce
But I don't drink that shit no more, I used to
In the hood, everyday, tryna smoke my day away
I used to
Sipping lean, everyday, tryna take my pain away
I used to
Niggas stay in your lane, yeah this 30 I know how to use too

Haann, haann
Me and my niggas tryna' make it out
True story, look
Grew up with them goblins, we all came from the trenches
Young niggas lived, learned lessons, we ain't wanna listen
We just was wildin', having fun, and made some bad decisions
But we was runnin' shit, No Limit, we ain't have to listen
I was like fifteen, remember I had the coldest winter
We lost Lil Roc in February, White Folks was November
This was my freshman year of high school, we was just beginners
Skipped breakfast, woke up sliding, loading pipes for dinner
This all I knew, pop out, all my niggas wanna do
Felt like a obligation, did what we was 'pose to do
G Faro lost his bro, I seen it drill a hole in you
Said to myself, "No matter what, I'll always roll with you"
I'll always ride with you, pull up, homicide with you
And for my brothers, it's whatever, 150 forever
No Limit tats on us forever, got that shit together
We only tryna find the money, we ain't folding, never
I look at myself as like the blueprint for my niggas
Really just, you know what I'm saying, showing the way
Of how to make shit better, not even a way out
Cause we young niggas, you know what I'm saying?
We in this shit together
And really with me being in the streets and all that shit
Everything that happened in my life I ain't never prayed
Or you know, nothing like that for no way out or
To change what I got going on
Even with me having a relationship with God
Cause I already knew what I was signed up for
Just everything played out like it's destined for me, look
I came from hiding from the cops, running with my mans
And getting blew at by the opps, ducking under vans
To copping shit before it drop and counting hunnid' bands
Tryna stay humble in the jungle, you don't understand
Cause when you come from nothing and turn that into something
Niggas get to hating, ones you never seen was coming
But you ain't pussy, fuck them niggas, make you start stunting
Get niggas pissed so they do something, make you start 'bussin
And this the struggle of a young black nigga tryna' make it
You livin' life, you gotta watch for niggas tryna take it
And can't surround yourself with niggas tryna' down niggas
Clown niggas, don't want work, just wanna be around niggas
I had to show my niggas money is the way out
Ain't gotta leave the gang but if you broke, that's how you stay out
And just moved Shanse' out in a new crib, all the way out
In a place I know my sis safe out cause my family know I don't play boutChopsquadDJ

I didn't know my passion, really just asked the hood, me and Cap really stayed in the trap
Slappin' that bitch, I'm winnin', no doubts
Spring and winter, sheriffs come kick us out
Soon as it's warm we right back on the block with Glocks
Never been worried 'bout opps, so stop
So many niggas got dropped for rocks
Snitch niggas want me to rot in a box
I just been skippin' the cops, playin' hopscotch
Strap on my left, feelin' back, who's a top notch?
Links on my neck like a box of Pop Rocks
Snappin' and crackle, they doin' a lot
Understand lil' nigga, I'm havin' guap
This shit wasn't easy, it took me a lot
Fans never know what it took me to drop

You know I'm a street nigga--real street nigga and that's common sense
Everybody know you 'posed to get money, stay out the way
Lookin' down the barrel of that hammer for my last time
Made me slow down, look at life
Why I'm just gon' give you mine?
'09 I was doin' fine

I backed away from that bullshit, then I got a little more far
I'm the most gangster nigga from my city
I don't wanna know 'cause it ain't my business
I don't give a fuck about her feelings
Fuck that bitch I don't want that bitch, I don't want dealings
I was in a drug bust wit' my dope on the backseat
Gun on the front seat wit' my ankle bracelet on my feet
I been on the block all day
Shot a nigga in the hallway
Have you ever ran in the corner store, pulled a stickup broad day?
Shout out grandma 'cause she put me out
Shout out every nigga ever  me out
Same nigga threw a cross at me, same nigga that ain't wit' me now
Same niggas when I went to jail, they ain't make my bond

Nobody out here wanna use they head, so that's why I had to fly on the go
Said he ain't never, ever gonna amount to shit, but lil' nigga a rider, though 
Had a couple niggas on our hit list, so we ridin' with four 
And I ain't give a fuck if it's Christmas, I was outside for sure
And we on one, pop out, roll up, movin' quick, gotta get the seal like hold up
Gettin' a kit, used to pour a six or a four up
Niggas bitches, war time, we was watchin' 'em fold up 
And if the feds ever grab my fuckin' folder
I'ma stay a soldier 
I ain't gon' snitch on no one 
So therefore, I ain't puttin' myself in a situation no more 
I waited long to get where I'm at, I ain't gotta be patient no more 
Oh, you gangster? Nigga, you think you gangster?
Do some gangster shit
On the strip, the same niggas I hung with who claimin' it 
I was hoppin' out the backseat of that Chevy aimin' it 
And now I'm worth some M's, I'm dangerous
Your bitch love to fuck me, hit the liquor and start thankin' it

Shot at me last night, I'm angry, so I woke up flamin' shit
Nigga got caught on a date, now all his homies blame his bitch
Everybody talkin' 'bout I changed and shit, you the one that changed, bitch
Matter of fact, nigga, I did change shit, I ain't have no chains then
Crib like I was livin' in a den, came and count my dividends
Now I'm legal, I can spend anything, now my closet, my kitchen big

On the phone with his exes, I don't wanna hear it
Anything about me gettin' rich, uh
Yeah, yeah, uh 
Damn, we runnin' all the, all the, all the checks up 
I'm tryna see where the, where the twenty-nine bag go
How Durk gon' put on this bitch? Go on Google to put on a switch
Told bro I wanna be rich, but I stopped takin' Percs, it's givin' me a itch
They don't want me to be on that block no more
Don't ride by the opps no more
You can't complain, that's how I am
Just tell 'em, "Don't get shot no more"
These niggas ain't beefin', throw in the towel
He told me he vegan
I don't even try to stop the violence no more 'cause Chino died at a meetin'
Man, get the fuck out my face, I was duckin' a federal case
He went to Iowa and got him a dub 'cause that was a federal state
All that beef shit your big homie did in a year, we did in a month
And I draw some tears for all them years, for bronem, I can't stunt
I was pissed off at my lawyer, me and Von ain't do shows in month
I can't blame the judge and state's attorney, 'cause both of 'em voted for Trump
And that shit you said about us, we ain't hear that from no bitch mouth
From the 'Raq, where the killers don't ask for a discount

Maybe I could be but I don't know if I should be
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
I can't be yours baby, know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine

Bitches that won't let go when I used to fuck on basic bitches
But you, I fuck with you, 'cause I get you, you like my clue
I don't judge you but don't try me
If I'm wit' you that's 'cause I choose
Anyway I'ma keep it 100, I like the way you penetrate
With that said, I love it but you gon' manipulate

Every time you ask me what we gon' be I just grin and say
"Even if we fall off I don't wanna let that take my friend away"
I'm honest, I ain't gon' lie to your face
And you 'posed to appreciate it
Otherwise go 'round the way and let them suckers grease ya baby
Gas ya, ride 'til you on E and go right past ya
Now you stuck on still until them junkyard dummies smash ya
I ain't gon' lie, I see a good girl
Sometimes when I look in your eyes
Most times I just see through your ways
Your ways lead me straight to your thighs
Plus I don't know what's on your mind
Always need your friends to cosign
Never asked for you to be mine
Being yours, I don't have no time
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Baby I'm thuggin', I can't be your boyfriend
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Maybe I could be but I don't know if I should be
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
I can't be yours baby, know I be on tour crazy
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Just keep that on the low, baby you know how it go
You got me fucked up if you think I'ma be chasin' these niggas
I'm thrown off when I'm next to you and I'm trying things that I never do
Your money long but your head gone
All my friends telling me don't
Problem is you're a street nigga and you're always sending me off
Truly you are my best friend
I fell in love and I can't pretend
Vibe right so don't fall back
If we go together, just call it that
See I show you off 'cause I ain't ashamed of you
I'm just sick of playing all these guessing games with you
Tatted on me, we skin deep, and I ride with him, no DMV
Test drive it, it's all yours, I miss you there when you on tour
Understand you a boss man, you busy getting your hustle on
But every nigga got one bitch that he call on when he feel alone
Bottom bitch, your main thing
Your best drug, your worst pain
Your girlfriend, your confidant
These niggas actin' so nonchalant

Yes I'm the loyal type, I'm just tryna make you mine
If only you were mine, if only you were mine
Baby I'm thuggin', I can't be your boyfriend

With my cousins and the rest of my grandmama children
I was the youngest, this was way before I had a sibling
'Member watchin' water from the rain leak through the ceiling
'Member watchin' roaches, rats run off through the kitchen
And my kitchen eased off chicken, you don't know the feeling
From the fucking up the kitchen, bad bitch doin' dishes
Mama know that I'm that nigga, she see how I'm living
'Member calling police station, she thought I was missing
Told her everything gon' be straight but she thought I was tripping
Cause I was posted on the 8, with Pistol totin' missiles
She say when you end up in prison, niggas ain't gon' miss ya
But we ain't like these pussy niggas, my niggas official
Instead they end up in prison and gave me the whistle
Mally said chill on that hot shit and just keep your pistol
For if a nigga want it with me that mean he don't get you
I'm that nigga, been that nigga all my life lil' nigga
I only spit the truth I put that on my mic lil' nigga
The difference between me and you, not nothing slight lil' nigga
You waitin' in line, I'm takin' shit we not nothing alike lil' nigga
Settle for less, that's what you got and what's in sight lil' nigga
I dreamed of riding foreign, I was on a bike lil' nigga
You out here flexing tryna stunt for hoes you like lil' nigga
I was up on Essex servin' hypes, you all on Skype, lil' nigga
You bought that bitch a pair of shoes, I bought a pipe, lil' nigga
Ain't never used one, squeezed that bitch with all my might, lil' nigga
Ain't never used one, it was ball or shoot, lil' nigga choose one
Bought my first tool, stopped going to school, now all I keep is new guns
Bought a five shot .38 and went in with my new one's
Now I keep 40 Glocks on me, wake up and bow a few one's
For G-Fazo, I run through ones
On opps, we ran through guns
Young niggas, we was goin' through some
Wakin' up, just to shoot someThis is dirty Sprite right here man like Future handed me this motherfucker. You already know what it is, this is G Herbo. 150 dream team man, I stay leanin', codeinin', promethazinin'. This shit ain't a habit no more, this shit like a lifestyle, a way of life now. Check it
Since Instagram say everybody ballers and shot callers
Why the world not a better place?
I used to fuck with niggas round the city, across the state
But niggas fake
Ain't tryna sip, just let me buy the eight
I tell myself even though I got a lot of niggas
But name a nigga filthy rich around a bunch of niggas
Don't get me wrong I love my niggas and I trust my niggas
But add up all my savages man that's a quick 50
Get rich or die tryin' way before I hit 50
And then reach out to all my niggas like "get rich with me"
And every nigga that's my mans got to understand
If I say yes every time my bands ain't gonna stand a chance
But all my niggas hustlers, they givin' grams out
So customers the only people with they hands out
Rusky keep a 9, Moody got a bankroll

I said I was gonna stop man, I don't know I be goin' through a lot of shit man so these fours be easin' my pain. I say I'm gon' stop this to save a little money cause this shit cost you know?

In high school I'm late as fuck, woke up at 8 o'clock
Teach like "Wright you late again, oh what perfect timing"
"No complete assignments, let me guess you was grinding?"
I'm like well matter of fact you right, I am fresh off the grind
I am gon' do something with my life, I am fresh off the nine
I am a statistic, yeah I dropped out of school
But unlike you man, I'ma go do what I gotta do
I ain't go get a job and take a check somebody givin' me
I'ma leave the house and then come back with 0 energy
Pocket full of cash and a neck full of gold
Let my momma thumb through somethin' every time, nigga
I think I ran through all that money on lean not cause it was a trend or cause other niggas doin' that shit man but because that's what I wanna do. I'ma do whatever I want that make me happy and that's pertaining to anything in my life man. I feel like anybody should just do what make them happy and let no body judge you, look
I promise man I'm finna go insane but I ain't tryin'
Everybody tryna sell a nigga dreams but I ain't buyin'
Can somebody tell me what the fuss about man, I ain't signed
If I deal with an advance, shit ain't nobody give me mine
And the shit they handin' out, I ran through that like 50 times
Shit 60 matter of fact, I spent like 50 on the Act'
Big G Herbo fresh as fuck, yeah all my fits at least a stack
Niggas think it's only rap
30 clips in every strap
They wanna go? I'm ready
Like the levies, they try and wet me
Plus I'm leanin' heavy
So they think it's easy to catch me
Better think again
Got it on me and I'm focused, finna drink again
Lost my homie and it still ain't really sinkin' in
I just pray we link again
Thought we knew it all except the part we was drinkin' in
I'ma Crush killer, Fanta fiend, spillin' the Sprite

You must've been in the trenches, you know me but I don't remember you though 
Niggas be talking 'bout all that kill shit, ain't never did it before
You be with gorillas or so , you play with them triggers or so 
My youngins they with it for sure, don't send 'em cause they just be willing to go 
Book 'em and give 'em a bond, we spend it cause they already been knew the ho
Get money like the 80s, ayy, pull up, new Mercedes 
Whole lot of bitches hate me , she was trynna have my baby 
You can just give the top and bail, I always drove off the lazy 
Did my lil' dirty dance, got ghost, I thought I was Patrick Swayze 
Get my lil' 30 bands a show, it really ain't nothing amazing 
Pull up make the crowd go brazy . nigga play cray got to face 'em 
I'm real high I look Asian , my eyes low like the basement 
Crib in the sky now, high as hell
I used to get high in the basement 
Nigga, you hating I can tell, I just want me some paper
Take advantage of this rap shit, might as well, know I got tired of the station 
I was gon' be in that bitch high as hell, I drunk a deuce raw and they liked us
I was young. I ain't know how to shake up the dope, so I gave it out raw and they liked it 
And I saw that shit through like a psychic 
Got this bitch on my hip this my sidekick 
I was gone off the ecstasy drinking some liquor ain't like the shit straight so I spiked it 
I told her come dolo, she can't leave her friend
But she said, "It's whatever", she dyking 
I text back, "Girl, don't tell me that, I'm trifling" 
Now I'm on point like a Viking
She said she'll be here in five minutes
Said, "Call when yo Uber arriving"
Let him in the room eat me alive in it 
Shit didn't even last 25 minutes
Put the business out ain't even like it 
Shit smell like fish coming out that pussy bitch you must be a Pisces 
You must be sick giving out that pussy bitch, ain't nobody wifed it 
I don't wanna fuck, you can't give me no woodie, bitch, you ain't even excited 
Me and my bitch having recruits for threesomes, ho, you ain't even invited 
I get in, I'm scoring, you spying
Used to pour in the sprite to get high with it
FN on me, more than likely
I got bands on me, more than likely
Ain't never been to the county of Audi 
Did my dirt, got away 'cause I'm nice with it
Everywhere you see us go, we got pipes with us
Same shit got my homies indictedAye, aye now on some real shit though, man
It's, it's like Chicago is just a lifestyle that you know what I'm sayin' a lot of people not used to but we adapted to it
Like I'm 20 years old, I know I know probably at least 50 people dead, like personally that I know like dead or not
You know what I'm sayin'
On the day to day basis this shit not regular
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babys catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the gang, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we play
Illinois, Chi, Eastside I was raised
Roamin' outside spendin' most of my days
Grade school, just a young nigga with a heart in 'em
And ain't none bigger
And some other young niggas with me ready for whatever
All I tell 'em 'go and get 'em thuggin', hustlin'
Shed a tear, shoulda make his blood brothers like I was born with 'em
Took a long, long time love to see my niggas shine
Fought a storm with them,  a couple gone on the ride
They ain't seen outside a long, long time
Somewhere at the wrong time, prolly too much on they mind
Tryna homicide, other half gone now
God called him home while mama is traumatized
And that's why we all quick to change niggas
One time back again the wall
Lettin' pistols off with the same niggas, sit with me floor seats
Tryna draw a piece, at the ball games kickin'
State to state on the planes trippin'
Kobe died we was pain sippin'
Thinkin' how we used to hang with him
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babys catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the game, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we play
'Member when I used to write rhymes on the Microsoft
Record lyrics on the trap flip 'fore I ever touched a microphone
Young nigga, like 15 granny livin' in the warzone
Naw I ain't talkin' Hot cars, boy I had to take a striker home
I ain't gon' lie was frightened, but I had it right by my side, I'ma let it off always
Walkin' inside with that bitch in my hand with no lock on the door and no light in the hallway
One thing for certain, I know that my killers lurkin'
Wake up, they flip it through all day
Go catch a fuck nigga lacking like always
Hop out the whip pull out the clip in broad day
Ain't no regrets 'cause all the shit we did, we did it our way
Can't trust niggas, fuck these niggas I learned that the hard way
And all the niggas that's with me they ridin' like a Harley
.40 in that old school, it ride like a 'Rari
All we know is darkness, all we know is pain
All my niggas heartless, this the game we play
And we come from, where they hate us
And they take from, world full of fake love
Nothin' but cloudy days, shoot outs 'round the way
Babies catchin' strays, but this the game we play
This the game we play
Know I'm riding for the game, we straight
I know this the game we play, one soldier die and still we playAye, aye, aye
150 Dream Team, RIP all my niggas man
I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I remember 16, told myself money was gon' do nothin' to me
I'ma get up a check and always be the same cause that shit wasn't nothin' to me
But my mama got bills and my sister 13 and they depend' on nothin' but me
So how the fuck money ain't nothin' to me when I know it ain't nothin' for free
And I come from the east ain't no love in the streets
Growin' up it wasn't nothin' to be
I was runnin' the streets, fell in love with the heat
Niggas never did nothin' to me
As a youngin' I grew up then broke in the hood with my niggas
And knew how to rap
Went to sleep at my grannies with roaches and rats
Then I woke up with 200 racks
Fuckin' offsides, gettin' fly every day sippin' Act'
And you know I went flat
Got in my zone and went up some more racks
Plus that 200 back
2015 is my year on the low, I just run up a few hundred racks
They don't give me my credit, they know that G Herbo the man, all I do is spit facts
I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I'm a hustler, Benz in my first 50k 'fore I travel these lil 50 states
Yeah they doubted me, said I was too in the streets, what I do? Run it up anyway
And I been in the streets and I made enemies
Can't get rid of what's pendin' to me
No Limit, we been right at east
Dream team boy, I've been MVP
And that's prolly why they envy me
I know niggas hatin', I see that they fakin'
I read it in they body language
They ain't gangsta for real, they ain't ready to kill
I can read it in they body language
And I got it on me, it don't matter beef, run up on me, leave your body stankin'
Hit them all, I got blood on my Masons
All this money is makin' me feel like I changed, thinkin' bout back in the days
When I used to feel like I could stay in the hood, get my money, and still be the same
But I'm still with the gang, just tryna stay in my lane and I move like a boss now
My whole family look up to me and I know if I fuck up it's only my loss now
I don't know what's becoming of me
All this money been coming to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to me
I've been changing my ways, thought money wasn't gon' do nothing to me
Yeah that money do something to me even though it ain't nothin' to meUh, mothafucka
Yeah, I'm finna go grab the Lambo truck soon as that bitch drop
No bap
Ayy, uh, you're big dawg now, you get smart
I'm a millionaire 
And I saw this shit through so I'm a visionary
Look up hustler, you see my face in the dictionary 
Remember the only paper in my hand was an obituary 
I wasn't never scared , I wasn't never worried 
I was shootin' that bitch every time I touched it like Stephen Curry
Summertime when I popped lil' nigga, that was my anniversary
Had a curse, reversed it
Hit the booth, it's an emergency
I got a verse for 30 
Now here I go off Percs 
Nigga, what's the controversy? 
Probably would've been your daddy had the condom burst 
But don't mention my fuckin' name, I don't want that drama emergin'
While y'all niggas on it
I'll text everybody where your house at and send everybody to purge you
One day I'ma buy my bitch a Birkin
But, I gotta stay on my grind, shit, I gotta stay workin'
There's at least a dub callin' on my line, cook up, bitches twerkin'
Wht you want, a turkey?
You tryna get this shit any lower than this, fuck you want, some mercy?
What you on, a Pereky?
And you say those 15s ain't doin' nothin' for you
What you on, a 30?
You got that gold on and got souls gonna go
Fuck, you think you Xeres?
Ain't no submittin', if you want my spot, bitch, gotta murk me
I'm a millionaire 
And I saw this shit through so I'm a visionary 
Look up hustler, you see my face in the dictionary 
Remember the only paper in my hand was an obituary 
I wasn't never scared, I wasn't never worried
I was shootin' that bitch every time I touched it like Stephen Curry
Summertime when I popped lil' nigga, that was my anniversary
Had a curse, reversed it
Hit the booth, it's an emergency
I got a verse for 30 
I'm in the booth, I knock that out
I got a verse for 30 
Still keep a Perk or somethin' in my lil' pocket
I pop in case of emergencies 
And it get hectic, I pull out this lil' rocket
Clock in the sizzock, knock your little shit outta it
Play in the street, tryna get every bit out of it
Met the connect, I finessed a little brick out of it
Trap goin' brazy, I just had to sit on it
That shit gon' get at it 
Chopper goin' brazy, we goin' too brazy
The cops keep on raidin' it but ain't get shit out of it 
Yeah, I been runnin' with my dawgs 
So you know it's licks involved
All I know is get rich, that's all
Blow 20K, send my bitch to ball
Hit the A 'cause I ain't been to Phipps in long
Bitch, I'm eatin', all I leave 'round tips and bones
One chain look like a 60 ball
Slide on your bitch at six in the morning
After I leave her, leave that bitch alone
Block her on my cellular phone, yeah
I'm a millionaire 
And I saw this shit through so I'm a visionary 
Look up hustler, you see my face in the dictionary 
Remember the only paper in my hand was an obituary
I wasn't never scared, I wasn't never worried
I was shootin' that bitch every time I touched it like Stephen Curry
Summertime when I popped lil' nigga, that was my anniversary
Had a curse, reversed it
Hit the booth, it's an emergency
I got a verse for 30
I'm a visionaryIon fuck with no bitch niggas
No snitch niggas, no brick niggas

If you outside when them bullets flyin
Then you gon' get hit nigga
You know I demand bucks
Stick up, hands up
Rounds clap from the hot shit
When the Glock spit pick ya mans up
Got bail money, no handcuffs
Mossberg leave his mans slumped
Let the shottie bust til his body bust
Then beat his body up with the cans up
Like when lil bruce hit Rotti up
Free lil hitta tear Audi up
87th wanna rock with us

But everybody ain't real niggas
So 83rd, they the sloppy us
But anyways this shit real

Free G Gill and we WILL
My dope rolled like 3 pills
3 shots fired and that's 3 kills
Show no mercy when you see field
That's real rap, on 79th them real traps
In the dip with them real gats
I ain't talkin bout no lil gats
That ning ding like Lil Shaq

Run up on him with the steel mac
These niggas caps get peeled back
Murder one on my 5th track
Ima boss, I ripped that

Listen, yeah im riding round with that 50
High points in that semi
Let off 4 bricks from the four fifth
Leave a ho stiff like dickies
Yeah its black mob, get benchpressed
Like "hey man, see the light man?"
Roll up on him in a white van
Blowin shells out like sprite cans
And it's Ls over them fuck niggas
The sweet route, I can't go
Every cent in my payroll I made that for Fazo!
And they must know
Cash coming it must go
That money come by the bus flow
And I ain't got no trust fund, I trust none
Its a cold war and my luck done
When it's war time I trust guns
I ain't gotta lie
No fear in me cuz i gotta die
And im good ma, you ain't gotta cry
Cuz im posted up with them thugs niggas
Talkin like a drug dealer
It ain't how you raised me
That street shit just changed me
Had to grow up and be a real nigga
16 tryna kill niggas
Got problems gon' deal with em
Drop whoever step to me
Making niggas leave they hood
Call they ass some refugees
EBK right next to me
Essex on the left of me
And I know that talk is cheap, so money got the best of me
And i'll never back down, so courage got the rest of me
Hustle till the death of me
Money on mind, Lil herbie on that grind
So im posted on the 8 with a 30 in my 9
Put a nigga on his ass if he come across the line
Let his mans meet the nickle if he tryna drop a dime
Make a nigga freeze up like my hamma stoppin time
Really though
Run up on his block with the mask, Rey Mysterio
Mac shots rip a nigga up now he cheerio
Back to the block banging harder than a stereo
I told them I was gettin on, but I dont think they hear me thoughIntro:
I speak the truth, I live the truth, I respect the truth
I respect the grind man...niggas who be they self
You try to force yourself upon some shit that you ain't
And you never been I just can't relate to it, look....
The rap game kill niggas, literally
It turn gangstas into drag queens
They look down on workin' hard like it's a bad thing
Shit I'm the last man standing if you ask me
I was just broke not long ago, it feel like last week
Remember niggas in they Benz's ridin' past me
I never hated, used to see that shit as motivation
And I was lost up in the streets, I needed navigation
Ain't wanna be no doctor, lawyer, ended up a patient
Young nigga said, "Fuck Jordans" went and copped a Sauer
Ruth's Chris three times a week, I got tired of Goya
I'm from Chiraq but I got killa niggas in the Nola
Go get that money for tomorrow, fuck who did before ya
Don't put yo focus in this bitches, they just gone destroy ya
Don't put ya trust up in these niggas, man fuck these niggas
Cause when you ain't so beneficial they stop fuckin' witcha
That's why I just be wit my niggas, fuck them other niggas
And every nigga always put they niggas over niggas
But I know my niggas ain't nun like no other niggas
If you ain't grinding, you just hating, you a sucka nigga
No we don't do no twitter beef, we really in these streets
We ain't trippin' bout no bitches, cause we know they freaks
And we really getting money, but we stay lowkey
If niggas really getting money, they gone let it speak...
Can you break down your whole grind, and still keep it brief
Instead of tellin' instagram what you make a week?
Ten-thou', twenty-thou' that's what you make a week?
On my mother, fly nigga, spend that shit on briefs
Fifty for a pack of three? I spend that shit on tees
Fifty-thou', hunnid-thou'? I spend that shit on jeans
Stunt on me? Lil nigga please, I do this shit with ease
A thousand on my G-Fazo's I don't do Giuse's 
Still 1500 for my jeans, bitch I love the B's 
200 for my Backwoods, you know we smokin' P's 
But I ain't tryna stunt my nigga, run it up, Imma run it up
Tryna see 30 with a hunnid-mill, boy I pray to God I don't fuck it up
Couple hunnid-thou', I done fucked it up, went and got it back
Told myself "enough" had to slow down I was in a rush, two or three hunnid' always in the cuffs spent 500 when I woke up
Young nigga living. I ain't give a fuck, spent 10 thou' like it wasn't nun
Remember them days I ain't have nun, slide in them foreigns
Totin' them thirties nigga, we slidin' always stunting
Don't IG none of our cars, can't let niggas know how we comin'
But niggas know how we comin', No Limit M.B. we drummin'
Pull up, everybody start runnin', know foenem gone hit sumn'
I ain't worried bout none of my enemies, I know I'm gone hit sumn'
I'm on defense, keep that thang wit me, gotta keep on gettin
This money, but I know I'm on my way to better days
Some niggas hatin' they wanna see me in my grave
Let me keep that .40, wanna see me in a cage I jumped off that porch, and knew what was comin I seen it in so many ways, but I knew how to handle myself in the streets I can't let that shit
Drive me insane, on the 8 we on point for the opps in the morning
Been at war for so many days, in the cut wit that bitch gotta watch
For the Jakes, jumping and hopping the fence, 50 shots and we
Bang, "Jumpout" the Gang, hop out the car wit them tents
And my niggas, they still in the hood everyday, bitch I'm
The only one traveling, tried to tell em to come on the road
All the time, they just wanna stay in the trap wit it. 
150 Dream Team the Campaign man... I'm focused full fledged
You know what I'm saying.... just on my shit, I ain't too much
Anticipating all this other shit, what niggas got going on
Just on my own shit man, Big G Herbo, you already know what it is
Ion know what I'm workin' on, a mixtape or a album
Might name my shit "Mixtape Or The Album" haha....You know, my mama live in a million dollar home and my sister, she still in high school
She just got suspended for fighting two white boys when they called her a nigga
You know, we— I thought we— shit, got away from this shit going on in the inner city, you know, for a better life
My first time getting arrested or any encounter with, like, the police and shit was when I was 12 years old, so that mean
They branded us early on for this shit
It's kind of designed for failure, you know, they want us to be labeled as just "nigga"
Still a nigga, just a nigga
Dropped straight out of high school like the rest them niggas
So I became a statistic way before I got I got digits
Ain't nobody think a million was realistic
I was out trippin' on some shit, I coulda missed it
Couldn't imagine life without my moms or lil' sister
Still said my goodbyes and hit the streets and start riskin' it again
Back out throwing rocks at penitentiaries again
Violence been the answer in my city since a kid
Sayin' that to explain some of the silly shit I did
But I'm just a nigga, what I'm 'posed to do?
Usually the one who hurt you mostly close to you
Reason why they say don't let nobody close to you
Just some niggas, got nobody 'cept for who we closest to
Jigga said we still nigga, and I'm just a nigga
But we real niggas, so respect a nigga
I'm a restless nigga, gettin' a check, nigga
Ballin' with my dawg, I'm like, "Check, nigga"
And I'm like ballin' on y'all, Spaldin'
Foreign all small and I'm tall, gotta crawl in
When I got paper, thought less of niggas, how you want me to
Runnin' problems, they don't never solve 'em, always want me to
Yes, I'm ballin', it's true and it's always over loot
Don't wanna slay my own kind 'cause I'm gon' walk in and shoot
Bless a nigga, I'll stretch a nigga, now it's less a nigga
Well-invested but detectives still wanna arrest a nigga
And it's tatted in my skin, I'm still a Essex nigga
All the shit I did was mostly sins, I wasn't supposed to win
Hundred bottles floatin', all endorsed, propose a toast again
All the niggas really love me genuine, supposed to grin
Security some bitches, the promoter got my toasters in
Now we at the top I'm like, "Damn"
If I had to, I'd still'll do that shit again
Niggas be like me but I'll never be like them
I was in the trenches, no deliverance, amen
Opps be on my dick more than my bitches 'cause they fans
Let me see who real niggas by a show of hands
Manipulate your soldiers, made them violent for a band
You don't really love 'em, had 'em wildin' for a band
But you got on them new Balenciagas for a band
Love to do each other like we mobbin' for the clan
For the right dollar amount and he'll slime his own man
In interrogations I was patient for the silence of the clan
Even though I know a killer like The Silence of the LambsHttps://genius.com/G-herbo-so-chicago-so-brooklyn-freestyle-lyricsGANG! L's... shoutout my squad man

Nigga that's Black History
No safety, if a nigga run up on me nigga
Now he Black History
You can catch me on the block all day

Big blunts remind me of the block
Hallways smelt just like piss to me
And I cough so long, cause the smoke so strong
That's why I gotta sip the drank
Bitch asked me "Herbo why yo cup so pink?"
I said "that's that mystery, bitch!"
How the Act had me gone like that
That's a unsolved mystery
When the Jakes ask me how they man's got whacked
That's an unsolved mystery
Out in traffic niggas know Duwop got the Gat

"Herb how you like Ibaka wit the Heat?"

Then I'm back on the Ave
Wit a mouth full of glass can't serve
Unless you coppin' it from me bitch!Look, When you out here playing this street shit man

Main thing, don't panic, keep yo head up
R.I.P. them niggas, R.I.P. big squad
Lets get it, GANG!
Imma tell you this, what you see ain't always whatchu get
So when you out here in these streets can't never trust no bitch
Stay in that trap and work your wrist, you just might get rich
You think that work was Jesse White the way I make it flip
In the streets I learned some shit that I can't forget
Rule number 1 don't never snitch you know what they get
Rule number 2 worry about you, don't owe nobody shit
And remember this, what you see ain't always whatchu get
Imma tell you this what you see ain't always whatchu get
Cause I saw that light right before my eyes, but they ain't hit shit
Remember all them nights, totin' all them pipes to protect my life
Imma ride for the squad, even when it ain't right, to protect my stripes
Mad Max goin right from the block to the opps, now he right by mikes

Shit'll never be the same, if hit another stain, imma spend it all on a watch
Lil shit on your instagram don't mean nothing bruh, is you balling or not?

Teaching suckers a lesson, give they bitches a blessing through all of my guap
And these nothing ass hoes got y'all niggas stressing, man it all gotta stop
Ya bitch all on my jock, won't believe what she did when she saw all my knots
If she know about you way before you meet her, then that bitch a eater
First week she want you to meet all her peoples, don't trust them either
Lowkey around you, hope her nigga don't see her, fuck around and beat her
Know I got that heater, I ain't worried bout nothing, I'm just puffing reefer
You can catch me in the hood, niggas think it's all good
But I don't trust them neither
Couple G's on me, and if I wanted to shit, I could drop it on my sneakers
And I gotta get rich, cause this money ain't shit
Like I'm just working on features
And I don't owe you shit, you ain't ride for my clique
Nigga you ain't tote them heaters
If you play the other team we'll have your momma crying, walking on my bleachers
You can't walk in my sneakers, you ain't from where I'm from
You don't rock with my peoples, and they don't rock you neither
You ain't been where I been, you ain't did what I did

Lotta shit I said I'm 'posed to did, I ain't do it yet
My homie ran up some bands, got a newer TEC

We was young and hearing stories we couldn't wait to see some shit
I'ma buy my own gun I can't wait to heat some shit
When I bought my first gun, I went and flamed up some shit
Next day, I'm goin' to school they said my name in that bitch
Niggas walkin' up to me, like, "You dangerous as shit"
Damn, I thought we was all gangbangers and shit
Niggas changin' and shit, snitching, how he turn witness?
It was all good, heard his statement, then he switched it

Then he turned states on you, why he with the district?
Pussy, keep your distance
All these niggas out here rappin' suckin' dick lips but I been rich since
And I can spot a fuck nigga, I got a sixth sense
These bitches go through Kevlar, don't get your shit rinsed
What I spent on choppers, could've bought a cheap Benz
I been in that field too long, I need a deep cleanse
Plenty nights we fired the block up then re-spin
We chasin' dreams and nightmares, but we ain't Meek friends
Shit, a lot of square feet I sleep in
Backwoods cheap in, Louis Vuitton sheets in
Used to be trap houses, fiends was all tweaked in
I can't even tell 'em shit, shouldn't have got 'em geeked in
I be like everywhere, they see me eatin' 
"Herbo, can you take a picture?" These some fans
We just need you walk through, these some bands
Ain't gone search you, get the hawk through, these ya mans

Got a Eastside swag so my dialect funny
If Rich was here he woulda never had to buy back Sonny
Cause we gon' slide 'til the sunny up, tie a nigga mommy up
Fill the old semis up, fire the whole city up
Never gave any fucks, you don't get no pity chump
Never heard a fitty dump, walk 'em down, hit 'em up
Take that, take that, dancin' like he Diddy slump
Want smoke, gimme some, free, it's for anyone
Humble, but I'm cocky, scared of me like Fofty
Bulletproof the whip cause my son in the car seat,  uh, nigga
Chi-raq with it, stay on top of him like Max with it
And I'm still relaxed with it
I restore that hip-hop feeling and mix facts with it
Treat rap like my city, put that shit up on my back with it
Ain't nobody like me, guess I'm that different
Slide the chopper back, hit it
Act like I'm defensive, then react with it
I know the real react, so I react different
Had a hundred-thousand, 18
Ain't want a deal, I had a pack shipping
My freshmen year of high school, I was Act' sippin'
Tried cuttin' that shit, I lost Max and started back sippin'

So if I honor any honor nigga I'd be damned
I'm fighting cases now, the judge want me to go to school

Pray I die wit a bag
G Herbo, and I done went through 200k man
I ran through that shit already
Tryna go way up and stay up look
Like my bro Cap way before rap, bitch I had stupid swag
So let me tell you how I blew a bag
Hit up the mall and spend $10k, don't check no stupid tag
Spent $1,600 on that 8, drunk that shit super fast
They like "Herbo, yo lil' stupid ass"
You better not go broke tryna ball out and stack you a bag
When all them other niggas fall off, best have you a bag
If OG just need sum' to call on, best have you a bag
I got a million things to do wit' cash
Like buy a Masi just to do the dash
And wasn't no silver spoons, all the dishes dirty
So every $50k, I put up 30
You live then you die, 'til then get the cash
Think about tomorrow nigga, fuck the past
You gon' lose it all tryna fucking flash
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Pray I die wit a bag
{Verse 2]
Go blow that income, save that profit, that's what I'm about $600,000 for my mama house
She tryna own it, watch me knock it out
Time to shove my spending problems down
Plus lawyer fees, cuz' I still ain't put that choppa down
Not even when I'm out of town
Money burning out my pockets when I'm outta town
Told bronem "Just go shopping", when I'm not around
100's, 50's on me in and outta town
I be Louis and Dolce Gabana down
This exclusive shit, Givenchy, it's not around
Rollin' Backwoods and Posto straight out the pound
Smith & Wesson gon' let off a lotta rounds
F-N let off and I won't make not a sound
You can't ball wit me lil nigga, you all out of bounds
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Think about tomorrow nigga, fuck the past
You gon' lose it all tryna fucking flash
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
Pray I die wit a bag
You live then you die, so then get the cash
Pray I die wit a bagI've Just Been Waking Up To All My Problems And Shit

I'm livin' proof that you can do it, too
By time I turned twenty-two I had a M or few
Get it? Had a M or few, ain't say a M or two
Spread wealth with your nigga, why you think it's him or you?
Why you think it's not enough out here for him to get it, too?
It's bad enough we limit us, we all criminals
And I woulda said "they", but this shit mental, dude
The system been designed for self to let it get to you
I'm talkin' self-destruction, traps for individuals
But I'ma dumb it down, I'ma humble down, I'ma mumble now
I been in the ring with Satan, had to rumble hours
I guess I had to go through pain to make another album
My mind thinkin' 'bout so much shit I be smokin' ounces
I need inspiration, in the Matrix, hella hours
I love the studio, been in there for eleven hours
Its four a.m. today, this goin' on my seventh hour
Put everything in perspective of what they're goin' through
And the PTSD that must come with that
And also why it's so important to get this story out here
And offer opportunity to these kids so these kids have somethin' to leave the streets for
It's like, "Oh, get out the streets 'cause you gon'⁠—
You either gonna die or go to jail"
Everybody knows that, they know that
But, like, leave the streets? Like, what opportunity do I really have?
To do what? Leave the streets to what?
Go work at McDonalds?
So the people that was tryna kill me last week can see me? Like, what you want me to do?
Herbo, where you see yourself in ten years? It's hard as shit
Everyday I'm gettin' sharper, I been smart as shit
And for some reason I feel like this still my hardest shit
Never seen a gangster like this, gotta pardon it
Hoppin' out a foreign, valet parkin' it
Used to be a tourist, broad day, sparkin' it
It ain't shit for me to rap about my life 'cause I'm a artist
I get personal and burn this bitch down like a arsonist
Shine bright 'cause I survived a lot of darknesses
When I walk I shake the ground like Parkinson's
Since fourteen, on my back, it been a target
It just make me go harder 'cause I'm knowin' why you started this shit
You just wanna be a part of this shit
I should've left the streets sooner, I got smart at this shit
Played your cards wrong, your disloyalty, I spotted it
Could have had smoke with whoever, ain't nada, I got in it
Now they change the weather, through the rain, whatever
Supposed to stay forever, we could have changed together
Got that butterfly effect, it's like I changed for the better
I ain't got no friends in here, nigga, I came for the cheddar
I came with Berettas, uh, Glocks, etcetera
And we'll pop the messenger, you try and stop from tellin' us
I rose from the cellar, in the bank more than regular
Still got some killers with me that'll rob the register
Mansions, marble floors, penthouses everywhere
Been inside the dealership a few, but you ain't ever there
Man, I worked my ass off for this shit, I'm tellin' ya
Granny house was rats on the rug like Angelica
How the fuck you jealous? Why the fuck you yellin'?
You ain't up no millions? Why the fuck you chillin'?
And you ain't securin' 'em? Why the fuck you trippin'?
You ain't got security? How the fuck you livin'?
How the fuck you think I did it? By my lonely, don't forget it
Wops and leave the stu', it's 8 a.m. but I just woke up finished
Every time they told me I couldn't, that just woke a menace
Blessed, I got a million dollar mouth, but I don't know a dentistHerbo stop playing with these real stupid goofy motherfuckers, man 
No, they ain't... Ayy, they ain't hear you, man
These bitches slow slow slow, you hear me?

Shout out Herbo, you know 
Get your slow bigoted ass out of here, bitch, I can't wife youNigga get realll, you catch me in the the 745 ridin round on big wheels
Run up on me you'll get killed
Cuz my chain and my watch cost bandz
Keep it on me, Ion trust em, I do not got friends
Heater on me plus another, yea my Glock got twins
Bitches never leave my brothers, we the block, heaters pop
Fam think it's sweet well its not, he could stop
Ridin thru the streets, fuck the cops free Lil Joc
I ain't lying in the streets I be riding with the heat
Niggas smile in my face blow the 9 at his teeth
Ion roll with the snakes, but I ride with the beasts
Keep the O's in the safe and the iron in the streets
Tot the iron on my waist, off the loud and the lean
3-5 in the 8 I rewind with the beat
I might lean so hard close my eyes on my feet
Got yo bitch on her knees, open wide get a treat
No time to decide, open wide bitch it's free
That's the only thing free if you asking for me
Im the only nigga spendin 45 on the my suite
Walk around, park the 745 on the street
Bitches scream my name explodin inside for the D
And the gang we post on the 9 over east
Lil Herb, im the realest nigga

If you throw it at me ima kill a nigga
You the witness nigga, let the witness feel it

We got the city hot cuz we young niggas wildin
Got alotta poles, we addicted to the violence
Pull up on the set, shootin techs with the silence
Bitch nigga won't hear shit, but the sirens
Skeet off, cut the heat off
Tell her hold a deep jaw till my meat soft
Whip started self up like a depot
Pull up on him, all white with his teeth sowed
Like a rich nigga, 17 worth 6 figures
Squad making noise lotta niggas tryna get with us
Keep a small circle cuz he might be a snitch nigga
Team no talking, big poles for a big nigga
Catch me on the road doing, tryna get rich
Or might be with a Folly boy shooting at a brick nigga
Everybody killer, middle fingers to a bitch nigga
Leave him no where, we dont gain, thats my lil niggaMany men
Wish death upon a swervo
Left on a Glock right hand on the turbo
From the trenches either in a missle you a bozo
From where bitches set they nigga just for a fur coat
I seen youngins fourteen go to school wit pipes
I seen niggas lose they life cause they ain't lose a fight
You know the streets is a maze gotta maneuver right
The shit you do on daily might not get you through the night
I was born in a world full of hatred if you got a weak mind youn make it
Boy you got a chance out betta take it
And if not then it's back to the basics
No heat roaches rats in the basement
It's like mom payin rent for a vacant
It's still more to have what she makin
wit a soul full of hate hit the streets start takin
And youn know the streets like hades and youn know the streets life crazy
Homicides I done seen like 80 youngins cryin in the street my baby 
The rap game killed niggas, literally and turned gangstas into drag queens
They look down on workin hard like it's a bad thing
Shit I'm the last man standing if you ask me
I was just broke not long ago it feel like last week
Remember niggas in they benz ridin past me
I never hated I just used that shit as motivation
I was lost up in the streets I needed navigation
Ain't wanna be no doctor lawyer ended up a patient
Young nigga said fuck jordans when he copped the Soya
Ruth Chris three times a week I got tired of Goya
I'm from Chi-raq but I got killer niggas in the Nois'
I remember back when I was young nigga
Teacher stereotyped me as a dumb nigga
Now lil niggas wanna be like me
Tell em finish high school don't be like me
Dropped out but I hit a high IQ
I was on the 8 block totin' doing high speeds
Now I'm bossed up 150 DT
Niggas wanna see me gotta run it by me
I was broke in the hood tryna buy Gs
Trappin out in white tees tryna buy Nikes
And I'm still in the hood rockin white tees
All G-fazos still got on Nikes
End of day so I would've went crazy but the money and fame never changed me
Started rappin on some street shit
I was dead broke
Ain't nobody never gave me shit I had to sell dope
And when that shit get to movin slow we fuckin with the coke
I can't let them white folks lose me don't catch us wit elbows

Oh cuz I stood up on the curb I was tryna get in shit?
My mama never married my pops  no tuition and
Everything I learn I learned just like a fisherman
Cast my real out on whatever hook I'm dealin' with
Grandma used to put me on games with a intuition and
Never stop roll though I changed a few missions and
I see why Mr.  never hunger out Benjamin
Cut a few off that was only there for the benifits
And I'd be damned  if they even order me off my dental plan

Livin' this shit I'm rappin' 'bout, you know, I'm just
Glad I'm livin', alive to rap about this shit now
'Member what it used to be like, I was seventeen
'Member what it used to be like, I was off the lean
'Member what it used to be like, all I had a dream
'Member what it used to be like, we ain't have a thing
But I turned into some shit that they all wanna be like
Ain't gon' never get like this 'cause you don't wanna be right
I make all the sacrifice so you live a better life
Somebody told me, "Leave your legacy while you still alive"
Somebody told me, "Leave your legacy while you still alive"
I wonder what it'd be like if G-Fazo was still alive
'Member when Kobe died, I drunk that shit raw out the bottle
We went to war for 'Raq, wonder if he was here, would he have a body?
We gon' fall out 'bout this rap shit, wonder what Slim would've felt about it?
Turned all the way up in this rap shit, but I wish Cap was right here beside me
Now a moment of silence 
Way we grew up, all we knew was violence
2012, we was strapped, used to play with them bitches like violins
We didn't even get to make it back safe and we hearin' the sirens
We gon' headbutt with the opps, on the iPhones wildin'
Matter fact, fuck that, if you want smoke, we can dial in
Just on the low, we gon' pull a vino or a pile-in
And we ain't broke no more, l'll do ya, end up on an island
Tryna see my niggas get rich, though
Keep it on my hip, what it's hittin' for?
And we shootin' dice, what it's hittin' for?
Ten for a stack, what it's hittin' for?
Fuck a nigga bitch like a nympho
Been in the streets, what's the info?

Went to school, had to dip to link link with the seventeen niggas we greetin' with tension
And big bro was ready to park by the school 'til I left, just in case he was itchin'

What you doing with that strap, lil' boy?
Don't be moving like that, lil' boy
Stay up out the trap, you you don't know what you doing with them packs, lil' boy
It's some niggas really like that and they might make you adapt, lil' boy 
Listen, let me gather your attention real fast
Take in all the details, this gon' go real fast
This a tale about a kid, they call him Lil Ride
A lot of real niggas wanna kill him real bad
Petty little bastard
Known to get in big shit about some little cash
If winning was a race in life, he bound to come in last
He cut you down bad, do what he ask and don't get blasted 'cause he'll kill you real fast
Living life in the fast lane, whole dash
Hit a lot of licks, ain't never made no stash
The last come first, they say the first come last
Okay, let me make you feel him real fast
Grew up, they was robbing, they was killing real bad
Nigga mom's cracked out, whole apartment trapped out
Smoker, spent, all down and out, he ain't never felt no love
Sisters, brothers slammed him out, slapped him all around the house
Went outside frowning out, crying rivers, drowning out
Shoes bent, clothes big, classrooms clowned him out
Ignored him, they sound him out
Watched they moves, he played the cut, he stayed round about
All he knew was the few blocks whatever went down in the hood, he seen the shit
Never had his hand out 'cause he watched niggas leech for shit
He rather take, he don't mind dressing in black to creep for it
Watched them all and it wasn't long before he learned their weakness
First time robbing, they went left 'cause he was starvin'
Poor man ain't moved right, he threw a bullet in his noggin
Young and paranoid as fuck, feeling like he out of luck
Then threw the gun, he on the run now for five hundred bucks
This nigga barely got some cash thinkin' bout his past
Breathing real fast, through the night is he gon' last?
Clutchin' on it while he get high 'cause he know he in some shit
Want to disappear and only way he know is hit a lick
Only rich nigga around is his big cousin, trying to find a route
Cuz probably stashed a whole brick or two at Nana house
The slowest week he move a half a brick a day
Plan was get to Nana's quick enough to grab the work and get away
Nana's senile and she ain't seen him in a while
Noticed who he was 'cause he was reeking of the loud
Cuz don't even smoke, nigga, cuz never been broken
Cuzzo been playing with thousands but ain't never been no joke and niggas know that
If you got a bond with family, why would you blow that?
Ride snuck his ass straight to the basement where that dope was at
Gave Nana the longest hug and kisses, said I'm coming back
He ain't ever coming back
Cuz see his bricks snatched, had them bitches gift wrapped
Ain't no guess who did that, now he ready to kill Ride
Cuz parked right outside with his MAC
Tears, blood in his eyes
Lil' nigga got no ties, he ain't linked with no guys
Cuz sliding and he on that 'til he get some answers
Streets ain't got no love, nigga'll kill his own blood
Murder his ass in cold blood like that ain't his whole cousin
He don't give a fuck 'bout repercussions, he forever thuggin'
Mika sluggin', sluttin' thugs, but she fuckin' Ride now
Text her, said he finna' slide, thinking shit done died down
Ready for a homicide, that bitch up on his side now
And he'll kill his bitch before he let a nigga fire him down
Hood know she fuckin', Ride love her like a sucker, though
Put a selfie on her page, tryna blow his other hoes
Uh-oh, he ain't let her know
Should've let her know that he was wanted
Picture been up thirty minutes, cuz on it
See straight through her hallway, cuz going all the way
Said fuck his guilty conscience, he gon' do this broad-day
All his younger life been having hard days
Put the car in park, gon' put a spark in cuz heart so they could part ways
Thinking 'bout the days when they used to play, damn
Probably could've put him on some smart plays
Then he think of hustlin' how he got this shit the smart way
That's why he can't spare 'em, there he go, he about to walk his way
Ayy, ayy, cuz
Ayy, check it out, come here

Soon as that shit hit the fan, I gave him fifty bands
Saw my first homi' and I got excited
Can't rap 'bout too much, I might get indicted

You ain't felt a heartbreak like seein' your soldier slumped
And we been doin' shit like that, so how you holdin' up? 
Got my first rap check, we was pullin' up on niggas
Ain't even put 'em on the 'net 'cause we was rollin' up on niggas 
Streets thought they was a threat, but now I'm rollin' up on niggas 
And bro don't let you hold the strap 'cause you be foldin' up on niggas 
In the trenches, please deliver us from evil
I'm just tryna do right by my people
Illegal got us where we are now, so illegal do

Same time he met God, he met the reaper too
Gangster

RIP Juice WRLD My lil' brother
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again
Don't stand too close to me, I got PTSD
I was hearing bangs like Chief Keef
Always yelling names that's deceased
I go off my mind and my instinct 
Shootin' at the same time, we was in sync
On the same thing, tryna repeat 
We was in them whips, right back on the enemies
Stuffed on my last hit, I was in the middle seat
Fuck it, out the sun roof, brodie got a quick release
And we in a car real fast from police
Shots fired back, but his ass in the street
When I bought a forty, showed Brittany and Tiffany
Knowing if they call, it ain't shit they can't get from me
Lot of warfare, 17, had a 50 piece
Flexed on niggas so you know they wanna kill a G
 Posted in the hood with some Bentley keys
 Roc died, showed 'em what it really mean
I can't sleep 'cause it's a war zone in my head
My killers good, they know I'm hands-on with the bread
A million dollars ahead, I'm still angry and seeing red
How the fuck I'm 'posed to have fun? All my niggas dead
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I made it on my own, they said I'd be in jail or dead
I've seen my brothers fall over and over again 
Don't stand too close to me , I got PTSD
Used to run home from the train stop 
Running so fast, dodging raindrops
'Member got robbed at the park once 
'Member thinking that that bitch probably ain't cocked 
'Member I was with my mama one time
Seen a nigga through the glass, hit a nigga with a bankshot 
Point-blank, head hanging off his tank top 
Walked off, we drove off, went to GameStop 
Quiet ride there, picked up San Andreas 
Certain things we ain't talk about, mama, we just prayed off
We seen it all, don't get involved
Carry the weight of the world like a shawl 
Conceal and revealing to people in court
I still can feel it, I know that the world is evil, in case you thought a nigga forgot it
When my homie was bleeding out, another homie went in his pockets 
Please do not run up on me, not even as fans
Niggas get fanned down on the Dan Ryan
I'm flying, I'm scary as hell, I need me a Xan 
I turn the news on when I smell death in the air
I prove you wrong, I made it out of here
I don't belong, I see my past everywhere
Don't stand too close to me, eternal PTSD
I got a war zone on inside of my head
I got PTSDI'm just livin' man
Blowing smoke , stress easy
Just trying to get to the main goal, look
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am I stuntin'
Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'
Big G Herbo been signed but never had me a big deal
Grew up with both parents, never had me a big wheel
Instead I had my momma, that's what keep me sane
And can't forget about my poppa, he taught me the game
Always told me to stay focused and make me a lane
Be a leader, don't you worry about being lame
You know niggas only worried bout making names
Chasing after bitches, don't want money, they just chasing fame But I'm a kid, who the fuck wanna be a lame, pops
I'm just tryna play ball, I ain't in a gang pops
It ain't my fault that everybody round me know my name pops
And I seen a lot of shit so I don't act my age pops
I'm getting older, I'm just graduating eighth grade pops
Soon as I turned 13, trouble with the cops
Soon as I turned 14, started seeing Glocks
Fazo toting 30 shots in the middle of the block
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am
I stuntin' Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'
We used to post up by the light pole waiting for the opps to flip
Lil bro got that banger on him, run up and start flamin' on 'em
On the 8th we 100 deep , neighbors down the street keep complaining on us
We ain't going nowhere, we in this shit til it start raining on us When it rain, put a hoodie on, now we slidin'
Catch him while he blindin', blaah, perfect timing
I left that life behind me but best believe that I'm still grimy
East side of Chicago where you found me
And them other niggas wanna blam me but they don't really understand me
I'ma shoot it out like Kyrie, gotta make it back to my family
Told Cap when my tape drop, watch everybody try to sign me
Cap said " Nigga fuck labels we young niggas we grinding "
I know you see your boy shining, rollie face full of diamonds
Holy water dip charm piece block everything tryna harm me Cuban link and a kilo but that bitch still like a dime tho
And I don't know when my time close so I gotta stick to the iron tho
Same niggas doubted when was nothing
Have the nerve to ask me why am I stuntin'
Same bitches used to diss me in public
See me now and wonder why I don't fuck 'em
Too many fakers niggas hatin' for nothin'
Can't believe they wonder why I'm one hundred
I been patient, still chasin' the money
I just hope that I ain't waitin' for nothin'Living Life Like Call Of Duty We Was Waring

Play around with this shit if you wanna
And I won't never see no opponent
You must don't wanna see me on then
I'ma get up and get it, I want it
Can't make no excuses we grown men
Can't make no excuses, we grown men
They like, "Put a nigga on then"
You been goin' hard since 2010
Nigga, it was black 40's and hoodies then
Nigga, it was 40 Glocks and headshots
From my block to the opps it's red hot
Own name, don't bring up no leg shot
You writin' back, posted up like a mailbox
Got a bitch right now 'cause I'm shell shocked
Feelin' high-low, is hell hot?
Think you gon' touch me, live to tell 'bout it?
I'ma let you walk around in front of everybody?
Got shows all weekend, everybody's invited
I gotta slow down, D.A. got indicted
Damn near saw it comin', I am not a psychic
Herbo down bad, everybody like it
Herbo spendin' cash, yeah, everybody like it
Hand out, tell 'em no, don't nobody like him
What I get for a show, don't nobody like it
But everybody got a 24 like me
You ain't ready to get up and go like me
Ain't makin' that sacrifice, most likely
And in my after life, don't forget about me
Yeah, you better remember who looked out for you
Way 'fore I ran up that check, I was lonely
Said, "Whatever come with it, I want it"
If it comes with fuck niggas, I want it
Put a drum on that bitch so I want it
I want it
Ain't have a crumb, I was hungry
Mighta did somethin' that was wrong
But I gotta put everybody on
Everything come with it I want it
Guarantee you can get it, you want it
Told the niggas I'm with, "Gotta want it"
Play around with this shit if you wanna
And I won't never see no opponent
You must don't wanna see me on then
I'ma get up and get it, I want it
Can't make no excuses we grown menWhen I pull up, you know I show out
My pockets pokin, yeah I brought my dough out
And these bitches know it, they love the way I show out
My team that's who they know bout, you see us it's a smoke out
Yo hoe she know im cashin
Gucci, louie fashion, plus my diamonds dancin
I fuck her without askin
My team shoot like the Mavericks, them choppa shots so rapid
My squad full of assassins, so now the opps been lackin
Them people tryna question can't answer what you askin
Catch me rollin aston, hammer tucked in traffic
Thumbin thru that cabbage, sippin on that actis
Call me wings and faces bitch, my robins full of jacksons

Really?
You know I'm coming over, right?
Now, you got it hot—
Had a long day
Tell me all about it
Need anything? Just call, I got it
On your freaky days, I'm all about it
Nigga like me, every time I leave home I got it, but I still stand tall without it
Don't lie to me 'cause you can't get around that
Won't mention bro but I know all about that
Hop in the car, you can't know where my house at
Don't need a bed, we can fuck where the couch at
Lambo, keys, where my Balenci pouch at
Full of potential just ain't got a scout yet
On my way, baby, just let me know where the route at
Ever met a nigga like me? I doubt that
You from the West or the Southside?
Skin tone have a nigga staring with his mouth wide
Either way I'ma hit the line when I'm outside
Family, dollar signs, I'm still 'bout mine
When you looking at me with the side eye
Like you tryna ride, be my valentine
I'm still a street nigga and you know it
Really wanna be with you, just don't show it
Missing your smell when I go on tour
Gotta go work, but I do want some more
I told you, it's no limit to my loving
Girl, you need a soldier
Talk aggressive, but that's just because I need to mold you
I ain't staying out all night, tonight I need to hold you
Let me hit it like a G supposed to
Baby, you need a rider
Someone to hold you down, someone to stand beside you
Don't hesitate to call, whatever you need I got you
Let me be your stress relief
Let me fuck you fast asleep
I'ma make you feel so complete
Last time you cheated
She ain't fulfilling them needs
She don't make you feel complete
Put you at ease, she ain't gon' freak you like me
Make you get down on one knee
Pretty petite, I'll turn you into a freak
I'll give you just what you need
Boy, what you doing?
You know she don't know what to do with a nigga that come with the streets
I can't stand when I'm mad at you, I just wanna be nice to you
You're the only nigga who, who can handle my attitude
Boy just call when you're outside, you know I'm down to ride
Don't act like you don't know you need some Ann up in your life
I told you, it's no limit to my loving
Girl, you need a soldier
Talk aggressive, but that's just because I need to mold you
I ain't staying out all night, tonight I need to hold you
Let me hit it like a G supposed to
Baby, you need a rider 
Someone to hold you down, someone to stand beside you 
Don't hesitate to call, whatever you need I got you 
Let me be your stress relief
Let me fuck you fast asleep 
I'ma make you feel so complete, yeah

Did I forget to mention? 
Cars, clothes , money, ho’s, Herbo love em’ all 
Jumping through the Gucci store, Herbo love to ball 
Bitches want a autograph when I hit the mall 
Sorry shorty, but I don’t sign  that shit at all 
But you can take my land line if you dropping draws 
My dogs shoving dick  and balls all through her walls 
And I don’t want no type of parts, I brought her for squad 
I’ll have my bitches bring a broad, let’s have a ménage
Just left the booth, I’m working hard
Bitch where my massage?
I’m tryna stunt some of the R’s parked in the garage 
I ride with thirties in the car, can’t catch me off guard 
Run up on me, imma spark
Take that to the heart

If it ain’t Gucci, than it’s Louis 
Im in Louis, so I’m Gucci 
So many .30 clips, I’ll hit your block and make a movie 
The feds wanna do me, plus the opps, wanna shoot me
But they can’t , sticking to the G-code like Juvie 
It’s Hollow bitch remember me?
8 chains, Mr. T
Let the bitch hit the drank, but can’t touch my Swisher Sweet
They say that boy daily, drive by in the Chevy
D-Eagles bang heavy , like Meth Man on Belly 
Call Pablo for them large grams 
We filling up the Dodge Rams 
Chicago, where they Kill, carjack, and do fraud scams  
Wake up, ate something, early and that late money
My bitch, say I need to take a break , I just make money

Through the streets of the city, my niggas waillin, they toting Glocks 
Thotties getting slutty, or wifey be posted on the block
Bought a crib, just to use the kitchen stove and whip the pot 
Grip the Glock, talking stupid, hollow tips will chip his top 
Foreigns pulling out the lot, I’m posted steel on the 8 block 
Lil’ Marley, and a cut five, and a blunt wait till the tape drop
Ride off with the rakes dropped, Im getting top if her faced popped
Im on the 9, Im on the grind, give a damn about if the jakes hot 
Money, cars, and poles 
.30’s with hollows 
.40 Calicos, knock them niggas out they clothes
Money, cars, and poles

Did I forget to mention? I couldn't even sleep at night
Fightin’ them demons, drug my chin up
Nigga I'ma be a'ight
Remember them nights I ain’t even want to voice my opinion
And I know I'm right
Remember them nights we was riding with pipes
Tryna not get caught at the light
Ready? We want it on sight
Now them nights, I had all over
You want to show us the price
Lot of shit changed, since I got older
But you niggas been ho's all my life
I took control for my bitch in the rover
I told her it's nothing, that's light
Clutchin' it close like that bitch, in a holster
I don't give a fuck 'bout your life
I lost a whole lot of money in life
I don’t give a fuck ’bout this ice
I lost a whole lot of lovers in life
I don't give a fuck ’bout his fife
Can't believe how I'm cashing out
Everyone busy when I was broke
Now I'm all they ask about
Anticipated when I got that cake, like I was gonna pass it out
Still fucking racks up
New wheel smacked up
All tryna gas it out
See us all fucked up
Ashing out
Still on my grizzy
Working my rizzy
Smoke till I’m dizzy
Still got the glizzy
Still back and forth from LA, making history
Still got to come back, had 2 cribs in the city
Could've got a .50
Still holding grudges for Capo
You clipped and get killed in the pity
Smoked in a minute
Who show up in it
You probably hoping you kill me
Hope you know that you goin with me, ayy ayy
But I'm with some animals
Definitely responsible, you come near me
Still ain't no fear in meLil Herbie i'm NoLimit
Hit the strip with my doors tinted
On 28s I'm EBK, fuck the Mobb, fuck the Lake
I see Juvie slam the rakes, I see shoota blam the 8
That's word to god no county floor, my word is bond
That's word to shawn I grind for mine
I ride for mine, don't ride for yours
I'm in this bitch, NoLimit shit, I been the shit
Don' leave the shit, don't need a bitch
Just tell her lies and feed her dick
NoLim hoe, pull up in a benz hoe or a lambo
With the black rims and the tan doors
Try to rob me I know rambo
When the can blow, turn a man ghost, make his ass float
That's some real shit, get your steel quick, you don't feel me nigga feel this
Them banana clips they'll peel shit
If he didn't know put his info on the window
Have Project get his kinfolk, make his brains fly
This for heroin, I'm a real nigga you a tampon, throw the ls up, throw your sets up
Shoutout big Buckz yeah he next up
Let the .40 go blow his chest up
Closed casket, leave him messed up
I aim, bang, from the neck up you see red stuff that ain't ketchup
Better catch up, cause I'm burning y'all I'm way too hot
I'm going in I ain't gone stop
Tell yo bitch to give me top
My flow is cold the 8 is not
Them bags look like tater tots
NoLimit the gang, put that thang to his brain
.45 cocked back keep them lames in they lane
Hit a stain for his chain
Hit the club in a benz, then leave the lot in a range
I'm on top of the game, I do not fuck with lames
You get popped for the guap, leave yo top re-arranged
My nigga Greg laid back but with that MAC he'll change
Leave a nigga holey'd up
Smoking on that OG stuff
Rolling stogeys in a Dutch
When it get close we throw the duff'
Yeah I'm all about that cash cream, sell a nigga bad dreams
Lotta shit be on my mind going broke the last thing
I go broke you get poked, you don't go you get smoked
.44 to the throat, m.o.b fuck a hoe, let her know
In the door, Crazy James got semis with him
60 shots, 50 hit him
This ain't rap we be drilling
In them traps making killings
Competition I don't feel 'em
Sending threats, I don't fear 'em
I'm tired of talking Bibby get em

Verse 1 
Zeekio I'm bout a bag on them broke days I reminisce

Hundred bands and hundred clips just understand Im getting it
Posted up in the same trap in the gangway where we hang at
Put the 45 to the boy shirt like MJ when he came back
Damn thats a murder scene for yo man
All you heard was click clack blam

Bitch Im focused on my money til my whole squad see bands
And I owe god my life cuz he got me out that jam l
Young hot head talk beef let it blow
But I had to learn that you reap what you soe
So police on patrol and the D's and my door
Hideout in the trap with the fiends on the floor
My route to the stacks anything for the dough
Im out with the gat in the heat in the cold
Gotta get the money anything for some mo'
Me and Lil Herb pop so flee to ya hoe
That bitch on me like keys in a door
Get money 4 ways that seasonal flow

And bitches know me I'm Ze to the Ko
Hook/Chorus

Verse 2 
Lil Herb just a young nigga
Gotta get money used to gang bang

Ever since they saw me in the gangway
But im the sameway smokin' swishers
And I'm smokin' bitches on the 8 block
Servin fiends til my tape drop
Ride thru' and catch a face shot
Let the K pop
Everwhere we go them K's pop

Spazzing out me and Zeekio
Later on catch me posted
Run up on me you get toasted
Getting to the money focused
Seven-hundred Louie Loafers
And I still came from the bottom of the line
Hated being broke so I got up on the grind
Didn't think about school too much money on my mind
And fuck a bitch I got money on the line
When I get rich I'm throwing hundreds on the nine
Yeah Im throwing hundreds on the nine
Ima make it rain when it's sunny on the nine
Ran up on Herb put some in his spine

INSTAGRAM@NOLIMITHERBO
INSTAGRAM@LILZEKOFirst off, what's up with all these crooked ass police
If they workin' hard then why the fuck they don't control the streets
Wanna see my brother strong, so I don't condone the beef
Play it safe, I got my chrome, rather you be gone than me
And my kids better than me, hope I live long to see
But feel like my past & the Devil holdin' onto me
What's up with the DA's and the judges, they don't owe no blood
Blacks folks who deserved a chance, but they ain't show no love
People sayin' they gon' change, but thеy ain't show no love
Ruined lives was innocеnt, but they ain't hold no grudge
Hard to face it, wonder why it's hard to make it
You grew up with privileges, and all this shit we had to take it
You ain't racist, when we on a elevator why you shaking
You ain't racist, see me in yo' neighborhood then why you braking
You ain't racist, when I make more money than you why you hate it
Said I was gonna get a warning officer then why you take me
I'm at war with all my brothers, but it's you that taught us hatred
I ain't racist, I got different colored diamonds in my bracelet
Acatavis mixed with some savages a  combination
Rich forever, 'fore I go broke you see yey at nomination
One announcement to  we need forward domination
All our women need safety, gotta make way for them babies
Hustle smart, don't make sacrifices and risks, just have some patience
That's the only way we gon' gain our respect back in the nation
These our demands, this how we gon' make demands
These our demands, ain't no asking, we demanding
These our demands, thank you in advance
Time to make demands, needa change of plans
Make the hood great again
Let the playgrounds be okay, where they can play again
Shit, the neighborhoods ain't safe enough to raise 'em in
Niggas ain't got aim, they killing 'em & grazing kids
All his homies bitch-made, they out there praising him
Hopefully one day my raps will end up saving 'em
If we don't stay accountable this shit won't ever end
Can't go to school cause our future is inevident
Dropped out, no college, street knowledge what I majored in
Can't be a boy where I'm from, it's quick to make a man
Bloodshed for generations, never make amends
And we hate to lose, but nobody never wins, this a life of failure
These our demands, time to clean the jails up
If you ain't tryna ride then tell me why you going to jail for
Change the cycle, why you wanna write your life through mail for
If the hood ain't get you shit but this, then what you near for
Who you really care for, gotta daughter, then her
These my demands, invest in stacking bread up
These our demands, we need assistance in the gutter
These our demands, bitch be more sensitive to the struggle
Let's stop always tryna blame the man
We gon' stand up to this shit and start to make demands
And we buying back the block cause now we making M's
So get off your ass and go make a change
Cause they just keep laughing at us complain while we do the same again
How you expect your life to change if you can't change within
And it ain't perfect, but I never may complain again
Cause I accept what's in my life if it can't change it's 
But I'mma always have respect and that's cause I demand it
These our demands, this how we gon' make demands
These our demands, ain't no asking, we demanding
These our demands, thank you in advance
Time to make demands, needa change of plans
Make the hood great againG Herbo; Intro- Yo wassup man it's G Herbo reporting live Hot 97 with my boy Funk Flex it's going down we in SWERVOSZN, let's get it
G Herbo; Freestyle Part 1-
Used to wake up like I had school in the morning been dropped out
40 Smith & Wesson plus the stick pop out
Middle of the block probably waiting on Roc til his shift clock out
Chico on the chase his Glock out
Vito on the gate middle of 8
Blizz probably on the 5 gone off drank
Fazo on the way you can get knocked out
Spit real shit cause they feel me
Big dog shit can't lil' me
Since 15 niggas tryna kill me
Mom's lived on the opps block like literally
Every second count going home I couldn't get locked out
Had to go home with my shit cocked out
If you want something gotta change it yourself so I moved mom and went got a wrist watch ouch
I got choppers and 50's in my couch
I got that 30 everyday I pop out
I'm seeing something you know it's a bow
I see the police I don't go that route
'Member police was chasing me down
People profile me racially now
Walk in the airport they hating me now
Right after land put my face in the loud
I hit them states and see all these faces I appreciate every face in the crowd
I been through situations and never seen none of it taking me down
Never seen none of it bringing me under
It ain't do nothing but beast my hunger
Let off a .40 it sound like thunder
Free all my brothers
And I used to get wild with my niggas
Let off rounds with my niggas
Went to trial with my niggas
And I'm in the kitchen not with the dishes
Neck on water not with the fishes
90 percent of these niggas bitches
Them and they homies need interventions, uh
I made it out the streets because I listen, uh
90 on my pendents them bitches glisten, uh
Can't go with you it's risky, uh
But if it's real then come get me and I'll assist you, uh
G Herbo; Freestyle Part 2
I done been through so much shit that I barely get excited
Sugercoat my lifestyle cause I'm scared to get indicted
Roll a spiff light it
Thinking 'bout my life and pray to god my son never gotta get as high as I did
Gotta be a role model now to the shorties cause I used to be like I don't give a fuck them ain't my kids
Now I'm doing better in life, it's whatever
I might buy a 20,000 dollar sweater tonight
I put bagets on my 'lil one
He don't gotta bang he can live off pops name I had respect since a 'lil one
Hit em' with a left then a right bet he feel one
More then 2 niggas disrespect me I might kill one
Fewer rappers going hard and im still one
Thought I lost pussy gave in and I still won
Eleven I was totin' on pellets, bebes, paintballs, 14 I said I need a real gunStomach was empty, now I'm worth a milli'
All my life was already gritty, now a nigga filthy
Either way, went good or bad, I was all in
Everyday you hit me 40 times, all spends
Everybody like "G Herbo, say some catchy shit"
When I pop out, know we on that ratchet shit
Ten thousand just to fuck you on this mattress
She from the hood, but she look like an actress
My lil baby balling, like Bryce Maximus
The world couldn't even see his face, like Mike Jackson's kids
And his birthday, Fazo died a day after his
I used to live with animals, like Mike Jackson's shit
But it wasn't Neverland, we was never playing
Momma saw me everyday but I was never staying, in
Picks for 38 and we was weighing in
Wake up, wasn't no telling how the day would end
Made two thousand profit, I got eight to spend
Twenty large on me, gotta take it in
And ain't no one to charge, homie, you amongst men
Ain't no working here if you ain't punched in
Moved out Momma house, need somewhere to stay again
Shoot out right in front of that bitch, need somewhere to lay again
I ain't care I'd shoot all in front of that bitch, my Granny'll probably see it
Gave my Momma the Glock juiced up told her "Leave it right here" cause I'll probably need it
He ran up, I blanked out, I probably beat it
I ain't never get my Miranda's readed
I don't fuck with him, I booked in his city and I ain't pull up when I landed neither
And I landed with heaters, I ain't have nobody meet us
Them bitches fly right out the chamber, hawkin' down like Cheetahs
I was destined to be a gangsta since I was a fetus
I run my check up, earn stripes, so I'm like Nike, Adidas
They don't like to see this, they gon try and beat us
They know they can't fuck with us, they gon try and cheat us
And your BM on my penis, I'm so out of here, like Venus
Still gon hit something, like Serena
High School, used to like Sabrina
But now my bitch bad, like Madina
Got something next to it, I might like to meet her
I been destined for greatness all my life
And I want it, get it done, I'm like Bruce Almighty
I don't play for fun, I'll shoot somebody
Send some hot shit all through your bodyEverything

        Kill a street nigga get a dime
Kill a rap nigga get a dub
I heard you Kodak
Uh, they be like herb you got PTSD?
Or why? How?
Post traumatic stress disorder nigga
Told him you gone live
But he ain't live my nigga died
Thinking bout it now the last time I really cried
Shut em tight now I see red when I open my eyes 
That's the only time I told my nigga a lie Remember he had that bitch on fire and it want even hot
I'm surprised we won that gun fight it want even a Glock
I was right there in his face and I ain't even get shot
Watch my comments cause the fans gone say I got him got 
16 I'm young as hell we going on the opps
Best watch lil bro cause he don't talk too much that nigga plottin
Please don't let maneski influence him that nigga rottin
We put in work for Kobe and roc so they don't feel forgotten
6am I had pen jotting Cmoney call me like pop out we on it again andale
I know the opps like damn thats them again they coming again it's ugly
Mik had a stu booked for me but I'm on the block with my killas cause that's where I wanna be
Went on my first hit but i ain't make it a body cause I seen a lady in front of me
I had a dream that I saw a nigga kill roc with a gun in my hand he was under me
I was naive chilling thinking i ain't have to go get it thought I could just wait till it come to me
I went and got it now I got a lot nigga everybody know I got dough go wherever I wanna be
Thousand mile races through my head now I can't sleep
Let me just relax the devil playing with me
Angel's talking I just can't hear what they saying to me
Suffering from anxiety I'm fighting insanity
In them streets I saw them fiends more than my family
I been seeing so much blood I need a xan to sleep
I can't even get no sleep unless you laying with me
And I got faith I'm gone get home I know you praying for me
I don't wanna lean no more now I can't even sleep
Sweating out for weeks if I ain't smoke weed I can't eat
I was drinking syrup before I heard of sound cloud
When lil black was in his prime you niggas wasn't around
Fore the Instagram had my city going down
Back if you ain't know a junky you wasn't a four a round
I was tryna ease my mind stop it from going round
I seen buddy laid down holes in his crown
All you niggas wanna be kings but doing peasant shit
How the fuck he want comission he ain't even selling shit
Niggas still out in these streets like they ain't telling shit
Ain't a hustler he can't eat unless he nailing shit
If you want smoke I love pressure I'm inhaling it
Cracking whateva I got my pipe I'll do life nigga try us it's whateva
I ride dolo cause I found out niggas wasn't solid I thought you was riding forever?
90 percent of these niggas is bitches they find they self snitching trying to lie to detectors 
Thousand mile races through my head now I can't sleep
Let me just relax the devil playing with me
Angel's talking I just can't hear what they saying to me
Suffering from anxiety I'm fighting insanity
In them streets I saw them fiends more than my family
I been seeing so much blood I need a xan to sleep
I can't even get no sleep unless you laying with me
And I got faith I'm gone get home I know you praying for meG Herbo; Freestyle-
I been in the streets since 14
My life like a movie it's a story
Everyday of it I tote a .40
You was in the house like Corey
New-age gangstas ain't tough they only bore me
You was set up I had it rough as a shorty
Now that bread tucked cause I was fucked as a shorty
And bullets missed enough I had luck as a shorty
But anyway I just keep my eye out for the snakes
Never see em' coming shit they worser than the jakes
Plot behind my back and then smile in my face
Know you wanna put yo .40 cal in my face
But they hesitate cause they seem mine on my waist
Still keep a killa on my side just in case
And he don't joke or smile he around just in case
He here to put a nigga in the ground when I say
And a lotta niggas gay they just out here in the way
Tell me how you in the game and you can't even make a play
I was falling back they was sucking dick just to stay
Tell me how you living you ain't got nowhere to stay
Mom's need the rent she getting evicted any day
And that drank still addictive you gone sip it anyway
Yeah that's 9k a month if you gone drink a six a day
You be hustlin' so you say, you ain't got shit put away
You ain't never had a shoebox you ain't got shit but a safe
I got bond money in case so it's a whole brick in the safe
I got 2 glizzies, a XD and like 4 clips in the safe
Rolling posto when I wake I turned a whole zip to a 8th
Whipping beamers 18 I turned a M6 to a wraith
And I'm independent I just bought a pendent like the other day
I been chillin' could've spent that 80k another way
But fuck it we gone spin just to get money another day
Run it up, endalay
Niggas listening on the low call that under play
I just took 800 went and bought another K so you pussy niggas bet not even come this way
Don't get no rhythm or no love this way shit all my heart is hate
But don't got hatred for no nigga that's a buster traitI be fresh as fuck
When I hit the scene, everybody know me
40 tucked in my skinny jeans, I'm so fuckin' lowkey
All hundreds, finna go get some cream, it's another show week
It's a show week
Out the seven days, I gotta pick up four of these
Momma told me
"Baby, get you some sleep, gotta turn down move slow please"
I go home, rock my son to sleep, gotta stay awake, get more of these
Nigga you mad cause you ain't gettin' no cheese
Whole hood charge you whole fees
Sometimes it's no one to watch over me
Too broke, can't get close to me
Seen the opps, said hello to me
Never respect when approachin' me
And don't act like you don't know it's me
Know that bitch somewhere close to me
And I ain't got no reason to be on that
You don't wanna avenge your homie
Even though I really be on that
Beat a nigga up if he want that
You can't even buy a whole lunch, jack
Better get a clock and punch that
Used to run my hood like a rugrat
We went to war with one gat
Ain't lyin', we a go, they come back
All on defense, we a bust back
So they want me whacked
100 shots out the back of the 'Lac
I spit that shit that you get high to, and make you wanna clap after that
Then drop some shit that make you contemplate on it after the fact
Rap about the shit you livin, nigga what happened to that?
I don't give a fuck bout the rap game no more
Nigga, I'm after the check
I ain't with the rap beef, nigga say my name once, I'm after his neck
Reach for 150, I'ma let 50 them bitches come out of this TEC
That's like 120 without the charms, and I just added baguettes
Run up that check 
Ain't break a sweat
Play with me, that's Russian Roulette
, how's that?
Already know where he at
Maneski gon do him out back
And you and your niggas is rats
Keep a blunt to my lips like Pat
And I used to be screwed like Pat
Had a little taste from that act'
Late nights we'd ride in the 'Raq
Mofucka right on my lap
I shared the pint with Cap
Drop a little deuce in my Fanta
I need a four of that back
He like "chill, you scored, that's mine"
You wasn't in the hood
You ain't have them east side stories, young boy that's mine
Herb you ain't droppin' on time
Nigga I changed my mind
Don't know if I'ma drop more shit 'fore I drop new shit
Gotta make up my mind
All on the pressure on Herbo, when you droppin' Swervo?
Nigga gotta take my time
All this fame, attention, got you hypnotized
You done did some shit, now you talkin' emphasized
I just get that money, it keep me energized
And by any means you violate, get penalized 
Best look me in the eyes 
Want beef, get tenderized 
I see the bitch in your eyes
All that talkin' get minimized 
Gotta watch the feds, they say we runnin' an enterprise 
Niggas go rat and go back with they set, you already been advised 
I ain't got nothin' to say
Ain't thinkin' bout none of you niggas, it's dinner time 
I been saving that shit like it's the winter time

First niggas yellin out "Gang gang!"
Go on a hit, I was with Crazy James
He like, "Don't panic", the main thang

But you can die if you say my name in vain
It's Lil' Herbo you know what it is with me

My word is bond, That's word to Shawn
I grind for mine I ride for mine
Don't ride for yours I'm in this bitch
No Limit shit, I been the shit
Don’t leave the shit, don't need a bitch
Just tell her lies and feed her dick
No Limit hoe, pull up in a benz or a lambo
With the black rims and the tan doors
Try to rob me I know Rambo
When the can blow, turn a man ghost
Make his ass float That's some real shit
Get your steel quick, you don't feel me
Nigga feel this, Them banana clips
They'll peel shit If he didn't know
Put his info on the window
Have Project get his kinfolk
Make his brains fly he a Scantron
This for Heron, I'm a real nigga
You a tampon , Throw the L’s up
Throw your sets up
Shoutout big Buckz yeah he next up
Let the .40 go Blow his chest up Closed casket
Leave him messed up
I aim, bang, from the neck up
You see red stuff that ain't ketchup
Better catch up, cause I'm burning y'all I'm way too hot
I'm going in I ain't gone stop
Tell yo bitch to give me top
My flow is cold the 8 is not
Them bags look like tater tots
No Limit the gang
Put that thang to his brain
.45 cocked back keep them lames in they lane
Hit a stain for his chain
Hit the club in a benz, then leave the lot in a Range
I'm on top of the game, I do not fuck with lames
You get popped for the guap, leave yo top re-arranged
My nigga Greg laid back but with that MAC he'll change
Leave a nigga holed up
Smoking on that OG stuff
Rolling stogies in a Dutch
When it get close we throw the duff'
Yeah I'm all about that cash cream
Sell a nigga bad dreams
A Lotta shit be on my mind
Going broke the last thing
I go broke, you get poked
You don't go, you get smoked
.44 to the throat, M.O.B fuck a hoe
Let her know, In the door
Crazy James got semis with him
60 shots, 50 hit him
This ain't rap we be drilling
In them traps making killings
Competition I don't feel 'em
Sending threats, I don't fear 'em
I'm tired of talking Bibby get em
Now these niggas ain’t eating man y’all need to get y’all weight up
I swear i’m so far ahead they tellin me to wait up
I be tryna make bucks tryna get my cake up
Married to the cash me and her will never break up
Only spit that real shit allergic to the fake stuff
Catch me on the 9 get outta line get ya face done
Sleeping on the kid tell Ken turn the bass up
On my Freddy Krueger shit these niggas better wake up
Racks in these streets attacking these beats
And my broski, Broski tell me “Dont lack in these streets”
Niggas act tough and get whacked in these streets
My boy Herb go crazy man relax in these streets
This ain’t a game boy it’s more than that
At your door with the choppa like you ordered that
I keep the heat like them Florida Cats
My niggas throw bullets like a quarterback
And these boys ain't ready clips long as machetes
2012 Kelly same color as the chevy
28 inches call that shit February
Man these niggas act like bitches call they ass Tyler Perry
Keep the Hammer Like Madea, See me Countin Money
Don’t get no idea cause u can get killed
All my niggas real and your bitch probably will
Got ya girl off the pill now she busting like my steelUh, Uh Run it up ya you gotta run it all the way up
You know what you feel in the air all the way up all the way up
If you feel it that shit hit your chest when it's deep
That's what I'm tryna do run it all the way up
Uh uh
We was hustling before y'all we was outside doing it all
Young war dogs and we knew we couldn't afford it all
So we depended on each other that's enough to keep extorting y'all
From the back of Fords to them Porsche's we built us a fortress
Three on three smoking weed dividing up them portions
We did the impossible as sure as I'm recording this
Still off the 8 and I ain't wait think I'm ignoring shit
We went on them missions and we watched you aborting them
Used to sit back and get high while they reporting shit
If I pop out at 8 they up at 6 we on some morning shit
Go to sleep to tweaking wake up geeked you think we snorting shit
Lately I been under pressure fuck it I been pouring it
Straight from off that corner my niggas went to coroners
Get up working everyday so I can't even mourn them
Leave the stu' at 4 back up at 6 in the morning
Man I ain't gon' never snore again
Been to church before but probably never go again
I believe the higher power ya I'm all in
But more so in life morals I'm a grown man
And you ain't never gon' win you scared to lose again
I told y'all my true story I just use the pen
My niggas telling real life stories through the pen
Frank told me rap about it I'm like dude you playing
But he wasn't even playing crazy part he do it again
So I ain't gon' even say it and if I do for gang use
So I ain't gon' even play it you gon' probably broadcast it
What they put in your head?
Talk bout' what you see but not apart of action you a podcaster
Why you judge him cause he got shit you never had?
Money 'posed to change you, you prolly think it's bad
If you let that shit go it probably bring it back
Don't hesitate embrace the power you ain't think you had
Use to pop out in my bag come on make me mad
With a chip on my shoulder come on make me blast
He too caught up in his way he ain't bout to last
You ain't even got a future thinking bout the past
And I call my noodles with some pharmaceuticals
All through the day pop least like two that's why you check my pupil
They was tryna blitz a nigga spin move I juked you
I'm just with some quicker niggas but I'm quick to shoot you
And my niggas feel me so they hit the whip and click the Bluetooth
And we don't like the search and frisk so this bitch in neutral
Could reverse, go right around him, or shit we through you
I could piss 100 thousand you ain't shit we through with you
We through with you
You ain't shit we through with you
We through with you
You ain't rich we through with you
You a bitch we through with you
We through with you
We through with you

        I used to sip that lean
I ain't wanna sleep no more, so I chased it with a bean
Came from havin' highspeed chases with my team
Started with this rap shit, now I'm doin' my thing
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Security ain't gon pat you at all, just walk in with me
And security ain't gon protect you at all, don't walk into me
What set you from, nigga? Who you talkin' to, me?
 with the concrete, have em white chalkin' your teeth
Go and turn up if you gon turn up, then we gon play your speed
You know we'll shoot this bitch up, like some MVPs
They don't even know where to run cause they hearin' them MPGs
When I used to sip lean it was fun, what the fuck is some MGP?
Big foenem was gettin' the fours from Black, it was tec and act
Lemme take it back, to that seal was already cracked, had to take it back
You niggas ain't really ain't sick cause I'm pullin' the stack
You niggas ain't tippin' the strippers, and oh, and your niggas ain't payin' it back
You niggas out here payin' tax
See me, I just be playin' with racks
My fans love me, I stay rappin' facts
They play in the streets in the 'Raq, where they at?
And I got that in the back on my lap
He ain't gang-gang, he ain't know Cap, slime
Throwin' up B's like Bloods and L's
L's or shells, two Glocks that's my tide
You grew up a pussy cause your habitat
And you met somebody that got you a strap
I guess you got tough after that
Yeah you ain't give no fuck after that
But really you wasn't even ready after that
Shit really started to go up after that
They still gon try you because you a fuck nigga
They make you up, and you gon have to bust after that
That's if you even brave enough, it's bad now
Niggas on your ass now
It's on sight, gotta clash now
Playin' games with your life, ain't no pass now 
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Came from havin' highspeed chases with my team
Started with this rap shit, now I'm doin' my thing
You ain't gettin' no money, boy, why you talkin' to me?
Ain't even ready to shoot some, can't be walkin' with me
Security ain't gon pat you at all, just walk in with me
And security ain't gon protect you at all, don't walk into meFuck you bitch im everybody killer

Then earn it back from the fiends
Serve 'em white or some green

Hop on your track for free? That's whack
For that goofy shit you deserve a smack
Italian mob shit, I'm about that
If you doubt me man go ahead
I'll have my hittas come through
Have your body fall like beef stew
Back to the crib I pop a corkscrew
Watch your pussy ass on the news
