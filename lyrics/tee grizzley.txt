You ever been inside a federal court room?
Nigga you ever went to trial and fought for your life?
Bein' broke did somethin' to my spirit
Asked niggas to plug me, they act like they couldn't hear me
Look at me now, drivin' German engineering
You don't want your baby mama fucked, keep the ho from near me
Kilroy, 'member when I used to use your L's
To hit the road, hit the O and make them big boy sales?

My nigga Fenkell, J Money, Brightmo Lo, Project Joe
Will tell you every day before school I sold a half bow

'Cause I do it better, plus I'm doin' better than niggas
I'm at home when I'm down there in Lexington nigga
'Bout the king, they gon' drop you and who next to you nigga
Unc said Lil T, "Get ahead of them niggas!"
When you take off, don't look back and try to rescue them niggas

Don't let them get the best of you, just get the revenue nigga
So let me know what you can handle, okay, come grab it
Here go some extras, so if I'm busy you can manage
Fiends had me Blade dancin', eating sixty dollar salads
Get it there and back, tell the feds I need a challenge

I told them crackers holler at me when they sober
On parole, I'm a felon, you think I ain't got that blower?
Yeah you right, bro take his head off his fuckin' shoulders

Whoever feelin' hot, that AR got a heat sensor
Cuz said don't entertain them hungry niggas
I wish I would pay attention to these homeless niggas
Don't call my phone, I don't want to do no song with niggas
And tell yo bitch to tighten up before I bone her, nigga

Through these white buffs I can see the ho in niggas
Free my nigga Parico, that boy be hoein' niggas
Shoot the smile off your face, I don't joke with niggas
Boy, I can't trust you with that strap if you ain't got no bodies
Boy, I can't take you on no lick if you ain't robbed nobody
You ain't no shooter, you can't do that shit without no molly
I came home and had the hoes wetter than Kalahari
Thirty months ago niggas ain't think that I was comin' home
Shout out to them niggas' freaks that I been cummin' on
Get 'em to the crib, bust 'em down, now bitch run along
This SK'll get to shakin' like there's somethin' wrong
Thirty bands two times, watch this money clone
The feds say my name hot like when the oven on
Bitch, I came home to my lil' brother gone
Niggas say they lookin' for me, pull up in the Skuddy zone
Who said I'm a snitch? You just heard a lie from him
Better check the black and white
That paperwork will vouch for him
Zero toleration for that nigga, take his life from him
He don't want that pistol play? Okay I'll Tyson him
I ain't hear from bitches when I had them blues on
So soon as I'm done fuckin', put your shoes on
I'm on parole in two states, I can't move wrong
The feds tryin' to build a case, I can't move wrong

Just fucked a ho out in France, paint her face like Picasso
I iced out my vatos, I'm really up 
Big ass Bimmer, big Benz, and my Bentley next 
Don't play around on my phone, ho, give me sex
Watch on my wrist out of date, but it's Rolex
Grizzley up next, I'm up now, strap your bullet vest
Five-hundred fifties, six-hundred hundreds
Seven-hundreds twenties, let's get straight to it
Eight-hundred tens, what's that, eight bands?
Hit the store and get some rubber bands, let's get straight to it
Everybody come together, everybody got the plan
He came with you, so if he steal, it fall on you, we on your ass
Have your mans call his mans, make sure they ain't movin' fast
Soon as they touch Atlanta, get with Boat, secure the bag, nigga
Uh, oh, a bag secured, that's on my mama, bro
Asian lil' ho, she ride that dick, Yokohama flow
Made that shit double, got an Uzi, I don't scuffle
Not a banger but that banger in my car like an airbag
Niggas only aimin' in the sky, call those Air Mags 
All up in Neiman's, coppin' shit like fuck a price tag
I'm ballin', ain't near a rap nigga in the game that I'm callin' 
If I need help, I'll dial it by my se-kelf
You swear your bitch faithful, she sent her location
I hit her at the trap in Decatur, she basic 
Chop with the laser, get decapitated 
Can't smoke, I'm on papers, hold on, this my Jamaican 
Niggas want me dead, so I'm steady prayin'
Ain't no disrespect without retaliation
Fuck a hotel, I hit her in the basement
Text her later like, "I'm done with you, I got a situation, baby"
Hmm, well shit, bro, let me get her then 
I'ma dog her out then switcheroo into the lion's den 
Nigga talkin' down, my bro got more heat than a fryin' pan 
Gucci 'round my hair, wrapped tight like I'm Taliban
Like I'm Taliban, how we drop shit 
Lot of dreadheads, lot of chopsticks 
Touch my nigga Yachty, get your top ripped 
Don't ask the price if you know you ain't tryna cop shit
You the type to look around but never cop shit, ayy
I'm the type to buy the store, make them restock it, ayy
Beam on everythin' I own, I will not miss 
Grizzley by my side like a pilot ridin' cockpit 
Yachty, I might stop rappin' for this one reason 
If the Feds hear this shit I'm doin' a hundred seasons
In the hood, shootin' craps in my Yeezys
Put angels on you niggas who be playin' like y'all demons

Middle finger to them niggas hatin' and fakin'
They plottin' on my death, I give their mothers deep penetration

Every real nigga livin' will respect this collaboration 
We the bust down brothers, check the Rollies out
Say you winnin' one more time, I'm pullin' trophies out
Niggas know we out, no Shaqs, all Kobes out
In other words, I'm with all shooters that'll blow you down 
From the D to the A, put respect on it 
If that's your ho, why my dick got her mouth on it? 
I'm from the south, I got diamonds in my teeth
I got fur on my fleece, my new ring could pay your lease
Chain on my dresser next to my indictment
When they said not guilty I was so excited

The country wait four years, we take presidents everyday, nigga
Take me to the horse, not the club, bitch the Porsche
Ho done took off with my dick, I should be takin' her to court

Only fear the Lord anyone else can see the morgue
Give me thirty seconds with her, I can get this bitch naked
One bullet out that K will leave the toughest nigga headless
Dawg, don't need one drug to act reckless
While he sober he'll up and put one in a nigga melon

I got a big MAC, that bitch'll shred niggas
Sayin my name better stop while your ahead
'Fore they look for your body and find nothing but your head, nigga
I don't wanna fuck if I can't get the head with it
You see the trophies ho, you talkin' to the bread winner
Lil' ungrateful bastards I can't stand niggas

Like lil' nigga,, I can do this shit with no effort
You know I do this shit with no effort

Only thing you meet is the requirements for a crumb

I used to be like, "I don't need security" 
I don't want these niggas thinking that it's fear in me 
Told my driver, "Be on point," he wasn't hearing' me 
Those shots went off, I'm steady callin', you ain't answerin', you scarin' me 
In my city, if you winnin', you can't stay
They call bein' broke, "Real," they call gettin' money, "Fake"
I gave you a bitch, why you still lookin' at my date?
I gave you some food, why you still lookin' at my plate, nigga?
They say they love us, but that love might be hate
I can't really tell the difference, salt and sugar look the same 
Look how they did Dex, look how they did Blade 
Look how they tried to do me, but got JB

You know your favorite rapper wouldn't have never let them guys get you
I would've shot 'em, left 'em dyin', leakin' in the street
Wouldn't have ran, would've smoke the Runtz and watch that man go to sleep
And you think they came for her? Man, you know they came for me
They took my heart and my brains, niggas know that I can't think
How I'm playin' with these drums, niggas know I'm like Tay Keith
Eyes bloodshot red, niggas know I ain't been sleepin'
But all these dead loved ones make it hard to sleep 
All this anger inside make it hard to grieve 
Ayy, all this nicotine make it hard to breathe 
All these tears in my eyes make it hard to sleep 
They found a murder weapon, bro, it's gon' be hard to beat 
First offer fifty years, so it's hard to plea, ayy 
And if they do somethin' to us, then they known for it 
But if we do somethin' to them, then we wrong for it 
Fuck that, if you take mines, I take yours, homie 
Then gon' pray to the Lord, "Don't be too hard on me"

If we tear this bitch up, they gon' say I'm dead wrong 
Fuck that, these niggas got my auntie with a headstone 
Niggas tellin' me what to do like they smart as me 
But they ain't take your heart from you, they took my heart from me

How the fuck you gon' die on me? I can't stand you 
I pray they don't go to jail, I want 'em dead

I'm just waitin' on a name, I'm just prayin' that they say it
Give a fuck if it's the Mayor, nigga, million on his head, ayy, ayy 
Wish I could wake you up and beat your ass
'Cause I was just tellin' you about them dreams I had 
Ayy, niggas snatched my heart out my chest, can't nobody replace it

"Make sure Tee good" is all I ever heard you sayin'
Tryna hold my head, I don't know if I'ma make it 
This shit been eatin' me 
I don't know what you seen in me, but you believed in me 
Tell them "Keep that fake love, let me grieve in peace"

Stacks big and green, I call my pockets the new Hulk
We don't pay attention to no loose talk 
Shoot that choppa hundred times, I had to let it cool off 
Diamonds dancin' on me, doin' the moonwalk 
Can't wear my AP, I had to let it cool off 
Almost died from pneumonia, had to take my jewels off 
We don't argue with these niggas, we just let them tools talk Fight the cases, I hope y'all beat 'em
You ain't gotta say you real if you real I can see it
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
I ain't trippin' on no losses I can always get it back
Ain't trippin' on my exes I can always get 'em back
But that time was wasted I can never get it
And these niggas be the fakest I can never feel 'em
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
Or that court room being empty, way back at my final sentence
No letters or no pictures like a nigga just stopped livin'
But I just had to sit back and remember
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Rest in peace my family I can never get 'em back
I can never call my niggas that ain't get back on the nets
Rest in peace my nigga B, he in the clouds, nigga
I spend some time with your daughter, she got your smile, nigga
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
Fuck Curry, I'ma rock with the Pistons
Fuck Peyton, I'ma rock with the Lions
You know I fuck with  every city in the Mitten
Met some real niggas in Kentucky
Bra took 35, no snitching
Lil' bro, if you with these niggas, sit back and remember
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
I got some feelings that don't show no more
Me and some of my family, we ain't that close no more
I got some anger build inside me, I control it though
My morals out here runnin' wild, I couldn't control her bro
The first nigga from the family, take that college role
My mom and pop's couldn't even see it that's what hurt me most
Some niggas that I barely know they wanna see me make it
Some niggas I know all my life don't wanna see me blow
I had love and now it's hate for y'all that's official
I had nightmares of that picture
When we left that shootout, you still had bullets in your pistol
I don't fuck with y'all that's official
Nigga, that courtroom was empty way back at me final sentence
Got me like fuck niggas, 'cause
Everybody ain't loyal, everybody ain't street
Everybody ain't you my nigga, everybody ain't me
If you real then I can see it, nigga
If you real then I can see it, nigga
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they real
Real niggas ain't gotta say they realLook me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose 
90’s baby but I get to that money like ’86 again
Lost pops and fell off, we back rich again
Gotta thank God for that prison bid
Music got us looking like the family's selling bricks again
Been on tour, been on TV, own businesses
Still I pull up with that stick and flip the whip you in 
You don't wanna hear bout indictments in the case I caught
Then, bitch, quit listening 
Free Mar Mar, he innocent
I was in the county indigent, now my pendant lit
Bitches love me, they go crazy 'bout that real nigga shit
Used to be a young follower, I was ignorant
If you don't want me to fuck her, go everywhere with that bitch, nigga
I'll drop a bird on your head
That chopper'll blow a third of the nerves out your head
Talking cash, shit, and we murdering that man
When they put them teddy bears on the curb for your ass, you lost
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just  to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose
700K in here and my bag in this room
But it's only for your eyes, why your man's in this room?
I don't know if he a snitch, now it's blood on your hands
If you think I'm 'bout to let him leave alive, you a fool
Got a record deal, my label don't like you when I hang out 
And let me know that they ain't know me 'fore I came out
Kevin Liles, I know it's a risk to have these chains out
But I'm that same nigga that'll knock a nigga brains out
Ex bitch ran off with the Rollie, hope she make it stretch
I could've killed her lil' dirty ungrateful ass
But I'm more mad at myself for tryna date a rat
Plus I make 30 for a show, so I'ma make it back
Used to order Wendy's fries, bring a shake with that
Now its Benihana rice, put some steak on that
The Mustang used to always run out of gas
Now I'm in that Wraith, touch the paint and it's a body bag, nigga
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
Had to risk it all just to win big
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon
Nigga, without me, my people wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose
I wanna see niggas win but everybody, you can't eat around
Some niggas, I wouldn't even go to sleep around
They had the bag, but ain't help me when they see me down
Same niggas DM'ing me tryna be around
Bitch, they see that Wraith and they think Meek around
Can't be around on choppers, yeah okay that's three around
Come get your friendly ass bitch before I beat her down
After I fuck, never again will she be around
It's crazy when your own people wanna bring you down
These niggas don't even know what they wanna beef about
He shot at me, and that's somethin' I can't sleep about
Drop his mama, leave the town, bitch, we even now 
How you gon' motivate the youth, rapping that gangster shit?
This what they like, so I'ma make the shit
But even still, this my life, I gotta claim this shit
So even if they didn't like it, I ain't changing shit, nigga
Look me in my eyes, nigga, I'ma win
I'ma get this money, nigga, I'ma live
First nigga in my family with some legal bread
So I can buy whatever ice, buy whatever crib
I could stack them hunnids to the roof
I ain't stopping 'til they stack to the moon, nigga
Without me, my family wouldn't have food
Anybody go against me gotta lose, niggaRaf Simons cost me five slips
That Goyard bag another five strip
You in Detroit and see a Wraith, nigga that's my shit
Would've pushed Rico's shit back, I am not Mitch
Helluva made this beat, baby
Gettin' money, why these niggas gettin' mad?
Jump off the plane with a couple of M's in the bag
If anybody play with me, it's numbers on their head
We ain't gon' talk about it though, that's the end of that
Trappin', I'm still into that, address, I can send you that
So if my label drop me, I can still look like I rap
Know a couple of niggas livin' like they got platinum plaques 
All they doing is catchin' bags, sendin' out and sittin' back 
Rose Presi' on my wrist, I can afford that 
Back in the day, I couldn't even look toward that
When I was broke, I couldn't even look toward the bitch
Now she suck my dick and don't say shit when I record the bitch 
Been on the indictment list, tryna see the Forbes list
Went from playin' with joysticks to out in traffic blowin' sticks 
When your fans gets your name tatted, then you know you lit
Stank from my cologne, I'ma fuck her if she snort the drip 
Promise my brother I'ma stack and get this paper right
But I'm spendin' 60k a month just on everyday life
When you that bag, everybody wanna whirl it
Problems they got, they gon' call you like you 'caused 'em
Fall up in the club, I can rain 'till it's morning
Start in every game 'cause at practice, I've been ballin' 
Heard a couple niggas wanna put me on my shit 
Tell 'em pull up with them sticks and let 'em hit, you better not miss, bitch
I know some Crips, know some Tree Tops
Name good, I ain't never sold no re-rock 
All these colors in my chain like a peacock
I let that .40 slam 'till it decock
Ridin' through my old hood, with some new money
Blue money, they that mad? Tell 'em do somethin' 
Got three Tennis chains, and like two Presi's
Three choppas, four Glocks, this shit too heavy 
Key to the pad, key to the Rolls, key to the bag
I got the key to the streets, don't get a key put on your ass
When I do that, you know them niggas gon' knock you in half
Heavy cash load, got my back broke
Bitches on the East, and on the West Coast
Sent me pics and videos, you can't get my passcode
Ten up in the motor, got the hood broke
Bitch, don't get yo' head painted, you gon' look like Lil Boat 
Ridin' through Atlanta with my nigga Lil Boat 
Niggas trailin' us and you know what they good for
'Bout to fly to Cali and look for that good dope
If you 'bout that life, then what you lookin' shook for?
Told my lil bro, I had to chase M's, .40 on me, all big face bills
In the back of the Mulsanne, lettin' the space build
If the police flip me with this Glock, I'ma face ten 
I ain't supposed to be the shooter, I'm on top
But I still let it spray like it's 4 days into July
I've been runnin' red light in my city, I know it's hot
I'd rather take the ticket, niggas want my top, it's so many opps
I know some Crips, know some Tree Tops
Name good, I ain't never sold no re-rock 
All these colors in my chain like a peacock

To this day I thank the Lord for it
Askin' me about such and such
I ain't say nothin', too much love for 'em
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'em
I know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave
It was a summer day
Niggas creepin' on us in the black car
'Round this time we was beefin' heavy
So we kept a choppa in the back part
We ended up gettin' the upper hand
I just know that hundred shots cracked cards
I'ma leave it there, I ain't say much
But I hate I even went that far
It was two of us when that popped off
Took an oath, I'ma not talk
So if the story get leaked out
I know whose face I'ma knock off
These niggas with me
When it's beef, they'll come and kill everything movin'
I'll never tell you what I think
I'ma tell you what I know, I done seen them boys do it
After it happened, it never happened
Get rid of anything that can tie us to it
Go clip for clip with my enemies
Then go wait a trial with them prosecutors
Niggas snitchin' on their homeboys
I don't see how they do it
I don't see how them niggas still livin'
I know their mans in there goin' through it
Like right, right, right, ayy
I done had some conversations that can't be repeated
For the sake of some of my niggas' freedom
We done did some shit, I know so many secrets
Tell them other niggas that know 'em I hope ya’ll can keep 'emI know about some situations I can't ever say
'Cause they can't give us life, so I can't ever break
I just pray to God I make it through the day
'Cause I done did some shit I'm takin' to the grave
Me and bro chillin', just talkin'
Told me how he blew a nigga's head back
Shit fucked me up
Stop the conversation, nigga, dead that
Whatever happened, it never happened
Don't tell none of your mans that
I ain't sayin' that your niggas rats
But I don't want you to chance that
Me and Cook talkin', what was said
It can't be repeated, nothin' about that
Can't believe them boys kept it
Hopin' people never find that
Marvin trippin' since 2012

Granny's eyes still ain't even dried yet
Rest in peace B, I know who did it

You prolly can't hear me 'cause you dead too
But I don't know who killed you, nigga
Had my mama down in them feds
She said, "Son you a real nigga"

You know about it, don't open your mouth
Or they huntin' you down, hit 'em upYou know everything a nigga say be facts man like
I hope they don't play this shit in court one day
If you look up some of the stories in my city
You will see the relation between the music
Everybody with me clumsy, we all be droppin' shit
Droppin' niggas, droppin' icy kids
Fuck a bitch, drop her at her momma crib
Not with the gossipin', we do that robbin' shit
Any means, I'm gon' eat
Slide with the tank on full 
Leave with the Glock on E
I got a K, it hold a hunnid
But I got lazy, only put 90
Money make your whole team vanish
That's a paper trick, Origami
I be dolo, don't need a posse
If you got the wave, I got the tsunami
Chain hit like Ike Turner 
But I don't beat bitches, I beat bodies
I just bought some chain reactions just to stomp a nigga in Versace
Call me Martin, I stay with the Tommy
You lookin' for me, pussy come find me
And I'm not gon' snatch your chain, I'm gon' take it off politely
So when I go back to sell it, it's not damaged, not even slightly
Raised around killers, that's how I'm cut
Found out where he stay, don't shoot the house up
Lay in they bushes 'til your legs lock up
Whoever walk outside first, drop some
Lift that chopper up, go nuts 
That was his momma, so what? 
Nigga that's your fault, we wanted your blood
And your bitch take dick like a grownup

Sharks and hustlers, I'm from the D 
Bring a nigga to the feast , we not stingy, homie eat

They gotta identify him by his teeth
We gon' kill you if you freeze
When your job was to squeeze, nigga
I got an Uzi and sound like, boom! 
I got a Draco and it sound like, boom! 
Knock your shit open, the bullets explosive
Fall and you getting stood-over 
Can't run out of bullets in a shootout
Taking my time counting as I'm blowin'

Rapper diss me, I'm at every show like I'm his biggest fan
Hollows in that Sprinter Van gon leave somebody crippled, man
You see your DJ brain come through his head
You'll turn religious, man
Having my way, him see us up at the range, that's practice, okay?
Dead bodies in the hood, pour acid on it for rapid decay
Granny don't even know the savage she raised, nigga 
Ayy, 200k get you took off the planet today, nigga 
Ayy, nigga hoes, I don't feel 'em 
Cut his head like a deck, let his homeboys deal him

I put Forgi's on my drop, them bitches rubbin' 
They like, "Grizzley, bro you rich, why is you thuggin'"?

Took my FN off my hip like, "You've been summoned" ChopsquadDJ on the beat so it's a banger
All bark, no bite, that's what these niggas is, hol' up

My cousin said, "This how you do it" 
Let the dope money hide in the music 
Can't say goodbye to the trap 
Got a whole brick of white and it's wrapped 
I used to stay on that bitch 
Just bust her down at the wrist 
Just bust her down like a zip 
Now when I shoot my shot it's a swish 
When the police tried to get me 
I used to run and jump fences
Now when I'm pullin' up, it's a Bentley 
I became one with the mission 
We like skydivers, everybody strapped
And we like a good audience, 'cause everybody clap 
Yo' bitch like a rehab, everybody cracked 
Laser on the Glock, trip and everybody zapped 
Let me take 'em back 
2007 
Got on my knees 
Looked up to heaven 
And I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this 
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for this shit 
Sat in the cell, and I felt defeated 
Open the Bible, I read it 
The world is so cold, anemic 
Suicide doors on the 'Ghini 
I looked in the eyes of a demon 
Martin Luther, think I'm dreamin' 
We go Freddy Kruger, choppers singin' 
Back and forth with the racks like Serena 
Ready for the times like this 
Big boy Patek, make a pattern with the wrist 
Big stones, baguette the fist 
Got a bigger bone, the Sig don't kick 
Styrofoam, double up, Twix 
Bitch, eat it up, we gon' reel in the fish 
Jump out the licks, jump out the sticks
Bentley Bentayga, big body kicks 
Put it on the gang, we won't flop 
25 thots on the boat dock 
Don't try 'Set, I hope not 
You gon' have a tan when your toes out 
I did it for the bag, no clout 
Leave it in the pad, it's the old route 
Lamborghini drag, bring your ho out 
Drippin' out the coca', I prayed for the drip 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this 
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for the drip 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for this shit 
I used to pray for times like this, to rhyme like this 
So I had to grind like that, just to shine like this Look at the bottom, I had to make it, I had to
Came with a record deal, I had to touch it, I had to
All the jealousy it got activated 
All the fake love it got activated
Got some people, they really my kin don't feel like we family though
Then I got some people, they only my friends and feel like we family though
Whenever it's time to stick to the plan
I know how to handle it most 
Vanish the foes and cancel the hoes
Just so I could manage to go
Deactivated and I'ma do me, I am not goin' on E
You know I'm out in these streets but let me not eat
I'm robbin' these niggas that's out here on fleek
And thats on my OG
One thing I learned from these suckers
These niggas don't be your brothers
These bitches don't even love you
Better keep your circle small
'Cause that loyalty is a bad motherfucker
That loyalty, that bitch a bad motherfucker
I caught my sister stealing out my pockets
It ain't your fault if I don't trust you
I can still get five years for the pistol
Ain't no way around it, I'm clutchin'
If I'm ever threatened, if I'm disrespected
Ain't no way around it, I'm bustin'
I got some people, we got different blood
They wanna see me in a Ghost 
And I got some people, we got the same blood
They wanna see me as a ghost 
That's why I'm doin' the most, playin' my role
Better tuck your bitch, I'm at niggas hoes
Thick spread, all blue faces, I don't need dubs to make it look long
Dreadhead but I'm a city nigga, if I'm pussy, then Biggie living
Won't fuck just an bitch and I'll let this bitch blow at any nigga
Date day with the belly spray
And it's really gold, I ain't going' different
Should invest into funeral homes
'Cause these bitches dyin' just to fuck with us 
Bro said the last bag was garbage 
So I paid him back out of respect 
Stand up, nigga, if I fuck with you, it's 100 brah, I don't finesse 
When I ain't fuck with niggas, it was all blood
Laugh, cry with him, for cuz
His loyalty ain't where I need it at
So it's a shame I can't even call Dub
I like to call baby, like what's the word? Chillin', I ain't on shit tonight
She gonna come through, get me right
And I'ma crash through it like she ran the light
Well, I gotta go before I miss this flight 
So I'm tryna get up 
I'm like a kid before Christmas night
Who ain't never had none in his life, like
This really my life with zero exaggeration
Some niggas just elevated, got me feelin' activated
Lost a lot in them cells and cages but held on to my dedication
The money got me fascinated, saw that shit and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw that money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated
Canada Goose keep me warm in my cold city 
I got a pole with me, Glock cost 450
Your bitch blowin' , took my soul with her 
They got they hand out , I don't even know niggas
For testing the game? I'm testing my aim
If I die today, I got a M to my name
In 2015, ain't have a stack to my name 
Cuz let me starve, sent him a pic in a new Mulsanne
Tell him I saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw that money and got activated
I saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
Saw the money and got activated
I saw that money and got activated
I saw that money and got activatedHad to take my jewelry off for this shit, man
Na, na-na, na-na
Had to take my money out my pocket and everything, before I even start rappin'
Ooh yeah
Just so I get that feel again, you know what I'm sayin'?
Na, na-na, na-na, na
Back to that grind, that hunger
Not like everybody else that's rich 
The last shit I dropped was some industry songs I thought was gon' be lit
Now I know if I keep doin' that, I ain't gon' be shit 
I can't make that shit y'all hear from Drake and them
The people that relate to me do not relate to Taylor Swift 
So I apologize 
For comin' to the studio and seein' dollar signs 
Instead of bein' real with y'all, like how I'm traumatized 
The shit that happened to JB hit me so hard, it made my mama cry 
Speakin' of my mama, yeah, she still got a lot of time 
Lost my great granny, we knew she was almost out of time
I ain't cut them niggas off for nothin', they was out of line
Niggas rappers 'til the feds have 'em singin' like Ty Dolla $ign, ayy 
I ain't no rapper, I'm an artist
Ain't in and out of jail, so I gotta be the smartest
Plus I'm seasoned like Lawry's
Put the guns down from my past, now I'm a target
Had to pick the guns back up case they start sparking 
Real peace, I'm tryna get closer to it
I can't find that in money 'cause I be blowin' through it
Free my commissary niggas and that bitch goin' through it
Few M's in cash, bet you can't get to know me for it 
The real side of me , it's a broke me 
And the rich me owe him an apology
Really I hit the lottery 
And instead of being grateful, I just see people winnin' and let it bother me 
Kylie made a billion, I'm failin' in life, I gotta be
She younger than me, so I'm 'posed to have more money logically
Then I start thinkin' like that shit don't apply to me
Kylie Jenner came from millions, I come from poverty 
Anybody born into money, they supposed to
You was gon' be dead at twenty, that's what they told you 
But instead you got rich and fucked all the hoes that hoed you 
Now it's time to make sure you don't go back to the old you 
Now I understand 
I'm me, so I ain't nothin' like no other man 
When they was buyin' 'fits and never wearin' clothes twice
I was at auntie house, tellin' Lau', "Give me everything you don't like"
What I got in common with these other rappers? Nothin', nigga 
They make theyselves feel real by hangin' with bummy niggas
Pull up to the trenches, take some pictures, let 'em clutch the blicky
That's why I be irritated when I gotta fuck with niggas 
I'ma tell you the truth 
They lettin' niggas get some money, all that other shit is through
I got bitches, got my niggas, I got millions in the stu'
Trade my mansion for a cell over some clout, boy, would you? 
But let you tell it, you quick to blast, gon' flip his ass
Life in prison, no more pussy, only nigga ass 
Only six packs , only calf muscle 
Them niggas ain't tryna make love, they 'bout to wrap somethin'
That shit funny, but it's true
Better grow a brain 'fore it be you 
Better think 'fore you try to be cool 
Better look for some cameras before you shoot
I was that nigga before I had the cash 
In the club with my bitch, still grabbin' ass 
God told me, "Son, I'm not sendin' you to Hell"
Even though I killed whoever caught 'em when I threw them shells 
Don't let this go over your head
I wouldn't've told on nobody and I wasn't goin' to jail, nigga 
Don't let this go over your head
I wasn't tellin' on nobody and I wasn't goin' to jail, nigga
Na, na-na, na-na, na-na
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Ooh-wee
Na, na-na, na-na, na, na-na, yeah
Oh yeah
Ooh, yeah
YeahNeed that
Shit we need that
10 bands will get a nigga a Tee track
I need a whole 10 out a nigga if I jump on niggas raps
I need a whole 10 out a nigga if I jump on niggas raps
Why these niggas watching me tell em to look at cable
Before I find they bitch and fuck up they engagement
The plug said I'm half a man and half amazing
No cereal but I got twenty bowls on the table
Feeling good finally made it out them chains
Yo mans playing tough, I let you see that nigga brain's
I can get yo bitch wet before the next time it rain
You a fool you think Imma keep that forty-one plain nigga
Been in the sun getting dark the Buffs still white
Did some time made it back the prices was still right
Everything I rap about it happened in real life
You got pregnant on me baby, how you think you still wife?

Nigga put his hands on me shit gone escalate

If these niggas can't come up with 10 then they in the way
I'm out of prison, Let me pick up where I left it at
Got my Giuseppe in the game but I ain't finna play
Medusa head hold up my white Barbours
I don't game up these hoes I don't like talking
This ain't no motherfucking rollie
This a ice sculpture
Try to take it watch how quick I send them night crawlers
Go tell them boys

Tell them boys I said 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga

Huh?
Somebody said talk is cheap
I speak a 100 thousand to existence
Come and talk to me
A nigga put his hands on me
Let me stop you there
A nigga raise his voice at me then he out of there
That K will sit you down and spin you like a barber chair
Jet black mink with the hood, Call me PaPa Bear
Stupid ass nigga I need 10 for a feature
If you hear a nigga chased me
I was running to a heater
Pop and leave his head hot
Somebody check him for a fever
Shout to my bitch and the bitches that want to be her nigga
Me and that boy Curry  got some shit in common
Last night we put up thirty niggas couldn't stop us
He put up thirty point's, I put up thirty thousand
Them niggas be shooting hoops
We be shooting choppas
Go tell them boys
I need 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Tell them boys I said 10 for a feature nigga
I need 10 for a feature nigga
Like what the fuck is five hunna
Dig deeper nigga

Tell them boys I charge 10 for a feature nigga
Wait a minute I get deeper with itRest in peace my day ones 
Wish I could have saved y'all 
Hand on my AR 
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon 
Free all of my day ones 
System take my niggas' lives away 
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day
They wonder why my heart is so numb
I saw so much when I was so young
When I look back, man I was so dumb
Shoulda used that game that I soaked up
But nigga, my streets, you can't play on
Young nigga get that weight gone
.45 hit your face
I bet that impact crack your face bones
Say young nigga get your cake loan
Fuckin' leave, we don't stay long
Founders of the streets with potential
And built them blocks like Legos
With a bad bitch, she Brazilian 
911, no ceilings
Know I'm chasin' after a million 
Put them fuck niggas in my rearview
Hollow tips at your temple
Rest in peace 'cause you can't heal 'em
Rest in peace my day ones 
Wish I could have saved y'all 
Hand on my AR 
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon 
Free all of my day ones 
System take my niggas' lives away 
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day
Nigga, rest in peace, my old man 
He always told me be my own man 
These niggas switchin' on their day ones
I'd rather be out here with no friends
We got drums, even on the handguns
Hundred shots on that AK
Few of my niggas got Instagram
All of my niggas got JPays
I make sure their books straight
They don't gotta fuck with them state trays
For Rondo I'ma go that way
Tae I'ma do the same thing
Rest in peace to Mario 
They killed him right before my b-day 
Back of his head, he died instantly
They couldn't even look him in his face
That's why I don't fuck with everybody
I stick to my own team
Tell the truth on every track
Hop in this bitch and my soul bleed
Cut niggas off like Jay Z
Shoot shit like Kobe
Niggas sneak dissin', don't know me
Then come around and try to bro me
Won't never tell you what I think
Always tell you what I know
Ain't competent, fake weak nigga
We can never even have a convo
ISIS members on speed dial
Have 'em run up on you with the bomb on 'em
I'ma die by what I stand for
I ain't scared to stand on my own
They tell you what you wanna hear
They only teach what they want you to know
I done seen my niggas drop like flies 
So don't be spooked I got this uzi on
In the studio like
Rest in peace my day ones 
Wish I could have saved y'all 
Hand on my AR 
I ain't goin' out like Trayvon 
Free all of my day ones 
System take my niggas' lives away 
Be patient, it's gon' take time
But get yourself together 'fore that out day
.45 black like Akon
Choppa screamin' like Lil Jon
Glock 9 on my waistline
I dare a nigga try to take mine
Know some niggas who fake now
Can't look me in my face, nah
Be  in my circle
My niggas is kings now
Rest in peace my day ones
Wish I could have saved my niggas
Rest in peace my day ones
Wish I could have saved my niggasHooo!

Night time, bro speedin', I was out the window
That's a scary sight
You gon' get buried probably
Demons talking to me while I'm shooting, like, "Hit everybody"
Ain't shit to hide but I want the car tinted
I want the crib behind tall trees and fences
Have you ever had to kill one of your friends
'Cause the shit that he was on was coming between your plans?
Can't just cut him off 'cause he know too much about you
Sent a prayer up, don't worry about your kids and your momma, I got 'em
Then you gotta walk past the casket
Remembering how hard he hit the wall when you blast
To remembering how sad he sounded knowing he through
Seeing shock and just disbelief in his eyes 'cause it was you
I had to
My nigga, I had to, ayy
Have you ever played roles with a bitch?
And that shit went too far
You done met this bitch kids and you know that she in love
You tell her, she like "She stuck"
But you know that everything gon' change after you fuck?
But you couldn't reveal your true intentions
She ain't the typa bitch that just let a nigga hit her
But fuck that, I got to
Baby girl, I got you
Let me be the one you smile with and who you cry to
Anything you need, let me know, and I'll spot you
Hoping she don't really ask you though, 'cause it's not true
You fell victim to my lust, my bad, boo
But you so cold and so thick, bitch, I had too
Only had like 250 in the bank but that ice and them jewelers steady callin' my name
They want 90 for the charm, 80 for the Cuban
I'm just knowin' it gon' kill me but I gotta do it
Tryna make myself feel better like maybe it's gon' motivate me
Maybe when they see me with it, they gon' know I made it
I went and got it, that shit ain't no nothing for me, jack
And it's a custom piece, so I can't get no money back
I just thought I had to
Fuck that shit I thought I had to do
I just thought I had to
Fuck that shit I thought I had to doATL Jacob

Before I go broke, I'ma jump in a lake
I could jump out that Bentley and jump in a straight
Jump out that straight and jump in a Cutty
Niggas want smoke, we gon' jump in a tank
Lil' baby, I don't do dates
Can't have these hoes with a due date
Spend your block for a few days
With a few K's, if you play, you lay
Niggas want beef, don't entertain it
They wanna die, just make the arrangement
She on her knees like its a engagement
My niggas get money too, it's contagious
Where was you at when I was in the basement?
Where was you at when I was at arraignment?
They wanna fuck, 'cause we in this bitch raining
Million dollar nigga, but I still eat Ramen
I love bro to death but we don't really be hanging 
I'm scared to hang with him 'cause he got more bodies than Jason 
Foreigns back to back, just line 'em up, adjacent 
You got all them niggas locked up, you a agent

Now I'm just savin' my money, you ain't gotta deal with me
I go broke, back to the block, ain't nobody gon' feel it but me
These niggas ungrateful
Do something for a nigga, niggas won't even say thank you
Speaking down on me now, that shit disgraceful
When nobody there, I was shackled down to my ankles
Now they callin' me with they problems like I made 'em
If I wouldn't here, who would you call?
If I wasn't rich, who could I call?
My days consist of me and my circle
Even got family members who ain't worthy
They be like let me hold something 'til Tuesday, I'ma give it back
Tuesday come, niggas act like they mad when you go to get it back
Bring up what you did for me then you shouldn't did it, I get sick of that
Everything I ever did was genuine, you would never hear me mention that
Remember that, nigga
So I get to showin' niggas love, like real love  pullin' up on niggas and everything, you know. 
Ain't nobody from our city that made it ever did that for niggas  ,you know what I'm sayin', the trenches.  I tried to be the first one to do that.  Niggas still hatin' on me for that.  Alright maybe niggas just broke and need some money.  I get the passing  cheese around that bitch, you know what I'm sayin'. 
I'm like, 200,000 in, just with, passin' money out, you know what I'm sayin'.  That shit don't work, these niggas don't appreciate shit.  These niggas ungreatful
Ungreatful, Ungreatful

I did for everyone
Ungreatful, Ungreatful
Ungreatful
They tell me
Niggas did bids
She made sure you was fed
Let you talk to your kids, so they can love they dad
You wouldn't say thank you
But at the same time, she was trippin' about some taxes
She ain't wanna break bread with her man, she so ungrateful
Ain't cheat just to keep you happy, I wish I was unfaithful
Let niggas hold money Friday to after Friday like I was able
I brought niggas 'round my kids, let them eat at the roundtable
Watch playoff games up at my crib 'cause you ain't have no cable
Jail visits, sending pictures I was by that
You say I'm trippin' but your family who you was mad at
Ì know some niggas who would take you out for some Xanax
Plan B, 'cause Plan A we ain't never plan that
You miss court, I let you lay low
You stole from me and ain't seen you since, I told my OG I'ma give you halo
Got that dog food like we Ralo
And they gon' kill you if I say so
Aye, I'ma tell you the truth, I'ma spit facts, I'ma tell you one time alright. My bank called me and was tellin' me like, someone just forged your, umm, your signature. So I'm like, "Hell naw, y'all trippin'." 20, 30 thousand dollar check ain't nobody, ain't finna know nobody gon' walk in there and do that, you know what I'm sayin'. Whole time it was my family. You know what I'm sayin', that ain't even hurt me, man, I just knew what time it was. That's why everybody I got around me I call my brother or my family, you know what I'm sayin'. It's so crazy but sometimes I put water over bloodI'm just curious, niggas can't be serious
Woke up like, "What year is it?" Niggas on their period
My change done gave me somethin', it ain't no curin' it
I seen Durk, I heard up close, bitch ain't no fear in it
My name superior
Bro and 'em be trappin'
They throwin' a couple hundreds just so you can deliver it
You said if he robbed you that you was gon' kill him
I seen him today, I'm just curious
I told her don't put me on child support, I'ma give extra but she wasn't hearin' it
I take you around the killer, the robbers, the shooters just for the experience
Don't try to dodge you, make up yo bed, you lay in it, niggas ain't hearin' it
I get yo bitch in the Bentley, she gon' see some shit she never experienced
I am a Captain, I get you crunched and put in a box, no cereal
This automatic hit that whip, nothing gon' help niggas short of a miracle
Tryna to make a million off a Bloodas tour but his P.O. not clearin' him
Tryna make a M and M but he couldn't do it and that shit was killin' him
And I grew up in the ghetto, I ain't never hung around gentlemen
Bought the drugs, take the drugs, niggas in the hood ain't really tryna get it
You would be surprised what your brothers do 
Don't be surprised for this Bloodas 2 
Couldn't feel my face when I popped that ecstasy
Couldn't feel my face off Percs, I just took 3
And my lil' bro could've died next to me 
But I shot first, get him a stretcher please 
Them chopsticks got his body ten degrees 
Someone should've told him we part Japanese 
Bro by the mill, he tryna catch the weed 
This bitch tryna get me to invest in weave 
I told her, "Yes," just to finesse that freak 
After I fuck, I'm playin' hide and go seek

Used to ride to school, Mongoose, now in a Range drop 
Is you is who you say you is?

You play with Durkio, you pick out your box

They in they feelings 'cause I smoke on opps 
I hope they know 100 shots ain’t gon' stop
I just been tryna save it, they keep on makin' it hard
They keep on makin' us jewelry, they keep on makin' these cars
That pump hit him, it's gon' lift him up and that nigga gon' make it to Mars
On track to confirm that shipment should make it tomorrow
50 to 100 stacks on yo head, I bet you won't make it tomorrow
Let me know your crib all night, no sleep, they drinkin' Starbucks
I'm talkin' boss life, you say my name one time, I'ma tell 'em I fucked your boss wife

Don't think I'm gangsta when you see, test it, watch this MAC pop
In that drop-head, tell my haters suck a fat cock
I ain't good at sellin' drugs, I done tried it 
I'm too lazy for scales, bitch, I tried it 
I got rich off tellin' stories how my life went 
Bring the loyalty, one hundred, bitch, we locked in 
In that cell musty, couldn't believe myself 
Lawyer wasn't doin' shit, I had to free myself 
Pops left the world earlier, had to teach myself 
Niggas out here lookin' crazy, they should see theyself 
I know bro would give me half if I needed it
Bro cool but that boy'll turn demon quick
'Cause, when it's beef, make sure you don't sleep on that 
My dawg tried to line me up, he think I'm sleep on that
While you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch 
I ain't goin' back broke, I'm stuck rich 
He tried to hide her but I still hit that dumb bitch 
One night and then I'm done with that punk bitch 
Only one of me but ho, I'm doublin'
I put his mans in the morgue, I know he double sick
Ask about me in the clubs, nigga, I double tip
I'm runnin' shit, whoever don't like it, suck a dick 
Bitch, when you see a boss keep twerkin' 
Keep doin' that and you gon' be my next purchase 
60 racks to NZ for this choker, I can merch it 
Ass so soft, titties right, you perfect 
Pussy so wet it make waves, we surfin' 
Nigga in your DM three times, he thirsty 
Used to be broke, catchin' buses, I was bummin'
Now when bitches see me out they like, "It's a husband" 
Girl don't thank for that cash, it's just money 
Don't even thank me for that bag, it ain't nothin' 
He don't buy bags, who he foolin'?
That nigga bag little, he ain't tryna blow through it 
You got a table full of niggas but it's one plate 
I don't even fuck with Unk and even old Ye' 
This old nigga told me, boy, you should love hate
'Cause nigga you wouldn't be poppin' if they wasn't hatin'
Hold up, when I was broke I never blamed God 
That's why every back end, I thank God 
They said I wouldn't make it but they ain't God 
That's why I say, "Ain't it a blessing," gotta claim God 
And while you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit 
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit 
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick 
I put my chains in the freezer, they too lit 
I put his mans in a hospital, he too sick 
While you niggas talkin' down, I'm up, bitch 
I ain't goin' broke, I'm stuck rich 
Call your bitch, like, pull up and do that one shit 
Talk to her while I fuck, make her cum quick
AP, new freezer, I'm too lit 
All my haters need a hospital, they too sick 
Put my chains in the freezer, they too lit 
I put his mans in a hospital, he too sick Backend all hundreds, they know how I want it
When we slide all choppers, they know how I'm comin'
Tried to hide at his mama's, ain't no hidin' from me
Sent you a picture of her house, like, come outside, dummy
Hit-Boy
Spray on cologne , that's eleven hundred 
The shoes on my feet, a pound of Runtz, Dior runners 
My whole 'fit cost about ten bands
All together sixty racks 'cause I got fifty in my pants
I looked up to Payroll growin' up, lil' bitch, I'm from the D 
Play with that yayo growin' up, lil' bitch, I'm from the streets
Lil' bro be bangin' and you know how my lil' nigga bleed
Put on that mask, knock on your door, this shit ain't trick or treat
The niggas out here broke, I promise I don't feel sorry
You ain't show up on no money, but you showed up to that party 
Broke ass nigga, I don't feel sorry for you
Barely legally retarded, every month that boy get money, ayy
Can't let no ho get in my head 'cause ain't no ho in me 
And get the fuck out ASAP when you get off your knees
In Miami, me and Zoey on them skis
We ain't out here havin' fun, we out here lookin' for some keys, nigga
I heard they floatin' 'round the water, had to come and see 
Clean nigga in every way but I got dirty piece 
Nigga owe me, make 'em roll and he gon' work for free 
You cut me off, it hurt, but you hurt yourself more than me 
Niggas praise and respect too much ho shit 
He too friendly with the opps, get 'em both zip 
Hot nigga, keep a cold bitch, froze wrist
Granny called like, "You on the news," I'm like, "Oh, shit" 
Let me hit that shit, now you can say you fucked a killer, bitch 
They ain't with us, they against us, fuck them niggas, bitch 
Jumpin' out that Benz truck with the cutter, nigga 
'Cause every day it's a new reason not to trust these niggas
Ain't nobody gettin' away with doin' no bitch shit 
I don't drink 'cause I get drunk and I talk big shit 
Sneak dissin' won't do shit but get your bitch hit
When you see me, shut your mouth or get your shit split 
Do my dirt by myself, don't need assistance 
You hatin' me and I don't know that you exist, bitch 
She text her homegirl like, "Look at his wrist, bitch"
She text back, "I seen him first, get off his dick, bitch"
Criminals or millionaires? Nigga, I'm both
When you come from that, it follow you, you know how it go
I know exactly where I'm from and who I am, I ain't ashamed
But the love ain't the same after fame, that's a shame
I be fresh but I ain't Gunna, give a fuck about no clothes
Swear I care 'bout everything but give a fuck about no ho
Listen, we is not the same, you say "door", I say "dough"
You say "floor", I say "flow", you say "for sure", I say "fa'sho"
Niggas diss rap niggas, but they won't show up to no show
Your mama must've been a ho 'cause you call everybody bro
I only wanna hit her 'cause she thick and she fine
Looks matter, shit, if God don't like ugly, why should I? 
Backend all hundreds, they know how I want it 
When we slide all choppers, they know how I'm coming 
Tried to hide at his mama's, ain't no hidin' from me 
Sent you a picture of her house, like, come outside, dummy  
When you see me, I'm with the same team
And I still got my clientele from my mid-teens
Gotta watch for them people, they tryna pin kings
If they livin' like kingpins with some legit dreams
I started off small-time, but I had big dreams
I used to nickel and dime, right on my ten-speed
She compared her man to Pay, I told her, "Bitch, please"
You begged the ho to stay, I told the bitch, "Leave"
This watch over thirty K, this a brick sleeve
This some small beneficial when you big league
You flipped the script on your people, I just flip G's
I used to fill fiends' needles, now they feelin' me
They like, "Oh, yeah, Fenkell in this bitch"
If his watch melt, we gon' be sinkin' in this bitch
The game natural to me, I been seasonin' this shit
You just in the way, what is your reason to exist?
Three niggas with me, but we leavin' in the six
Might see me on Five Mile fleein' from a flip
Smellin' like new money, reekin' through a 'fit
Count money, stash money then retreat to a trip I ain't gonna use the beat this time, I'ma get, I'ma get a little more intimate with 'em
You ready?
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
This is my moment, this is my moment
This what I wanted, this what I wanted
You know that I'm with it, you fuck with me, I'm goin'
When that money callin' I throw a bitch off me, I'm on it
I'm on it, nigga
I sat there and waited
For niggas to help me
All that talkin' they did, them niggas ain't show it
I sat there and starved, I remember the hunger
Ayy, when I got a plate, bitch it was over
Game over
Nigga, back the fuck off me 'fore them killers get on you
Ooh, I ain't gotta be steamin', for these bitches to blow me
Ooh, beat my case in Kentucky, but they wanted to stone me
Ooh, one time for my bitch, I won me a trophy
Ooh, Neil mama know that her son safe
'Cause at all times I'm ridin' with him
Deangelo ever get killed, I can't tell the story 'cause I'm dyin' with him
I was just broke without a dime with him
And Cody, countin' pies with him
Matchin' APs, it's our time, nigga
Feel good to be alive, nigga
I know niggas, niggas cool
Fuck 'em, I'll kill anyone
But my niggas ain't gettin' touched
If they ever call me, I'm whippin' up
Hoppin' out and I'm liftin' up
50 shots on that glizzy drum
Niggas coppin' pleas, I ain't hearin' 'em
Obituaries gettin' printed up
Ain't no beef with you niggas
You niggas can blow me
Ooh, 50 racks on me, that's after the Rollie
Ooh, I wasn't comin' home? Oh that's what they told you?
I ain't killed nobody, bitch you know they couldn't hold me
Ooh, one time for my codefendants
Nigga, everybody stayed silent
Ayy, Theo, we goin' to the grave
In assessment, nigga, we was wildin'
Ayy, Juan tho when they split us up, my blood felt like lava
Pointin' out them niggas that shot you
So I can set them niggas on fire
Ayy, Big T if you can hear me, dawg
I can't breathe without you, I'm drownin'
When Suge called with them bad news
All them tears had a nigga blinded
Ayy, mom dukes, when you fought the feds
I just knew that you was gon' beat 'em
When they gave you all of that time
It ain't hurt 'cause I couldn't believe it
But look, this is my moment
And this what I wanted
Before you fuck with me, just know that I'm with it
With whoever I'm goin'
Real niggas gon' listen 'cause I'm a real nigga
Can't nobody clone me
You fuck with my niggas, I'm comin' to get you
I swear that I'm on it
Ooh, ten bands for a feature
500 to answer my phone for you
I ain't got room for no leechers
Mothafuckas only call when they want somethin'
Niggas really out here snitchin'
Still runnin' 'round like they ain't told nothin'
And real talk, I'm scared of y'all niggas
Y'all will get a nigga Super Bowl numbers
Don't do it just for the money
You ain't gon' always get rewarded
When you one hunnid don't nothin' come with it
And when you're real you don't get nothin' for it
Long as them circles stay silent and loyal
What else is really important?
Watch me do this shit for all of my niggas
Watch me get this money tellin' my story
Nigga, this is my moment, this is my moment
This what I wanted, this what I wanted
You know that I'm with it, you fuck with me, I'm goin'
When that money callin', I'll throw a bitch off me, I'm on it
I'm on it, nigga, like ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, ooh
Ooh, ooh, oohMy place so full nigga
You can say that two times
The goal was to make 50 bands
I done did that a few times
I'm 25 four times
Bitch I'm 50, 2 times
2 times say he don't shoot cribs
Chop sticks he don't even suit 9's
300 hundreds on me
She gon' see this and be lit
I hit the horn and keep going
Cause you niggas ain't talkin' bout shit
I sat my whole circle down
Like nigga we gotta rich
Like nigga we gotta get icy
We just can't fall in love with the shit
After we had that talk, them niggas ain't stop working
I'm in love with with Tinashe
I can't wait to see to her in person
I can't wait to see if she loyal
Can't wait to see if she a squirter
For you niggas that can’t wait to rob me
I got niggas that can't wait to murder
King T, I'm your highness
Niggas don't wanna take it to violence
The same way I act out in public
Is the same way I act while in private
I can not go to the club
If I can't get in with my fire
And 30 bottles of the finest
And watch the money get to flying
Like hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, catch it
Like hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, catch it
Run off with it, we gon' catch 'em
Pray for the opps and bless they man's restin'
Caught the bag at breakfast it's gone and still breakfast
Rob my man's and gave it back, stupid we still stretched 'em
When I wanna talk about nothing
Take me a lil' break from the money
I'ma come holler at y'all
Matter fact leave me your number
And when I'm tired thumbin' through hunnids
When I'm sick of running up commas
I'ma come see what y'all on, I'ma let your bitch know when I'm coming
These niggas ain't fucking with me
Nigga, that ain't no money to me
Nigga, I blow all of that shit when I go it ain't comin' with me
I was in St. Louis, ain't talkin' Missouri and 2 had a hundred on me
That's a lil' big homie, touch 'em at two you won't make it to 3
I was with all of the shooters, when I heard it was money on me
I was around the hitman when I found out it was money on me
Either these niggas don't know what they doin', or they scared to go for the kill
We know, they know what they doin' them niggas just know what it is
Like hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, catch it
Like hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, catch it
Hol' up, hol' up, hol' up, catch it
Run off with it, we gon' catch 'em
Pray for the opps and bless they man's restin'
Caught the bag at breakfast it's gone and still breakfast
Rob my man's and gave it back, stupid we still stretched 'emI ain't givin' niggas no passes
I ain't givin' niggas none 
I ain't givin' niggas one
Used to carry bottles to the store, praying nobody see me
How these bitches disappeared? They up there with Houdini
Now one of my trucks a Bentley, the other a Lamborghini
Driving to that same store, praying somebody see me
They ask if my fans abandon me, would that kill me? 
My own family abandoned me, so you tell me
Got a big family, but that's a cold family
Got a new family, still love my old family
I know how it feel to know I had no family 
I wish I could bring back my dead and gone family 
Run that bag up, now I'm a ho magnet 
Metal on me, don't have me around no magnets, ayy 
Big bag in this bitch, now where the hoes at that's fucking?
I got everything, so when I hit the mall I don't see nothing
Wait outside that nigga mama house since he think he the toughest
I got two of the same watches, both them bitches a hundred
I got anger problems, so I can't kill you with kindness 
Kill you with this chopstick or kill you with this nine, bitch
Granny used to try to have me on some get a job shit
I ain't get no job, bitch, that's nonsense, I'm robbin'
Couldn't sell dope, they had the plug and they was hoggin' it
Knew I would get rich when I was young, that was me callin' it
Ain't nobody helped, but they all wanna be a part of it
This 40 that I got'll cut your head off like Spartacus 
Fuck your gang, make the whole set vanish 
Outside an opp party with that TEC slammin' 
Couldn't keep shooting 'cause that bitch kept jammin'
Lil' nigga, you a bitch like my ex-companion
Walkin' anywhere and I'ma stand on shit
Niggas ain't on shit besides a lot of ho shit
I ain't been on bullshit, I got five full kits
Soon as you walked away, your wife winked and blew a kiss
That's why I don't trust shit, nigga, not at all
Sniffin' on her ass, I ain't nasty, I'm a dog
You ain't gon' bust shit, nigga, knock it off
If my money wore clothes, it'd shop at Big and Tall
Got a big family , but that's a cold family 
New family, but I still love my old family 
I know how it feel to know I had no family 
I wish I could bring back my dead and gone family 
Run that bag up, now I'm a ho magnet 
Metal on me, don't have me around no magnets 
Run that bag up, now I'm a ho magnet 
Metal on me, don't have me around no magnets 
Who the fuck these niggas talkin' to? 
That's why you can't let these niggas get too comfortable
They treat you like a worker, show 'em the boss in you
They act like they ain't scared of you, go'n and off a few 
I'd rather you be loyal 'cause you scared of me
Not loyal 'cause you love me, you could love me and steal from me
My uncle stole an ounce, I left a birdie there
Same night, they had to take his ass to urgent care
Used to carry bottles to the store, praying nobody see me
How these bitches disappeared? They up there with Houdini
Now one of my trucks a Bentley, the other a Lamborghini
Driving to that same store, praying somebody see me
Got a big family, but that's a cold family 
Got a new family , still love my old family , ayy
I know how it feel to know I had no family 
I wish I could bring back my dead and gone family 
Run that bag up, now I'm a ho magnet 
Metal on me, don't have me around no magnets 
Run that bag up, now I'm a ho magnet 
Metal on me, don't have me around no magnets I'm book smart, street smart, but still with all that dumb shit
Right nigga to link with, wrong nigga to fuck with
In love with these streets, I just hate what they come with
If ain’t no lie detector test around, I can't trust a bitch
Gas station gang, pull up, let them pumps hit, yeah
Trampoline gang, make a nigga truck flip
You a fuck nigga and your ho a fuck bitch 
I don't sprint, I don’t jog, but still manage to run shit 
Pops used to trap from the nighttime to the sunlight
Still know his plug, I can get it for that one price
Shout out to 600, we ain't gon' talk about that one night 
If we strapped and they strapped, it's a gunfight 
Real nigga school, you cannot enroll 
Hip-hop artist, bullet poppin', make you rock and roll
Boxin gloves on this K, it'll knock out your soul
You gon' think this bitch had clippers when it knock off your ’fro
Only nigga with a deal still coppin’ blow 
Where's 4G? He can hit that with his eyes closed 
Tee, you famous, what you still got that nine for?
’Cause rappers droppin', rest in peace XXXTENTACION 
Ayy, I'm the voice of all my prison niggas 
Them felonies don't mean shit, I made millions with ’em 
Fuck all that partyin' and bitches, come home, get your riches
If a nigga told, find his whereabouts and go and kill him 
I know where doggybone live, I should kill 'em 
They say I can't be with felons, but I'm with some 
Attempt murders, we don't do those 
Made your dog go to sleep with a suit on, ayy 
I could pass out blessings 
Lotta hundreds on me, I could pass out extras
Happy enough to pass out, I used to pass out testers
A nigga blow at me and miss, that's his pass to heaven 
I don't need no reference track, all this shit, I wrote it 
I could probably do a bid for most that shit I quoted 
Yeah, tell these fuck niggas it's still my moment 
Tell these fuck hoes it's still my moment, ah Gotta laugh to keep from crying, dawg
My mama locked but she strong
My pops got popped, now he gone
Lil' bro locked, told him hold on, oh

Driving a foreign like I'm tryna wreck

I ain't never comin' home, make sure you do it, my nigga
'Cause I been in here going through it, my nigga"
Cuz got killed showin' up unannounced so I don't do pop ups 
Unc' got killed smoking his weed so I don't do ganja 
Nigga run up on me too quick, I'ma lift that Glock up

Sometimes I wonder who gon' be here if he gone
Sometimes I ponder, I got so much on my dome

Sticks with the drums, they don't want no problem

You hate what I said on 'Win' but I can't lie in my songs
Tell the truth on all my audio, keep it real until he call me home
Where the fuck did all my niggas go when I needed them around?
I hope she don't have no baby on me, that might break me down
They ain't visit me upstate, no, so they ain't gon' visit my grave, no but
I remember sleepin' on the floor 
I remember being broke 
I know if all this money go 
I'm gon' look up like where everybody go? 
I remember sleepin' on the floor 
I lost everything but hope 
I know if all this money go 
I'm gon' look up like where everybody go 
I remember sleepin' on the floor 
I remember being broke 
I remember being broke 
Sleepin' on the floor 
I remember being broke
If all this money go
Damn where everybody go?
Damn where everybody go?Niggas prayin' on my downfall 
These niggas prayin' on my downfall
Straight up from the bleachers, but I'm a different creature
I bring shit to the table, I ain't fuckin' with no leechers 
Dope dick, oh shit, I gave my bitch a seizure 
Knew somethin' was weird when stepbro had a kitchen full of beakers
And he ain't no chem teacher 
I looked up to that nigga, then I looked up to the preacher, that's why a nigga be preachin' 
I can't fuck with people who ain't passionate, I'm adamant
If it's my plan, it's elaborate
Dropped out of State, but a nigga still done mastered it
If it's my shit, I'm smashin' it 
Your shit, I'm snatchin' it 
Holy Jesus, Lazarus
AI braids, so don't be talkin' 'bout no practice, bitch 
I done been around actors and activists
I can get money alone or collaborative
I can take a pic with a bad bitch and afterwards she a badder bitch, that's facts
Yeah, I went to Cody and Dixon 
Three dollars to my name, got a juice and a McChicken 
Call in some Coney, it's gon' be done in twenty minutes
Don't go up there without no strap, might have to bang it out with some niggas, wait, hold up
Went on Google, when I looked up your lyrics, they ain't have no meaning in 'em
Pourin' Actavis on my bullets, might have to lean a nigga
Yeah, she bad, but I can't wife her if she been seen with niggas
I'd rather stay broke and go chase with some greedy niggas
Like Mike dropped, I'm like, "I wish I was Lil Bow Wow"
Unc' like, "Never wish you was another nigga"
It ain't fuck these niggas, but fuck these niggas
Asked am I happy with this money? Bitch, I'm happy to be livin'
I was makin' a sandwich, they started shootin' through the kitchen
I got lower than a midget, bullets crashin' through them dishes
Ayy, I'm really from them trenches 
Nigga sneak diss me, then see me and ask for pictures
Ayy, man, these niggas bitches
If I don't do that real nigga shit, how they gon' see it?
All these other rappers killers or drippin' like greasy pizza 
All that shit smoke and mirrors, Arabic shisha 
Start talkin' to moon, God made me a different creature, ah
Remember when I almost gave up on this music shit? 
Highly favored, ayy, I really dodged a Boosie bid 
She see the Cuban, she gon' wanna get that coochie hit 
My chain got more fuckin' colors than a Coogi fit
Stay talkin' 'bout me, tell 'em tell you how I feel 
I thank God, he been workin' harder than the devil 
I'm a black rich felon with some hit records
Joy Road, what I been yellin', niggas been tellin' 
Care 'bout a lot, but I don't give a fuck 'bout what it cost 
You ain't gotta pay for nothin', bitch, you with a boss 
Just don't go over your budget, that's gon' piss me off
They wanna know my cologne, can't let 'em get the sauce
Love my hood, but you will never see me go there 
All that bein' a real nigga shit ain't get me nowhere 
You love your hood? Nigga, fuck your hood
See the world, go get a crib off the coast, live good
My whole hood got extinct over petty beef
Niggas I looked up to growing up, they deceased 
Wish they could have been here, damn, how I get here?
God saved me with the rap game, even though this shit weird 
Me and Shine, we put on for the crib
Call us DTE 'cause we cut on the lights around that bitch 
Fat ugly nigga get 'em wet like Pretty Ricky 
She gon' throw it back for a Moncler and 50-50s
On my mama, I was really in them trenches 
They ain't men, niggas bitches
On my mama, I was really in them trenches 
Ayy, they ain't men, nigga bitches, you hear me?Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city

The shit ain't new, it been chaotic since the them bombings
Trap out with that pistol nigga, do we have problem?
Welcome to Detroit, where one day it'll be quiet
The next day that body counter shoot up to a thousand
I grew up on Joy Road it's a lotta villains
How we gon' put them choppers down, these people tryna kill us
Cause they puttin' up prisons, stadium for the Pistons
Only thing niggas ain't puttin' up is the pistols
Crack and heroin, came to crash the whole system
Saw my cousin serve his momma, shit made me vicious
Detroit public schools ain't even teachin' the children
The ambulance takin' too long to reach the victims
Police doin' illegal raids in my whole section
Destroying black owned businesses by the second
My city took a hit, construction to repair the damage
This ain't the time to be weak, we gotta stick together
Is you gon' get a weapon or go get a reverend
I remember talkin' to my granddaddy
He said Detroit ain't been the same since '67
If it wasn't for that it prolly be some money in my family
How the fuck you think that make me feel
If anybody doubt that what I'm sayin' real
Type Detroit versus Baltimore, 1967
They postponed the game they ain't want their players killed
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, nigga
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's
Ain't no love in my city, blood on my city
Shell from them slugs in my city, hol' up
They wanna take the guns out the city
All them boys got too many
Try to make us be a victim, they gon' riot like the 60's
A violent public disorder
These boys on fire and they ain't want no water
You call it protocol, that shit really torture
They see us livin' and we gettin' it they tryna destroy it
Disturbance in Detroit, Michigan
Let us live in peace or we tearing up this bitch again

And we ready to show our strength
Cause ain't no love in my city
Too much blood on my city

Your struggle made you strong and you don't owe a soul
'Cause my pockets was empty, baby, ask them to put me in position, save me 
But them niggas ain't listen, caught my case, got sent to prison 
I sat back, worked on my vision, that's the shit that made me
Couldn't wait 'til I got me a bag, couldn't wait 'til I got me a bag
Couldn't wait 'til I got in my bag, couldn't wait 'til I got in my bag

Couldn't wait to see her with that bag
Couldn't wait 'til she got in her bag
Rest in peace to the man who raised me
Saw him dead and now I'm crazy
He had a heart attack, I miss him
Almost took it out on some niggas
Caught a case before I did it
That's probably what saved me
I had a lot on my plate
I ain't had shit in my stomach
I just need an opportunity
Never asked niggas for nothing
You know they gave me nothing
You know how y'all ask us for something
I can't save niggas I'm only saving this money

Ain't nobody give you none

Ah
This winnin' shit's easy, all you gotta do is grind and pray 
If you ain't fuckin' found somebody else's time to waste
At the Rolls dealership like, "Hmm, I'm just gon' cop the Wraith"
Free my lil' bro, he 'posed to got it and got out the way 
Nigga, we don't get no sleep 'cause we be grindin' hard 
Bring the game to its knees, you know I'm tryin' hard 
I believe in the Constitution 
So you know I exercise my right to bear firearms
Ayy, and I don't owe a nigga shit, y'all can blow a nigga's dick
We got sticks in our bags, we shoot bags to the sticks
V called home from jail, it's a hundred for a 10th
Mark come home in 2020 so I set aside an M
You gon' hear a lot of shit about me
But I ain't clearin' up shit, you gon' believe what you believe
All my haters broke, drug dealers or no-name MCs 
Or a bitch who ate my dick and then got left up at the suite, hold up 
I don't take pictures with no guns 'cause they not for show
We ain't family, my nigga, stop callin' me "Bro" 
You would hate to see my face if I was still broke
Treat you like a stripper 'bout your jewelry, take it off slow 
Used to rob niggas, I'd run up on 'em with two Glocks
Like run that, before you meet my favorite rapper, 2Pac
50 shots on him so the Glizzy really a oowop
I got the dope, you got the money, we can do a swap 
Used to want a G-Shock, then the Patek came
Make sure your bitch was home at 12, it's a respect thing 
Heard niggas snatchin' chains, I ain't finna wrestle
Trippin' get your stupid ass lit up like the Patek bezel
So much dough, I had to bag it with a shovel
I'm the reason they put metal detectors in DPSs
Lou said if you get shot, you ain't gon' die if you don't panic
You ain't gon' die if you don't panic, hold up
That ho ain't cut me off for you, boy, I demoted her
I ain't tryna get to know you, ho, you know what's up
Hundred on my chopper 'cause that 30 don't shoot long enough
If you ain't a private client, your account don't hold enough 
Gang 'til the world go up in flames, I ain't switchin'
Presidential, ain't no tickin', chopper bust you down like our wrists
Glock got the .40 and I got the big four nickel
Don't make us separate your body from your spirit, ayy
This money ain't stop a nigga from bein' vicious
Alcohol on the shells, no DNA or no witness 
Grind hard 'cause I still remember them evictions
I owe Granny some plates, I used to chop up on her dishes 
Heavy checks, still trappin', call it rich hustlin' 
Tell these niggas gon' 'head with all that dick suckin' 
Heavy checks, still trappin', call it rich hustlin'
I don't know if niggas gay or what 'cause y'all be dick suckin' 
I got a rapper's baby mama playin' in my dreads 
Money off the music, still playin' with the meds 
Had to slow up on the 10, can't play with the feds 
I ain't trippin' on that shit, we ran up the bands
Real nigga, so I'm cool with my ex-bitch 
Stay fresh, keep some bands, I'm from the West, bitch 
We hit the club and make a mess, bitch 
Like free the real, keep the rest, bitch
Free the guys, man, you know we gon' hold this shit down

And it's back to ballin'
Come pick your boys up in that Bent' truck or somethin', ahAyy, thick white bitch, Iggy
Bust on her back, Ricky
Only tote Glocks, I'm picky
We'll make niggas get out of the city
Ay, hurt my thumb loadin' the K
Turned to a opp, they lead him astray
You know when I'm talking them killers obey
Like, "Go put that young nigga head on display"
Free my niggas, it ain't gon' be long
They ain't forget who ain't pick up the phone
Keep tryna diss me, he tryna get known
The corner gon' know you when we take your soul
I run with murderers, killers
Bitch get wet, rivers
Then get cut off, scissors
I speak the truth, scriptures
Big chopstick got wood, splinters
Don't see in the mirror that's a mixture
Got richer and bought me a Richard
I still give my hitman your picture 
These niggas broke, we fixed
You can shoot at my hoe but you know you gon' miss 
Look at these VVS, how these bitches hit
My wrist dripping like I done slitted this bitch
Jet on the way to Dominico
Lil' bitch threw me off, too much Silicon 
I bought the whip with the ceiling gone 
Countin' dead faces in the living room 
Ten bedrooms but I live alone 
Chops in this bitch, I ain't here alone
If I'm beefing with him, his family should cherish they time
'Cause he won't be here long
Y'all been beefing for a year long 
Ain't nobody died yet? 
I don't know what would  happen if a nigga snatch my chain
'Cause ain't nobody tried that
I run with murderers, killers
Bitch get wet, rivers
Then get cut off, scissors
I speak the truth, scriptures
Big chopstick got wood, splinters
Don't see in the mirror that's a mixture
Got richer and bought me a Richard

I don’t know how long I’ma last in this rap shit
So that deal money gotta invest it in this bag, bitch
Ayy, I wear that glizzy like it's fashion
A bitch know not to treat me like I'm average
Don’t take this bag if it's too much for you to manage
Only joke around the circle, don’t let niggas see you laughin'
Ayy, who you lil’ niggas talkin' to?
If you ain't my mans and we argue, I'm offin' you
If you hit my trenches with that chain, it's comin' off of you
I might buy your bitch a pair of Yeezy's, they comfortable
Turned my niggas into bosses, that’s what bosses do
Why you niggas askin' for my number? I don’t fuck with you
Got a nigga from Chicago, he got money too
But that boy'll still eat your chain like a Lunchable
Rollie on my wrist and it’s fully sprayed
Got these niggas pocket watchin', they like what he paid
Bitch bad like Beyonce, sippin' lemonade
With the D’usse they can't do me 'cause a nigga made
I know they praying on my downfall 
These niggas prayed on my downfall 
They still praying on your downfall 
I pour a deuce up like I'm John Wall Ayy man, to them young niggas, man
Everybody out there that's growin' up, that's kids
Don't try to grow up too fast, man
Enjoy your parents, enjoy your friends, enjoy your relatives while you got 'em
They ain't always gonna be livin', they ain't always gonna be with you, bro
Trust me
We started off stealin' bikes and playin' a game at the crib
Like ask your mama can I spend the night
Hittin' the mall, gettin' matchin' pair of Mikes
Gettin' girls' numbers was the highlight of our life
At school in the bathroom, goin' 30 seconds
Sittin' next to Robert, tryna copy off his answers
Around report card time, I was finessin' 
Like, "Granny, they ain't give 'em to the students, they gon' mail 'em" 
We was mad when the other got suspended
Like, "Damn, now I gotta be in school without my nigga"
Why they let us get our hands on them pistols?
Why we ain't get a book on all the shit that came with it
Why our peoples ain't tell us the government had an agenda?
Don't get a young nigga forever stranded in that system 
Wasn't thinkin', I was busy thinkin' 'bout a million 
Jasmine , Lay-Lay , Kayla  Britney 
Used to wear my uncle's clothes to the parties
I know these pants big as hell, but they Ed Hardys
Tay tapped me like, "Get ready, bro, I'm finna snatch these Cartis"
I think that's when all this shit got started
Next day, we standin' outside the apartment
On Chicago, when some niggas rolled up in a Charger 
Like, "Come up off them glasses 'fore we start sparkin'"
All I remember is gunshots and dogs barkin'
Bruh like, "That's them 7 Mile niggas," so that's our target
Next day we on 7 Mile and Ferguson with five .40s
Tell his mama her baby gettin' aborted
No statute of limitations, so I gotta end that story
Put the gang on our shirts, you know what my mans claim
Terrorizin' shit, from Northland to Fairlane
Gettin' all the hoes at the high school games
Bunch of young niggas with some frames that'll go insane
Then that RICO Act came, that's when niggas changed
My day one niggas dead or stuck in that cage
My day ones that's out, they don't wanna change
But I got too much to lose, gotta go my way 
'Cause I remember when them people ran in my crib
Pointin' them SIGs, crazy how we went from babies to men
Q was 17 when they gave him his bid
Straight to the Pen, he get out, he gon' have great-grandkids
Send him money every month 'cause he ain't say what we did
Only thing he told 'em is we went from babies to men
Our transition was crazy... from babies 
We went from babies to men
Now I got my foot on niggas' necks and I ain't lettin' up
Five M's tucked, if I ain't do shit else, I ran it up
Ho give me a bottle, what I'm gon' do with a cup?
I put on for Detroit, I need me a free pair of Bucks
Bitch, we really run the city, go and ask about us
Niggas gettin' found without their head about us
I was 17, givin' niggas no passes
Unc' taught me how to shoot, we used to call it po' class Want to hear all their preachin', man, look
It's a difference between preaching and speaking from experience
We the one's movin' around them trenches man 
I got them niggas woke, man 
I give them niggas hope, man 
Make sure you tell them 
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , pray up 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope 
We live in the days where niggas do shit
Without even thinkin' about it 
But who am I to talk?
Blew 50k without thinkin' about it 
Beefin' wit' niggas about shit so stupid
We shouldn't be beefin' about it
If you in high school, I encourage you
Go try to make it to college 
Got niggas in prison
Your body locked up, don't let your mind be
Daydream, make a plan, write it out
Don't forget that your mind free
Don't let that wasted time be a waste of time
That's how niggas get back in chains
Bro only 5'8" but he run up and bang on you like he 'Bron James
Fuckin' up the money, steady buyin' chains 
But this what I wanted
Bust down Rollie, AP, shit feel good and look good, don't it?
I got the ball, got hit, fumbled
Picked it back up, scored six on 'em
Did a field goal with the Louis kicks on 'em
Said I would lose, got the win on 'em like
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , pray up 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope 
I'm in the trenches 
I give 'em hope 
I get 'em books 
I get 'em coats 
They fuck with the kid 
I'm the adult
Bitch, I'm the father figure, nigga, the coach
Fuck a result, I want revolt
You want the bow ties, well you need a cosign
And I'm at your bowtie since you let Bettie Jones die
Gotta go hit up COPA, then I go hit the folks 
Then I go hit up Sosa, gotta hitcha from both sides
Get the Zulu and Xhosa and I gotta ride shotgun
Ain't no fun when you ghost ride, tell the mayor I'm gon' slide
And the city my copilot, nothin' but a lil' more mileage
You don't want the type of smoke I lift 
Shake this bitch open with both eyelids
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , wake up, pray up , stay up
Wake up , pray up 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope 
Motivate the trenches 
We got 'em woke 
Street niggas winnin' 
We give 'em hope , uh

Hate my opps so much, I should go get 'em dug up 
Don't fuck on broke bitches no more, baby, I'm stuck-up 
Up that chopper on my brother, I don't trust nothin', wait, wait
Nigga killed my auntie, let me live, boy, you foolish
When you die and go meet her, she gon' tell you you stupid
If these pussies got a problem, you know I got a solution
We gon' do it like math, subtract everybody included
I like fuckin' bitches soon as we meet
Only street nigga from the D made more money than me was Meech
First one go touch a hundred without goin' to jail is me
Only nigga with a song hard as "First Day Out" is Meek
Boy, you sweet

How you gon' get ahead, you keep runnin' off on niggas?
I got 'em sick like I had a cold and coughed on niggas
I'm the same nigga from Joy Road with them dreads, yeah, them locks 
When I was 'round, they stayed in 'cause the clip curled on the chop 
We'll air you out, we'll tear you down, no flyin' up this block
I'ma bust it down into rocks, then go bust down me a watch, niggaOoh, ooh, ooh
Ay, my heroes weren't Batman and Superman and Spiderman, bro

If I pick my money up, I might as well deaD lift
Caught your brother on a killer, now he dead, bitch

She hit me like, "Why, you ain't answer?"
'Cause I'm with my bitch, ho, text me

Styrofoam cup and that's Codeine infested
Drinkin' the syrup like I'm under the weather

Condo in LA, it's gettin' developed 
She woke up, she ate me for breakfast 
Boy, who you talking to? Don't get embarrassed

Don't make us get on that car, we gon' air it
We live by that gang, and that beef, we inherit
Ooh, ooh, them niggas robbed you because you let 'em
Ooh, ooh, I got twenty choppas, I feel like Tip Harris
My shit authentic, their shit generic
I'm the founder, I'm not your chairman
Don't play with the Boogieman, shit'll get scary
And I'ma be quiet like this a library
I send them killers to get 'em, I flip 'em
When they pull up, you know they gon' rip 'em
Soon as he gone, his niggas gon' miss him
After a month, them boys gon' forget him
Ay, if he got bitches, they better kiss him 
Ay, 'cause this' they last lil' couple days with him
I go throw with that K in a Sprinter
Put on my jewelry, it feel like the winter
Bitch, I'm a boss, refer to me as mister
Get it from the bank, printer down, I'ma kill him
My bitch bad, don't need no filter
Every time I hit her gotta leave kids in her
Chanel boy bag, gotta get in my Floyd bag
At the clearport, on jets where we deploy at 
At the traphouse, that's where I was employed at 
But I don't glorify that life, I didn't enjoy that
But I don't glorify that life, I didn't enjoy that
But I don't glorify that life 
No, I don't glorify that life 
We at the clearport, got a flight

Trump got a billion, tell 'em don't forget 'bout lil' bro 'nem
Don't forget about the people that was livin' check to check
Say a prayer for the ones that's in need, but they got debt

Moving fast I was dumb
Doing everything under the sun

To the pain inside I was numb
Got myself together, thank you for what I've become
Send Jesus for my sins, I know I committed a ton
Father can you help me with all my heart break
Hope you have a place for my love ones you took away
Should've died so many times but you sat me in that cage
Got me on this path, now Father help me stay
Let me give my testimony 
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
Let me give my testimony 
Let me start off by saying you never turned your back on me
I seen so many things when I was coming up
Money, sex, death, drugs
For some crazy reason you kept me from going corrupt
Things I thought wouldn't matter you showed me it was enough
Saw my mama get life in the feds, saw my daddy dead
Nothing hurted worse even though I know they made they bed
You told me stop worrying and turned to you instead
And if I gave you my life, I'll be with him again
So let me, give my testimony

House up on the hills, gotta rock climb to get in
It ain't one nigga I can call and borrow a band

Yeah, we can do that debit and that credit talk
Tell your mans face to face 'fore I blow his expression off

Ain't 'bout to get me big mad about some lil' shit
I came from white squares, scorpions in the middle bitch
White drop top horses in the middle bitch

Throw them handcuffs on me, drag me out my bed
Nigga playin' with my paper I'ma give him lead
You ever catch a nigga with it, bitch, I'm goin' fed
22 summers straight, bitch I'm gettin' bread
Bottom of the pyrex, spread it like some butter

When I finally got my shine, niggas felt it 
Got yo bitch in the Benz, pussy melt 
Hold up, spread that money out, we can't be selfish 
Playin' like spades, get a nigga and his partner dealt with
They said we only fucked up once, Tee left us on stuck 
How many chances niggas want? You niggas grown as fuck 
We gon' be forever straight with god, we gon' forever live
Niggas had what I had, but I did shit they never did
White on white AP gon' make that bitch fuck, while she celibate
Draco will go through an elephant and kill whatever's hit
Niggas that was up ain't come around the hood 
Got rich young, retire early, got your timin' good 
Older niggas told me get it and stay out the hood 
But I chose to motivate the streets, push Bentleys around the hood
Time

And watchin' my words
I got insurance, no warrants
He pointin' his gun like he wanna blow it
Tell me why we gotta die
He went for his wallet, reached for a gun
You think that's some shit he'd try? On a cop?
He can't breathe and you still chokin' him, man, why would he lie?
Your knee in his neck, you ain't gotta do all that
It's one against five
RIP
Mister Officer , Mister Officer

Crazy part about it, it only happen to us 
They brought us here against our will, now they ain't happy with us 
That's crazy

Haha , ayy
Talkin' to my mama on the video visit 
She sittin' in the feds from the way she was livin'
Bro sentence, 'cause niggas couldn't take a conviction
They ain't like us, damn, I wish you paid attention, my nigga
Saleem callin' like, "I need to make a hit"
Shooter callin' like, "I'm broke nigga, I need to take a hit"
I'm like, "It ain't no threats, it ain't nobody to get"
He like, "Let me go get one of them niggas that's talkin' shit," ayy

You can do it bro, you just gotta believe 
Look what I achieved, nigga why you sleep?
Pray that you succeed, then go get where you gotta be 
I remember seein' cars like, "I want that" 
JR called with them licks and we was on that 
Niggas all in my face 'cause money around
Probably'll stop pickin' up my phone if I blow that 
It's a blessing that I know that , ayy
And I thank God that he showed that 
Niggas tried to bring me down, they got no cash
They ho ass, that's why I got far away from they broke ass 
This money comin' in crazy, let's toast to that 
And it's all legal, we can close the trap 
When you givin' back and showin' love then you know you lit
When your bitch sister wanna fuck, nigga you know you rich

, nigga, ah Because when I was out here robbin'
You wasn't there, you wasn't there
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you
To come around and be a part of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true"
Only wanna help me because it can help you
It's sunny now but don't forget that it can rain 
Bitch, I still got my rain boots from back in the day 
Before the rap, before the plaques, before the steak 
I was starvin', me and bro had to split a fish filet
I can't take no breaks, wait
Mar Mar was stuck in a hole, I wish I knew what was wrong
I got money on my phone, I can't wait 'til you come home
Stayed in my bed for a week, when I found out Tracy was gone 
Me and them niggas was close, I bet you don't even know
Them niggas done change on me
'Lot of shit got blamed on me 
Wonder why these shades on me
So you can't see the pain on me
'Cause when I was out here robbin' 
You wasn't there, you wasn't there 
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you 
To come around and be apart of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true" 
Only wanna help me  because it can help you
I lost it all , then got it right back
Matter fact I got more than I had, my nigga 
When you speakin' on my situation make sure you don't leave out the facts
You know this shit way deeper than rap, my nigga 
Wonder why I keep toasters, nigga, wonder why I stay focused, nigga
Niggas changed up overnight so I can't get close to niggas
And they wonder why I'm antisocial, nigga
Huh? 'Cause they don't understand me
My niggas , these ho's , even my family
Changed on me, 'lot of shit got blamed on me
Reason why these shades on me
So they can't see this pain on me
'Cause when I was out here robbin'
You wasn't there, you wasn't there 
And when I was out here starvin'
You didn't care, you didn't care
So why do you think it's fair for you
To come around and be apart of what I do
I can tell you niggas, "Love ain't true"
Only wanna help me because it can help you 
I done had some niggas change on me
'Lot of shit got blamed on me
Wonder why these shades on me
So they can't see the pain on me
'Cause when I was out here robbin' 
And when I was out here starvin' 
When I was out here robbin' 
When niggas was just targets 
You was not there , you did not care 
Niggas be scared , don't shoot in the air 
We be out here lurkin', niggas ain't nowhere 
Karma gon' come back, tell her I'm prepared
'Cause when I was out here-It's a movie in this bitch, I got that Uzi in this bitch
You know I'm truly with the shits, nigga
Ayy, long black AR, I call it big nigga 
Take a rapper his CD back, I can't get jiggy 
They gon' think I'm beatin' you up, look, baby, stop screamin' 
I just blew two-hundred K, I could've dropped Demon 
Dropped my first song years ago, it still ain't stop streamin' 
Tell them niggas "Stop talkin'" 'fore they stop breathin'
You see everybody starin' when I pass , that's 'cause I'm in the Lamb' 
Two K for some pants, ayy, chopper with a stand 
Do you still got the money? Fuck what you done had 
Livin' in the mansion, niggas livin' in the past
Turned the penthouse in Hollywood to a trap-spot
Big MAC, no laptops, white diamonds, black Glocks
Dick suckin' ass, nigga, fuck is you a mascot?
Ten Louis slippers like I been playin' in the sandbox
Rest in peace my babies, damn, I wish my boys could see me now
Big Grizzley chain on my neck, pointers beatin' out
You ain't tryna deepthroat, what you speakin' for? You tweakin', thot
I can't take no shower with my bitch, the water be too hot
I spy with my little eye 
Thirty racks on me as we speakin', I'm so fly 
Private jet whenever the fuck I want, mom, I can fly 
But them prices way too high, so I'm on Delta with the guys 
Only thing I hate about them airports is the lines
And them dirty ass dogs fuckin' up my dripper-thon 
They gon' give me TSA 'cause I done did some time
Why y'all treatin' me like Saddam, fuck, y'all think I got a bomb? 
Did a European tour, but I ain't see a stage 
Bro said I gotta start puttin' that shit on my page 
I say you gotta take it in, nigga, put your phone down
Just don't put that chrome down, they want our brains blown out 
And you know that that shit ain't gon' happen 
Can't fall off, too balanced 
My one AP, two Pateks 
You can't hold me, I'm too savage
Got a girlfriend at twelve, granny told me I'm too menace
Ayy, snuck her in the basement, fucked that lil' bitch on the pallet
Run that dope, nigga , on these broke niggas 
On these joke niggas , on these ho niggas 
You a freak bitch , you a weak bitch 
You a cheap bitch , ain't shit sweet, bitch? 
I spy with my little eye 
Thirty racks on me as we speakin', I'm so fly 
Private jet whenever the fuck I want, mom, I can fly 
But them prices way too high, so I'm on Delta with the guys 
Don't like hoes, I like bitches, get these hoes out 
Don't like hoes, I like bitches, put these hoes out 
I'm in the hot tub , get some cold mouth
Kings Garden THC, shit got me zoned out
Woah, got me zoned out
Kings Garden THC, shit got me zoned out
Right here, got me zoned out
Let me get it together
Run that dope, nigga , on these broke niggas 
On these joke niggas , on these ho niggas 
You a freak bitch , you a weak bitch 
You a cheap bitch , ain't shit sweet, bitch? 
Ayy, ayy
I spy with my little eye 
Thirty racks on me as we speakin', I'm so fly 
Private jet whenever the fuck I want, mom, I can fly 
But them prices way too high, so I'm on Delta with the guys 
And some hoes too , and some poles too 
We got that low too , better do what I told you 
Tell the truth everytime I get on Pro Tools , nigga
GangYeah yeah
Oh yeah 
Talk to 'em
I 
I been hustlin' 
I'm just tryna find my way out 
Because I-I, can't stay off of them streets 
And no one's doin' nothin' for me 
So what to do, when everything goes wrong? 
Know until I get this money, I can't go home 
I 
I been hustlin' 
I'm just tryna find my way out 
Because I-I, can't stay off of them streets 
And no one's doin' nothin' for me 
Ayy, in the freezing cold with these glass tubes 
Thankin' God for this L wool 
Winter time, ceiling gone, chinchilla on
Nigga I remember when the hoodie was my winter coat 
Letter from my mama, told me leave them streets alone 
She would tell DTE to leave the heat alone 
Livin' backwards 'cause I'm tryna keep heat in my home
But the streets cold so I could never leave the heat at home 
Pops said these streets don't love you
These streets gon' judge you, they'll eat you alive, my nigga 
So when I got locked up , and I ain't hear from you 
Don't trip, I wasn't even surprised, my nigga 
If you get killed, these streets won't miss you 
These streets'll forget you, they'll eat you alive, my nigga 
So when Pops got killed , and you ain't hit the funeral 
You know I wasn't even surprised, my nigga 
Cuz tryna get that time back, them bitches overdid it 
When we catch the nigga that ratted, we gon' overkill him 
From overlooked to overbook, niggas thought I was finished 
Can't handle that bag, don't take it, my nigga, know your limits 
Before you jump into some shit, you gotta know what's in it
You gon' get money, but you gotta assess what you riskin' 
If you get it all off, you gon' make a million
If you get caught, you gon' get out of prison when you 60 
So ask yourself what you gon' do 
Don't wanna get a job, you think you too cool 
But them niggas with the jobs 
Is the ones who get to raise they kids, watch 'em graduate from school 
My people see me with them M's, livin' good
To us, that's like seein' a mansion in the hood 
It's niggas that I love but I had to shake
Save everybody, bro I wish I could, but I can't, nigga
I , I was hustlin' 
I done finally found my way out 
Because I could not stay off of them streets 
I didn't expect no one to go and do some shit for me

But I knew until I got that money, I couldn't go home, yeah

Chopsquad DJ on this banger!
I used to put licks on a floor 
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow 
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own 
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own 
When I'm talkin' I got the flow, my first four-five was a Colt
A hoodie used to be my winter coat, now it's thirty-five hundred for the coat
Only gettin' worn once, bitch, I'm gettin' bored, fuck
Used to line licks, give a fuck if it's a hot, don't put the sticks up
Aye, used to hit licks with my uncle, he was older than me
Broke in my mans crib for the PS3, he ain't know it was me
That same friend got a heart problem, may he rest in peace
Had a heart attack, died in his bed, they thought he was sleep
Aye, Summer school, fifth grade, had real bad grades
My mans with the heart problem always came, didn't even have to, nigga got straight A's
In the joint had to gamble to eat, every morning I would play Spades
Niggas used to ball in my face
So I put them niggas on a flow 
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow 
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own 
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own 
In High School got broke-up with, because I went broke
But wasn't no licks on the floor, couldn't even go take my bitch to the show
Now I get 50 a show, and she in my DM right now
She probably don't know that I saw it 'cause I ain't accept, I declined
Shout out to Rudy, that was my guy
Wore his Buffs to prom, I was shocked when he got that time
He probably shocked cause I'm sittin' on top
Niggas tried to sign me for twenty-five hundred, like that was some money
Crazy part is that I almost did it, I was fucked up, fuck it
Four words to my fans, wake up get money
If you ever get rich, you got blessed, you ain't get lucky
No weapon formed against me shall prosper, can't shit touch me
When I finally get married, can't no other bitch fuck me!
I used to put licks on a floor 
Now I get paid every time I kick a flow 
Flexin' with my cousin money, I ain't had my own 
Now I forgot how many bank accounts I own Gotta watch my back because that bag is enormous
Please don't run up on me, I will have your family mourning, family mourning
I done came through in a million dollar foreign
Yeah, yeah, yeah, ayy
The safe out of space, like the roof on the Wraith, yeah
House got a view with a lake, might go canoeing today, yeah
I can sit back for a month off what I do in a day, yeah
Jump out the whip, then come off the waist
Call the plumber, I done flooded the face
What kind of trick is that?
I’m in the Lambo', the Urus
Came from nothin', I’m touring in Europe
Look at God, granny be catchin' no cure
Don't fuck with these niggas, no sir

Diamonds dance like you got served
I'm up in Gucci, 10K to the clerk
And the roof missing no AMBER Alert, ah
I done came through in a million dollar foreign
Had to call that bitch an UberX 'cause she was boring
I'm a felon so I might not make it through the border
If they made a movie 'bout my life, it would be horror
I came through, did a show, and made a hundred
Gotta change my ways, I was wrong for bringin’ that gun in
But I done seen some shit that made me sick to my stomach
Seen so many meet they demise, I learned from it
Yeah, niggas don’t want no static, yeah
Still got a few bad habits, yeah
Used to sleep on palletes
Now this Benz I got 4Matic 
Sixty dollar salads 
With the crab legs, bring me a mallet
My niggas like animals, they won't trip if you don’t panic, ayy
Bring me another round
What they gon' say to us now?
When I got that bag, felt like the game went and touched down
Went from bus stop to bustdown 
Bust bands, used to bust rounds
I'm the big dawg, sit the fuck down
Bitch ain't fuckin’, why you come around?
Free my niggas, RIP my niggas
I be poppin' pills for the pain, nigga
Why you talkin' loud? You insane, nigga
Leave you in the street with your brain drippin'
Run into your mans and do the same, nigga
I'll show you boys how to tame niggas, yeah, ayy 
Heart of a thug, baby 
Probably get to the plug, baby 
You gotta stop ridin' 
I'm 'bout to cum, baby
They don't get far 'cause niggas dumb, baby
Want a walk-through, nigga run eighty
I'm a chance master, niggas can't play me
Good defense, niggas can't take me, ah-hah
Ah
And I came through in a million dollar foreign
Had to call that bitch an UberX 'cause she was boring
I'm a felon so I might not make it through the border
If they made a movie 'bout my life, it would be horror
I came through, did a show, and made a hundred
Gotta change my ways, I was wrong for bringin' that gun in
I done seen some shit that made me sick to my stomach
Seen so many meet they demise, I learned from it
I done came through in a million dollar foreign
Had to call that bitch an UberX 'cause she was boring
I'm a felon so I might not make it through the border
If they made a movie 'bout my life, it would be horror

Gotta change my ways, I was wrong for bringin' that gun in
But I done seen some shit that made me sick to my stomach
Seen so many meet they demise, I learned from it
(Gang, gang
I learned from it)I really don't even need to hear certain shit, like
Really, you ain't gotta say nothing, just when you with me
Just play your role, that's all I ask, know what I'm saying?
Swear that's why I'm straight on hoes
I got feelings, I can't let these bitches play with those
Ain't gotta tell me that you love me, just play your role
I know you got other niggas just like I got other bitches
But do like me and text 'em later on
Caught a bad one, I call her Ruby with the booty
She ain't even know me but she treat me like she knew me
Told me that she loved me, I believed her like a goofy
I can't put my heart in bitches' hands, that shit spooky
Dear Ruby, sincerely yours, from Grizzley
Fuck you and any other bitch that I think iffy
I see you on the 'Gram and you don't even feel guilty
I know I'm still living but that shit you did killed me
You texting niggas, I look at you like an opp
Like, what you tryna get from them that I ain't got 
I should've left you in the room like a thot 
Ain't even hit you from the back, I got on top
That's why I'm straight on hoes
I got feelings, I can't let these bitches play with those
Ain't gotta tell me that you love me, just play your role
I know you got other niggas just like I got other bitches
But do like me and text 'em later on
Diamonds clear, days cloudy, heart so chilly

High school days used to have niggas runnin' from me
Shoes Italian, whip German
Pockets on , no Sherman
Street niggas gettin' chased like surgeons
Everything foreign down to my Balenciagas
My hoe from Europe
Draco wit' that blue light from Wakanda
Tell them boys that I want yo' top, better not let them spot you
In the trap house dressed like a whole cop, .45 wit' the binoculars
 street no thermos
Thirty hangin' out no curfew
In the Maybach, closed curtains
Y'all niggas clowns, no circus
Say my name, they merkin'
She know I'm showin' up, she fuckin'

When I go on stage I'm in Givenchy drip
Come back to the trenches, I take off that pretty shit
Probably in my Dickies fit
Hair trigger, don't hit my hip
I'm motivation for the 'Gram, might up a fifty strip
And that Bentley truck so big, I might hit her in the whip
She got up out my bed and left to Philly for a trip
That ain't the only thing she left, that bitch left hickies on my dick
Free Meek Milly, niggas can't even pop no wheelies 'round this bitch
If I drove to your city, I got all sticks
I'm a grizzly but I be wit' all pits
Yo' bitch ain't see no money, she got all dick
When she asked me for a bag, I told her, "Naw, bitch!"
And my niggas on the east side all rich
Ain't sittin' in no trap, they take them long trips
You a turnaround and come back wit' that dog shit
No finessin', we would nail you to the cross quick
Ridin' in this motherfuckin' Hellcat
If I catch a opp he gettin' his head wet
Rest in peace pops, I need my mans back
Math the only subject I ain't fail at

No Airbnb, I bought that cash
Dapper dan walk, that's vintage
Retired the streets, no pension
Back and forth in a race, no tennis
To my ex-hoes, no hard feelings
Paid for that Brazilian lift, now it look better when she twerk
I'm with the threesomes, you gon' get credit for participation, but you gotta work
Say her nigga ain't got cash, here go a ten, go get you a purse
Street niggas for the win, it look better when we first
Hundred racks in that Goyard, bitch, I want both of y'all
They kicked our door in, we already sold it all
I left her soul scarred, tryna race like go-karts
Can't go back broke, dawg, my life was so hard
Fuck with a boss, I don't just talk
Baby, I walk it but I don't ever walk
My niggas out buyin' foreigns in bulk

She just wanna be free 
For a nigga like me

She let me bust up her back
Showed her my hood, we ridin' around, I got her clutchin' the strap
If some niggas run down, don't duck down, bitch, bust on 'em back
Gave her some racks to go to Miami, she came back, her stomach was flat 
I get on stage far and flat, get off to hundreds of racks 
My chain hit in the dark 
She wanna fuck in the car 
Let me put the Bentley in park 
This ain't Baby Boy
Play like you got hard, niggas gon' rip you apart
These niggas called me two animals
Like, "That nigga Grizzley a shark" 
Amiri jeans on cost me seventeen hundred 
Only bought 'em 'cause they go with these Balenci runners 
Really ballin', niggas know I'm on they neck stompin' 
Wintertime grind, see you niggas next summer 
See you niggas muggin', man, that shit don't mean nothin'

Last thing on my mind is these pussy boys
Last thing you would see me chasing is some pussy, boy
In the club in the back, 30 in my hoodie, boy
This bitch sound like "grrah," this bitch a fully, boy
Jackin' off my pockets trynna make this money come
I was young walkin' to the store for just a honey bun
Then going to the trap, seeing unc' that was on the run
With a hundred drum, rest in peace, he was a one of one
Beating niggas up for lil' bro, you better not fuck with him
Granny took my BB gun, she ain't know I had another one
Walked to the dollar store and got my little brother one
He took it to school, I'm like, "Bro, why is you so fucking dumb?"
'Cause he got caught with it
But I took that on the chin 'cause we was taught different
I ain't never sold my soul but I bought niggas
I know niggas that ain't played basketball but they cross niggas, ayy
We ain't wanted to be known, we just wanted to be on
Thought the industry was full of real niggas, I was wrong
They was tryna get the throne, we was tryna get the gold
We was chasing down our goals, they was chasing down the hoes
Nigga, it's where they at, where they at?
Niggas talking 'bout reach back, if I reach back, you gon' get slapped
With a stack on your head, now you whacked
Got that MAC on my lap, fully of lead, ratatat
Talking to some young niggas, juvenile where they at
Like, don't look up to these niggas, man, these niggas full of cap
Talking to some other young niggas, prison where they at
Stay solid, never rat, the real always make it back nigga
Make sure that shit you say reflect on how you act
Make sure you ain't never content with where you at
You ain't gon' rich if you don't learn how to stack
Just listen to me, you gon' pass 'em up like that, ayy
Quit hanging 'round them niggas, tell 'em you'll be right back
Just listen to me, you gon' pass them niggas up like that
Quit hanging 'round them niggas, tell 'em you'll be right back

Just how I feel type shit
Been wanting to get this off my mind for a long-ass time 
Wendy's chicken sandwich fuckin' over Popeyes 
Lot of extras in my clip like fries at Five Guys
Neck on Dairy Queen, my wrist on Häagen-Dazs 
My girl colder than the shit they sell at Coldstone 
Every time she let me hit, I make her soul go 
Brody sellin' gas like the Chevron, Sunoco
The BP, I'm from the West, but I'm good Deep East 
The semi transform to a fully, Decepticon 
Reach for my gold, I kill everybody, I'm leprechaun
Free them real niggas, fuck them ho niggas who testified
Tellin' shit the police ain't ask, got 'em some extra time 
They want a picture of my city, let me paint it 
It's so hard to make it out, but we gon' make it 
We want the best shit, we can't do nothin' basic
It's a Detroit nigga everywhere I go, that shit amazing 
Let's talk about the people and the shit they be sayin'
Some people love me so much, you would think we related
Some people hate me so much, you would think we wasn't related
Niggas salty 'cause the bitches they in love with ate it, ayy
Like some chicken, but they didn't put no hot sauce on it 
And I dropped them hoes off after they hopped up off it 
I probably dropped a couple dollars on 'em 
And I be talkin' so much shit, I probably dropped some knowledge on 'em
Like somebody prayin' for me, gotta be my sweet grandma 
Old soul, I could fuck a nigga's mean grandma 
I come from where it's snow, but I ain't never seen Santa
I just seen a lot of niggas get popped like peach Fantas 
You ain't never been through shit, you tryna find some clout 
I'll drop your bro and give you somethin' to rap about 
Before a studio, we had to trap it out 
At a club in the slums with that ratchet out 
A young dog, so ambitious, but ain't got no goals 
He get some money for some clothes, he tryna buy some poles 
Touched a lot of dead hands, all of 'em was cold
With a lot of makeup on they face so you can't see the holes
They want a picture of my city, let me paint it 
It's so hard to make it out, but we gon' make it
We want the best shit, we can't do nothin' basic
It's a Detroit nigga everywhere I go, that shit amazing

He a big dog now, you know young dog eat 
He got some money, now they thinkin' that young dog sweet 
I know for a fact he ain't, 'cause young dog me 
Yeah, I went from Lil T to Big Unky 
My uncle turned into a bitch, now he my auntie

Meet with my plug and cash him out, that nigga don't front me 
But you ain't never been through shit, you tryna find some clout 
I'll drop your brother, give you somethin' to rap about 
Before a studio, we had to trap it out

Ayy, where I'm from gotta clutch your heater
Grew up so fast I could've fucked my teacher 
Killers 'round me, but I gotta strap myself 'cuz I don't trust them either
Sometimes yo' people ain't yo' people, you hear me?

You play with me, them killers split your wig
But I'ma tell them niggas
Gotta ride with them sticks
Screaming, "Fuck the opposite"
The streets gon' talk 'bout what they hear
The streets, they took a lot of tears
Don't bring my ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring yo' ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring my ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring yo' ratchet ass up in here
Niggas to comfortable
Niggas finesse it, they fuck with you
I take the Xanny to substitute
All of the Percies I threw up, yeah, yeah, yeah, niggas too gullible
Chain one color, not colorful
My niggas don't fuck with you
When you hot, she gon' suck on you
I dropped my lean, I'm hella full
Call up my brother to bring a pint
Bitches be wanting to get clout off you, bitch ain't tryna fight
Cuban link dynamite, they shine without a light
You touch, you die tonight, my killers on dynamite
Ridin' round in the city in a Bentley
Ridin' round in the city, gotta get it
Never should've gave my youngin' a Hemi
Ain't nobody go, go, go against me
Lean steady fuckin' up a nigga kidney
Bitches tryna fucking suck up on a nigga
Diamond whole carat
Clearport jetting
Don't copy this convo, parrot
In the trenches, terrace
Gettin' money a fetish
Drugs coming in 
Break it down and sell it
Put the bag in the rental
I am the plug, ain't no middle man
That fake talk out the window
Gotta ride with them sticks
Screaming, "Fuck the opposite"
The streets gon' talk 'bout what they hear
The streets they took a lot of tears
Don't bring my ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring yo' ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring my ratchet ass up in here
Don't bring yo' ratchet ass up in hereWe got London On Da Track
Them niggas driving slow, jump in a new lane 
This a Bentayga not a Mulsane 
No rachet bitches, , this my new gang 
Blew a nigga life savings on this coupe, damn
Get her back to the crib, she gon' open up 
That bitch told you she don't smoke, she right here rolling up )
She suck me off before we left, she ain't hold me up 
Since I already came, you can't go with us
Offset!
Smoking up biscotti, lungs open up
Jumping in that pussy like it's double dutch 
Drop a Tracy McGrady in my double cup 
Hit it with the fork, I beat it upper cut
 burn up on they knees 
Frost up in my AP, double it up with Patek Phillipe 
Murder while he sleep like Freddy Kruger, Elm Street 
Hundreds like I'm neat 
Fuck 'em by the three 
Pockets on Monique 
We got stripes like referees 
Shawty so petitie but suck the dick just like a leech 
Moonwalk on the bitch like Billie Jean, Chanel my feet 
My drip is unique hundreds what I seek
Perfect physique, I tape a brick off to your cheek 
Trapping out the bando, we got blow just like a leaf 
Chopper get to eating, biting, we gon' have a feast 
Golden ticket,  speak unless it's brief
Them niggas driving slow, jump in a new lane 
This a Bentayga not a Mulsane 
No rachet bitches, , this my new gang 
Blew a nigga life savings on this coupe, damn
Get her back to the crib, she gon' open up 
That bitch told you she don't smoke, she right here rolling up )
She suck me off before we left, she ain't hold me up 
Since I already came, you can't go with usAy man i feel like, i feel like fuck a hook man, fuck a chorus
Know what i'm sayin', we just gon' go, we in beast mode R.I.P. rock nigga
-
Ay, i told bro to have a safe trip
This shit we doin' you get retired off of 8 flips
So many numbers we get closed after days' shift
Y'all niggas play a lot, just don't play with this 
'Cause the AR gone' hit everything the "K" miss
Ain't got time to count this money, nigga weigh this
Superhero in these streets, i need a cape and shit
Save the nigga save money, never save the bitch
-
You just gotta quarter package came
This shit's so low you think it's fake
Bro say kill em', i say bro you think we ain't
Landlord in the earth and you can't stay nigga bwah
I can tell you why these bitches don't get bored with us
'Cause we litty and we do it Biggie like Notorious
Got some bad bitches from New York with us
Brand new diamond link it got more pointers than the Warriors
Y'all lil' niggas peasants
No money "B" cause y'all ain't got no principles or ethics
I call them killers and say 'Christmas'
They gone' light up some trees, then gift wrap 'em like a present
Lil' Baby have you ever seen a shootin' star?
Well you just did, i'ma shooter that turned to a star
Generation 5, givin' niggas bald fades
I'll hit your block and cut everybody like i got all spades
-
I don't know how long we been beefin'
But let's see how long the clip last
I'm a big nigga, i ain't got a six-pack
But she wanna ride all day, like she at Six Flags, zero cap
Still ridin' with them drums, we be in the slums
I'm a felon, if they flick us, bro hop out and run
I'ma tell 'em you owe child support, that's why you ran
I don't know why niggas play when they know how it's land
It ain't from the bottom of your heart, why you say it?
If you know that you ain't bout to hit your target, why you sprayin'?
Niggas be playin, my dog played me
I saw that shit comin' before it happened, That's So Raven
Did everything for niggas, they did everything but thank me
I was sittin' in that cell doin' everything but complaining
Accepted what came with it, before i did it
That's what separate me from these niggas, no cappin' these lyrics aye
I set your boots on fire like you run to fast
Niggas hot like fire cause i ran it up too fast
Y'all go broke on all that jewelry, we gone tuck this cash
Cut the lights off, if i see it i'ma cum too fast
We get ours, get out the way we don't be greedy for it
Made a million off that run, you ain't even know it
We don't wanna fuck your hoes, it's too easy for us
We ain't clickin' up with niggas, y'all too skeechy for us
Niggas in the streets know us, they don't play with us
What i think about your new chain, your jeweler play too much
They look at us like Office Max, nigga we paper'd up
We got cake like we got baker plugs Half a million on my neck, that's here nor there 
Niggas that been rappin’ look at me like that shit unfair 
Let that envy turn to action, boy I wouldn't dare 
We ain't aiming at your legs, we gon’ hit upstairs 
You ain't tryna get no money, man this shit a mess 
Seem like all these niggas care about is gettin' fresh
Bed on the jet, we ain't gotta lay no seat back
Nigga beat my ass, pop him, I don't want no rematch, no cap 
Brodie, bring me a magnum, them niggas straight pussy 
Gold Louis' on my feet, look like K bullets 
Lil' niggas better watch what y'all say to me
I’ll put them apes on niggas heads like some Bape hoodies 
I'm that same street nigga that used to swap hands
I ain’t a better person, bitch I still want my opps dead 
And I ain't gon' lie, I hit some bitches that was not lit 
If she a 6 and she was thick, she probably got hit 
Niggas say they run the city, got it fucked up 
Nigga, sit your ass down, shut the fuck up 
Go get your respect up, I’m ballin', tell them check up
You don't know how a M look, I'll shoot you from your neck up
We in back to back 488's, them all coupes 
Gave my young nigga a brick, told him that's all you 
We can't all rap, y'all gotta ball too 
You know this fresh up out the trap if ain't all blues
I'm a young nigga from the slums in a Bentayga 
Under 26, richer than the city Mayor 
Niggas want a plate but ain't wanna help set the table 
All these acres, nigga I ain't nowhere near the neighbors
And I ain't had no big features, or no big favors 
And if I did they ain't post it, look at how they played us 
I can see it in they face, them niggas feel threatened 
Since God first and family third, you know that money second 
In interviews, they like "Tee, why your name Grizzley?" 
I ain't give myself that title, I got that in prison 
I was overly aggressive, I was easily offended
When I ran up on niggas, they left the scene barely living 
Niggas say I fell off, I got some back ends say different
Could of bought a Ferrari how much I spent just on Amiri
Only human that scare me is that nigga in the mirror
He so tall and hairy but still could fuck the bitch you married nigga
Only thoroughbred niggas next to me 
Shout out to them niggas sleeping on me, rest in peace 
Man down, I ain't send no shooter, that was me 
Most underrated, just give it time, they gon' see
I'm puttin' God first, cause he came to my rescue
I put my family third, you know that money second
Because when I was broke, without no money, stressin'
Nobody felt that shit but me, nigga I made it happen
I'm puttin' God first, cause he came to the rescue
I put my family third, I put that money second
Cause back when I was broke, without no money, stressin'
Nobody felt that shit but me, nigga I made it happenAntt did the track
He might die today
How my lawyer feel, he might be the case
How that witness feel, he might have somethin' to say
Beatgang, ahh
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
These bows that I got stank up the building
Keep the clientele buildings
A lotto in a turkey bag, we not no pilgrims
We find a city then we milk it
, money to the ceiling
Got a brand new chop, you know I filled it
Brand new opp, you know I killed 'em
JB on the job, we got millions
Keep the chopsticks if I need Kidd-Gilchrist
Bust that brick open, let me see them flakes
Touch that nigga skin, he might be a snake
I like how that Benz feel, it might be a Wraith
Don't like how my Timbs feel, Ballys on today
I just got back off that road, I might go back today
And I get triple what I pay, I might come back with Wraith
Huh, like how your bitch feel, get her out my face
Hey, fuck how your kids feel, they daddy out the way
Hey I know that nigga lyin', just look at his face
My lawyer want a dime just to look at my case
Huh, your lawyer wanted ten, I gave mine a dub 
I just shot another nigga, might go on the run
Put my lil nigga on the road 'cause he old enough
Put your lil sister on the pole 'cause she cold enough
Got another sale, forty more just ain't gon' hold you up
Since Unky them got set up in the K, ain't shit slowed us up
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
God can you tell Flake that we still up
Niggas rappin' but we really had a pill run
Yeah we really had a pill run, yeah we really had a pill run
A hundred bands stashed under the mattress, had to have that shit
We hardly get a hold of that shit and try to bad kick
Fifty bow sale on the floor, make sure I bring my stick
Steppers on stand-by case the plug don't want to send that shit
Two-hundred grand cash in the roof of the Trailblazer
Get it to the crib, send it back about a day later
Try to plot on this and get you flushed like the radiator
Nigga don't you see this ice, I'm colder than refrigerator
They on the elevator, T, I got them bitches comin' up
We finna run 'em up, these young niggas, they can't fuck with us
Niggas tuckin' what? T got all his fuckin' chains on
I blow his brains out, I catch him slippin' at his man's house
Caught that nigga slippin', we persistent, brought them K's out
Since that nigga T came out I promise you ain't seen no drought
Thirty bands in my joggys, bitch I'm talkin' right now
You don't get three tries, miss once and you gon' strike out
Ayy, I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
Sleepin' in the, I been sleepin' in the
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the Hilton
I been sleepin' in the trap like it's the HiltonWish a nigga ever would try
We gon' get his whole shirt tie dyed
He gon' have to know wassup with my side
He gon' have to take it up with my guys
You are not dealing with a nice guy
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
We ain't with that wishy washy shit
We wash the laundry
Whole time you know I'm on to ya
Whole time you know I'm on to ya
Whole time you know I'm on to ya
She gon' fuck for this co-sign and botox
Even though she yo' wife, she both ours
Cause she a freak, she do a lot of things
What you think when gave her diamond rings?
Mean cause we need a lot of rings
Flexin' like we won the lottery
Hatin' but you should be proud of me
You gon' make 'em put your name up on a tee
R.I.P
Wish a nigga ever would try
We gon' get his whole shirt tie dyed
He gon' have to know wassup with my side
He gon' have to take it up with my guys
You are not dealing with a nice guy
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
We ain't with that catchin' feelings shit
We catchin' bodies
Only gave that hoe some dick for christmas
She been naughty
Bottle on my left, you see the AP when I pour it
Gotta take his life policy on my ice, not insurance
Bad bitches in the penthouse going up
Pounds on the table that's gettin' sold
Aye don't roll that up
Drown that boat, don't throw it up
Don't be shy bitch open up
Gang, gang, gang, bitch throw it up
And they only gon' go for us
Lame niggas blow her phone up, they some terrorists
Lambo, Bentley, Rolls Royce truck, that's how we carry it
Aye, on everything, I hit the mall and I get everything
Did everything to that bitch and that's yo' everything
Wish a nigga ever would try
We gon' get his whole shirt tie dyed
He gon' have to know wassup with my side
He gon' have to take it up with my guys
You are not dealing with a nice guy
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry
Fuck it, let the champagne cry

        Why you still be in the hood like you ain't Sada Baby? 
I got plaques, why I still be going choppa crazy? 
Hey, why you in the hood like you ain't Grizzmo? 
Aye, why I still be in the trap gettin' biz tho? 
Huh, big gun, I can lean on it. 
Aye, lil' gun, got the beam on it. 
Aye, talk brazy put some g's on him. 
Aye, Buff's got foggy, let her breathe on 'em. 
Beef on the floor, we can manage that. 
Money on the floor, we gon' handle that. 
Broke jugga crazy, he can gon' have a scam attack. 
Kidnapped your daughter, bitch come get your family back
You only fuck if he got bands, I can't knock you back. 
We knock that nigga off, shit IDK. 
Uhh, was 'bout to go but then I heard he want some smoke. 
Uhh, was 'bout to skate but then brodie brung the Drake, uhh. 
Brodie brought that Drake, we ain't 'bout to play. 
Why he still out here like we ain't drop that paper? 
Bitch, two pistols on me now, you can die today.  
And this forty Fat Joe, might you rockaway 
Aye, pop a perky, got me out my body. 
She'll fuck me in a restaurant cuz she know I'm somebody. 
In front of everybody, I'm not just anybody. 
Hop out, run up, no accidental bodies. 
Her lil' sister gave the neck to me while I was drivin'. 
She said she did it cuz she never seen these kinds of diamonds. 
PGK chain, with the chop, we gon' drop somebody. 
Poppin' pills till it kill me, Skuba Phyllis Hyman. 
Chorus:
Sada, tell these niggas Google Phyllis Hyman. 
Shoutout to Phyllis, touch this chain and you gon' feel this cannon. 
Aye, fuck his bitch and I might Insta Snap it
And I might chew all on that pussy like it's ginger snappin'. 
I might up the strap on you because I'm feelin' savage. 
I can't give that boy no job, he can get a package. 
I don't want to buy yo strap because it's semimatic. 
I need a fully on you niggas, clip's long as grass
Bitch from Oakland, lookin' like I snatched her out a pageant. 
Fuck her, send her back, I got her feelings damaged. 
They act like they want smoke, tell them boys what's happenin.' 
Get it crackin, Sada in here, my bad, get it brackin.' 
We need to see the snakes Sada, cut the grass. 
Kill that nigga, throw his body in the trash. 
My name tatted on your baby momma real ass
I spent my last back end on her pill bag. 
This ain't no playground, bitch you can't slide around us. 
If I'm anywhere near it, then that fire 'round us. 
Huh, them niggas don't want smoke, they ain't no firefighters. 
Huh, throwin' up yo hood, you ain't gon' die about it. 
Throwin' up yo hood, you ain't gon' die about it. 
Find yo momma house and have them killers crowd around her. 
Might see yo son, daughter, we gon' fire bomb 'em. 
Bitch if I gotta do that, everybody droppin'
Chorus:
Sada, tell these niggas Google Phyllis Hyman
Shoutout to Phyllis, touch this chain and you gon' feel this cannon
Aye, fuck his bitch and I might Insta Snap it
And I might chew all on that pussy like it's ginger snappin'
I might up the strap on you because I'm feelin' savage. 
I can't give that boy no job, he can get a package. 
I don't want to buy yo strap because it's semimatic. 
I need a fully on you niggas, clip's long as grass
