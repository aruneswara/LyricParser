Invisible set, diamonds huggin' my piece
Book me for a show, I need eighty at least
I want the smoke, ain't no keepin' the peace
Keep me a razor when I'm in the East

Swear the change gon' hurt, but it really ain't a game 
Shawty like to twerk, I bring the rage 
Really get to trippin' on the stage

And the Bentley all white like a dove
I took off, ate this Xan, means it works
Kicked her out, told her walk to the burbs
I'm a sipper, can tell when it's cut
You can't tell me that she ain't a slut
Who you think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent
I'm scammin' a wood, my cup full of mud
I came out the hood
Sometimes a gangsta need a hug
I'ma give all my problems above
Hate when people keep doin' too much
Keep it real, the streets show you no love
I don't need no one vouchin' for me
I be flossin', ain't talkin' 'bout my teeth
Car push-start, I keep losin' the keys

Beverly Center, shoppin' spree on me
New agenda, don't do nothin' free
Ain't not one of my foreigns on E
All my bitches got expensive weave
I sip drank for my pain to get eased
I still talk to the Lord on my knees
Helpin' me take care all of my needs
And we take off the top for a breeze
Who you think you foolin'? We not new to it
We countin' fluent

Sometimes a gangsta need a hug

I blew a 50, 'cause I had a long day
When it come to money, I done came a long way
I fucked the bitch, but I can't go on a date
She sucked me loose, I put some nut on her face
Let her see the loft, she gotta fuck at my place
I'm steady bossin', bitch I'm havin' my way
Niggas in the trap, but can't get away
But I've been 'round the world, it feel like I'm tourin'
I’m livin' life, I swear I know your life borin'
Mama said don't stop, I gotta keep goin'
The house so big, the bedroom got an alarm
The necklace cost so much it came wit' a charm
The diamonds drippin' like the rain when it stormy
These niggas say that they lookin', well I'm finna' show 'em
So many acres it look like a farm
23 Million like I'm Michael Jordan
2 or 3 bitches, they wanna come join
Fuck all these bitches, I feel like a Don
I looked in the mirror, I know I'm the one
You ain't gonna shoot, but you carry a gun
Niggas act tough, don't want to bury your son

I want the racks, I gotta get mine
Stackin' it up, I work wit' a stride

Same price as the rent, that's the cost for the kicks
I'm stackin' up racks just to make a hit list
My nigga El Chapo' will chop off ya wrist
Pull up wit' them choppas, I know I won't miss
Some niggas get locked up, and turned to a snitch

I walked in Hermes, bought a bag for my boo 
I get them blue hundreds, spread them out like a wound 
Can't get you off my mind, I might die about you 
My outfit cost a dime, can't control how I move 
Give praises to the God, don't believe in voodoo 
'Cause when you at the top they'll tell lies about you 
Tell everything but the truth 
Get nothin' but love from my crew 
I guess they hate what you do 
Pull up in coupes with no roofs

Niggas pillowtalk, I really set talk, we'll shoot the whole place

It's my word , I done capped off bird
I done seen a nigga jump from a slab to a brick 
Cute pink toe, I bit her on the toes
I fuck her like a ho, I make a whole flick 
Proud of baby girl, she can take a whole dick 
She told me she was thirsty, started drinkin' my spit 
Ooh , you ain't never heard this

They been sendin' threats, but don't worry 
We hoppin' in a rental with a dirty stick 
They ain't give me my money, I'ma murder this bitch

Rental off the Rollie, just went way in the ditch 
Young Gunna not no playa 'bout these chips 
We really used to struggle now we paid, filthy rich 
A hundred K to hit your VIP 
R.I.P. to Nipsey, paved the way for the Crips 
Plus, I'm smokin' cookie, blow Biscotti by the zip

Ayy, money on the way 
All I see is hundreds all day 
Top chef, fish sautéed

Can't believe Cash's studio is covered in BAPE 
Fuck so much bitches, I should be in porn
Cost an arm and a leg just to see me perform 
Speakin' the truth 'cause I ain't good at lyin'
And I never play golf, but I still keep my iron
Call up some vibes, I got nothin' but dimes
And she gave me some brain, I got piece of her mind 
Pull up to functions, my name on the banner
Still walkin' through the back door with my hammer 
Told these lil' boys, they don't want no smoke
Had to aim for his legs, can't get caught on the camera
Got me a baddie, when she give me sloppy
She tie up her hair with a Gucci bandana
Come between me and my blues and get handled
I know me some dangerous Crips from Atlanta 
If I run into a problem with cake
I put pots on the stove and I whip up the batter 
Speak on my name, I'ma pull up on you
All your people gon' run when the shots start to splatter
Stayed on my grind and I been makin' noise
And I still find a way how to tune out the chatter
Catchin' yo' bitch is like catchin' the opps
I just pull out my dick and I shoot it right at her
Oh, they fresh out a coffin, don't know why they talkin'
Got power like Austin, they cap with a gown
These rappers is exhaustin', that ho shit gon' cost 'em

Come through in Forgee no shittin' and pissin'
Bitch I'm a shark, I swim with the fishes
I pray to the God, you know I'm committed
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in L.A
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case
I pour up a four and I go outer space
Can't go back and forth, ain't no time to debate
Real nigga shit and you cannot relate
I ain't got no feelings, I don't feel the fakes
I keep a Glock .40 on side of my waist
My plug get that work and it slip out of state
I pop me a perc and now I'm in a daze
I ain't got no pressure and I'm tired of waiting
I bought a big house that's surround with a gate
I moved out the hood, made sure momma straight
I'm still in the streets, cause shit can get deep
I gotta keep Meech, Chanel on my feet
My jewelry ain't cheap, I know I'm a beast
I go get that work, watch my niggas eat
I need some more diamonds, my team need some rings
Put ice in my teeth, man I l feel like a king
Red bottoms on with my YSL jeans
I need that drip when I walk on the scene
Look up at a boss when you talking to me
You know this shit cost I can't walk through for free
I pour up that mud and I roll up, get geeked
I heard he ran off on you niggas, you sleep
I made 45 and I break down a P
I bought the whole house, they didn't give me a lease
Run through the week make a hunnid at least
Copped me a coupe, it ain't come with no key
Bitch I be high and I don't get no sleep
They say I ride when I'm on a beat
I love your vibe let's fuck in the suite
She got her friend fucking on me
The strong gon' survive and these niggas weak
This a freestyle but this shit ain't free
I got crocodile all over my seats
They eat up the style, they get it from me
I made a 100 today
Look at my Rollie when I need a date
There's flawless VS's inside of the face
I see the stars inside of the Wraith
I went for the cup but I'm still in L.A
Pray to the Lord that I beat my case

Too many keys to these exotic cars
Too many freaks, I been fuckin' a foreign
If you niggas fly then I must be airborne
Won't pay you no mind and they gon' pay me more
Hopped in the coupe, let the Tesla charge

But I can see my mama in Dior
We walk inside and they closin' the store
You niggas ain't drippin' like Gunna the boy
Geekin' up and it's already a sport
Jeep and it's clanging, the engine it roaring
Fiending so much I don't know what to pour
In middle school when I jumped off the porch
Good in the hood, had to dodge all the narcs

Protectin' your family, you gotta go hard
The way my drip set, that shit come with a scar
I took that drip all the way cross the border

You cappin', I'm rappin' my shit, you ignorin'
Saving the profit, our business is growin'
They felt sunny days and they wish for a storm
Fly in the sky, young nigga airborne
Wiring account, money come in all sorts
I really trapped out that Honda Accord
My chopper my pillow when I'm in the war
Blue hundreds my reason, lil nigga what's yours?
She tell me she cummin', I'm strokin' it more
Thinkin' that time we go big like the Hulk
Feel me, you thought I wouldn't make it at all
Get rich and I still gotta duck all the law
Shut the fuck up, I don't need you to talk
I ran up the millions just watching you walk
You never gon' win when you droppin' the salt
I took that drip all the way cross the border
That two door Maybach should've came with some stars
I stood on this shit, I don't get an award
All the new whips comin' with a push start
I don't fear shit but I rock fear of god
Took the spaceship and I landed on Mars, ahI call the shots, I'm a coach

Guess it's more , I'm a young boss so I'm rockin' a plain 
Foreign cars, two door coupe, they takin' the Range
Only time I sleep is on a plane
Paranoia, all this money on my brain 
Guess it's more , I'm a young boss so I'm rockin' a plain 
Foreign cars, two door coupe, they takin' the Range
Uh, two-door coupe, drop the roof
This a Transformer too
I'm in my bag, ain't nothin' new
Been in my bag since high school
Choppa talk, Dr. Seuss 
Catch a nigga, grab the noose 
Your bitch look so edible 
I'ma take her for dinner
Hop in that bitch like I'm incredible
I fuck that bitch like a winner
Feel like Mike Tyson, I'm impeccable 
Uh, I don't love her, nah
I only love my Beretta, ho 
I still get her wetter though 
Bill Cosby, molly on me 
Damn it, Gucci my sweater, ho 
Only time I sleep is on a plane
Paranoia, all this money on my brain 
Guess it's more , I'm a young boss so I'm rockin' a plain 
Foreign cars, two door coupe, they takin' the Range
Only time I sleep is on a plane
Paranoia, all this money on my brain 
Guess it's more , I'm a young boss so I'm rockin' a plain 
Foreign cars, two door coupe, they takin' the RangeOnce upon a time, you could be a bad guy
And you'd live to see another day
But now you'd never manage. Boy, you'd be brain-damaged
Just to think that you could get away
The power has arrived in a dream team
A force where one and one makes three
And when the trail's gone cold and the lies have been told
This crew will find what you can't see
Yeah, danger hides when the hyper bee flies
And the ninja stars fly too
The muscle is Vector, the karma collector
And he's sworn to fight for you
They're detectives you want on your side
Their directive's trackin' down your crime
Come along for the ride
Truth can run but not hide for long
The game is on now!
Remember when the stealing used to be a good dealin'
And the crooked life would always pay
Well, now that the team's in town; that's all gone underground
But it's a worry to this very day
A challenge has been issued by the Eggman
This mission's gonna need them all
And though his hopes grow thin and the outlook is grim
These three are gonna heed his call
Yeah, Charmy's thing is dishin' out first sting
And the green one cheers them on
Espio is clearly ready to go
Run down who'd do you wrong
They're detectives you want on your side
Their directive's trackin' down your crime
Come along for the ride 
Truth can run but not hide for long
The game is on
Sonic Heroes—what your problem needs
Watch those three go make the outlaws bleed
There's no way you can win 
If it's trouble you're in 
They're gonna kick your...Lyrics from Snippet
Run that back, Turbo
Hop out the McLaren 
Got so fresh, oh so clean 
And my bitch in celine 
Actavis, sippin' lean 
This ain't no facade 
We count cash, color green 
Got that clean on the cream
Like a Holly got that rings 
You can't heal my heart
I got scars on my veins 
You can't feel my pain 
These rackets keep me safe 
In the  country, sippin' codeine lemonade
Liquor racing through down London
Shoppin' bros what they expect 
I came from the block
I get M's on my name 
My watch hit my crib
Hi, dear, it's insane 
Shawty, give me that top 
The top of the RangeI will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a ten
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch
Got 60 shows a nigga goin' in
They sent me to front with a back end
World tour, I'm picking up a 10
We run up that sack when they pack in
You wanna send it, better mail it straight
I could show you, let me demonstrate
Saran wrap it like a dinner plate
You got the truck and I'ma check the date
Get there early, not a minute late
Bust it open, smoke it, meditate
That lean is something I can never waste
That Iley Miley got a bitter taste
We been pouring syrup in a Minute Maid
We far from white but we got plenty K's
We blow this shit up, we the renegade
I bought a house and then went renovate it
My side bitch wanna have a baby
I fuck her good and give her penetration
We fucking smoking, we need ventilation
I'm rocking ice, a nigga really skating
I'm rapping focused, nigga dedicated
I brought the show, look like a masquerade
Shut this shit down like the Central Station
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a ten
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitch
I know, I know, I know, I know I'm goin'
I know, I know, I know I keep 'em flowing
I open words and now I speak influence
I'm a boss, I got a strong influence
I went got my chance, I'm a opportunist
I tuck the Glock, nigga not the Ruger
Got 30 shots and nigga I'm the shooter
I put my jewelry in a fucking cooler
I whipped the Benz and then I whipped the Beamer
I told her pick my clothes up at the cleaners
She walk and toot it like a ballerina
She bad as fuck, a nigga barely see her
She shop at Houston in the Galleria
I send her once inside the Beverly Hills
She try take my wallet and spend a mil'
I keep it silent I never tell
I came out that dope hole to give em' hell
Tell me what you want, I got it for sell
When I was 11 I seen a bale
Go 'head run that pack all the way
I copped me some work when I got a scale
And I found a plug in L.A
I told him we sendin' it in the mail
I will never ever switch
I stopped and watch 'em take a pic
I put some icing on my wrist
My Forgiato blowing kisses, lips
I hit the club and threw a ten
She know I know I'm goin' in
Got Tom Ford on my lens
A Don Juan like a pimp, bitchHear that money talkin', I'm in designer walkin'
I put that money all in, stack the money by the ten
Forty thousand for the lens, from a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win, I hear that money talkin'
Hear that money callin', I'm in the mall, I'm ballin'
I gotta keep the carbon, I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six, I'm in the top cockpit
Spit this shit up out the door, niggas know I keep the tone
I can do it all alone, had to do it for my home
Niggas 'till I'm movin' on, got some money on the phone
Got them shows on my own, fifty-seven for the shows
Puttin' rappers on they toes 'cause they know I ain't tote
I can never break the code, I will never ever fold
This some shit I woulda hoped
And then pulled up in a Rolls
Everybody used to kick doors
'Till I pulled up on copy road, and seen a spot full of yams
I sold my first car and got a half a bag and started breakin' down grams
Now I'm textin' Uncle Sam, but the fucker started scammin'
Now I'm hoppin' on the 'Gram, me and Nechie in a Lamb'
Had to show 'em who I am, had to show 'em who I was
Had to show 'em what I want, rockstar with a bunch
Niggas do it for the front, 'cept you should do it for the ones
Tryna hit like Barry Bonds, make a million every month
Hear that money talkin', I'm in designer walkin'
I put that money all in, stack the money by the ten
Forty thousand for the lens, from a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win, I hear that money talkin'
Hear that money callin', I'm in the mall, I'm ballin'
I gotta keep the carbon, I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six, I'm in the top cockpit
Every time you see I poke my chest out
And my life been lookin' good, but I been stressed out
For them niggas who talkin' big, you know they chests out
Why the fuck you buy a vest? You want yo' head clocked
And when that money talk we cappin' out, what we live now
Killin' everythin' but the kids now, that how it is now
I used to be broke, I walk around with a ten now
Ready to just spend on anythin' that I feel now
Through these chrome heart lenses, I see it all, yeah
I see the hate, I see the fake, I see the flawed, yeah
Fuck it we gon' ball, yeah, Stevie Wonder, see we gettin' cake, we gettin' it all, yeah
And we ain't playin' with these hoes 'cause we don't hear them all yeah
Never fall, I stand tall on it, shit, I just hit the light and cashed out on
I bought a Mulsanne, and a new chain, you niggas too lame
Kickin' flavor like I'm Lu Kang from the south, but I ain't 2 Chainz
Hear that money talkin', I'm in designer walkin'
I put that money all in, stack the money by the ten
Forty thousand for the lens, from a bucket to a Benz
Nigga know I came to win, I hear that money talkin'
Hear that money callin', I'm in the mall, I'm ballin'
I gotta keep the carbon, I ain't tryna bargain
I cop the drop-top six, I'm in the top cockpitNiggas they on to me

The differences is, lil' nigga I listen
I ain’t tryna sign, I'ma stay independent
Now open your eyes, hope you pay attention
I copped me a coupe and it come wit' no ceilin'
I used to struggle 'til I started dealin'
I gotta hustle to get me a million
You in the way nigga, play your position
Keep a straight face, I don't play wit' these bitches
Keep a AK, 'bout to blow in the kitchen
I might make the Forbes from tourin' the city
When I go to the hood niggas actin' like bitches
I gotta stay focused, my enemies envy
I know you ain't wit' me, you niggas against me
I know you ain't wit' me 
I turned to the lord, I know you against me
Try to avoid and roll me a spiffy
But these niggas tellin', I smell somethin' fishy
I can't sell a brick 'cause I think it's too risky
If I sell a bale they might try come get me
I'm still gon' pour bale and my shit cost a milli's
Wake up in the mornin' and think about Benji's
I went to the bank and I'm seein' number commas
To tell you the truth, I'm in love wit' blue hunnids
These bitches gon' fuck when they see the young Gunna
I just got a slut and she came from 
She sucked me so good got a flight to Atlanta
These bitches get money, you know it don't matter
Went straight to the top and I didn't use a ladder
Got choppas on choppas if you wanna battle
Yeah 
I go to the mall and buy my bit' designer
'Cause she kept it silent I know she a rider
Go back to the spot, put the dick all inside of you

You niggas some ballhogs, don't want me to ball
I still got some savages waitin' on the call
I done doin' prayer, stack my money tall
Pourin' the Act' in that red, we sip raw
I'm feelin' like 2Pac and it's fuck the law
Cash out on a foreign, I don't care what it cost
It came wit' a horse, she hear the exhaust
I got me a check, went and bought me a loft
I'm a young boss, made it outta the South
Nigga gon' hate, keep my name out your mouth
These niggas show fake love when they see me out
They know I'm workin' when they in a drought
12 hit my spot, had the work in the couch
12 hit my spot, had the work in the mansion
And I hold my daughter, said baby don't panic
I hope she don't tell 'em the safe in the attic
Just keep it cool and don't be dramatic
Whatever I showed you, you need to forget it
She can get prices on a dealer wit' business
I just want work and chase after these riches
I stack up them racks, I stacked up them riches
Got racks in my pocket, got racks for my bitches

You've been somewhere else
And I've tried, and I've tried to tell you the way I felt
How many times can, how many times
Can we keep going in circles?
But still can't make you see
You're walking out and I follow you to the street
Tell me what I gotta do for your love 
I'll move mountains if I can, just to make you understand
Tell me what I gotta do for your love 
I would hand you all the stars
Just to get you in my arms
Tell me what I gotta do
From the start, from the start I knew this is what I want
But it's hard when your body's close, but you still feel far
Oh, how many nights can, how many nights
Can we keep going in circles?
But still can't make you see
You're walking out and I follow you to the street
Tell me what I gotta do for your love 
I'll move mountains if I can, just to make you understand

My neck worth a price 
Live on paradise 
I'm covered in ice 
I'm cold like an ice age 
I roll like the dice 
This cash coming my way 
I shine in the night 
These diamonds are bright 
I polished all of my jewels 
Cuban link on my wrist, she like, "Ooh" 
I was the cool kid in school 
Kept some new kicks, I was servin' that food 
Don't owe you shit, I done paid all my dues 
Dior my jacket, Off-White on my shoes
My bitch is nasty, get wet like a pool
Hi-Tech and Act' and I'm chopping and screwing
New Jimmy Choo, they like, "Who is that?" 
New Bentley coupes and they back-to-back 
Big ol' white mansion my habitat 
You just be cappin', we stackin' racks 
Treat her and beat her, I break her back 
The slime two-seater is pretty fast 
My mind is zooted from sippin' that 
Stay down on your grind 'cause I know you can 
I cash the checks early
I fucked your hoe, it was 10:30
Hear the Hellcat swervin'
ATL Falcons, we play wit' the birdies
I won't fold my dogs and I'm not trying to merge 'em
Crackers won't get it until we stop purgin'
My car hasn't been touched, it's a virgin

I will outshine you, I'll blind you 
I am like one of a kind 
You are like nothing to find 
I got the chalk, get your body outlined 
Your ho gonna cry when she find you

All of them hunneds speak for me
Baby, she like me, she creep to me
Ooh, she hungry, she eating me

Yeah
I'm lit up like a lamp 
People call me the champ 
To describe my life story
I would say I'm goin' up like a ramp 
I was hittin' one of my old shorties
I fucked around and caught a cramp 
She ain't wanna stop, she still horny
I broke her back till she left 
I don't cook, I get it from the chef 
And I really want to change the wealth 
I'm one hunnid, tell you, "Watch your steps​" 
I won't let you fall where I fell 
If we all get caught, I ain't tell 
Gunna rock-solid, I ain't frail 
Thank God, I could've been in jail 
Now I'm on, family strong, I can enjoy myself 
My neck is froze, VS stones, mini globes in my ear 
Scott got me stoned, sippin' fours, I done poured up a whole fifth 
Grippin that .45 when I stare
I see you in the camera in my rear 
Got a scarf from Alexander for your tears
I done spent my whole life bein' real
I rolled dice, can't hold dice
So I'm taking off in sixth gear
Made more money than I ever thought
Look at how the cards can be dealtLast night I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Next year in the winter, let’s give it a try
I’ll keep on dreaming out loud tonight
Summer's over, but you still haven’t call me back
We're just getting older, soon enough, it’ll be to late to act
Let’s do it again, let’s ride on the waves of gold
I'll wait for your call, 'cause I wouldn’t go on my own
Last night I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Can we still make it happen, it's worth a try
And I might keep on dreaming out loud
It's a beautiful lie staying under blue skies
Next year in the winter, let’s give it a try
I’ll keep on dreaming out loud tonight
Winter is dawning, and I can’t seem to adapt
And somebody told me, that you've felt the same way since we went
Why won’t you give me a call, we’ll ride on those waves again
And I can wait through a storm
'Cause without you, it wouldn't be the same
Last night I was dreaming out loud
California sun was making my eyes dry
Can we still make it happen, it's worth a try
Aah, and I might keep on dreaming out loud
It's a beautiful lie staying under blue skies
And next year in the winter let’s give it a try
I’ll keep on dreaming out loud tonight
Yeah I'll be dreaming out loud tonight
I’ll keep on dreaming out loud tonightNigga fly like a pelican

Pigs tap phones, one big trap
Rapping but I still live the gutter life
Cut a nigga for that butter, that's a butter knife
These bitches act crazy
Pussies everywhere, like they're Crazy Cat Lady
Didn't know about vision, I would visualise
Thought about prison, they weren't living nice
But I thought about living nice
So anything about money, I weren't thinking twice
Everything 'bout money in their conversations
Except for money, everything's in moderation
On the strip like I had the slags stripping
Flip, I put the money that I had flipping
Swag dripping of course, dripping with sauce
On the pills, driving through the hood, whipping a horse
I do it, did it by force
Gotta do shit yourself, they can't give you your balls
If it's us in the place, better give an applause
Forever buss in her face and make her get an abortion
Touch base, then I touch bass
Then I give 'em the course
Think the street's cracked
The streets need me, I need the streets back
Drop bangers, then I take a seat
Take a back seat, then I just take my seat back
Pussy niggas got a death wish
Got killers floating round like dead fish

Spin a nigga, spin a nigga, man's hyped
Ever been that nigga on a man's mic?
Wanna come and get you on your man's life
Come and go and get 'em with your hands tied
And you can't even afford it and you bang time
Can't even afford that little gang crime
But you're a gully motherfucker and you bang 9s
But now you're kind of walking on them landmines
But God's on a man's side when a man's blind
Gang wars
Couple drug dealers, couple gang lords
Fuck it, let me talk about the album
I'm 'bout to get 'em ready for the landlord
I charge a little fucker £20,000
Cause they know that it's the shutters when a man tours
I'm feeling like a motherfucking mountain
And these bitches got me looking like a man whore

Had to slow down, I done bought too many chains
Car a  but the engine a mini 
The Maybach wood grain like my Cartiers
Money speak for me, ain't much I gotta say
Don't care how much I made, I still gotta save
International, getting it all kinds of ways
The ambassador, get everybody paid
You lamеs aren't charged to the gamе
Heard you got a nigga framed, you should be ashamed
I was shackled on the chain from a selling-full of grain
Now I'm rocking hella chains, thanking God for a change
Free the slime Melly, shit be hard to explain
I just wanna  like  and  out with some brains
Had the feeling that I'm ready through my heart, in my vein
Pop a perc and in a second you be numbing the pain
I come from the home of the brave
I don't go back and forth, but I don't really want you to stay
I got mad support and all type of fans, different races
Drive the fastest Porsche and I ain't even here for a race
What's a million, that they thank me for booking a chase
Niggas looking, better think before you looking this way
'Lotta money in the bank and it's all of a faith
It's a phantom don, you can't call this a wraith

Four in a minute maid, ain't no cap in my rap, we really paid
Call my bitch, she pull up in a Bentley thing
When I'm sipping they stare at my pinky ring
I ain't sleeping, my nigga, this ain't a dream
When you slipping, ain't nothing to protect the king
Long live Nipsey, I put that on everything
This shit slow up, I go back to selling green

Chrome Heart for the children, talk to God dressed in linen
Got my dawg in the system, pay it all to appealing
All for the healin', codeine raw when you sippin'
I lost all of my feelings, drive a car with no ceiling
Pretty broads with me chillin', smashin' hard like a engine
Got a 9, that's a semi for you boys you act silly
Straight up out the struggle
Y'all gon' cop a brick and I'ma make it worth double
She just let me hit and now she fuckin' on my brother
Your bitch, shе with the shit and now she tellin' you shе love you and she put no one above you
I been goin' hard off of that pack since I was little
Big up on a perc, we pop them bitches like they Skittles
I was born off in that jungle raised by gorillas
And some killers that don't give a fuck about none you niggas
Free , told my dawg I'ma bring him home, that's my word
Yeah, bitch I'm pitchin' bricks up off that curb
Yeah, you can get your issue on that curb
Way before Corona, we was curb servin'
I took a risk to get that paper, it was worth it
I took a hunnid, caught two bricks and started workin'
You caught me cheatin', I broke your heart and you ain't deserve it
Now is it worth it?
Came up with a hustle when we all made a killin'
Came from out the struggle, we can all spend a million
Chrome Heart for the children, talk to God dressed in linen
Got my dawg in the system, pay it all to appealing
All for the healin', codeine raw when you sippin'
I lost all of my feelings, drive a car with no ceiling
Pretty broads with me chillin', smashin' hard like a engine
Got a 9, that's a semi for you boys you act silly
We can hit the town in matchin' 'Raris
Money ain't a thing, I just be smart with it
Really don't blow mine, I might buy small shit
 I still got options
My slogan 'round the world Four Pockets
Even though I hate the opps, I ain't gon' bad talk 'em
Or try to knock unless I knock 'em off
Gucci socks showin' like I golf
I can't ever take my hand off her body, she so soft
I'm the type of real one who'll never mention what I bought
Chrome Heart long-sleeve my ass got three cross
Got the Cullinan waxed, it feel better when it gloss
Came up with a hustle, had to make myself a boss
Only heard me say it once and they already wanna know
I'm tryna get over anxiety
I know for sure my slimes proud of me
She say she love me, but she lied to me
She caught me cheatin' and then cried to me
It's like my heart is not inside of me
I took it out and put it out of reach
I gave you everything to help you breathe
We did this shit and stay ahead and keep stackin' with ease
I pray to God that I don't ever need
I let my diamonds cry no tears, I'll probably never grieve
One day it's gon' be everything it seem
Put that on all that dead ones on the team
I keep it gangsta from the start, check out my ice, now I got hella cream
Came up with a hustle when we all made a killin'
Came from out the struggle, we can all spend a million
Chrome Heart for the children, talk to God dressed in linen
Got my dawg in the system, pay it all to appealing
All for the healin', codeine raw when you sippin'
I lost all of my feelings, drive a car with no ceiling
Pretty broads with me chillin', smashin' hard like a engine
Got a 9, that's a semi for you boys you act silly
Raised independent
Now I rock a show and make 'em race like the engine 
Niggas cappin' like this was a wave they invented 
Keep it real, Young Gunna havin' way too man millions to not put us in position 
She made a decision, let me fuck with no permission
Our relationship too risky, I don't trust none of you bitches 
You can never sell stingy, bought you diamonds and they twinkle 
Tryna give back to my city, they would doubt when you still little 
You wouldn't even believe that I get paid for the Ritalin
You wouldn't even believe that I got paid sellin' Skittles 
Get sprayed, I'ma spitter, I'ma take it and steal her
Still don't play with the dealer, no, I'm way too realerIt's been a few nights, you by my side
Begging me to stay, now I’m jumping on a flight
Another shot and your tired
It's been a few days now you haven't call
Telling your friends, "I’m too blame for it all"
I bet you left out the part
When you told me you needed time to figure it out
As soon as I moved on, you come back around
Saying that you moved past all of your doubts
I hope you figure it out
'Cause I ain't gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
And I ain't gonna waste another heartbreak
Waste another heartache on a girl like you
But I hope that you figure it out
'Cause I know that I figured it out
No, I ain't gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
On a girl like you
Met a new girl, she loves my family
We're playing games, 'cause she understands me
It’s never felt so right
I get your calls, but I never answered
Loving my new life without any pressure
Don’t even question why
You told me you needed time to figure it out
As soon as I moved on, you come back around
Saying that you moved past all of your doubts
I hope you figure it out
'Cause I ain’t gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
And I ain't gonna waste another heartbreak
Waste another heartache on a girl like you
But I hope that you figure it out
'Cause I know that I figured it out
And I ain't gonna waist another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
You told me you needed time, baby
You told me you needed time, baby, oh
You told me you needed time, baby
Yeah, you told me you needed
You told me you needed time, baby
You told me you needed
I ain’t gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
And I ain't gonna waste another heartbreak
Waste another heartache, oh
I ain't gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like you
And I ain't gonna waste another heartbreak
Waste another heartache on a girl like you
But I hope that you figure it out
'Cause I know that I figured it out
And I ain't gonna waste another heartbeat
Waste another minute on a girl like youLyrics from Snippet
When you worked hard at your hip
I leaved and took off and got a deal
I teach my niggas what I'm taught and now they label me a boss
They keep it real, and that's real
I post wheel, I'm so trill
My niggas act hard, I leave 'em roadkill
My family run, I need some more meals
Top off of the Don, I give her soul a thrillHe killed what he ate and brewed what he drank
Listened to Coe, Jerry Reed, and Hank
A bear of a man, hardly left the woods
A six foot four, solid rock when he stood
He'd hunt with a hatchet and his own bare hands
Refused welfare, only lived off the land
Drove an '87 Dodge, straight pipes out the back
Stocked his house with white-tail racks
He's a rebel, a redneck, grew up in the sticks
A standard American son'bitch
His shirt says Ralph but his real name's Fred
Got grease on his hands and sweat on his head
Pants oil black and arms are scarred
And knuckles more busted than his credit card
Spends weekdays working under the hood
He's got mouths to feed and he knows he should
Come Friday at five he'll collect that pay
Pop a top on a cold one at the end of the day
He's blue collar, a sinner, he can't decide which
A standard American son'bitch
You can call me a redneck, call me a hick
Say I'm a drunk, messed up just a bit
But the flag I fly's got the stars and stripes
Test my freedom, I'll be down for a fight
We're the backbone, blue collar
Working, trying to earn a dollar
Hurts, but it feeds our kids
Standard American son'bitch
He drives a Peterbilt with eighteen wheels
The ICC hot on his heels
Running them roads since age eighteen
Ain't a city limit sign that he hasn't seen
Grinding them gears, heading down the line
He's enslaved to the law, the law and time
Make it home for two day's sleep
Then it's back to his cockpit and Air Ride seat
He's a driver, a highway man
Loves his woman and two kids
A standard American son'bitch
He ain't heard too good since '67
Flew a chopper named The Stairway To Heaven
Got an M16, hacks up black tar
Vietnam plates on the back of his car
He don't talk too much and he don't waste words
When he does you damn sure better know he's heard
A ponytail, little thin up top
Rolls his own for ten cents a pop
He's a soldier, a veteran, beat up a bit
A standard American son'bitch
You can call me a redneck, call me a hick
Say I'm a drunk, messed up just a bit
But the flag I fly's got the stars and stripes
Test my freedom, I'll be down for a fight
We're the backbone, blue collar
Working, trying to earn a dollar
Hurts, but it feeds our kids
Standard American son'bitch
Country boys survive
Mess with my family, I'll cut you and gut you and tie your hide
Set you on fire and watch you burn aliveBam-bam-ba-bam-bam

Får meg til å skinne som en sol
Likner på deg, du er mitt idol
Vi to finner på noe å spille
Fra morra, til det blir kveld
Går rundt og rundt som en karrusel

There’s just something about
There’s just something about
There’s just something about
The way you look in that dress
You’re never trying to impress
And I can’t live without
I can’t live without
I can’t live without
The smile resting on your face
Let’s get out of this place
Now is the time
For us
We’ll listen to the music

We barely got away
Pulling down the shades
Sleeping the day away
We’ll hide under the covers
Until we start all over
And my head’s spinning round
Cause we’ve been spinning round
Running around this town
We’re crashing all the rooftops
Did you just hear my heart drop?
We’ll listen to the music
Till we get it right

Til the morning light
When the sun comes up
And the stars go high
We’ll listen to the music
We can dance all, dance all

Ain't no one else above us unless you mention God 
Our enemies despise us 
We still ain't switchin' sides 
I woke up in a mansion
All these different places, I can't take this shit for granted 
Giving drip and they say thеy say I'm a dripping bandit 
Roof panorama  'Wagen from my auntie 
Diffеrent foreign cars, Tropicana call it candy 
Don't gotta work hard just to get that out her panties 
I ain't with the fraud niggas, fake, I know already 
This ain't no facade I got real baguettes
Put my jewelry on, my neck feel heavy 
I'm up here with the stars, this shit ain't ever landing 
I keep her on my side, my little baby in handy 
She told me call her Brandy 'cause she ain't drinkin' many 
These dogs, I could never switch sides

When I look at the stars and I wish that I could fly

Chopstick Glocks, they filled up with hollows

Breaking up pounds with  and Pablo

Crawling inside a nineteen gelato
I'm thinking twice but here for tomorrow

Call up the line, got perkies and  
Bros on the side, they treat me like Cappo 
Show the respect, they killing you pronto

Got vibes in the VIP, yeah we getting litty

Hoe gettin' cash and I know

Ain't no secret, I got love for my Pradas

Back to the block, and it's fuck all the po-po

My life Dior and my bitch still need coco 
Young Wunna the wave, no  to the mojo 
He tryna cuff his wife, I know she a hoe though 
Bounce up and down on my stick like a pogo 
Before I got rich I stopped wearing that Polo
Stop hitting me up, I don't fuck with you no more
My closet like Lennox, I really got flyer 
I'm really getting it, get paid for a flyer
I took four million, receiving these wires 
Stay in her mouth like a kid pacifier 
Niggas burnt out, don't be close to the fire 
Gunna a lion, I strike like a tiger 
 my whole bitch, now I keep a spare tire

Fuck what you thought, this money the mottoI've been searching in the dark
Trusting every clue I've found
But the truth has not been told:
Is every corner of these woods is hollow
I can't see in the dark
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
'Cuz the rivers told me lies
Sometimes light is breaking through
But my blinded eyes can't really learn illusion
I can't trust it be the ring
So I keep on wandering until I feel you
Feel that you lied
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
'Cuz the rivers told me lies
Where are you?
Where are you?
Where are you?
Oh, where are you?
Cuz the rivers told me lies

So when it's time to rep my hood, I'm repping mine
I blow your head, out your hood, when it's repping time 
When it's time to rep my hood I'll press the nine
Still repping
I'm black flagging, still bragging about the Black Gang I'm in 
I come with the gym bag like I've come for gym
But I ain't come to pump ways that's that pumpy ting
I jump out, with the pump out, and dump on him
These niggas wanna act hard
Get touched with the pound like a scratch card
I trade pound 7's fam these clowns call me mr motivator
Undertaker with those pounds
Pecknarm, Black Gang
Young Size
I rep the narm on a Black Gang ting 
Black hand ting
Niggas smiling, I slap man's ting

I'm on a mad ting, grab man, stab mans skin
Smith & Wesson scream, mad noises
And create, mad wings
SN1, PYG, are the Black Gang kings
Man back hand him, for screaming out that GAS Gang shit
I'm a badman prick 
I've violated so much niggas and I clap mans sticks
No itch I slap mans wig
And leave your brains leaking like a, broken fridge
It's got a long clip, and it sprays

Pecknarm, Black Gang

Oh you might catch me, with Billy or Gunna

If I rise the hagging out the bag

Big shots off pricks that rely off of air shake
I'll let it glide through your head top like air spray
I'll show the real meaning of rising in heat
Imma take your face you're beefing imma grill you in the streets
Move the street when I ride, if I catch you in your ride
Let it sky through the top if you're in a drop top, that's a better head top
I hit your head side
Send the YG's in the block, you'll be in a big shock
That's a  through your woolyish top
That's another body drop

Got a bag of  cops when the Pecky niggas ride
Pecknarm, Black Gang
Butch
Black, Black and I slang it too 
That'll leave you in a black bag or definitely cabbage you

We might ride on your gang in mechanics suits 
Drag the hammer and let the cannon shoot 
Better go grab your go go gadget boost
You're getting squad them pricks ain't  you
Come on, man shot out clips lit your back in 2 
I move like an addict move when I grab and shoot 
And a couple of my niggas got hammers too
 eating out a tube when I slap it  
Fix up your attitude 
You get it in your back I put your face in your lap 
If you wanna be facing the strap 
Believe me, I'll cock them shots in your beanie
If you stuck in the lamp like a genie
Pecknarm, Black Gang
Killa, Black Gang

Loaded, they holla at Ben conversating 
Broad day light, then a niggas on a bait ting, stop hating
My niggas bang K's while you're raving
Killa's in a bad mood and straps knew niggas ran miles when the mac booms 
And a niggas on suck, suck it like a vacuum
Old school niggas get dropped what the love do
The trap opens in the morning niggas out at 9 then a nigga get a warning
One wrong move then a case starts 
You niggas ain't hard, you niggas are appalling 
You niggas ain't balling, dialling H when a nigga gets to warring
Drops 3 a jumper, while a nigga yawning

Playin', we gon' rip up your whole city
Hurricane, hurricane, hurricane
Bitches said do it like a bet
So I went and put some water 'round my neck
Gunna gon' and went and got the check
Young nigga fresh off a jet
I'm climbing to the top, watch your step
I came to shoot a movie, Michael Phelps
I pour up and I lean to the left
I don't think the nigga hear me, might be deaf
Pull up in the Rolls 
Type of bullets make you bleed when they melt
 100 we don't need no annouc'
You could throw a private party, make the bitches strip
 think I need to pop a pill
Late night on the  that Young Gunna live
Still got my mind on my money
Pourin' up the mud and the muddy
I got it out the grind, out the mud, I was dirty
The AP rose gold and the shine never sunning
Sixty pointers looking like baguettes
Used to want a Rollie 'til I seen a Patek
YSL, motherfuck the rest
 gotta grind if you want it
 gotta grind if you want it
 gotta grind if you want it
 gotta grind if you want it
I had to skip a mil I was hungry
 stackin' Ms getting money

Aw, I'm rich
I laugh at  and fuck on you bitches, aw
Man, a menace
I walk with a 30 might  listen

I still serve a fiend
You gotta grind if you want it
Go 
Slime  wipe yo nose clean
Thugger thugger that's my bro
I iced out the Jesus
See the diamonds in the Rollie
I pull up and spray juice
Left a hole in your homie
Drive the foreign like it's stolen
Fuckin' bitches in the 
Nechie Nechie I'm a monster
Made a profit off a 
YSL be the sponser
Middle finger to your honor
YSL be the sponser

But there's something that can't happen
Won't say it any more than one time
Weren't listening? Well, too bad
Not allowed repeating
Don't tell me to ever sing again
Lost chance
Make sense
Running out of words use
Failing communication

Desperate today
Streetlights, people

Yuh, woah, ACOT, ACOT
Bitch, I'm all about my chedder, no macaroni
You don't know me, ball like Kobe 
Fettuccine, I'm so dreamy, she get freaky 
See my money, see my money, actin' funny 
Don't touch my skrilla, I got killa, steady aimin'
No macaroni, you don't know me, ball like Kobe 
Fettuccine, I'm so dreamy, she get freaky 
See my money, see my money, actin' funny 
Don't touch my skrilla, I got killa, steady aimin'
If you come to me 
I smoke you and that's guaranteed 
Cops come, you better not freeze 
Opps come, we spread like Febreze 
Blood on the lease 
My brody he fresh out the bank
More for Coy and he lettin' it rain 
And to think that he had hoop dreams
Tidy white shoes so much
Growin' up broke, nigga lose all hope
Gettin' lost, I'm all full of dope
Nigga really don't wan' smoke
Why I always gotta hit you first? 
I'ma do it, guess I never learn 
Smoke yo' ass and put you in the urn 
Big body, hit the wide turns 
I'm for the money, so I am not for you
I wrap the work in aluminum foil 
I put the coke in pot, let it boil 
Fry and then I put your ass in the soil 
Never lackin', you know that we got it
Know I need all of the profit
Bitch, I'm all about my chedder, no macaroni
You don't know me, ball like Kobe 
Fettuccine, I'm so dreamy, she get freaky 
See my money, see my money, actin' funny 
Don't touch my skrilla, I got killa, steady aimin'
No macaroni, you don' know me, ball like Kobe 
Fettuccine, I'm so dreamy, she get freaky 
See my money, see my money, actin' funny 
Don't touch my skrilla, I got killa, steady aimin'

        All of your dress huggin' your body
Watchin' your eyes, can't take 'em off me
Don't wanna be late to the party
I'm holdin' my breath, it's killin' me softly
You walk in and I'll wait in the car outside
Countin' down the minutes, one, two, three, four, five
Then I'll walk in alone, you know we both know why
It's better if we hide
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
Nobody knows the things we do when we're alone
Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody, nobody knows
That I have to keep you a secret to keep you close
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
One, two, nobody, nobody
Make 'em believe we can be strangers
High on the rush, lovin' the danger
Wish it could be, nothin' is simple
When you're ready to go, give me the signal
I'll walk out and meet you in the car outside
Countin' down the minutes, one, two, three, four, five
Then you'll walk out alone, you know we both know why
It's better if we hide
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
Nobody knows the things we do when we're alone
Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody, nobody knows
That I have to keep you a secret to keep you close
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
Nobody, nobody
Nobody, nobody
It's harder and harder to wait
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll do whatever it takes, oh
It's harder and harder to wait
I'll do whatever it takes
I'll do whatever it takes, oh
Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody, nobody knows
That I have to keep you a secret to keep you close
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
Nobody knows the things we do when we're alone
Nobody, nobody knows
Nobody, nobody knows
That I have to keep you a secret to keep you close
Nobody knows that you're the one I'm takin' home
Nobody, nobodyVoopTraphouse Mob

While I'm in the club, throwin' them hundreds and fifties and ones and ones
Pop Smoke, they know I'm wildin'
If I'm on the island, I'm snatchin' the cell
Brody got locked, denied his bail
Until he free, I'm raisin' hell
Tell my shooters call me FaceTime
For all the times we had to face time
Free D-Nice, he doin' state time
If you need the glizzy, you could take mine
Please don't come out your mouth, you know I'm like that
I'll make a movie like TNT

We back in Dior, Dior 
I got Valentino denim 
Brand new Mike Amiri denim

I drop the bag, they gonna hit 'em

I'm tired of niggas tellin' riddles 
Take that foreign, whippin' through the ghetto

Bellaire we're in here, them breddas, they chat waffle
So raise your bottle, man's celebrating life
You only get one, so let's celebrate it right
And tell them girls man ain't looking for a wife
I'm looking for tonight, I'm serious, look in my eyes
And tell them yutes man ain't looking for a fight
Money's the motivation, who's looking for a price?
Fuck that, let the bottle pop, look at dem gyal there, watch the bottom drop
Pecknam's with spotting knocks with them lowkey Gs who went spotting rocks
And you went spotting Zs in the spot with me, in a spot with G
And the spots turned up were the reason why your girls ain't turned up
She got my dick firming up, she strip for me and she earnt a knock
Them yutes ain't worth a buck, say goodbye to that and come and work with us
Look, girl, it's a whole new day, don't get held down, go play
And pop a bottle off that black bottle
Sipping on a Bellaire
Screaming out hell yeah
We struggled and we've been there
Now all my niggas in here
From selling crack, from hell and back
Thinking who held me down and who held me back
From selling crack to selling more crack
Raw crack, get one, get four back
So I tell Poppy send the box down
Down through your blocks, what if they knock your blocks down?
That's why I rep the UK
Threw that young chick behind me like a bouquet
Money makes the world turn
I say money makes the world turn, but for the worse
We need more real niggas and less cameras
Cause all that shit is rehearsed
But maybe it's  why I can't think past my thoughts
And shit is like the Hunger Games, blood sport is what we class as sports
Still on that run the game shit
Think they're running shit, but they're on that run again shitMy shit is therapeutic
Give me the time, I'll make that timeless forever music
Time is forever moving
So if you're moving with time, then you better move quick
You get left behind
That nigga couldn't see his future and it left him blind
I remember time saying "fuck it"
A pound in my pocket, that shit stressed my mind
Now I tell a broke nigga "come grind"
Grind like two broke niggas combined
When you're focused on that money
There ain't a pound that a nigga can't find
So don't stress it, hard to strategise without stress shit
The worst times, I wrote the best shit
Shit can't bring me down
Time is money, invest it
Wading through muddy waters
Just to reach my high
And it's true, the grasses is greener
On the other side
Why the long face?
Tryna do right in the wrong place
Another death, they take out the violin
Then they throw someone that long case
Killed by it when you live by it
You can't make noise and try and live quiet
You're stuck by it or you stick by it
Loyal to the game but I'll never a kid try it
In it till you're dead or you're killing the game
I know old dead broke niggas still in the name
Make a killing or you're killing your name
Cause rich is gangsta, that's real in the game
 nigga, niggas know that it's real there
Couldn't tell you why I'm still there
Find a better place or try and make that place better
For the kids that are still thereYeah , Yeah , uhhh

        I live for that hustle, no money, I can't breathe
No hearts, we wear diamonds on our sleeve, nigga
Believe in the hustle
Hustlism, just believe, nigga
For them hustle recipes, real niggas rest in peace
If falling ain't my plan, then it's destiny's
I was down, then I got up off that dust
Like I fell and had some dusty knees
Got up off that coke, gotta make sure the press flips
Pushing round that white girl, call it domestics
Get the niggas if I hear that they get bricks
Three clips on a movie, call that shit Netflix
Niggas that are stuck up
Stick-ups to get my stack up
And I don't fuck with bitches that are stuck up
If she ain't up for fucking, tell her shut the fuck up
Cause if she ain't talking money, put that mouth to good use
Lost a lot of niggas cause round my hood's loose
The way I move, you won't think I could lose
Where I'm from, no bad news is good news
Feeling like it's just me
Cause I can't trust a nigga that says "trust me"
Came up off the dust but I ain't dusty
Customs fitted with the cufflinks, bitches saying "cuff me"
Bitches want a ring but I don't even ring her phone
And I hate a bitch ringing when I'm in my zone
In this bitch alone, done it on my own
The way I hustle, you would think I had a clone
But I ain't rich at all
Real niggas get that money first cause it is a rule
That's why that bitch calls it her bitch, I fuck that bitch you call
Had her on her knees like a ritual
Hustlism
Fuck the system
Fuck the prison
Free my real Gs, cause I fucking miss themLast year we went to the isle
I remember your smile reflecting the light
We didn't care what tomorrow would bring
There was only right now, the sun was alive
Can still see you walk down the shore
Holding in all the secrets, kept me waiting for the answers
The answers
We can do it all again
I know
Somewhere down the line we're meant to come back home
We can do it all again
I know, I know
Somebody said it's only those who dare to die young
Who get the most out of their life under the sun
But I know it's not true, I've seen the future
And it’s brighter than the eye when we are together
Yeah, it’s brighter than the eye when we are together
Last day I saw you in town
Didn't care to say hi, you were in a rush
Let’s say I see you again
Would you care to sit down or was it just a crush?
I see you walk down the street
Holding in all the secrets keep me waiting for all the answers
The answers
We can do it all again
I know
Somewhere down the line we're meant to come back home
We can do it all again
I know, I know
I know
Somebody said it's only those who dare to die young
Who get the most out of their life under the sun
But I know it's not true, I've seen the future
And it’s brighter than the eye when we are together
Yeah, it’s brighter than the eye when we are togetherMe and Lil Keed, we poured up a six
Oh yeah, let's go, Kay9ine
Fuck all the cops and fuck all the pigs
Uh
Me and Lil Keed, we poured up a six 
Fuck all the cops and fuck all the pigs 
I push your top, drop cash on your wig
We spin the block, hop back on the bridge
Pocket got knots, the car cost a crib 
Designer the socks, it's creme de la creme
, yeah, my denim a M
We cannot stop, we chasing these M's 
Speedin' in the Bentley coupe, yeah 
I can see when the camera in the rear 
Overseas, I just landed in a Lear 
Cop a Patek, I might pop another pill 
Real hot stallions, gotta fuck her in a chair 
You waited for the bail, I was playin' with the bells 
 like to talk, a lotta bands on the shelf 
Yeah, say you getting money, I couldn't tell , yeah
Seats in the coupe, seashell , yeah
Water on me like a wishing well, yeah
Baguettes in the Rollie as well 
Do the whole dash and we ain't stand 12 
Leave the block quiet, leave body leave shells
You make the wrong move, catch a foul, call you ref 
Hood Baby, me and Gunna-Wunna smoking Biscotti 
Catch your main ho, make a real movie 
I told her take it off, I don't do sneak peeks 
If she slime out, get some bands at least 
Bust down the Rollie, put the time on freeze 
Ride with FN and .223s
Y'all niggas shrimp, man, I'm so out your reach 
Me and Lil Keed, we poured up a six 
Fuck all the cops and fuck all the pigs 
I push your top, drop cash on your wig
We spin the block, hop back on the bridge
Pocket got knots, the car cost a crib 
Designer the socks, it's creme de la creme
, yeah, my denim a M
We cannot stop, we chasing these M's Tryna make it out the hood but I come back around
Back around
Nothing for me in my hood but pushing crack around
Crack around
I ain't on no petty shit, grinding for that city shit
Swear fighting up in the pit, don't be on no pity shit
I ain't from the city, nah, I'm from the shitty bit
Chilling from them dark blocks, looking at the city lit
Came from nothing, understand? I came from nothing, understand?
Nothing's planned, so I plan nothing
But to get rich
But on the other hand, there's other plans of handcuffing 
But I can't leave the street shit
Tryna eat from music, just so these feds can eat shit
These pussy niggas ain't the truth
They just sound confident when they speak shit
Nigga, I'm the truth
Proof is in the pudding, no cake? Where's your proof?
I can't take how they move
Niggas too fake like a tooth
Niggas say they don't see me in the hood again
And I be like yo, when I aimed to get out
You must have forgotten
Amnesia my nigga, oh, it's becoming too common
You ain't gonna see me postered up
Unless I'm on a poster, blud
I don't even hear when there's raves in the ends
Please don't act like I'm supposed to come
Cause when I'm around, they act like I ain't welcome
Look at the way my man's looking at me
You would've thought I fucked his girlfriend
And other man are like "Ghetts, holla at me"
But what they gonna say if I belled em?
Yeah? Well then
Dead that, Sus came around with that Bentley
I jumped in and I revved that
Test drive
I jumped back in my Merc and immediately turned to a very depressed man
I phone my nigga CJ in the AM, and this is what he said
If you want one, get that, go hard for it
God forbid rap comes to a number, if it does, move like, move dark for it
But if you got a Bentley, when you're parking it
You're gonna need a suburban yard for it
I'm gonna private plate and carbon it
I want it all, not half of itHook

My Momma Told Me To Paint A PictureNiggas hating on our come-up
Joey, Hollow, Kyze, Gunna
This a banger, wait till summer
Turn up, turn up, turn up, turn up
I moved one up, on the road getting those funds up
I remember shotting that ganja, when  was spitting that thunder
I had a Nokia, took that from a punter
He owed me paper, about a oner
I was chilling with the man dem, we never gave one fuck
I was still getting girls then, bussing my one nut
Who'd have thought of putting them guns up? Fucked around, we would get 
I remember  but nowadays dem man bump us
Look how we started
Nothing, look how we started
Look how we started
It's nothing to get shit started
Hollowman take it back, slippery started
I'm talking about putting on classics, I might put on these Martens
 and then put in his garden
Nigga weren't eating right, just look who's starving
Remember that XR2, been pushing that 
Been wanting to see that show, now look at me charging
Remember that lazy , all that pushing and barging
Never got pissy at parties, couldn't have tooken advantage
Back to back, I went back to pot, then went back to crack again
Then man went broke and went back to coke and then rapped some raps again
Clapped a strap and then clapped a MAC and then clapped a MAC again
Then smashed the rap, out the fire and struck the match again
Way back before I ever spat a verse, I had a buss hammer and a half a mersh
Back then I moved half-cursed, I had a rudeboy bop that was half-rehearsed
I was in and out them foster homes, this town, that town, I was on my own
Back then I was half a tramp, foster mum robbed me like "son, you skanked"
I bounced back like half a champ, got myself a little pro and the hardest shank
Jumped on a little garage ting, had a flow that could blow like kerosene
If I applied a little fire and sprayed that truth, I ain't never been a liar
Little devil started swimming in the fire, on a little level but back then it seemed higher
Speedy Brown in full effect, I ain't explained things fully yet
I was marching my food on the move, I weren't a goon or a bully yet
Skip a couple years or something's the story, had to buck it on the fucker like the nutter before me
Cause I know where my heart is, and I know where I started
Compare these niggas to hoes, these scary niggas my bros
Hood nigga, used to keep every tag on all my clothes
Crazy mosh shirt, crazy mosh jeans
Hit the phone box to ring my hot beans
Olders had that greazy walk where their butt leans
Walked in a couple olders' steps till I got fiends
Showed respect to the niggas that I learnt from
But still robbed a couple niggas that I earnt from
From the days when niggas getting rushed
In the ends that they weren't from
Now the hood is a rat trap, make a pussy nigga get a cat nap
Young niggas saying brap brap, now them say niggas make the MAC clapAll of my foreigns got luxurious speed, I could hit on the freeway
I ain't givin' no help, I know how to play deaf I dont talk to the D.A
Met yo bitch in the strip, wit' my dick on her lip, and her nut lookin' like toothpaste
If we hop in da' whip, with sixteen in the clip, that boy gon see his due date
Got hunnids', on hunnids', on hunnids', on hunnids', I keep me some blue racks
If its your comma, it cost me a couple of commas, I got it in two days
I done' got more designer, it  that im rockin' this shit all in one way
Livin life, and I never will trade it for nothin', thank God every Sunday
Do what they dont, and I ball when I want, and these niggas don't like it
When I come to the scene, it's me, i'm so fresh and so clean, I know they gon' bite it
Pockets full of blue Cheese, i'm smokin' on Biscotti 
Swear to God, we ain't playin', we keep a  minivan, and a Glock we can light it
Louis bag full of bands, i keep me a lil' hunnid' gram, ain't nothin excitin'
I'm a  boy, I feel like a Lion
We ain't got nothin to say, we bitin'Told her learnt that you're able once you're able to learn
I let the heart go cold, getting paper to burn
Now she likes revenge served cold
But it's like sushi, waiting for the table to turn
Put a price on that love, the feelings were sold
Had to leave you cause I weren't leaving the road
When your mind's screwed up, let them feelings unfold
Cause you can't control your feelings when you're feeling controlled
Set your mind free
If I'm on your mind, just don't mind me
You're just gonna find them feelings when you find me
Try to front, you said them feelings were behind me
They say leave that boy alone, it's the only way
They see he's the playing type, he ain't known to stay
They say this and that
But it's the ones that matter least who have the most to say
She's got a fat arse, but there's a thin line
Between that money and that pussy, there's a thin line
At least I keep that between mine
These girls are out of line, I keep my bitches in line
Some put it first
Some put that pussy first
When it comes to kill that pussy, got that pussy hearsed
But when you're dead broke, keep that pussy nursed
Turned my old girl to a cold girl
Had to hustle so the feeling didn't hold well
Couldn't see I'm on the road, girl
Homeless, bagging coke in the hotel
She thought she knew me so well
Thought she knew me, oh well
The times I didn't know what to do
I just did what I know well
So we can fuck but there ain't round 2
Cause when your money's down, these bitches ain't down too
When you're money's down, these bitches ain't round you
So when I see these old bitches, I stay brand new
Even though I stayed new, then
The shit I never knew then
Like these girls ain't shit
I fuck old bitches like I never knew them
Bitches misbehave, she was rude then
In the rave, jumping round to "Slew Dem"
I weren't pushing food then
No phone, took that number with a blue pen
Devil in the dress helped me through then
Through hell and I've been through them
In hell with the blunt
The girl that smoke with me is the girl that I want
There's no talk limit when these bitches talk, init
I ain't saying keep it bottled up, just put a cork in it
Fuck all of these bitches, all in my business
Tryna make me cross I burnt all of these bridges
Tryna get money, I ain't tryna get mad
Tryna get mad money
But when your money's mad, these bitches get mad funny
Still embrace the rainy days that I never had sunny
You weren't with me from the start, you weren't with me from the heart
A part of you fell in love, then I watched it fall apart
The girl from the beginning, devil in the dress
I guess hell is full of women
But I'd rather the devil I know
I'd rather the devil I know
You can't let me go, I need help with this sinningPull up in the lamb truck me and Taurus 
Order me some lamb chards and some calamari 
See that comin next month I want that RR 
Fuck this bitch from  but she yellin ahh ah 
9 times outta' 10 niggas knew I was gon win 
9 times outta' 10 I was gonna get a  
.....Hard to keep it lowkey
9 times outta' 10 dawg' i know i'd get a rollie' 
 im on my   rockin up on 
Got carats on my ear it's hard to go unnoticed
No rosa gold just all white got me feelin holy
 he had that soft white hoe and now he stole it
That boy ain't got his own style my  so he stole it
Got my bank account still loaded you won't  to  the 
Yeah that's the homie' neighborhood roller you will never be my crodie'
Colder than a polar  a nigga the four degree
9 times outta' 10 you broke ass niggas can't get near me  to be  me
9 times outta' 10 niggas knew I was gon' win
9 times outta' 10 I was gon get a

Secure my vibe, hater get out my space
Foreign my car, hold on, foreign my bitch, okay
Big-ol' guns, hitters on deck, don't play

Heart frozen, you can tell I'm a product of the motherfucking slums
Strap in my palms, gorilla in the streets, yeah, 
Comme des Garçons with the Rick Owens on me, show 'em how to put this shit on
I'ma show 'em how put this shit on
Fashion show at Louis Vuitton
I put Dior on my Jordan 1's
I put the Rolls Royce droptop down
Got a nice breeze and I feel the sun
Biscotti weed coming out my lungs
Get a lot of G's, I can spend 'em for fun
 now I'm one over one
Young Gunna, Young Gunna the one
He talking real tough like he never been stung
I hope that lil' boy know I come with a gun
Slimy and shady, don't back down for none
I count up it daily, unlimited funds
 the money gon' come
I still got a habit, they thought I was done
Dark-ass shades, haters can't see my face
Secure my vibe, hater get out my space
Foreign my car, hold on, foreign my bitch, okay
Big-ol' guns, hitters on deck, don't play

Jumped right off the ship now I'm warm
Amiri my britches, I dior my kicks, I'ma show 'em how to put this shit on
My bitch can't wear 
Need a six  to perform
My lil' college freak like fucking in her dorm
When I  put the gang on a charm
With Gunna and I got a gun
Put that shit on, I do that for fun, been doing it since I was young
 I'm shining on time
Wipe that boy nose, when he know I was slime
 dripper, can't fuck with your kind
My diamonds, they blind
That's why I gotta rock...
Dark-ass shades, haters can't see my face
Secure my vibe, hater get out my space
Foreign my car, hold on, foreign my bitch, okay
Big-ol' guns, hitters on deck, don't play

Heart frozen, you can tell I'm a product of the motherfucking slums

Comme des Garçons with the Rick Owens on me, show 'em how to put this shit onYeah
Yeah, Gunna a rockstar 
Ice out the drip with a black car 
458, its a Nascar
But for London, I need me a Passport 
Mm, I dont got to act hard 
Got that beamer swaped out for the Jaguar 
I stay smokin' like I got a gas car 
Its a rover, it did come from landmarks 
Mm, i'm in that  )
Every other day, I pop the tag off 
Take her shopping, cause she got a wet mouth 
I went deaf on that bitch, let the cash talk
Cash in and cash out 
Blow the six and we pull up and air it out 
Sippin  hope I don't pass out 
Look at this bitch, she got her ass out 
And they know we keep guns like torpedoes 
Blow his face off, I shot through the peephole 
Got baguettes on my teeth, with the pink hole 
Baddest bitch, she came from Puerto Rico 
Dior bag, where I stash all my racks at 
I got  in the back of the Maybach 
I say fuck it, fill my face with face tats 
Camel toe, all my bitch got a fat cat
Niggas tried call me up, try to box me in 
I turned up to getting flats, come in millions 
Camouflage Gucci shirt like Chameleon 
And my drip got it wet, so i'm diving in 
Smokin' skittles, my back with a big loc 
And they know i'm on drugs like a rockstar 
Got a draco on my shoulder, I let off 
Pillow talking, i'm knocking his head off
The red dot on his face, like he rude though 
Got bad bitches on top of the rooftop
And these niggas gon' fold like a futon
Boy, the sauces not free, need a coupon 
Got a Glock 17, need some titties on 
And the lil' nigga sketchy, I don't feel the homie 
Foreign bitch ride the dick, like she seen a pony 
Put the bitch on white, now she call me Tony 
Yeah, Gunna a rockstar 
Ice out the drip with a black car 
458, its a Nascar
But for London, I need me a Passport 
Mm, I dont got to act hard 
Got that beamer swaped out for the Jaguar 
I stay smokin' like I got a gas car 
Its a rover, it did come from landmarks 
Mm, i'm in that  )
Every other day, I pop the tag off 
Take her shopping, cause she got a wet mouth 
I went deaf on that bitch, let the cash talk
Cash in and cash out 
Blow the six and we pull up and air it out 
Sippin  hope I don't pass out 
Look at this bitch, she got her ass out Love to get them grams in, but I ain't on romancing
So if I hold a bitch then I'm holding her for ransom
Pecknam is where my gang's from
I keep the notes high, cause that money is the anthem
Pretty little thing, any city that I'm in
Arse so fat, got the nigga's chances looking slim
But that nigga ain't me
When I'm in that pussy, thank God I ain't him
Bitches used to love, I love to choose
A girl that doesn't love the crew but falls in love when we cruise
Cruising through the city, loving the views
Drive nice and slow, watch her blow like a fuse
Tell a bitch rethink tryna refuse me
I tap bitches like I'm saying excuse me
I call up a few
Tell em come, get cozy in the jacuzzi
I love bitches on this shit, bitches love this promise shit
I don't promise shit, I let her polish it
She wants proper shit, they gave her proper shit
They cop her shit, I'm the opposite
Might pull her over like a copper though
She likes it proper slow, but I gotta go
That's why she wants beef
I just gave her the whopper though
Chocolate chop it down, let that chopper go
Bitches sell out, you got a copper ho
Call it wholesale
Walk in the pussy house with a lot of dough
Now and then I see a bitch inside
So now and then I fuck her on the kitchen sides
On the other side, but I ain't slipping
Still the bitch better let me slip insideCheck my clique bitch, we got tall racks 
Hit my bitch, told my bitch don't call back 
Felt like the shit, yeah bitch I'm all that 
Fall back, fall back 
You can't get in , we won't tax 
No credit or no debit, all cash 
Got some cake like Lil' Debby, aw man 
Fall back, fall back 
I be taking them racks 
I go with no mask 
Federal tax 
I don't play 'bout that cash 
Don't play with that cash 
I drive fast 
On the way to the bank 
Tryna fill up a bag 
Pull up in the Maybach 
Nigga play and get snatched 
Get you ate like a snack 
Hit your head with a gat 
Better not hopе you get wacked 
Ain't no going out sad 
Get you wacked like a rag 
Hurt your life with a tag 
Put that boy on his ass 
Put my foot on the dash 
Lord I hope I don't crash 
Put that shit on, might fail 
I'ma drip, I don't dab 
On the way to the lab 
Bitch you know where we at 
Check my clique bitch, we got tall racks

Music's my medication when I meditate 
Celebrating that I'm still, here to celebrate
Its hard giving love, when you're living rough
Its like you can never give enough for them to never hate 
Niggas ungrateful
Give a nigga a plate, niggas still hate seeing your plate full 
Niggas are hateful, but when your pockets full them same niggas wanna stay cool
You can stay cool in the freezer 
Got killers with no visa
Niggas pray to jesus when they end up where my g's are
Little nerds wanna beef hood
Click of the mac, leave your back looking see-through
I ain't got no feelings, fuck how that nigga there feels 
I'll have that nigga holding slugs like Bear Grylls
In my hood there's no smiles 
No smiles cause of rare meals 
I'm in the hood, but the hood ain't where my plans are 
Big plans where my fans are
I've seen pussy niggas dying over petty shit 
Cause in my hood disrespect is like cancer
Fuck a diss song, we've got guns that piss long 
They'll be pissed your gone, when you get pissed on
Pussy niggas get pissed on
Piss my niggas off the pistols, where they piss from

Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy 
Smoking on that ahhh
Sipping on that hennessy 
Smoking on that loud
Music is my therapy 
Yeah
Smoking on that
Yeah
Sipping on that hennessy 
We ain't watching any police
Me and all my niggas we get plenty of p's 
30 for the hennessy, 20 for the cheese
Got the cigarette, the rizla man are ready to breeze 
On the motorway all them niggas play is Skeppy and Gunna 
Another 100 grand and I'm ready for summer 
I tell em' jump in the pool if your watch is real
I could swim 100 lengths my shit would be working still 
I came in the game with the 8 ball, £400 and my tanita's 
My line went dead, told myself I gotta get them features
Now you turn on the radio, its my voice you hear in the speakers
I feel to go to my old school, and say suck your mum to all of the teachers 
Wait!, I think that's weed on the phone let me grab my charger
Told the weed when you talk to me, talk to me like you talk to the headmaster
But this weed just started schooling me and I was so obedient
I wish Bob Marley was alive, I just wanna share this experience

Music is my therapy 
Smoking on that ahhh

Almost can't remember what it looks like
When you do that thing with your face
You know, the thing, what's it called?
Smile
Right, can't stand that
I guess I could go watch an old video
Reliving the memories from so long ago
But it's not the same, friend
It's been far too long
That's why I wrote this song
To tell you...
I really miss your face Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Staring at the ceiling fan, following the blades
I see people passing by, my feet are stuck in place
If you asked my friends they would tell you that I'm fine
Don't question what I do it for, I'm fighting for my life
Now tell me what the future holds, one second at time
Cause I need to know why something don't feel right
It's time to be honest, I'm anxious
Was just thinking about it, I'm pacing
I'm tired of wondering, is this good enough
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm falling forward
I try to control my thoughts, but they get worse
I'm tired of wondering, is this good еnough
So tell me, is it good enough
Say I ain't the only one who hates to feel this way
Where these thoughts are coming from, I wish they'd go away
Cause I'm terrified, I'm scared of growing up 
All I wanted was to find the words
So that I could finally be heard
All I wanted was to find the words to help me find myself
It's time to be honest, I'm anxious
Was just thinking about it, I'm pacing
I'm tired of wondering, is this good enough
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm falling forward
I try to control my thoughts, but they get worse
I'm tired of wondering, is this good enough
So tell me, is it good enough
Ooh, yeah, ooh, ooh
Is this good enough
So tell me is it good enough
All I wanted was to find the words
So that I could finally be heard
All I wanted was to find the words
Oh, yeah
It's time to be honest, I'm anxious
Was just thinking about it, I'm pacing
I'm tired of wondering, is this good enough
I feel like I'm falling, but I'm falling forward
I try to control my thoughts, but they get worse
I'm tired of wondering, is this good enough
So tell me, is it good enough
Ooh
So tell me, is it good enoughFrom the second I started falling
I knew you'd let me hit the ground
Loved to keep me beggin' for all of your attention
Messing with my head when I'm wide awake at three in the morning
And even when you're not around
Swear that I can't take no more of all of these emotions
I need you the most
Ayy, you're gonna kill me either way
And I'm never gonna learn and you're never gonna change
Even when it hurts there's some pleasure to the pain
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy
Each and every night I pray, ayy
Please don't ever stop
You take me to the top
Just to leave me in the dark
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy
Each and every night I pray, ayy
If you won't let me choose
I'll take the pleasure with the pain
Every touch is a chain reaction
I come back for it every time
Saw the signs, but closed my eyes
'Stead of losing you, I'm losing my mind, yeah
It's hard to sleep, now I can't focus
Gotta hold of me and I can't control it
I'm half alive and you still don't know
You're breaking me inside, I don't even know why
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy
Each and every night I pray, ayy
Please don't ever stop
You take me to the top
Just to leave me in the dark
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy
Each and every night I pray, ayy
If you won't let me choose
I'll take the pleasure with the pain
Ayy, I'm a sucker for the pain
And I'm never gonna learn and you're never gonna change
Even when it hurts there's some pleasure to the pain
Baby, you're impossible to blame
Addicted to the pleasure and the pain
And even when it's driving me insane
I still want it, yeah, I still want it
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy 
Each and every night I pray, ayy 
Please don't ever stop
You take me to the top
Just to leave me in the dark
I stay, ayy, waiting for my heart to break, ayy 
Each and every night I pray, ayy

'Til a fire burned down her bakery
She got really sad and found a new hobby
She's the button-maker Naomi
Buttons were her specialty
'Til she poked her eye then she couldn't see
She wears an eyepatch and now she sails the sea
She's the pirate lady Naomi
Pirating was her specialty
Til she accidentally caused a mutiny
She had to walk the plank and now she's lost at sea
She's the missing person Naomi

Do you like pie?
Well, do you?There's one thing that I find so amusing
About this language that we're using
Others may find it so confusing
It's silent letters
Shhh...
The following letters should be seen, not heard
To non-native speakers this may seem absurd
So use these tips to help you pronounce these words with silent letters
Shhh...
B is silent when it follows an M
G and K are silent followed by an N
G and H you don't hear before a T
And L is silent before F, M, K, D
See it's easy, it makes total sense
For pysch- and pneu-, you remove the P
U is gone between a vowel and a G
WH as in "Where did the H go?"
I don't know where it went; why was it there in the first place?
So you may wonder why we keep them around
When these letters don't even make a sound
Listen closely to the reason I found for the silent letters
Shhh...
The magic E when it ends a word
Ensures that a long vowel sound is heard
Some letters help to emphasize the syllable that we should prioritize
And finally some other letters due to spellings retained
So the origins of the words can be ascertained
So with all this is mind, let's try to pronounce the following words
Shhh...
Salmon
Aisle
Colonel
Isthmus
Cockburn
Schenectady
"Though the tough cough and hiccough plough him through."
So some may say my list is not comprehensive
That's true, I'm not gonna get defensive
Rules and exceptions are quite extensive with silent letters
Shhh...
And although we make it so complicated
Their importance can't be overstated
I really wish they were appreciated
The silent letters
Shhh...Uh, this money came and all these bitches want my last name
This money came, now bitches be wantin' my last name

Man I've seen it all in my day, my day, my day, my day
Yeah I've done it all in my day, my day, my day, my day
Had to tell my mom "Don't stress just pray, it'll be ok"
But she ain't really tryna hear me cuz she love me, and ain't tryna lose her son, no way
GunnaTyme!
Man I've seen it all in my day, my day, my day, my day

Hey, hey, hey
Yo... Everything's good not a worry in the world, still I got some shit that's weighing heavy on my mind though
Went and spent a check on everything I ever wanted, barely had enough to get a present for my mom though
I'm a new Marine, got me feeling like a king, flexing balling harder than that muthafucker Rondo
Yeaa I'm doing good,but got a family in the whole, praying up to god but they ain't getting no response though
Swear my checks will barely make it work
And when I try to help it only make the shit worse
I'm robbing n*ggas tryna get my family out the dirt
I think it's time i went and found forgiveness in a church, Amen!
Forget about my sins every night I'm praying
Decided to apply what my mom was saying
Cuz I ain't tryna end up in a fuckin State Penn doing a couple long years with a bunch of gay men
Hell naw! Muthafucker
I ain't having that
Rather have my freedom riding dirty in a Cadillac
Rather smoke some weed, I'm getting higher than an acrobat
Be the n*gga laughing, you the n*gga I'll be laughing at
Lord!
N*ggas losing lives man this shit is not funny
Tryna dodge the feds I heard the County jail want me
Keep a pistol on me case them n*ggas try to jump me
I've done done it all and seen it all and boy I'm only 20, Got damn
Man I've seen it all in my day, my day, my day, my day
Yeah I've done it all in my day, my day, my day, my day
Had to tell my mom "Don't stress just pray, it'll be ok"
But she ain't really tryna hear me cuz she love me, and ain't tryna lose her son, no way
GunnaTyme!

Uh
Loyal to the soil, word to main I never break
In the world of oppotunist hella people fake
Most these women selfish and these men full of emotion
But I don't let it phase me and I know you've taken notice
What happened to the real?
I miss you niggas so
In the world full of billions sometimes I feel alone
Talkin' to the clouds out loud, how did it come to this?
The game is why the  timelines and it's the proof of this
The truth is this
They wanna crucify the message
Created in god's image, no I will never let it
What happened to the world Lord?
 it's probably where your favorite rapper at
It's all about the dollar so they ask me what it cost
If it's money over moral, everything is what we lost
Cause they know it
He don't listen
Uh uh
He don't listen, she don't listen
Cause they know it
You can give 'em everything, but they still blow it
Ego on a billion
Wisdom on zero
Ignorance on infinity
Anybody is their hero
Heavy is the head of he who wears the crown
But my head sky high, never lookin' at the ground
Focused on the future
Appreciate the present
Life is the greatest gift, better treat it like the present
Loyalty over love
Humans switch it up like weather
I ain't cut from a club, I'm cut from something better
It's all about the dollars so they ask me what it cost
If it's money over moral everything is what we lost
If it's money over everything then we have nothing
You see, money is based on belief
Haha
So if we didn't believe in it it wouldn't be money
You gotta use things and appreciate people
Not use people and appreciate thingsPutting on a show for me
She's putting on a show for me
Good girl but she's a hoe for me
She's putting on a show for me
Putting on a show
Putting on a show for me
Good girl but she's a hoe for me
Putting on a show for me
She's putting on a show
That cocaine and alcohol
That slow pain going down the pole
Dancing with the devil
Tell her dance on me without a pole
That bitch is down to roll
Bitch is down to go
That bitch is down to come
She said let her low when I'm 'bout to cum
She don't ask much
Before I went, I gave that arse one more touch
Putting on the show for me, I let her count that dough for me
Take the knickers off her first, she puts em on and slow for me
Good girl but she's a hoe for me
Brings out my bad side, but she's cool with both of me
Says she drives dick, so I let her chauffeur me
On both your knees, show me how you blow for me
I know you get high
But would you get low for me?
She's putting on a show, camera clips and photos
Pulling out my iPhone, then I put the settings on slow-mo
She loved me, not the CoCo, if I tell her to, she gon' go low
Only fucking with trill niggas, so them other niggas all homo
Yeah, and even though I wouldn't wife her
Swear down if I ever hit a lick, I'm gonna nice her
Love it when I'm hyper, ringing off my 
Sit up on my saddle, yeah, she ride it like a biker
Yeah, she putting on a show for me
Ride or die, literally, I make that bitch chauffeur me
On the kitchen stove for me, she whipping up them Os for me
Pent up in the spare room, she's putting on a  for me
Rats up in her yard, she never stole from me
Cause that bitch so loyal, she's so close to me
Yeah, and that's how shit's supposed to be
YeahI sing a song to the sound of my heartbeat
When I get lonely
Listen closely
Rest your head up on my chest and listen closely
I can rap to a hard beat
Fuck that, I can rap to my heartbeat
Hustle flowing through my veins
I feel it more when I'm feeling like I can't eat
That shit ain't adding up when that shit ain't adding up
I got coke in my system from all this bagging up
I could brag a lot because I never had a lot
You stay broke in this system when you ain't standing up
I was on my face, never had a leg to stand on
Now I'm hands-on anything I get my hands on
Streets is a gamble, rolling that dice
But I still appreciate any number that I land on
And keep rolling the dice
Niggas that you know don't like knowing that you're nice
I hate  so I'm showing them the ice
But it's only for the camera, nothing's showing but my eyes
When you only want the main thing
When you're gone, they want the same thing
There's a thin line, and it stays thin
Niggas turn python when their pay's thin
Gotta watch the snakes, doing what it takes
My life's a movie, I do a lot of takes
Tryna break the bank, I don't take a lot of breaks
Furthermore, I ain't got no brakes
She thinks she's hot to me, lot to me, fuck to me
Got a lot of bitches so why would she mean a lot to me?
There's too much money in the way
So anything you say, if you ain't talking money, it ain't got to me
Can't believe a talker but I talk like a believer
Music from the heart, gotta give this shit a breather
Tell em look past your surroundings
You will go far as long as you can see farYes you can, girl, yes you can
Yes you can, girl, yes you can
You can get this dick, girl
Bitch made me stop what I was doing
If it means come and get that pussy, I forgot what I was doing
It don't matter though
You know you're stunting on a bitch when she says "what car are you in?"
So what if I rent that shit?
She got me speaking from the heart like I meant that shit
I don't, texting me after, telling me to answer
Bitch, I won't
She's sexy though, got niggas tryna audition
I'm just tryna fuck, bitch, fuck that position
There's plenty fish in the sea
So I fuck, put her back in the sea and go fishing
But that's just me
Bitch is tryna adjust me
She says it's all about the trust
Would you trust me if I say you can't trust me?
You can get this dick, girl, yes you can
You can get this dick, girl, yes you can
I'm just tryna fuck
She's saying she ain't fucking on the first night
I can't stand them links and how they think, they're the worst type
She came from overseas for the first time
I said "if we ain't fucking, I'mma put you on the first flight"
Words can't explain, unless I get this verse tight
My dick's hard as a pole, her pussy's dripping like a burst pipe
So yes you can girl, yes you can
Don't be coming round here pulling scams
I'm tryna buss, and she ain't hoping that my bullet jams
But I'm pulling out so I won't be pushing prams
I'm too busy on the curb, pushing grams
And all I want is pussy, so can we make some pussy plans?
And talk zero nonsense
I ain't telling you no lies, cause I don't want you on my conscience
So baby, open up, confide in me with confidence
And if they say you can't, all you do is sing this song to emI can hear the crowd scream my name and I love it
You can look around and you still won't see me coming
Used to seeing clouds, uh, and now the sky sunny
I'm performing, Rolling Loud, got my fans, star-studded
I hustled as a child, went from nothing to something
Lost and I was found, I fell in love with the money
Remember they had doubt but I know only God can judge me
I remember they had doubt but you know only God can judge me
Treat you like my sister
I'm protecting her like Tony
I'm 100 to my homies
And unloyal to you phonies
Only speak the real
This a Gunna testimony
You fake as hell
And I can tell you tryna clone me
Go back to your town
Ain't no crown for no rogies
I come from Atlanta
Where we take a nigga cookie
Too much love, I handle it
I know he understood me
I'm like Trayvon in my hoodie
Lotta cash without no footage
Told her

Dripping like a fluid

Laughing to the bank

Fuck what you think
I know you thought I wouldn't do it
Fuck what you think
Young Gunna flowing like a poet
I can hear the crowd scream my name and I love it
You can look around and you still won't see me coming

{Ciaela's scene}
Wow, that looks delicious!
So let's put it in our mouths!!!Minns du än hur det var
När vi möttes du och jag?
Du var allting för mig
För jag såg ju bara dig
Och jag kände med ens
Det är dig jag vill ha
Och jag minns ännu orden
Jag sa:
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag
Jag kan se än idag
Hur vi gick där du och jag
Uppför altarets gång
Och med orgelbrus och sång
När vi vigdes och prästen välsignat oss två
Kan jag minnas vad jag tänkte då
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag
Efter åren som gått
Har jag lärt mig och förstått
Att där lyckan ska bo
Finns det kärlek, hopp och tro
För vi älskar varann
Och har det så bra
Och vi följer de orden jag sa:
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jagIt's a new world order//
Cold shoulders on my black skin//
Bringing heat like may-weather//
Take that like promethazine//
That means these bars are sick//
Only time you get blessed is when I sneeze on a track//
That's blessings on blessings, i'm taking the crown//
You better watch the throne//
So fuck your peace signs//
And fuck your co-signs//
I don't need that//
It's a never-ending story of a kid in a maad city//
Never gon' quit//
6 man, 6 god//
I been cooking with the wrist boy//
Watch that tone, boy//
So i'm stacked on d'usse//
So fuck what you say//
And fuck what you say//
Cause when a nigga reaching, they think it's a weapon//
And if my revolution don't get televised//
Tell em we the plug, we gon' improvise//
We a generation, moving on an elevation//
It's a revolution, for the evolution, of a resolution//
Never gonna back down//
If I stay myself, imma own this lane//
Like superman, i'm clark kent//
See the 's' on my chest, means SLR//
That means i'm all up in your face nigga/
Take them bars to the brain nigga//
Hook :
God complex
God complex
Got em on a roll
Now, that's a god complex
Verse 2 :
I spoke to god. he said fuck religion//
Humans fucking stupid thinking that we on high//
On the real though.. i been talking to em//
Conversations with jesus, zeus and allah//
I'm a motherfucking monster//
Niggas got my back, bitches with the racks//
Couple hundred stacks that i really don't have, i'm a monster//
Nigga, fuck the basedgod//
We hood like trayvon, the beat insane dawg//
The flow's amazing like online shopping, fuck the bass up//
Better thank the good lord//
Dank the whole floor, bitch you should know me//
Gunna be that nigga with a flow that's stable as 22 ponies//
Bitch so phony, you niggas don't know me//
I should really stop caring//
Young basquiat, i been rolling since i was born like ozzy and sharon//I can see the writing on the wall
And it's spreading just like an infection
The problem is we'd rather hate then love
Or blame improper font selection
Bold, italic, u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲
If we'd give it a moment, it could shine
To ban it would be a measure so drastic
How can you hate a font that's so fantastic?
Just watch how you kern it
Comic Sans is the best font in the world
If you want your designs to look like they're done by little girls
Comic Sans, best used in moderation
Come on join me, the Comic Sans Nation
And if I asked you to join the crusade
Would you do it without hesitation?
To cure the world of fontophobia
Eliminate all font frustration
'Cause, bold, italic, u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲
If we'd give it a moment, it could shine
To ban it would be a measure so drastic
How can you hate a font that's so fantastic?
Slanted is the new italic
Comic Sans is the best font in the world
If you want your designs to look like they're done by little girls
Comic Sans, best used in moderation
Come on join me, the Comic Sans Nation
And on the subject I just want you to know
That we've been pronouncing it wrong
It's true
The 'sans' part is actually french
So it should sound like "comic /sã/"
Mais ne t'inquiètes pas
Bold, italic, u̲n̲d̲e̲r̲l̲i̲n̲e̲
If we'd give it a moment, it could shine
To ban it would be a measure so drastic
How can you hate a font that's so fantastic?
Ha, it's time to make an Impact
Your favorite Mistral, yes you know I Rockwell
I bring it Extra Hot, but this is not Helvetica
Get a connection to any letter or number and we'll make it look 20 years younger
Whether you've got a tablet, feeling so wild
Or if you're more of a Bookman Old Style
O! CR A-game
We've got the best font in the world and I maintain
Girl, you're totally my type, CE
But let's avoid those Giddy Up STD's
Everybody put your hands in the Arial
Get 'em up high, and my Wingdings will carry you
In the Futura nation they use what I do
You're living in the past, I make these Times New
Roaming the streets, painting walls with my Brush Script
But there's a font of which I'll never get enough, it's
Comic Sans is the best font in the world
If you want your designs to look like they're done by little girls
Comic Sans, best used in moderation
Come on join me, the Comic Sans Nation
Comic Sans is the best font in the world
If you want your designs to look like they're done by little girls
Comic Sans, best used in moderation
Come on join me, the Comic Sans Nation
Comic Sans, the font that's misunderstood
Please don't use it for evil, but use it for good
Comic Sans, best used in moderation
Come on join me, the Comic Sans NationAye

All in your feelings

We don't catch attitudes
We catch bodies

 city fight night
 and Mayweather
 city in the ghetto
We call it AK weather
Soul snatcher

Dumb checker

Can’t wait to see your face
I’m coming over
Let’s explore this place
Running down these empty streets
No idea of who we’ll meet
But that sounds ok as long as you’re with me
We don’t have to go that far
We could stay right where you are
But tonight I think we that we should get away
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
Let’s make some magic
We could make magic
Pack your bags
Let’s take a trip tonight
Just stick with me
And it’ll be alright
Sailing on an ocean cruise
Gondola with stellar views
All of that sounds great as long as I’m with you
But we don’t have to go that far
We could stay right where you are
But I think tonight that we that we should get away
We could drive along the coastline
See crashing waves upon a shore
We could climb up on a mountain
Run around while the rain pours
Neon lights and flashing towers
Food we’ve never had before
I could stay right here for hours
See the world and so much more?Intro:
I swear man
I gotta teach niggas how to rap man
Haha yea
Verse
I can't feel these rap guys
Over hype buzz over night these niggas not nas
They bad habits, got a black casket for yall to sit in
I'm sinning, I'm not new to this villain role
The throne was made for a nigga like me to sit alone
And Rap dudes  act like they all get along
It's not authentic
Everybody friendly
Middle  finger well intended
Who not offended will soon regret it
When these lyrics start piecing
And I won't repeat it
Fuck you pee wee niggas
Rapping in a league you Can't compete in
I'm completely conceited
So the concept of you telling me im arrogant
Shit Just boosting my ego
In my pea coat, all black
Like I'm dressing for a funeral
Niggas working hard like they soon to blow
And I respect it and I'm receptive
To the idea, money evil, but I need it
Like my miggas need a fucking student loan
For a degree that dont guarantee a job and end up going aback home
That's fucked on different levels
I don't really trust, I hope to get to
Cuz life as a pessimist yea that shit get overwhelming
I'm not over zealous, motivated and loving the pressure
See Yall niggas lack substance
Lack lusters, how do niggas fuck with ya music
I Guess the generation changing
Something i gotta used to
I don't say shit for shock value
My value hot, whether or not I pop
I'm not pac but got props and that's me being modest too
I'm trying to paint visions
If fame come with it
Probably change elevate my game
Penetrate a few women with stripper names
Just being real
I got the juice
Women laughing at you like you Bruce, Bruce
I got a tight grip on hip hop
You ain't gotta clue
I'm star of the play, star player
You don't play apart
You don't get a Cue
This that oh shit he nice,and I do really fuck with him for real
My style, my skill, willing to take on anyone that step forward
I rep for
Bx
Fuck the bs
Need a rolls Royce
That's why I grind, columbine beats
I'm In a column by self
My own league
So I don't speak
Cuz I don't respect what you speaking of
Quiet mute it, trying gathering money til my family from it
Young breezy got the game and I'm a fucking run it
Outro:
Its only right that I do shit like this
Ahahah
Ya nah mean
I talk my shit, spit my lyrics and show you my lyrical prowess
Fuck you cowards
Dont doubt me
Im full of lyrics, you full gimics
You little bitches
Hahhaha
What drizzy say tho
Oh you gotta love it, oh you gotta love it
Ahhh yea

Folket står stolt med Dannebrog
Og hilser med juble de fodboldsko
Der sparker i mål og spiller en kamp
Så selv de største hold får tabt
Den danske ånd er stærk og strid
Af fightermod og selvtillid
La' Goliat bare komme an
Han bank skal få af danske mand

Vi slår dem alle, så'n er det bar'
Og gi'r den en skalle uden dikkedarer
Når bolden ruller er det 
Fra hvidt til rødt og rødt til hvidt
Støvlen er hård og hovedet koldt
La' os sammen spil' om den danske bold
Der' én vej frem, og det' i mål
Få sejren hjem og skrål, skrål, skrål
Vi har det
Åh-åh
Så dejligt
Å-å-å-åh
Så 'der bas
Det' én for alle og alle for én
Med finter og vrist og dribleben

Et hold der ved, hvad der skal til
La' nettet blafre i finalen
Nu ska' Danmark ha' pokalen
Gi' det danske spark en hånd
Brug nu kækt dit stemmebånd

So many times I could have changed but I remained myself
I swear to god that I'm so scarred from all this pain I done felt
Lord knows I'm sorry for that drama and that pain that I dealt
Was skippin school strapped with that tool
For who want act like a fool
We run him down and he get smoked just like a pack of them Kools
For Fred and Tracey I'm gone crash we put his ass on the news
I call up Yak and he gone slide now tell me what you want do
Bitch I'm a stepper
I ain't ducking pressure
Slide and get put on a stretcher
Two Glocks like I'm Lil Tecca
We gone send him up today
Talking out ya top we hit ya block and let that thing bust
Thinking shit be sweet I drop a bag and get ya brains bust
Jay up in that cell we ain't gone fold this shit won't change us
Put you on the news now yo lil pussy ass is famous
Go against the grain pick out yo grave this shit get dangerous
Shooting out the van we giving faceshots like the BangBus
Wanna do a feature told him go and get ya name up
I'm changing outfits the only way I ever change up
Drugs inside my body I pour red and get a stained cup
These killas that I'm with gone leave you dead just for to rank up
Pretty lil bitch she fucked my dawg and tried to come back
I told my opp's mama she won't never get her son back
Ridin with a tool Glock 32 bitch that's a fun fact
Plenty marijuana in my body where my lungs at
Say he got a bag won't hesitate we go and run that
Put ya hands down pussy bitch where all the guns at?
If he go to trippin call up Plucky and we on thatV1. I don’t got no wings but I feel like I can fly
Hold onto my dreams til the day I die
Head in the music got me feeling way up high
Had to let you know I’m gonna touch the sky
No matter what You know I’m gonna try
Won’t let this moment pass me by
Chorus. My momma told me anything is possible if you believe it// so I’ve been grinding so one day I can achieve it// if you try to stop me ima have to cut you off can’t nobody keep me from getting to the top// gonna learn to fly gonna fly so high// now sit back and watch me touch the skySomeone said:
'I saw a dancing man
on the beach of a green dream
with the smell that wandered in under the surface
In the sunset the dancer shone in red
He powdered his body with ground bones
mixed with the purple-red of spices
and splintered shavings of brick
What does it mean that he danced on the beach
surrounded by those who blindly saw the sun?'
It means he was dead
or would shortly die.
And you who have once seen such a strange man dancing
you yourselves will never dance again
be it in love, in hope or in despair
You are long since dead, all of you, and vanished.Verse 1
Yaw need to hold that
Little nigga back
Let that little nigga know
He fucking with a grown man
Keep acting like a Conan
You can get the cold hand
Better look around nigga
You in a surround nigga
Ain't no where to run nigga
Where you gonna run nigga
Niggas we don't cut slacks
Know we coming back nigga
All in black nigga ski mask nigga
See that nigga feed that nigga
Bullets come around like heat packs
Nigga eat that nigga
Hook
Man up say what's up lil nigga
Have a respect for a real nigga
Better show how you feel nigga
Better watch what you deal nigga
Cause the streets is for real niggasBeen in da fieldInstrumentalI can see the sunrise
On a cloud so far away
If only you could help me find my gun
I have the strangest boner right now
Give me back my pokéball
My mind says no
It's not your fault
I want your mom, your mom
I'm the one who ordered the crispy chicken
I'm not sorry
I ate my pony
Please don't go away
You know that old donkey?
Potatoes are itchy
The fridge is my best friend
I am a brony
What if I was a llama?
It's my philosophy
Take my banana
I took my love too far
You're scaring children
Don't ever say goodbye
I'm fatReal Thug baby I'm a Ruff Rider
We spinning on ya block and we ain't leaving no survivors
You know we got them Glocks and best believe we brought them rifles
We catch you out in traffic better hope you brought yo bible
Steady down bad on my ass
You ain't do shit for me
Post up with that cutter I can show you just how real it be
You was in that class while I was skipping school up in the street
Refuse to sell my soul can't give my life way to the industry
If that boy still breathing swear to god he ain't enemy
If you wan there before I caught that case you ain't no friend to me
Put the glizzy on ya fuckin dome just like some headphones
Just came thru fully loaded threw one back and got my head on
Was talking out his neck his family talking to his headstone
I heard his partner mad, he in his feelings cause his mans gone
I tried to tell his ass the shit I rap be what I stand on
Let's bang out
You can see how quick we bring them things out
AK47 on ya head gone bring ya brains out
I'm dying bout this shit so when you step know I won't stand down
I pull up on yo partner let it off and leave a man down
Fuck shooting out the car up in close range that boy get ran down
Remember I was broke for all them times I brought them bands out
When I had a dime ain't give me shit don't put yo hand out
This diamond choker shining on my neck you know I stand out
Just walked inside my house and found that bitch she got her pants down
Remember she had curved me, ran it up say she a fan now
Crossed me like Steph Curry I been clutching on my 30
They be asking me why I be so damn clean and still sip dirty
I ain't worried bout lil buddy he get knocked off in a hurry
I be playin with that cutter I'm tryn give ya homie surgery
You ain't seen no homicide I'm screaming RIP Lil Murry
I remember times was broke I hit the fridge during that burglary
I ain't really with the capping they ain't hard they just be rapping
Me and DeeDee on the porch was shooting craps was 10 and trapping
Told him let them shots pop off he wanna talk I'm bout that action
7.62 in the clip I dump this bitch turn you to fraction
Say he steppin on the gang I told him "Haha" like Clinton-Dix
Stepping wrong we stamp em on my soul we quick to end this shit
Real Thug baby I'm a Ruff Rider
We spinning on ya block and we ain't leaving no survivors
You know we got them Glocks and best believe we brought them rifles
We catch you out in traffic better hope you brought yo bibleVerse
I'm the illest
No if buts or probably
Fuck the game up with my honesty honestly
I'm Jamaican where Gangja be
Tell these women don't bond with me
Or get comfortable commonly
Cuz chasing these commas need
A Benz or Ferrari
Sometimes i feel I'm a king pin
Praying to Gotti
I'm equip, fit, still searching for purpose
Give your chick quick dick
And tell her she deserves it
I'm a god with these lyrics
I'm guiding you bitches
I'm kind but I'll remind you Instant
If crossed Kris cross jump
Please get off dick
I got thoughts, I'm pretty smart
I'm a bachelor
With bachelors and fucking cold heart 
I'm a rap Mozart, not in the trap but in fact I'm that dope boy
My skill level still deadly
You ain't that close boy
This sport I score the most point
You just a backboard boy
Or a back up cuz you lack the
Skill set or the practice
But the fact is
I'm a factor not an artist or a rapper
But a genius with an act for
Word play, these verbs brave, they surface and get at these Mcs that
Spit the worst phrase
The beast coming
Fuck all the quiet shit
And I'm the illest out the Bronx
For who inquiring
My style is in, I'm Kobe Iverson
Kyrie Ervin, observing, get murdered
Be careful who you colliding with
My work ethic is worth repping
If I want my nigga it's worth stressing
And If I'm all in then loyalty what you getting
Far from perfect
Ima Star in the making, draft day
Teddy bridge water
Spitting heat Retreat my nigga this just a warm up
This verse going to hit nerves
Get all niggas cautious
Like why you ain't warn us
For shit talkers this just bad karma
Hot temper, I got thing for
Artenders Latinas
Living la vida
Leading the allegiance
Of Young handsome
That make anthems
Of reaching dreams
Working like machines
Sacrificing weekends
So we can get mansions
TO Total opposite, y'all better wise up
I'm Fingering  your girl up
I ain't time to put the peace sign up
Please honor the flow or umma
Demolish with this polish college
But so street Demeanor
Looking cleanest out the borough

You a bitchCome into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
Come into my life, I got so much love to show you
I told her  start
Tempt her with an empty heart
A part of me is empty
And you end up with an empty part
The only other part is a pocketful
If it ain't the fam or the money then just fuck it all
So choose wisely
Tryna chase money and love, you lose twice
I just say fuck em all
Cause they ain't nice too when you're too nice
That's why I'm so ignorant
Gone too far like an immigrant
Then I come back like I never went
I'm so arrogant, I aim shit towards you with the arrow bent
I smell pussy, but who doesn't have a scent?
I mean that broke nigga probably doesn't have a pound
Let your money talk, I bet he doesn't have a sound
Hating on a nigga
That's the kind of nigga I can't hang around
Your girl calling you broke, but you can't call her a bitch
You wouldn't be calling her shit if she was calling you rich
Feels like when your money's down, your girls are calling you much
When your money's up, feels like they're calling you Mitch
That's how the game goes
Bitches get cold when your flame goes
Rainbows
True colours after that rain blow
Stunting on my ex like it's a new chick
Twisted bitch, a Rubik's
A rude bitch
Thinks she's quick too, bitch, I'm too quick
My next girl loves the game, she loves that hard coke
She's rather be half broke than heart-broke
That's why I show her love because she loves the game
These other girls, they just love to blameI got plenty bitches
And my bitches know that I got plenty bitches
I got plenty bitches
Top floor suite are all the 20 bitches
I bet one of them is your girl, bet I've fucked your hot cousin
Put that glove on, treat that pussy like a hot oven
But fuck loving, McLovin
To these hoes, told her talk when I'm not buzzing
I've got plenty
Top floor suite, looking penty
Talking 'bout the man, I hope you meant me
Fuck an escort, that pussy's rent-free
I can't tell a bitch "I ain't into you"
I'm just tryna catch her man out like an interview
Think he's big fish till I catch him
Told him "hand over the Ps or that's the end of you"
Had another bitch, she was thirsty
I met that bitch on a Thursday
Then I fucked that bitch on a Thursday
I fucked that bitch on the first day
By my top, you could tell that I'm getting Lizzy
In the wooly, shotty is my nigga Skizzy
Uh, blocka blocka from the trizzy
Some rich niggas that get busy
Shout my niggas on the strizzy
Told my young'un stay clear from them piglets
Phoned me bout the shipment
With that cling, I'll make a 9 look a midget
You niggas finished
Realest and the richest
Let me cook a body  figures
Told her tell her friends to come get with us
Wrist looking vally
Us niggas clean, you niggas dirty

Stuffed him in the Bentley, now we in a Feeling so empty, I got this pain inside
I just can't ignore it, no matter how hard I try
But I wish I could 
Really wish I could 
'Cuz I need it now 
Something that tastes good
Gonna get some food
Gonna get some food
Gonna go on the Internet to find a good place to eat
So many people in the world don't have a good place to eat
But I think they should 
Yeah, they really should

You’re almost there now
You’re almost there now
I’m still walking the same road
Wonder why I am tired of all
To reach a goal on the other side
All the bliss of life’s counted out
My body is older but still my heart
Is beating the same as from the start
There’s nothing else for me out there to find
So I keep running cause
I’ll never die
I’ll never go under
Beyond the clouds
I’ll be remembered
For who I was
And what I've accomplished
This I know

Cuz I saw the signs
You see them all over saying
Don’t give in just yet
You’re almost there now
Don’t give in just yet
You’re almost there now
I still wonder from time to time
If I am fooling myself with lies
It’s creeping up on me sometimes
That I should stop and just resign
But honey where would I even go
Cuz I’ve been closing all other doors
I've got stuck in the high tide
Gotta have faith in that
I’ll never die
I’ll never go under
Beyond the clouds
I’ll be remembered
For who I was
And what I've accomplished
This I know
No, I’ll never die
I’ll never go under
Cuz I saw the signs
You see them all over saying
Don’t give in just yet

So take my hand, take me there
Give me your heart girl, that's a dare
Let me own this, you know that you won't find
Another like me, it's hopeless
We on that coastline, ocean view
No time like now to get close to you
Reading all the signs, and I hope it's true
If I come on strong, will you come on too?
I know what I'm saying how it seems
But I could be the man of your dreams
Make me fall in love with you
And I'll make you fall in love with me
Come on come on baby
Come on come on make me
Fall in love with you
Come on come on baby
Come on come on take me there
I don't wanna play anymore
Come on come on baby
Come on come on make me
Fall in love with you
Come on come on baby
Come on come on take me there
I don't wanna play anymoreYea
Verse 1
You a honest student
Never staying out late
Me I'm the nigga with the worst kind of traits
I made some decisions that will blurr up your vision
But the best thing bout life that you Learn from mistakes
Momma never like me
It's no secret
She said you don't know love
Man You don't feel shit
No street shit
No sleeping At his apartment
Dont she know Having a heart is
Caring for someone regardless
Knowing Them or not
See I been down down down down
No one gave a fuck
No one said hi
How are you?
Are you okay?
I've been lonely
You came for me?
Baby, darling, we may argue
But that's between us
I ain't trying to be perfect
We dont have the world but..
We dont have the world but..

Everybody trippin

Verse 2
You got your priorities straight
You fine, I'm trying to figure out how long did GOD take
Because Your soul is perfect
Your eyes amazing

I never question that
But they question us
Cuz they setting traps
Like please dont fall in, niggas be talking
Bitches be all in
Our businesses
Smile on your face like strawberries
So sweet
See my lady walk with the groceries
And then my baby call me when she don't don't sleep
And everybody got shit say

And I know I ain't perfect and we dont have the world but..
We dont have the world but..

OUTRO
Life is a beautiful flower ready to blossom
I got you and you got me
And don't feel it awesome?
Flaws all on your lips ready for me to kiss
The thought of Losing each other and not coexist is a risk I'm not willing commit to
Yea We got issues, just like the rest of the imperfects
Not everybody connects
That's why most are still searching
And Love is deep, and trust is peace
Of mind I happy keep Once I leap
Into your arms, but the outside is trying to comprise us
Let's be conflicting​​Intro:
Yea
You gotta ride out to this
Its the Prequel
Verse 1
Young black & hungry
All these niggas acting funny
From a field of real niggas
I feel like one in a hundred
Or maybe a thousand
I fell like lately I'm doubting
I mean this world  is full with sharks
But no one Save me from drowning
This that god flow like I just left heaven
Bx repping
Niggas couldn't see me with their best effort
I set records
They Slept, I flex clever
Display that I'm fresh better
You know I stay steps head of
These over hype dudes
Once I hold the mic truth
Spitting I sit in a class own
I kick the real they asking for more
Now While they laughing at home
Im Know to spit the nastiest flows
If I had to cast me a vote
I pick myself, I'm sick as hell
Just pass me the thrown
Man this The prequel
And I see Thru bs most of the time
I climb ladders with this rapping
Not even close to my prime
Your flow will decline
You a clone who don't copied or stolen my style
Who ya kidding
I'm from New York City
Home of the God biggie
And I'm calling all the shots
Even tho that we all scrimmage
Taking more steps aiming for your chest
From these ghetto Floor steps
Man we sure bless
Life precious please
Let me explain these
Death take out the game
So to me life is a great league
And wonder will my niggas ever play free
Chorus:
My soul done been through a lot
And then my eyes done witness too much
Cuz when the sun dont shine
We still living life you know it, you know it
Cuz when the sun dont shine
We still living life you know it, you know it
Verse 2:
Look into my eyes i hope this window
Big enough you
Staring at wall, I feel im lost sitting up at 2 morning
Trying to find my self that's truly in important
What I'm learning
Whatever these lessons give
I'm hurting but  I carry burdens of a pessimist
The pressure is
Too great at times
If i search your mind
Who will I find
A soul filled with gold or a place where egos collide
You know what im going thru
Please don't imply
Speak to the people
This the prequel
Hope they feel me with time
I hope they feel me with time
I hope they feel me with time
I hope they feel me with timeFeelin' irie
But sufferin' because of my hip-hop lifestyle with no road to recovery
Music's like a mother to me
I feel at home every time I throw on some headphones, or
Maybe like a brother to me
Cause when I'm in a tight squeeze, I'm findin' peace when I release my mind
And I'm writin' these
Some of the time
The only reason that I do it is for pure soul recovery
Easin' my mind in one of those situations where I'm lettin' fear stroll in my mind
And so I go into a place with no dimension or time, and then
Astro and jet myself into a divine realm
Works every time, but when I let it go
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Slippin' in and out of Paradise, flippin' through the channels of life
It's all nice, everything is alright
And then an obstacle appears in my sight tryin' to frighten me
But I deliver the goods with fury and might, mind-heightening
Then my spirit will take flight, hear it or not, fear it or not, it's quite enligh-te-ning
I'm like ligh-te-ning on the mic, with fire bolts shooting outta my soul into your light, now
Everybody get in the circle and bust flows 'til your voices give out
Just like a tire from Firestone-
Red is the color that my eyes get
When I take a bowl to the dome, the full-blown fire hydrant
To each and his own, but I admire when
Someone grabs the mic and takes up total control
And that's what I'll be striving for when I open the door
Into another dimension of rap
Hardcore
Bridgin' the gap
As good as it gets, and beyond that, I don't hold back
I hold mics with cords attached
Now I go inside myself
While I take care of my spiritual health
Then I can tell all's well when I let it go
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
You know it's bad when
Breakfast is a "J" to the dome
A bowl of cereal
Barely enough to get your ass full
You know what's really bad?
DJ's
Claimin' they got soul
But yo the needle's jumpin' around just like a rodeo bowl
And what else?
I like rappin' and so
I'll enter a track in the flesh
To make it visual
For your inner-consciousness
Maybe I can take a trip inside of your
Spiritual-
Mind and find myself inside a prism of individual realisms
Travellin' up and down on your spinal chord
Make a detour into the core of your soul
Show that you and I are made up of the same materials
Mission abort
And now I'm back in my body and, oh yeah, thanks for bein' a good sport
I'm holdin' down the fort, my own option is
To rock it like every day's the apocalypse
And chop it up just like a double-bladed sword with a detachable fist
To attach verbal clips into the gat that I rap with
Just another hit
Blunt to the dome and I don't miss
It's the real-spoken every time I'm chokin' the slogans out of the throats of all these phony terrorists
Just, yo, know that when I'm throwin' down the hearts of these cowards like Hulk Hogan it's imperative
I'm sharing this with the Earth, for what it's worth, it's just a matter of time for Mankind
Either to get together or form apart in due time, so
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Now I go inside myself
While I take care of my spiritual health
Then I can tell all's well when I let it go
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhyme
Rhyme to the rhythm, the rhythm to the rhymeNew bitch, it ain't nuttin' new
Ducking from the pigs, it ain't nuttin' new
New beef, it ain't nuttin' new
I'm surrounded by some killers that'll duppy you
I love her, I, I, I love her
Thought she was the one until I met another
I don't diss the love, I diss the lover
Broke bitches tryna find love when there's money to discover
She'd rather talk dirty, I'd rather talk business
I'd rather talk money, you'd rather talk bitches
It's like they don't understand me
So like Lil Durk, I do it only for the family
Surrounded by some real killers
And nobody brags
Talking 'bout your bag of niggas
I'll have the niggas in some body bags
I lost a lot
Before you get that money, it can cost a lot
I lost a lot, I think I lost the plot
The young Gs are cold but them blocks are hotVerse
No lie, I don't know how to start this
Am I artist, rapper, poet
Shit What do  I call this
Music change fame is the target
And rapping to evoke emotion Is obsolete
Nah, It ain't a shock to me
Money cars clothes overdosing
Is the culture?
Yes it's global, less emotion,the notion of relating to the audience
And giving them something to cope with
Where did that go?
What do I care?
Long as I get paid to get play on air
I'll be fine, I be lying if I say I ain't  want the riches
From the ghetto steps, escaping threats
Who wouldn't trade it all for this money the women
The hunnies giving the greatest head
Dont lie
I'm narcissistic, artistic, authentic
Ahh this is
Words not verbs but nouns with feelings that are hitting
The mind, the demise of my time
Got me feeling pressure
I take walks just to kill the pressure
Question let's address it
Would you rather be alive hating
Or be six feet regretting
Life is unfair let's accept it
Mow Why trust when you're pulling knives out your back
And Why love? Cuz When it's gone
It eats your soul
That's my perspective
But fuck it to each is own
I'm reaching goals, I'm eating good
My style dope, moscato
I'm pouring when it's cold
Outside to keep my going
Am I crazy?
Ive been talking to ghosts lately
Harboring hatred, heartless ladies
Often cross paths with me
Deadly encounter, I ain't no good
She ain't no good, so nothin good come out if it
I'm allowed to vent, my sister going to college in fall and in proud of it
And people asking for the music
And to be totally honest man Ive been out of it
No inspiration
I'm still getting texts like why we don't talk?
And Still no explanation
And side bar don't like girls that born the End of April
Old habits stills chasing
I'm running, feet caving
I wonder if my music good enough to keep aging
I think, fuck what everyone thinks
Opinions belong everybody
And I can't please everybody
I'm steve with no modification
Weed in modern ages, as we inhale
We inherit the themes of Marley and the whalers
My life good at times roller coaster ride
Describe what transpires on the daily
My student loans on rotation
Can't afford to miss a payments
Miss days withs no bills, I'm still hating on my childhood
Lost in this life, I often need insight
My insides in time will ignite and release the beast
Cuz I been holding too much anger
And I been Hoping god answers
Me and my father don't speak
And Do I still miss that banter?
And I been thinking boput calling
But Should I still plan it?
She said miss she miss her period
Should I still panic?
I don't know
Outro
I guess I needed to get to this point
To get the point
Life is short, times are unsure
So I tie my loyalty to loves ones
And We all need someone to adore
What money can't buy
Is what time affords
Feelings, realness,a  genuine voice

Holy water dripping
Only God can get this
I'm climbing  ever ladder of this chamber of life
Material life is addicting
My niggas chained to these nikes
Give them some change
Buy some ambition
This is basquiat spitting
In the form of lyrical wisdom
I'm a peasant in a lyrical kingdom
I'm the hungriest, young Simba
Young phenomenon, I speak loud
I leave ears,eyes in a state like "oh he God"
Young rebel from the Bronx
Don't fuck with him man oh be wise
Thought provoker, talk what over
Nigga I'm the leader
Of the new school, My truth choose to, chew through
All you fake soon to
Be exposed niggas
I'm a dope nigga I'm suppose to think that
You niggas whack you suppose to sit back
And watch me shine, monster style
How am I
Not one to look up to
Not once you should trust dudes
Shady is a trait shared a lot these days
Cops these days
Spraying and tase
And if Your phone ain't charge to capture these boys
You and your justice will be laying in graves
Shit is fuck up, i still rock my hoodie
Tell your Stereotypes to suck nuts
Not every black nigga bus guns
Verse 2
Cole I hear you
They addicted to likes
They admitted to being side chicks
They sipping these whites
Have no assets but bragging that they balling for some rimz
Are these facts?
Are we trapped?
No role models, just a lot of niggas bragging
How they toe tagging showing big stacks
I was born in an island, where the murder went top 5
No I ain't proud
But these condition, conditioned a nigga mind to think life's is a bitch in a bloody gown
My middle finger sync up for who thinking I should dumb it down
Ain't shit cool about being misused
That shit will make you angrier than New Yorkers when the Knicks lose
But let me melo this
Trying not to be a pessimist
But really?
Can I save this generation with one track? One bar, one rap, encore, Im  not sure cause when I said it first time you heart beat was sent for
Outro:I just can't say no when you look at me that way
We been talking a lot
Can't you tell that I'm not messing around this time?
Yeah
I've been putting you first
Hard to put it into words
When I fall into your eyes
Something makes me lose control
And I'm down to risk it all
And you tell me you don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
I just can't say no when you look at me that way
I'd jump across this world to see your face
Just for one second or one day
I try and try, but I just can't say no when you look at me that way
I'd jump across this world to see your face
Just for one second or one day
And I'm never gonna let you go
I just can't say no
I just can't say no
Seeing you in my mind
Wearing nothing to hide
I'm just hoping that you stay the night
See you stealing my heart
Watch you dance in the dark
Love the way you're not afraid
Something makes me lose control
And I'm down to risk it all
And you tell me you don't wanna be alone, wanna be alone
I just can't say no when you look at me that way
I'd jump across this world to see your face
Just for one second or one day
I try and try, but I just can't say no when you look at me that way
I'd jump across this world to see your face
Just for one second or one day

I try and try, but I just can't say no when you look at me that way
I'd jump across this world to see your face
Just for one second or one day
And I'm never gonna let you goGot something for you
Cause I, cause I adore you

They mad as a bitch steady hatin I'm on
When they pull up that choppa gone ring like a phone
I had to hustle just for to survive
See a lot of my homies got life or they died
Eddy got life charged with 2 homicides
And Lil Reggie got smoked all because of his pride
He think he hard cause he clutching a glizzy
Go tear up his block I'ma make that bitch feel me

Ain't beefin with Floyd but I ride with them .50s
He get outta line and get hit them semis
Bitch say he steppin

You know I can't slide if I ain't got that tool
Up with this choppa hop out act a fool
We gone smoke his ass down like a pack of some Kools
Don't give no fuck bout yo homie in prison

Gudda shit, Free TooliClouds and thunders standing in my way
But I must try to figure it out anyway
Songs of worries travel with the storm
But I must try to figure it out alone
Yes I must try to figure it out alone
And now  when you're gone 
I know things won’t be the same no more
I'm sure it'll take a while cause I’m still sore
Yes now  when you're gone 
I know I still have a long way to walk
I'm sure it'll take a while to reach the golden shore
Walls and mountains standing in my way
But I must try to figure it out anyway
Tales of worries travel with the storm
But I must try to figure it out alone
Yes I must try to figure it out alone
And now  when you're gone 
I know things won't be the same no more
I'm sure it'll take a while cause I’m still sore
Yes now  when you’re gone 
I know I still have a long way to walk
I'm sure it’ll take a while to reach the golden shore
I must try to figure it out alone
Yes I must try to figure it out aloneDear Ye
We need you out this sucking place
It's been heartbreak since you dropped 808
My beautiful dark twisted fantasies in exeption
The shoes been cool, but the music you neglecting
Late registration, but you aced the semester
College dropout that May, something better
Graduation we was proud like Obama won
Yeezus dropped but wasn't sounding like 
Close to watch the throne and cherish it like the lotto
You get lost living the life of Pablo
Remember 'Bush he don't care about black people'
Fast forward to Trump, still don't care about black people
Make it great again, tell me when was it ever
I heard Yeezus walk, you were supposed to make it better
But instead you talk before you think
Somebody get the spoon in the cut before he seek
We want you back on that good life shit
Speak up for and not against Beyonce shit
We know Taylor didn't deserve that award
But you cut in your own legacy, your tongue is the sword
Slavery was a trace, but you ain't mean it like that
Posing with the devil, you ain't see it like that
 from the belly of the beast
You owe it to your fans and you  teach
Intentions is good but your actions is off
How you supposed to be God if your actions is lost
Get back to your soul or become a fallen hero
For you make it to the top and lose it all like Nina
What good is the money if you don't know how to use it
Roc-A-Fella you always make good music
But let me step, I ain't tryna start a fire
Somebody crashed a car, so he can spit it through the wire
GunnaOnce you on it then I'm off it
So tell me if you need it then I got it
Yeah it's so amazing how it's sounding
Growing up but I gotta keep my grounding
I'm in this independent
Not stopping at a finish
20's on my whip stay spinnin'
My wrist stays tickin' while it glisten
I told you Imma show you how to get it
Make your life look like a story nothing rented
You can't see me in the Fini
Ride around the city windows tinted
I've been living like a king
Type of shit you see all in your dreams
Tryna flex but boy what you mean
You not on clean like me
Once you on it then I'm off it
So tell me if you need it then I got it
Yeah it's so amazing how it's sounding
Growing up but I gotta keep my grounding
I'm coming fast like andale
You on it late you on delay
Put my vid on on demand
Give you all that view per pay
Get a house out on the beach
My backyard got hella waves
Future life in a better place
Not in the future gotta live today
Dip
Dive
I only do work for a prize
Fly
By
You see me and know I'm sky high
Choose any one they all mine
Choose any time it's my time
Choose any word and I'll rhyme
On the come up cuz I shine
On the come up cuz I'm pretty
Your girlfriend probably been with me
Your ex's probably been too
Count it up I got plenty
On my water shit like Sea-Doo
I'm in the light I can't see you
Fake ones are see through
Had a feast now I don't need food
Tons of gas pouring out my section
Point the arrow in the right direction
I leave her speechless every session
I had to teach her with the lessons
Rewind her run it back
I want this time to everlast
But the only thought I got is cash
Plus I'll add a thought for that ass
Once you on it then I'm off it
So tell me if you need it then I got it
It's so amazing how it's sounding
I'm growing up but gotta keep my groundingMinns du än hur det var
När vi möttes du och jag?
Du var allting för mig
För jag såg ju bara dig
Och jag kände med ens
Det är dig jag vill ha
Och jag minns ännu orden
Jag sa:
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag
Jag kan se än idag
Hur vi gick där du och jag
Uppför alltarets gång
Och med orgelbrus och sång
När vi vigdes och prästen välsignat oss två
Kan jag minnas vad jag
Tänkte då
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag
Efter åren som gått
Har jag lärt mig och förstått
Att där lyckan ska bo
Finns det kärlek, hopp och tro
För vi älskar varann
Och har det så bra
Och vi följer de orden jag sa:
Vi ska gå hand i hand
Genom livet du och jag
Om det händer ibland
Att vi lessnar någon dag
Ska vi trösta varann
Det är så det ska va
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag
Vi ska gå hand i hand, du och jag

I already bagged the pole 
You niggas too scared to go 
I clean up like hands and soap 
Get a mink, let it drag on the floor 
It's a nine in the bag that I tote 
Workin' hard, we ain't havin' no hope 
Bitch, I'm the man 
Did it with no advance 
Gave my nigga a chance 
Tryna see what he gon' do 
He done ran up them bands 
I done got me some bands too 
I could drip on the 'Gram too 
Said my hood like the damn zoo 
I can't decide, which foreign car I'ma ride, mmh
That Phantom Rolls body is wide 
I made the boy bleed like the watts, mmh
I put some more rocks in the watch 
Middle finger to the cops, mmh
Me against the world like 2Pac 
Say the wrong word, get you shot 
The whole world love you when you hot 
Thank God, He gave me a shot 
The same ones that thought I was shy 
I took off and went straight to the top 
You can't feel me, a nigga too high 
You need to stop livin' a lie 
You know we keep sticks like the Chi' 
I knew I'd be rich 'fore I die 
They won't respect you 'til you try

I got luck like a charm 
Fifty racks on her arm

Fuck these hoes like it's porn

Oh, I can go on and on 
My car is a foreign 
I crank up and start soarin' 
My heart is torn 
Shoot a movie like Barry Gordon 
A star was born 
My left wrist like a damn storm 
I got luck like a charm 
Fifty racks on her arm 
My tsunami a storm 
I stay fly, I was airborne 
Fuck these hoes like it's porn

My life a lil' fun 
Ain't no one of my hoes boring 
Got Chanel by the ton

Skinny jeans with a gun 
Play with me, it's a whole war 
I ain't finished or done 
We got some, but we come to get more

What Would Hank Green Do? 
Megamix 2014 This song is dedicated to anyone who ever had a bad manager
I heard a rumor, they've been treating you bad
These allegations, they just make me quite sad
Myocarditis?
Oh no
And gastritis?
That's bad
Mishandled Visa?
Terrible
Kidney disease-a?
I can't believe it
So they might be the biggest company
The leaders of this very industry
But if there's one thing that's true
It's that I'll be there for you
You're #1 on the chart of my heart
I won't treat you like...
I won't violate your basic human rights
13 year contract? Babe, I won't have that
We'll be exclusive until you want to go
I won't treat you like...
I'll be so much better 'cause I'll do you right
Won't try to exhaust you
'Cause what if I lost you?
Won't try to control you unless you say so
Now I know it seems like I probably don't know what I'm talking about
And to a certain extent, I don't
But what I do know is that when people work hard for other people
They deserve to be treated and compensated fairly
Anything else is exploitation
I won't treat you like...
I won't violate your basic human rights
13 year contract? Babe, I won't have that
We'll be exclusive until you want to go

Everything I swear this cash rules
Yeeahh, I’m chasing this money like a marathon
Gotta make my family some millions
I’m makin’ these hits just like I’m Barry BondIf I ever lost you, I would lose myself
I built my world around, thinking that you'll be around
Forever isn't long enough, I think I need more time
'Cause I didn't know the best of me, 'til I gave it all to you
I didn't believe in meant to be, but now I know that it's true
If I ever lost you, I would lose myself
If I ever lost you, I would lose myself
If I had to watch you walk away from me and fall for someone else
If I ever lost you, if I ever lost you, I would lose myself
How did I live without your smile, I can see it now
Forеver isn't long enough when I'm by your sidе
When you're not here with me, you're in every song I sing
Even when you're out of reach, you're never not on my mind
If I ever lost you, I would lose myself

Over a thousand  yeah, yeahMaybe our lives were not meant
To collide from the start
But who could foresee the fall?
Maybe it's time to decide
What to do with the fact
That it happens to us all
From time to time it all comes around
And no one knows the end
We're all building bridges slowly
Tearing them down fast
To start over
We're all trying to come over
Memories of the past
And start over
The past can start over
Ooh, start over
Stay alive to prevent
All the chaos
But happiness can't wait
And maybe it all would come clear
If we knew how to act
For each other's sake
From time to time it all comes around
And no one knows the end
We're all building bridges slowly
Tearing them down fast
To start over
We're all trying to come over
Memories of the past
And start over
We're all building bridges slowly
Tearing them down fast
To start over
We're all trying to come over
Memories of the past
And start over

The past will start overDown on my dick ain't give me shit I feel it's time to take it
Pain left me scarred sometimes I cry and I can't even fake it
Showed loyalty to a snake so I feel like love is dangerous
All the shit you did ain't forget
I'ma leave you brainless, and
The way you crossed me I swear that I just can't understand
I ain't perfect I'm human I'm tryna feed the fam
These hoes goes hate once you make it they turn into a fan
Homies acting strange they gone change up all for a couple bands
I'ma put the opp on a shirt heard he think I'm pussy, naw
Speaking on my name telling lies but that shit ain't true at all
Gotta feed the bros who stayed solid when we went thru it all
Had to understand no one catching you
Solo you gone fall
I don't give a fuck if you family, you changed
I'm thru with y'all
Can't forget the times I was locked up I was talking to the wall
Free all my brothers heart frozen until Lil Tooli call
Yeah
I'm steady waiting for that payment
When my brother step we leave you dead up on that pavement
Them shots start popping off police tryna figure where yo brain went
We got plenty caskets for you and them folks you came with
We don't give a fuck boy you a opp for who you hang with
We beefing with yo partner so his ass you gone stained with
Gang shit
No lame shit
Don't step up out yo lane bitch
This .40 on my hip gone get to busting get yo brain split
The section that I'm from we don't see love we just see murder
Lost my thugs to homicide can't leave the crib without my burner
I refuse to let them take me
They hate me
Won't let it phase me
Lately I been going crazy
Might kill my partner for acting shady
I pray he don't make me
Joe died and that shit there changed me
I'm gone take care of yo baby
Just talked to yo old lady I'm hoping she don't still blame me
I still blame myself sometimes even though I know she forgave me
And
R.I.P to all my dead homies
Make it out the hood and I'll still walk round with this lead on me
Gunshots, hard to sleep I just hear gunshots
Reaching for my neck last thing you hear gone be a gunshot
YeahSunshine drippin' summertime slippin'
Gotcha shades on blue jeans hangin' off your hip
And rockin' that Rolling Stones tee
Listenin' to some country
Your arm out the window
That smile lettin' me know just what you got on your mind
You don't have to say a thing
You know I feel the same way
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' then you're thinkin' 'bout forever
And forever sounds good to me
If that ain't what you're thinkin' and you're thinkin' somethin' different
Forget I even said a thing
I ain't even kiddin' girl the way the way our lips are fittin' all so perfectly
So if you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' and you're thinkin' 'bout forever
Forever sounds good to me
Moonlight fishin' startin' skinny dippin'
Wearing nothing but a smile as you lean in for a kiss
I'm livin' this nitty gritty drink
It's gettin' better yeah you better believe
Stars on the river, bright and gettin' bigger
Like diamonds in the midnight sky
Yeah you don't have to say a thing
You know I feel the same way
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' then you're thinkin' 'bout forever
And forever sounds good to me
If that ain't what you're thinkin' and you're thinkin' somethin' different
Forget I even said a thing
I ain't even kiddin' girl the way the way our lips are fittin' all so perfectly
So if you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' and you're thinkin' 'bout forever
Forever sounds good to me
If you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' then you're thinkin' 'bout forever
And forever sounds good to me
If that ain't what you're thinkin' and you're thinkin' somethin' different
Forget I even said a thing
I ain't even kiddin' girl the way the way our lips are fittin' all so perfectly
So if you're thinkin' what I'm thinkin' and you're thinkin' 'bout forever
Forever sounds good to me
Forever sounds good to meSo you wanna party with the band
Drink a case of beer and get slam canned
Been floatin' that bill for over a week
Grab your girl kick off your bare feet
Old Bronco's brand new Jeeps
Super Swampers let the muffler sing
You can ride with me I'm an outlaw hick
One fist pumpin' and the other packin' dip
On a flatbed truck generator in the back
Lights strung up and the band kickin' ass
On a farm in a barn by an old John Deere
We got the music you bring the beer
I want some real country
I want some real country
You say you wanna roll with my crew
Can you sip Jack Daniels with a jaw full of chew
And if you do after that can you sing
Dancin' jumpin, not spill your drink
A ol' brown band with a 318
Listen to the hillbilly hummin' machine
Ride with me I'm an outlaw hick
One fist pumpin' and the other packin' dip
On a flatbed truck generator in the back
Lights strung up and the band kickin' ass
On a farm in a barn by an old John Deere
We got the music you bring the beer
I want some real country
I want some real country
I want some real country
Yup yup
I want some real country
Woo
Yeah
Get up
All right
Ow hey
I've been cooped up playin' in the bars and venues
City girl don't you know I love you
But it's time this cowboy breaths
I need a mud run out in the country
Call your friends save five grand
We'll play the party where the blacktop ends
Come on
Ride with me I'm an outlaw hick
One fist pumpin' and the other packin' dip
On a flatbed truck generator in the back
Lights strung up and the band kickin' ass
On a farm in a barn by an old John Deer
We got the music you bring the beer
I want some real country
I want some real country
Yup yup
I want some real country
Come on
I want some real country
I want some real country
I want some real countryVerse 1
Running low on emotions
See how I'm coping
Styrofoam filled with liquor

 This the night when my eyes low
This the night where the times go
Slower than you know of
 Some on the homies on the run from
Cops cuz nuff man bun di ganga

And every nigga on the block want a dollar

Hook
I close my eyes so that I can I breathe

Like do you understand for real
Cause i've been through much,Well I been

Cause i've been through too much
Cause i've been through too much I've been through too much
Verse 2
Running low on emotions

Blunt filled with leaves

This reminds me im in high school
Uhh I've been cold for too long
A few flaws I'm too lost
Will the shit ever change my nigga
Will these niggas stop that pretending shit
Will these bitches ever be genuine

They stabbing see the knife wounds
You know u fake so what you tryna prove
Cause life turn a nigga this way
No more tears, see a nigga escape

Cause what? Cause I done turn a pessimist 
And I see too much stress in this 
Momma im gon be alright 
But I still
