Some things don't change, I can't complain 
I try not to think about you
What can I say? Every time I get near you
I want that old thing back, now bring it to me

And some say there's levels to this shit
Damn look at all the levels that I skipped
Feeling like there's a medal I should get
All these haters getting heavy on my dick
Look at my niggas, chasing paper
Getting books with my niggas
So how the fuck can people back home say I shook on my niggas?
Your two cents ain't working for me
All you niggas sound commercial to me, man
I don't like commercial niggas
Please shut the fuck up before I hurt you
Don't take it personal 
This a Derby City come up, this a Derby City vertical
First 48, straight murder you
For years and years we waited on this
Living in a place folks didn't know exist
Surprise motherfucker, we up in this bitch
I said I'm back and I'm so much better
I'm so, so much better
And I won't stop 
I can't stop
Not now  not ever 
Louis slugger with the hits
Knock them out the park then I'm knocking down your bitch
I'm watching how you pitch
I'm not from Houston, no, I'm not from 'round the six
Got the four series, I should cop the six after the World Series
I just talked to Rich 'bout palm trees and bad bitches
And how these snakes can harm me with bad business
Damn, fuck out of here, nigga
It's very rare for young black men to come up out of here, nigga
Some will call it luck and some will call me up
I ain't heard from you in years
Please get the fuck out my ear, nigga
My peers get it
Only G-O-D can judge me, fuck the jurisdiction
I'm working, ain't got time for thirsting
Over how these chicks appear in pictures
I'm just painting crystal-clear pictures
Brushing up on my lyrics nigga
I just wish momma was here to live up under chandeliers with us
I guess all I ever had to do was take this shit a little more serious
Let's get it
There's not much to say
Woah, I'm from the Southside
God Tiller
DamnI think she love me, 'cause I got the check on me

Scratch out my name, put the X on me
You should come check on me

Fuck it, might as well get undressed for me
Love how you get that pussy wet for me

Couldn't see I was the best for you
Now you gotta figure out what's next for you
Now you feel regret, oh, do you?

You ran me dry, bet it gets to you 
Out of respect for you

Stepping out, know I want you on the side of me
Mama, you could come work, full-time with me
Roll through in the Bimmer, get inside
'Til the wheels fall off, that's how long you can ride with me
Yeah, that's word to Stephen Garrett, come ride with me
Say it one more time for you

You remember...all them times
You used to come keep me company
Tell me you love me and just me
Oh and it took a while to trust me
Girl I had to work for it
Still you don't judge me
I love the way you touch me
I'm feeling like I'm 'bout to lose you
With all the shady shit I do to you
Some things are better left unsaid

Better left unsaid
Everything that I regret
No lie girl when I tell you, you a blessing 
Girl just let me make corrections, yeah

Tell me that it's over
No, I don't deserve you, the shit I never told you
There's too many things, I can't look you in the face
I just grab you by the waist and act like everything's okay
Bare with me girl, I'm trying to be honest
Tell you what you need to hear, just not yet
I'm barely getting started, I'm being cautious
Girl that's the hardest
All we been through, look what we've been through

If you'd just let me explain 
Baby oh

Young Tiller!Baby sometimes I feel so naive
Thinking you would come back to me
Say I fucked up, I'd have to agree
But second chances I do believe in
Just give me one reason
We fight, make up then fuck
Girl that's the sequence
I've been dreaming about the most recent
I don't lie, no I don't pretend
And your guard up, that's defense
Let it down, girl I swear I won't let you down
I ain't 2Pac, don't get around
Was clueless at first but I get it now, I get it now
You know all of my secrets and
You know all of my weaknesses
I can't give that to someone else, none of these weak bitches
Gotta tell them hoes keep distance
Miss how you whisper go deep in it
Please don't do that with no one else
Just me, is that too much?
Is that too much? yeah
Is that too much? oh yeah yeah
Am I asking for too much?
Say this shit once, say this shit two times
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many times
Is that too much?
Truth be told I know that somebody
Somebody as real as me, someone as sincere as me
That's what I'm afraid of
Don't you dare give him the same love
Cause what that man do girl, I can do it
Hold up one time baby girl, I can prove it
But this right here, so time consuming
And this right here got my mind confusing
What now what now, one day one day you'll come around
Like "Fuck them niggas, I'll shut 'em down"
Sex Mami I'm needin' it
Thirsty much I gotta replenish
If I get it back you know I'm keepin' it
Baby, I been deep in my thoughts like
Is that too much? yeah
Is that too much? oh yeah yeah
Am I asking for too much?
I won't stop 'til I get back what's mine
I know I fucked up one too many timesYeah, Rambo
They beggin' for mercy, like the Lambo' 
Know they told me kill 'em all, goddamn, though
I know they wanna see me fall, look where I am, though
On two feet, that's where I stand, though
I'm a true fuckin' killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em 'cause I can, though 
I just signed a deal so big that it's a secret
Victoria's Secret Angels dancin' 'round me for a reason
Spread your wings for me like I'm Freddie Mercury
But baby, you should call me King, you know that it's my season
I'm 'bout to re-up, made another killin' in Reno
I couldn't leave her until I paid a visit to P.O
Too much tequila, I had too much tequila
They cuffed me like I was single, fuck it, I'm back to Henny
Thank the Lord, didn't kill me in the elevator
Wasn't my time, saved my soul downstairs for later
Cheat death every day, never play fair
Roll stress all day, blow it in the air
Had to kill the pop game so they know what's up
Now I'm poppin' back swift, had to shake it off
Sobriety is an enemy, I'm sorry, mama
Society now acceptin' me, pray for the young ones
I'm from the Scar town city
No love from the town where a nigga never ever blow up
Now they love me 'cause I shine, shawty
If you ain't fuckin', then it's time, shawty
I see the truth inside your eyes, shawty
If you don't love me, then you lied to me
If you don't love me, then you lied to me
Swallow all your pride for me
Or you can swallow all the time for me
Now you can tell me how that taste, girl
Gene Simmons tongue, but I ain't down for the kissin'
My nigga got a scope, and I ain't talkin' 'bout the rinsin'
My niggas hittin' notes, and I ain’t talkin' 'bout the singin'
I'm breaking billboards from my city, got me thinkin'
I'm a motherfuckin' villain in my town, Heath Ledger, 'bout to O.D
Married to the game, I ain't never gettin' cold feet
Killin' all these lames, lot of motherfuckers owe me
I just stay quiet, I just let the money climb high
Yeah, like Rambo 
They beggin' for mercy, like the Lambo 
Know they told me kill 'em all, goddamn, though
I know they want to see me fall, look where I am, though 
On two feet, that's where I stand, though
I'm a true fuckin' killer, like Rambo
No ammo, they see me on the Sanyo
Nigga, I just kill 'em 'cause I can
Ain't have the time, but I got time now
Okay, I see what's on the line now
Oh, he let up? Bitch, let me find out
I might have to turn up, I mean turn this shit upside down
And let's keep it cool, I see the fear inside their eyes now
Crunch time, think I might have spared his life one time
Felt the storm another time, okay, now it's fuckin' time
Forty-five to run time, I fortify my run time
That's why they flee when they saw me come up on the front line
Fuck with me, seen them shots flyin', oh, what's wrong now?
Revenant, I show up there in blood like it's on now
Really tryna see me in my muhfuckin' zone now
Just another day to me, but Weeknd on my songs now
They thought they was right, they was wrong now
Losses to biggest bosses in my phone now
Positive, I'ma prosper, the mental strong now
Fuck "woe is me", G.O.A.T. is me, nigga, I'm just sayin' 
This is not, this is not a, uh

Ayy, when are we speaking again?
Yeah, you look good with that ink on your skin
Hood, but you far from the streets you was in, oh yeah
No, he don't like it, call me up, he don't like it
This was the perfect timing
Love you, I'm certain I can, yeah
Talk about you like a queen makin' him madder

No, no, if y'all ain’t got the same momma and daddy, y'all can fuck
You fuckin’ him
You was on the verge of losing her
You was acting like you ain't want shit to do with her
I cut out the bullshit and kept it true with her
That's why the sexual tension is high when I'm in rooms with her
She really the shit, I don't be juicing her
I'm the shit too, that's why I'm so in tune with her
I feel like I'm sewn on ya
I feel like you grew on me
Have I grown on you?
Done fronting like I don't want you
Keep treating me like I don't know you
Back and forth between me and all your niggas
You're busy tonight, that figures
Tonight you're staying in his city
And still I answer your call when he doesn't answer at all
But I want that too, that's all
I need the same in return, that's all

Versus anybody, really show me my opponent
They coming for my head, not like Makonnen
Kill them all, send 'em my condolences
And I'm back, back, back on my bullshit nigga
Do I miss doing this shit, just for fun? Just a little
Now, I do it for funds, that's facts, fundamentals
For a house up on the makers, lawyers, doctors, my neighbors
Everyday I say my prayers, terminating betrayers
Now the man is blessing me, first the man was testing me
I went through the storm not knowing whether it was green on the other side or not
That shit would bring out the best of me
I'm so true with it, who are you kidding?
12 asked what I do for a living, told them Google it
I'm so rude with it, and the youngest doing it
You don't know what I been through nigga
This the truth nigga, oh my goodness
Spittin' flames in the booth, nigga, oh my goodness
God really came through for me, oh my goodness
I can give a fuck about you, and your mothafuckin' crew

Never on the road with you
Fuck you like you're mine, that's what I'm supposed to do
Yeah, just like you're mine
You encourage me to do what's right, do what's right

Oh, it's just what I needed
Oh, it's just what I, yeah
You got what I need
And I got what you need
Listen up
When I look at you, I see someone I don't deserve
Then I pretend like my vision blurry
Is it love I'm searchin' for? Or different word?
Looked at me, said, "When did this occur?"
Soon as I seen you in mini skirt
Soon as you hit me with smile first
Soon as I heard how your mind works
Me and my girl, we just diverted
We just went our separate ways, yeah
Knew she loved me 'cause I'm paid up
Therefore I don't wanna make up
Yeah, I saw somethin' different in you
Had to come and tell you straight up
You was headed for the door
Had to tell you, "Wait up"
Like "Aye, yo, hold up, wait up"
Hold up, hold up
Let me tell you, girl, before you go
There's a few things that you should know
I don't do this on the usual
But I felt compelled to let you know that you a
Bad lil' thing
So bad
YeahListen up
Oh, baby
Note to self
Stay true to self 
Shorty, I could use the help 
And you know what to do to help
Going in circles, trying not to lose myself
No, check up
How can I check up? 
Tell you I messed up 
We could go somewhere nice, get pretty and get dressed up 
I always said I should keep you fed and not fed up
Always said if I ain't happy give you heads up
I would rather give you back down, long stroke, legs up
Known for giving you the best love
No, I wouldn't give you nothing less, nothing less, love
Used to look at me and tell me "Don't stress, love"
That's why I need you whenever I'm stressed, love
Cut me off, tell me "Stay blessed", love
Hey, stay blessed
Changes
Right now I'm going through changes
We upgraded to a crib that's spacious
But this house is not a home without you, baby
Ain't shed a tear, you just left on me
Chuck the deuce, told me, "Stay blessed", told me
In due time, I'll regret
Especially when I remember you was reppin' when they slept on me 
It's been too long
I gotta know
What must I do to
Get me back right beside you? Oh
Whenever you decide to
Alright
Say it's what I get for lying to you
I can talk to you whenever
Say whatever, yeah
You was my best friend
It's what I get for lying to you
Used to look at me and tell me "Don't stress love"
That's why I need you when I'm stressed, love
Cut me off, tell me "Stay blessed", love
Hey, stay blessed
Roll up the carpets
Close up the curtains
Guess the show is over, I still love you, that's for certain
Self righteous but I'm dead wrong, that's for certain
If you're tryna make me crazy, baby, it's working, hey
Baby, it's working
Dealing with clown niggas, know your life a circus
I'm still around, I bet he called you when he heard this
He's scared you might take me back, I got him nervous
Tell him, baby, should he be nervous?
And not because I buy you those expensive purses
But because the love you got for me is permanent
He threw me up under the bus, he say I'm undeserving
Don't give him no encouragement
I had to soak in some things, I needed nourishment
Look at me now, see a nigga really flourishing
I wouldn't trade my old life for my current one
Hey, no I wouldn't trade it
A 'Ventador for a Huracan
Why trade a good woman for a' immature one?
Or a gold digger for an entrepreneur
What I'm saying, momma, you the one
Ain't no second time, I fooled you once
Be true to you, that's something I don't do enough
Cut me off, shawty, I thought you was bluffing
Got me blowing up your line, what's up with you? What's Up?
Note to self
Stay true to self
Shorty, I could use the help
And you know what to do to help
Going in circles, trying not to lose myself, noI had asked myself
So, what would you do if she left?
What would you do?
Would I find someone to distract myself?
Detach myself
Get my mind off you
This is far from the end
Got a nigga in a frenzy
Only you would understand
Oh, when I used to be your man
You tell me, tell me
Over and over again
If it's too much pressure, babe
Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby
If you gotta question me, babe
Think of all I've done for you, baby
I said that I know it
You're going to find someone
That's ready for you
And teach me a lesson, baby
You're gonna find someone who gets it, babe
Teach me a lesson, babe
Baby, ooh

Now you're tryna find a replacement for me, babe
Oh, hold up
Why we broke up
Guess I don't know, love?
Guess I don't know
Baby, I had to grow up
I don't want you with no one
No one, yeah
If it's too much pressure, babe
Maybe I'm not the one for you, baby
If you gotta question me, babe
Think of all I've done for you, baby
I said I know that
You're going to find someone
That's ready for you

Came up on a check, I take it to the bank, deposit it
She hate when she tell me one thing and I do the opposite
That's just how I be when I be thinking 'bout the guap and shit
Like I give a fuck 'bout a hater hypothesis
If you putting money up, put your bands on him
That's your best bet, cause the man gon' win
If shit get outta hand, I put my hands on him
Damn, Tiller you went Super Saiyan on them
I'm about that action, put the cam on him
True, nigga all hell broke loose
Live from the motherfuckin' L-O-U
Doing numbers, getting numbers in my cell phone, too
Like viewer discretion
Come through with a weapon
My crew is the shit and your newest sewer the essence
I blew through the finish, ooh but you was in second
I'd do a song or two with you if you was impressive
Cut you a deal on it if that's what you were suggesting
You getting me too congested, I think I need Mucinex
Cause you sicken me, like "Can I get a freebie?"
Are you kidding me?
I gave your bitch a third of my dick, she want the trilogy
She feeling me
Never met nobody real as me
That's cause most of these niggas weak
Keep the shade coming, boy, you never offending me

Things were never the
Way we made 'em out to be
How we thought they were
Lately, I'm not sure
One thing for sure
Is when we're together
We're toxic as ever
Make no mistake, all the roads lead
To we shouldn't be together
I don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
Been twisted off you so long, oh-ho
'Cause it's complicated, far from simple
Always find a way to dodge thеse issues
Can't seem to shake it, not for nothing
Thе problem is we're not discussin'
All that screaming, yelling's not becomin' of you
Things just can't be fixed, we're out of time
Time, oh yeah
Oh yeah 
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah, yeah
Oh, turns out I don't
Know, know you, no, not anymore, no
And I can't wait 'til we find a way to part ways
Seems like your days are dark days
Seems like you're mad at the small things, I
Admit it, it seems like you're playin' it the hard way
We fight through the night, all day
I, I still don't know why I
Still play into your palm
Even though I know what you want
I've been twisted on you for so long
For so long, girl 
Got me twisted, I could only wait for so long
For so long, girl 
Waited so long, but we got no time, no

Say he coming for the spot? Bitch It’s a spill now
Leave a stain in the game, bruh
Fuck the niggas waiting on Young Tiller to change up
Niggas waiting on me to run out of paper
I don't ever speak on niggas, nah, I barely say much
Fuck, I look like, bringing niggas names up?
I can't let a fuck nigga get famous
These niggas, they wanna de-fame us
They wanna betray us, they wanna play games, oh no, no
Disloyal, this how they won't portray us
Looked at my dog like, "Fuck it, let's make 'em hate us"
If you got paid for the attention that you paid us
You would be a rich nigga but you just a bitch nigga
Foreign whip, make you throw a fit, nigga
Foreign bitch, I know you won't get with her
Lame niggas not the type that she consider
You thinking of speaking with her
Boy, you better reconsider
Hey, I'm my daughter's keeper
And I don't take with the threats or promises either, nigga
You gon' have to see me one way or another
And for my blood, bruh
I'm a cold motherfucker
Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me, hey
Shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
Listen "Don't fuck with me", hey
Think twice before you fuck with me
What it is though?
2016 Tiller on this shit, so
Most likely I'ma vent up on this shit, so
Well, um, damn, here it go
You see the shit is so new to me, bro
Not the music, that's easy, it come smooth to me, bro
When I should've been in school, I was making tunes, truancy, bro
Low-key, them cool kids weren't as cool as me, bro
I fell in love and had a mini me, thank you, Jesus
Ten fingers, ten toes on her pretty feet, seriously, thank you, Jesus
Pray for it every day in the UPS trailers
And you gave her to me like I asked, that's amazing, Jesus
I know the saying, give them an inch and they take a mile
But Jesus, I really need this, I gotta make it out
Studio shit on eBay, I gotta purchase
I told my niggas "Lend me 600 dollars, it'll be worth it, let's cop it"
So many times I second guessed myself, nigga, I never wanted to be an artist, nah
I don't wanna be the centre of attention but I guess I do this shit for lil' Harley, nah
If you know me, you know I just want to be able to walk into Target and people not be astonished
Man, let me do my shopping
But this in my job, I asked for it, I got it, let's go
Just got a new manager, my last one was fucking up my vision
Can't believe this nigga still tryna get a percentage
I gave you back your investment, get out your feelings
Telling people that the money changed me
Nigga, the money saved me
Nigga, money is the reason that you fuck with me, ain't it?
And even though this shit got me angry, I'ma let God fix it
'Cause I know if I fix it, my daughter gon' have to grow up without a father figure
I'ma end up in prison
Wishing I never got into this business
It's nothing personal, I made a business decision
I might have a job for you if you shape or you could fill the position
That's as real as it gets
And sometimes I don't know how to deal with this shit
I've been searching for the answers in my idol's music
In his earlier days, man, I know he went through this
He got through this, I'll get through it
Before you judge me
Check yourself before you judge me
Hey, shit could get ugly
Next time you might not be so lucky
What you want from me?
What these niggas want from me?
This is a, "Don't fuck with me"
Hey, think twice before you fuck with me
Check yourself
Check, check, check
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Chiddity-check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Check yourself before you wreck yourself
Yeah
Check, check yourself before you wreck yourself
Before you wreck yourself, check, check, checkYeah

I got a pocket full of cash, it's more than I made last year when I was packing
Oh, wait, it been 2 years, I lost track and
No way I'm going back, I been in mansions
I been in whips so quick that you lose traction
And made 6-figure transactions
Met a lot of pretty women AKA distractions
And some fuck niggas with subliminal captions
I won't 
Show these lames no compassion
Wanna play the game, gotta have expansion
Nes sent me an e-mail, came with attachments
And like a fan of the show, nigga, I started snapping
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening?
What's happening, oh, what's happening?
Woah, woah, high stakes got me feeling like I'm gambling 
Drink got a nigga rambling 
But hear me out
I wake up and see a roof over my head
Used to be the roof of a '04 Audi, that shit used to be my bed
Lot of disrespect from those who used to be my friends
Lot of checks to replace those used to be friends
I don't fuck with you, what don't you comprehend?
Give a fuck who I offend, real and fake cannot blend
And I pray to God I never lose a cake, amen 
With the high stakes, I'm in
I'm in
Even with niggas after me
I still stroll through the city casually
RIP Static G
Ali gone, that's another tragedy
Oh, my God, who gon' show the kids strategy?
I done seen so many things that they gotta see
I made it to the game using honesty
I know my momma proud of me
God tell her she gave birth to a young prodigy
Aye
Aye
Thank you
To the most high
Praying that them blessings don't stop
I'm praying that them blessings don't
YeahHold on, I'ma give it to you

It's two days 'til our anniversary, somethin' like that, oh 
Uh-huh
Yeah, you know I tried to stop
Yeah, you know I tried
I tried to give you a little less of my time
Startin' to feel like I'm never in my right mind
In my right mind 
Is it the right time, babe? 
See you in the nighttime, babe, it's nighttime
Wish you had feelings like mine, baby

Say  bye 
Say-say now, girl, say bye 
Say now, say goodbye

Overloaded
On all the memories and all the moments, yeah
When I look back to them, it's hard to focus
Oh, I like to imagine the time being frozen 
Oh, don't tell no lies, you wasn't mine, but hit my line up
Why? 'Cause you was tired of somebody 
I won't say his name, I'm simply tryna forget everything
Since you don't remember anythingHush, ayy

Too much to talk about
Come clean to you

Hit me with the Addy and I'm comin' now
Wanna get there before sundown 
Tryna be a better man
Came to tell you that we gotta stop fuckin' 'round
But you look good, I wanna fuck now
Make these other bitches seem basic 
Livin' where they go to vacation
You a goddess, you gracious
Look like a supermodel
But you modest
Look what God has created 
I'm tryna stop you from being famous 
From rappers knowin' what your name is 
I'm barely famous and I hate it
Take your time, I'm just sayin'
I'm a selfish nigga on occasion 
Fuck you and don’t hit you til' I crave it 
Whatever you finna say, save it 
I be like my bad, girl, I'm busy 
You know I always say the same shit 
Hit you when I'm back in the city

Say I didn't love you, you know a nigga loved you
Did you forget to mention?
All the things I did for you, times I made a trip
'Cause I know you hate the distance
Baby, it's alright 
Go ahead and take your time
But you gotta make your mind
Make your mind up, ooh
Girl, it's on you to tell me what you wanna do
Ayy
Tell me no, tell me somethin', tell me is it someone?
Seen you claim him pronto, must know somethin' I don't
I can't keep explainin' myself, feels like I'm drainin' myself
I guess there's no one to blame but myself
Got a big Henny cup, thought drinking would help
Been taintin' myself, I'm ashamed of myself
I've been praying for myself like you used to
Embracin' myself, like you do too
I know things is different, your name is different
And as strange as it is, I'm okay with this
And I can't say it different, never even met him
Can't hate the nigga, although I hate the feelin', I gotta
Although I hate the feelin', I gotta face the feelin'
I gotta feel that shit
Bury the feelin', kill that shit
The only way to heal that shit, you know
They won't hear a nigga talk that shit as trill as this
As real as this
I'm feelin' like I still got this
I give you more soon, until, that's itYeah, wow
They not ready for my new shit
Yeah
I want my baby to have your eyes
I'm going against my own advice
Should I do New York? I can't decide
Fashion week was more your thing than mine
I can't even lie, I'd rather stay inside
I can't do suit and tie
Can't be in one room with you and stand on different sides
One thing at a time
I have to learn to hide
One thing at a time
Emotions running high
I wish you felt alright
Just hitting my line
All the time, all the time, all oooo–
You stay on my mind
All the time, all the time 
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You and your sister
Too hot to handle
Things would get canceled
I would make time for you
Commitment
Going the distance
I'm new to all of this
It takes some finesse
I seen you finesse
He can't know finesse
You stay on my mind
You stay on my mind 
Stay on my mind

Pressure on me whenever I'm flatlined down

The game called me and said, "Come back right now" 
Put the fire on the fuckin' wax right now, yeah 
She want all the eggs in one batch right now, but 
I can't risk that right now, no
City on fire, that's 'cause of me and Jack, huh 
Fifty deuce got the city loose, goin' platinum

Givenchy, you like 'em? I'll send 'em in for you 
Split it with a nigga, got the dividends for you
You down with it, wood brown, cinnamon for you

Where you goin'?
'Fore this time go 
Goin', goin', gone, gone, gone 
Go
Yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeahAll I did is say I have feelings for you
And all you do is shit all over it
And tell me you want me to get over you
And that you want nothing to do with me
That's hurtful, Bryson
I did nothing to you
I've done nothing to you
For a year, all you did was lie to me and talk to other girls
And I'm still hearing it
Okay, I forgive you, let's work with it
I really like you
Last year was a misunderstanding, let's get over it
No more brittle conscience
I forgive you for everything
I've done nothing
And if I did do something
Then and now would be the perfect time to say
'Cause you done everything to me
I never did that to you
I'd never do that to youYou'll say
You'll say "Don't you wanna change me?"
Hey  mmm
Doin' too much 
Too much for me to miss you
Maybe calling you up would fix things right now
Are you listening right now, are you listening?
Repeat, replay this just to make sure you don't miss things
See, I know, see, I know how much you miss me, you miss me, but
Things now are so different
You should see me now, I'm so different
I know you like to say I went distant, but
Went to woman from women
How could you say you missed him?
I gave you like ten percent, I
I, I, I shorted you
Hate my guts, of course you do
Had you twisted like contortion, you
Bent over like backwards for me
Shawty, you had me spoiled too
Love you, ma, you know I do
Then how the fuck I choose her over you?
How?
I could tell you how though
I could tell you
You gon' let me talk though or you just gonna keep...
She like, "How could you leave?"
Let things be done
Find you someone
Miss the way you love me
Don't call me for once
Swear you're no fun
You was loving him too, but you swear you're the one
Girl, you know I can't settle for it
Try to tell myself I don't need that
Yeah, I know that you classy
But you a freak too, I gotta see that
No, I never get one time
I need two times, repeat that 
No, I never go too deep
I get lost in it, won't be back
She would never get me back
It's a evident relapse
I been sober for too long
I'm done forever, I mean that
Shit done had me two drinks that got me open
Now I gotta speak facts
In too deep, gotta evac
And I don't know where you lost me at, but let's recap, ah
Things now are so different
You should see me now, I'm so different
I know you like to say I went distant, but
Went to woman from women
How could you say you missed him?
I gave you like ten percent, I
I, I, I shorted you
Hate my guts, of course you do
Had you twisted like contortion, you
Bent over like backwards for me
Shawty, you had me spoiled too
Love you, ma, you know I do
How'd I choose her over you?
I could tell you how
Let's talk
Since you want closure
I can do that, ayy
I see you hurt, I see you cry
You see DC in my eyes
You hit DC for a drive
Threw my CD out the—

With a new thing, she CC'd out
You like, "Come on, B, that ain't even your style"
"Come home, B, let me see these hoes out"
"Let me show 'em the ex"
"Sit down, ho, let 'em know I'm the best"
Face so cold, always go for they necks
Girl, you're so bold, too bold with a text
Girl, you over the edge
Over the sex, I know it's for the best
I don't wanna text, I don't wanna chat
Stole your heart, think I won't give it back

When I'm lonely, baby
It's like my friends don't know me
Girl, you used to be my homie 
Left me with a dream she sold me 
Even the dreams get lonely
Left me here at three in the mornin'
Questionin' all the things you told me 
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy
You got lost in thе heat of the moment

And if you еver need it or want it, I got you, you know this
And if you ever home alone and need a little company, I'll swing right over
Baby, I'll be right over

Yeah, yeah
You don't miss me, babe
Don't know why you're tryin' to convince me, babe
Know there's been somebody else since me, babe
Think I might do the same, don't tempt me, baby
Hit the party and get friendly
Honestly no, I don't got it in me
It's no fun when you're not here with me
It's no wonder you're not here with me, yeah
Yet you tell me there's no way
Yes, you tell me there's no way, way, way 
She's like, "How you figure?"
Girl, I seen you around here with him
Trust me, I heard a lot about him
Tell me where you found him
He won't get around you, no, I won't allow it, no 
Guess it's over now, if you think I don't know by now
Can we slow it down and sort it out now?
You got lost in the heat of the moment
Baby, if you need it, show it
And if you ever need it or want it, I got you, you know this
And if you ever home alone and need a little company, I'll swing right over
Baby, I'll be right, yeah, yeah
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Seen what I said right?
Heard what I said right?
I'm a boss and you see it, right?
You took a loss and you see it, right?
We could stop, we could rewind
Would you call in the meantime?
Ain't no problem, we'll be fine
Would you come with me tonight?
All the stories you rewrite

Searching for a heart another world away 
How far out have I got to move? 
Oh, I've gotta get next to you
But you're so far away 
Searching for a heart another world away 
I'm still waitin' here, how soon can you make it here?
Hope that you will make it clear
Hate when you're away from here
Said I hate when you're away from here
Too far away, countin' the days, until you get here
Wait until you gеt here

And when I found it hard at times to be myself
Not me, just me and myself
Myself, myself
Out there doin' what I'm 
Doin' what I'm doin'
I think that's what got me here
I gave it my best and that's exactly why I'm here
Hated how it felt to be in debt, to bein' failed 'til I did somethin'
Self-reflectin', thinkin' 'bout the testaments and wisdom
Make sure you got a will, there's a way when there is one
Keep doin' what you doin', go do what's already been done
I know you got it in you
Yeah, yeah, baby, I

Flipping the script on me that’s your forte, yeah
We've gotta fix this here baby, oh yeah 
Been through some shit this year
You been working tryna up your net worth, shawty
Doing the leg work, shawty
'Fore you leave, give me sex first shawty
I gotta get you wet first, shawty, nah nah
You gotta love me and baby we can call it a truce
You know I don't got shit to prove
This is something you always do
You know I only give my love to you
Ain't got a God damn thing to prove, nah nah nah
You got my heart, that's proof nah nah nah
How could you ever cut me loose? Nah nah nah
Here's your proof, nah nah nah
Damn, girl you better stop it
You told me tell them other girls to stop calling and I did
Always think I'm with another broad when you're not here
This the truth, why would I lie to you? What are you doing? Worried 'bout what I'm doing
Say you got the proof, it's in my music
I'm a poet baby, had to let you know it, baby, thought you knew it
I chopped down, screw it, I guess I got to slow it up for you this time
Always thinking 'bout you and I, don't ever question if I'm down for you or not

I come out to Bridgetown with it, hey
Oh say my name, hey, oh, say my nameYou gotta trust me, yeah
That's right, I'ma be okay
They be like "Do the task right, don't make no mistakes"
They negated what I sacrificed, think I live a flashy life?
But really life is flashin' by, twenty-two, go get it now
Twenty-seven, hold it down
I got several homies now, but still I keep my bro around
Crazy we both older now, babies, no, they older now
Plus, I know they count on us to lend more than a shoulder
This world is growin' colder
But I swear they never get the cold shoulder
Sand drippin', should I flip it ovеr?
Skimmin' through this picture folder
Wishin' I could live it ovеr
But you wiser when you gettin' old
Normally, I'm closed off but just for this specific song
I might try to let them in, save lustin' for a different song, but
Baby, you gotta trust me
That's right, we gon' be okay
You know I'm gon' do that task right, I'm gon' make mistakes
But don't you forget what I sacrificed, think I live a flashy life?
But I ain't never had this life
And I'm talkin' about this rapper life
Them flashin' lights and catchin' flights on PJ's, crazy, right?
But if I gave this life to who I was, on God, I would hate my life
And if Jesus take my life? At least I made it to the greatest heights
He said "Look, son, don't be afraid of the heights and don't take prayer light
Keep me close and watch me change your life
Maybe go take a risk, maybe that'll make the whole situation flip"
That's true, but even if things don't end up cool
At least I know I can
I can trust in you
Sincerely, um, affectionately, Bryson
Just one time, thank youI love the way you pop your top
And how you lose your cool
And how you look at me, too
Say why?
It ain't no fighting, no I can't stop it
This took a while, yeah
Love the way you pump your fist or how you bust your hip
For my affection, tryna be down
No fighting, no stoppin'
Stick around
And you the type of girl I'll take over to mama
The type of girl, I know your daddy be proud of
Yeah, uh be proud of, yeah
Uh be proud of, uh be proud, you know, you know
The type of girl I wanna turn into a mama
The type of girl, I'm already proud of
Uh be proud of, uh be proud of, uh be proud of, boy you know
I wish you was a normal girl
I wish you was a normal girl
Normal girl, oh, oh, oh
I wish you was a normal girl
You like it, when I get, aggressive
You like it when I tell you
How I want it, tell you how I need it
Tell you "I don't want to have to repeat it"
Baby, I, tell me I, never should worry, end of story
That's the end of story, that's the end of story, yeah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Woah
Wish you was a normal, girl
Ayy, ayy, ayy, ayy[Intro};
Actually, there is a word for that. It's love. I'm in love with her okay!? If you're looking for the word that means caring about someone, beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want, no matter how much it destroys you, it's love. And when you love someone, you just-- you don't stop... ever! Even if people roll their eyes or call you crazy, even then. Especially then! You just-- you don't give up! Because if I could give up, if I could just... you know, take the whole worlds advice, and- and move on and find someone else, that wouldn't be love! That would be... that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for
;
Look where we are
After all of this time
Finally made it
I know this for sure
And you were so patient with me babe
I gotta say thank you
'Cause I know I don't deserve it 
I remember scrolling through my phone
Seeing you in places you would never go
Small payback for the pain I caused
For all the ways that I did you wrong
I didn't hear from you 
Not a fucking thing from you 
Laying here in bed thinking about her
Loudest silence that I ever heard
Yeah
People say they gon' change but it never happens
And we go back to old ways and old habits
A nigga just so used to getting reprimanded
I had to hear the silence just to understand it 
Since then a nigga changed so much 
What will I do with the pieces of you? 
I just need one more chance, one more chance 
I gotta get my baby back
Now all I have is fragments of your heart
Since you been gone it's been I've ever got
Girl I know this is kinda scary
Falling way back deep in love so involuntary
All you needed was my trust
Now you got it baby
And now that I got it
I ain't gonna lose it
Swear to God I'mma prove it
;
Oh, I can't shake it, I can't shake this feeling that nothing about me and Barney makes any sense!
But love doesn't make sense! I mean, you can't logic your way in or out of it. Love is totally non-sensical. But we have to keep doing it, or else we're lost, and love is dead, and humanity just packed in. Because love is the best thing we do. Look, I know that sounds cheesy, but it's just true. You love Barney, and he loves youI'm sick as hell right now
Just going to keep it real with em
I just thought I had to tell you
I just don't want to see you get hurt, that's it
Shit I don't like it, shit just looking out for her
You know what I'm saying
I just think you should know this
Girl, he don't fucking love you
No, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run through
Why you let him lie to you, girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back, he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you
Try to trust me on this one
Go and find someone different
And don't ask for his permission
He a dog, he tell you that in all of his songs
And yeah, that's my boy but I can't let him do you wrong
I be telling him to drop all of them other hoes
But them thirsty bitches, he would rather fuck with those
I agree when he say he can never trust a hoe
But that's no excuse not to love you though
I should mind my own damn business
Cause I'm happy with my girl
She brought the happy in my world
Niggas like you are the reason love's looking kinda tacky for these girls
Are you happy this occurred?
Boy, I never met a nigga so ungrateful
Why you fucking with them devils when you got an angel?
You say you care about her
But do you know what you about to tear up out her?
It's a heartbeat, smart, dumb nigga
Girl, he don't fucking love you
No, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run through
Why you let him lie to you, girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back, he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you
Oh he's offended now
He say he gonna make me wish I never did it now
He say he got a lot of dirt on me
Tell my girl I actually love her
That'll be worse for me
And tell yourself that anything you do is never hurting me
I'm dead, I'm already dead
I didn't kill myself, I just went and killed this song instead
The dogs been bred
Thanks for the lessons brother
Rule number one
Fuck these bitches go and get the money
I love her smile
Do you love it too?
You wanna see that smile then tell her not to fuck with you
Cause when it's said and done I'll be the one she tells her story to
And when somebody else is in the picture she's ignoring you
You know you done fucked up don't ya?
You know you done screwed up
Went and told her she's the bomb
And now she's feelin' like she's one step closer
Now everything done blew up
Yeah, he don't fucking love you
Nah, he don't fucking love you
You are just another bitch
He'll probably let his other homie run to
Why you let him lie to you girl?
I bet your friends call you stupid
You is way too beautiful
Behind your back he call you a hoe
That's cause he don't fucking love you
Mind yo fuckin' business
Don't need no help with these bitches
Nigga get the fuck off my set
Gon' put up with this BS 'til I know that she got my back
And fuck around and end up bending my back
She'll like that
See love is just a game, look at my stats
But her and I've been hurtin' just reserve I got a ice pack
What my heart 'posed to be you should try that
Cause far as I could see you are right behind where I'm at
Now first our relationship was plain, pilot
Oh, but she'll still fly that, hijack
And when I'm in her presence that is exactly how I act
Like she's a gift to me
And plus she likes the fact that I rap
See I don't have to call her all the time
Or even be around to let her know she's on my mind
Just know that we got a bond that y'all don't find
And I tell her she's the bomb cause she mine
Man I fuckin' love you
But I won't put no one above you
You should see the way I treat these other bitches if I ever let 'em come through
Cause I know that you gon' ride for me girl
You the one I'm in the coupe with
You could shake if you wanna go
Aye your dad said you gettin' old
That this is what I think of youOh I'm leaning, 420 leaning

I ended up with a clique that's sucka free
I ended up with a bitch that fuck wit' me
She'll cut a nigga off quick, suddenly
This is not luck, motha'fucka, please
Built it from the ground up, right from underneath
Bitches come around always tryna smother me
Niggas never tell the whole story, just a summary
Just a-just a-just a summar-just a motherfuckin' summary
Why can't niggas keep it one-hun' with me, never front on me?
Never front on me
It's the same ol' song, mad 'cause you ain't on one wit' me
Don't pay that nigga one release
Little thick when I met her rubberina, uh
Thumbin' through her check, nickname her Thumbalina
She just tryna dodge all these motha'fuckin' frauds
Beat that pussy out the frame, so much we got a collage
Why you fuck wit' him, shawty? You is so lost
Nigga showin' off nudes like Yugioh cards
Me? I'm in this bitch tryna be a studio God
I'm remainin' soft and I been through a whole lot, ay
Fuck the fame, I'm gettin' rich
Now a nigga gettin' popular like I could give a shit
No more Papa John's, twelve hour shifts, I'm clockin' in
You could start supportin' me, nigga, but ain't no stoppin' him
It's young Tiller
Yeah, lucky me 
I ended up with a clique that's sucka free 
I ended up with a bitch that fuck wit' me 
She'll cut a nigga off quick, suddenly 
This is not luck, motha'fucka, please 
Built it from the ground up, right from underneath 
Bitches come around always tryna smother me
Niggas never tell the whole story, just a summary
I heard my name in the city gettin' downplayed
Niggas won't give me the credit, nigga, I won't even sweat 'em
Niggas got goals, niggas tryna be David Beckham
Niggas got souls, niggas never ever gon' sell 'em
But I cannot speak for y'all
Shit, I hardly ever speak at all, that's why your bitch is curious
She say I'm mysterious
Even had to ask Siri if you niggas was serious
Boy, I been a lyricist
Nigga, is you hearin' this?
I got-I got-I got patience, yeah, I waited for my turn
Got some real ones at my table, now the tables finna turn
I could do it by my lonely, why are they gettin' concerned?
I don't need too many homies, keep it one-on-one like Zoey
Niggas know me
Focus on the music solely, I be ready
I'm on Ocean Drive feeling like bad Tommy Vercetti
Pull in that in furnace, T-coke, give it to Kermit
'Cause that ain't none of my business
Can't keep up, get off the circuit, nigga
Got it covered, resurfaced, nigga
I mean, do I not deserve it? I got perseverance
Hate a woman that's too worried about her appearance
Just keep all your shit together
Promise, baby, it's forever
If you doubted me, you won't be forgiven
The fuck don't you like about me? Boy, be specific
Like my bitches yellow like Lisa Simpson
My weed purple and my swisha fat like Peter Griffin
Yeah, lucky me 
I ended up with a clique that's sucka free 
I ended up with a bitch that fuck wit' me 
She'll cut a nigga off quick, suddenly 
This is not luck, motha'fucka, please 
Built it from the ground up, right from underneath 
Bitches come around always tryna smother me
Niggas never tell the whole story, just a summaryDon't, don't play with her, don't be dishonest 
Still not understandin' this logic 
I'm back and I'm better 
I want you bad as ever
Don't let me just let up
I wanna give you better
Baby, it's whatever
Somebody gotta step up
Girl, I'm that somebody, so I'm next up
Be damned if I let him catch up

I am on a whole 'nother level
Girl, he only fucked you over 'cos you let him
Fuck him, girl, I guess he didn't know any better
Girl, that man didn't show any effort
Do all I can just to show you you're special
Certain it's your love that holds me together
Lately you say he been killin' the vibe
Gotta be sick of this guy
Pull up, skrr, get in the ride
Left hand is steerin' the other is grippin' your thigh
Light up a spliff and get high
Shorty, you deserve what you've been missin'
Lookin' at you I'm thinkin' he must be trippin'
Play this song for him, tell him, "just listen"
Don't

Light up my night and we shine

I built a time machine so we could eliminate the past

On my way from the club to the cribDJ E Dubb
A young boy from the hood South
I knew I didn't belong because I stood out
My house burned down, left with nothing but a doubt
I need me something new that I could learn now
Riding in the old school, listening to old music
Who granted, I really couldn't stand it
But damn it, I love it now
Put nothing above it now
Which is why I never thought about rapping 
I needed something more sweet
Which is how I found out about a thing called R&B
Unfortunately, nobody was supporting me
That's why I kept it on the low like a submarine
I remember the days being a rookie
The ones that been playing the game would overlook me
And once they saw that I was cold, producers started cooking me
And all the new rappers got old so I say
Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me
Now, I can shine
I don't want to waste no time
I just want the fame right now
Be a celebrity, all of this fame, yeah God
I just want to make it mine
Hear me out, I deserve it
I just ain't been heard yet
Down low, it's worth it
I'm just so glad I can do something these people can't
And that's why I say thanks to R&B
Oh thank you R&B 
Singing in the shower but came
Singing into a studio mic for a couple of hours and then
I realized I was better than most
Cockiness to the side, I had a hell of a float, for real
I've always asked for a deal, fuck a bargain
Tryna get signed like a tree, bark carvin'
My songs hot, they should charge me with arson
And I kill the beats sick, call it coughin' in a coffin
Singing to your girl on the phone, late at night
Pleasure P did it wrong but I made it right
Success ain't cheap, I'm working hard to pay the price
Make way for Bryson 'cause I'm taking flight 
I appreciate the haters
And the "Tiller would never be famous" debaters
And I appreciate every single prayer
And thank God most for giving me the breath to say this
Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me
Now, I can shine
I don't want to waste no time
I just want the fame right now
Be a celebrity, all of this fame, yeah God
I just want to make it mine
Hear me out, I deserve it
I just ain't been heard yet
Down low, it's worth it
I'm just so glad I can do something these people can't
And that's why I say thanks to R&B
Oh thank you R&B 
Man, I swear 
I love you, you know?
It's something special to me 
I need it 
I'ma do it 
And keep going 
And keep going 
And let's go HQ
Thank you R&B
You separate me from all of these locals surrounding me
You brought out the cloud in me

I don't want to waste no time
I just want the fame right now
Be a celebrity, all of this fame, yeah God
I just want to make it mine
Hear me out, I deserve it

Oh thank you R&B DJ Edubb
The mixtape bully is taking this shit over, nigga
Yeah, yessir
Bryson Tiller, huh
My instinct, let me shine now
I tell 'em, "Now go and throw your hands up for some real talent"
Haters try and throw a nigga off but I'm still balanced
They say don't act a fool at the top, I can care less
'Cause when I hit that height, I swear I'm beating on my bare chest
King Kong, I'm the villain in this movie
I swear I didn't know she was a fan until she blew me
Yes I found my calling, I just hope it doesn't lose me
'Cause reception in my city is terrible, no one knew me
From the start but that subject is changing in the end
My grandma's two cents was to change all my friends
I agree, some of my niggas think my flame is for them
And the bitches think that every song I sang is for them
That's a lie, I advise quitting school ain't your best move
'Cause everywhere you go, someone gonna test you
And I'm Ray Charles to the bullshit
You know we killing this shit like we should bitch
Yeah
Uh, they be telling me stop wasting my time
'Cause ain't nobody made it out of the 'Ville 
Yeah but I'ma keep on grinding on this music
Dropping bangers until I get a deal 
And they say they ain't hating on my shit
When they say quit and they just keeping it real 
And I'm glad 'cause they think I won't 
But I ain't hearing that, baby we will

Do it for the money and the power

Hol' upAbout a year and a half ago I was sitting in my best friend's car, playing him some music,  and he said to me "Man you're my new favorite rapper, please burn me a CD when you're finished, I'd even pay for it". So before writing these "thank you's" I just had to call him and let him know that this project would be in stores and boy was he ecstatic. We both were actually, lol. So I'd like to thank him first. Thank you Gerald: for convincing me that I could actually do this as a career. I wanna thank Poóh: for being an awesome mother to my daughter. I know it's hard doing it all  by yourself while I'm on the road but somehow you manage. You've been very supportive and I love you for that. Thank you Harley: for making me smile every single day and giving me hope. I do this for you. Maybe one day you'll thank me if you ever decide to make an album, *crosses fingers*. Thank you Keem: for saying "You got this, all you need is one hit song and it'll change your life", you were right bro. Stephon and Smitty: for helping me cop that studio equipment when I couldn't afford it, thanks guys, foreal. Thank you Steven: for being there for me after things went south in Miami . Thank you Neil: for making my career your priority. Thank you Black Mic and Fabian: for having these mixes on point. Rich: thanks for believing in me when nobody else would, and for putting me in rooms with people who could change my life. Tunji & John: thank you both for wanting to be a part of this and taking it to the next level. I wanna thank my fans: for spreading the word about my music, I obviously wouldn't be here without you all. I also wanna thank every last producer on this project for giving me a chance to put lyrics to these dope ass beats, . Thanks to any and everyone who helped me on this journey since 10/9/14. And lastly but most importantly thank you God: for answering every single prayer, and always doing me another favor. I wanna dedicate this project to anyone who wants to change their life and accomplish their goals. My advice to you is: don't wait on anyone, don't let anyone tell you your dreams are too big, don't lose hope. Don't give up. Don't forget to pray, and don't ever lose faith in God. Don't.Ayy

Tiller
Louisville Slugger with the hits 
Knock 'em out the park then I'm knockin' down your bitch 
I don't got a hublot on my wrist
Shawty, I would rather see you blowin' on my dick
Look, look at my pockets, what's in 'em? 
I'm gettin' guap in my denims 
I need some kind of incentive 
Tell that pussy a million fuckin' dollars in the minimum
I'm killin' 'em and I am not a regular nigga 
Dick game have you upset wit'cho nigga 
I see him out here straight flexin' in the rental 
I know we all see 'em but you better repent 'em 
Bitch, I'm goin' in, nigga like dinner

Me and my niggas tryna make history
Fly out to Italy then put out the fire consistently 
Nigga, since 2011, it's been armageddon, I been gettin' spins 
My better designer is a belt with a whole lotta wins 
What's up?
Niggas laughed at me like I ain't-I ain't-I ain't gon' come up
But I knew I would have the last laugh
I mean, all a nigga wanted to do was stack cash
They ain't really expect a nigga to do it that fast
Nigga, that just how it go when you want it that bad
That's just how it go when you want it that bad
I'm young, I'm handsome, I'm fast, I'm pretty
It can't possibly be me
And I'm better now than I was
I'm experienced now, professional
It is the fitting that I leave the game just like I came in
Stille
Platinum and gold all the records I sold 
Talkin' plaques to the ceiling
Nappy been off for a minute just plottin' and buildin' 
Now we back in the buildin'
Probably been out on the road for a decade or so
You could say that we winnin'
Yeah, I put on for my city
My O.G. top bully would tell you, "Boy, quit actin' silly"
Grippin' on my Louisville Slugger and I'm spittin'
Pointin' at the upper deck right before I hit it
Hit it out the park like Aaron Rodriguez
Not Aaron Hernandez, but a certified killer, ask Tiller
Now they hatin' on me and my nigga
But they was singin' our shit when they was little
Only if they would admit it
Nigga, we made it, we did it
Niggas gon' hate 'cause they didn't 
Still chasin' that Monterrey
I ain't had a job since I was like my oldest daughter age 
K-Y Buffalo, you should probably follow me, I say this in all modesty
You ain't do the Rock & Roll hall of fame
You don't got your own holiday
You ain't rock the Apollo stage
Or tour a lot of dates in Colorado state
With models on that molly while they wait
Swallowin' bottles of Tres, how could you hardly relate?
Huh? I'll wait
What's up?
Niggas laughed at me like I ain't-I ain't-I ain't gon' come up
But I knew I would have the last laugh
I mean, all a nigga wanted to do was stack cash
They ain't really expect a nigga to do it that fast
Nigga, that just how it go when you want it that bad
That's just how it go when you want it that bad
And I know a little ,  had my little first taste
It's like I want it even more now, like I never had it in the first place

Turn it up, turn it up, show you love
More than love, turn it up, turn it up

Wavy love, thought you nigga don't never really see eye to eye
Don't know what the hell these hoes talking 'bout
I just got back with my ride or die
I'm sorry that, I never cleared my schedule, just gotta call you back
Shawtie bad, I shoulda probably hit harder to give him a heart attack
I'm sorry that, I didn't tell you this sooner
I can tell you more if you would call me back
Got room for improvement we both knew
Now let's work hard at it
We should fall back in
We gon' fall out like we used to fall back then
How we fucked back then, fucked back then
But with my heart, I'll be happy again 
Yeah let me show that I'm back now
Maybe you should come see this, maybe we should get leavin'
Dip the party, get drinks in me, that is wishful thinkin'
Pray at the same time, baby, I get you a new dial baby
Turn it up, turn it up, yeah, show you love
More than love, turn it up, turn it up
Know you love, smoke it up, roll it up
Now burn it up, burn it up, yeah

Why don't we get this right
Wanna take all your time, yeah
Be all mine, I wanna make things right
I wanna make things rightWill be updated soon...Wonderin' how we gon’ come again 
My golden rule was not to focus on the fame game 
In retrospect, the game ain't the same, mane 
The heart and soul is divided
They ramshacked the music, no control up inside it
Now , look at this, it's all stretched out and nasty
But , let that money pass me? I doubt that 
And niggas from the bottom know 
Pumpin’ hard, wind, sleet, hail, or snow 
 you got to get your gate right 
No matter what , you got to treat your weight right
On the block if you focused on greed then 
Nine out of ten times you'd be bleedin'
The analogy is clear to all of my peers
I'm a motherfuckin' vet, don't mean to disrespect
'Cause I write rhymes, I write checks 
Bust, hey, yo, what happened to the love for the game?
Love for the music?
I need realness in my life
Hey, yo, these niggas in the gameAyy
Hello, I just touched down
Lil' mama, wassup now
Been tryna kick it with you for the longest, so we can meet up now
Whatchu mean, "Oh, not now"?
Whatchu mean, he got you locked down?

Huh-huh, right

If I have another dream about fuckin' you
We may have to make it come true
Let me hit it from the side on your desk
Take that off, don't get no wrinkles in your dress
Got 'em meetin' with the press and they seem to be obsessed
I believe in hypnotism, look at that cleavage in yo' chest, I
Don't really get into politics, but tonight I wanna get into politics
Besides the sex, can I protect?
I wanna shield and conceal that things that's inside your chest
But you got a sec?
I don't wanna waste your time
I don't wanna make you mine either, just wanna save your life
I'll be your bodyguard, I don't need salary
You don't gotta pay me back, a simple thanks is fine with me
Baby, come get high with me and get your lungs dirty
Haha, ayy can I be your secret service?
Haha, Yeah
Ayy, can I be your secret service?
Haha
Yeah, ayy,  can I be your secret service?
Yeah, ayy, can I be your secret service?
Ayy, can I be your secret service?
Yeah
You know I got your back
Forever and always
Always and forever
Be my Whitney Houston
'Cause I've been waitin' for so long
I've been waitin' for so long
Baby, ayy, can I be your secret service?
Haha
Ayy, can I be your secret service?
Ayy, can I be your secret service?
Yeah
Ayy, can I be your secret service?
Ayy, can I be your secret service?Lyrics from Snippet
We shared eternal light
And we shared, oh, stories about life
And wrongs I'ma still right
And I really don't make no sense
No, I don't wanna lose your love
How do we save it?
Girl, I used to be your favorite
'Til I got lost by it, baby
But did you notice, baby?
Right now, I'm focused, baby 
Yes, I'm focused right now
Wouldn't we...Y
