I struggle to fly now
But there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but we cannot deny
Eats us alive, it eats us alive
Yes, there's a scream inside that we all try to hide
We hold on so tight, but I don't wanna die, no

Please don't cry no tears now
It's Christmas, baby
My snowman and me
My snowman and me
BabyI was born in a thunderstorm
I grew up overnight
I played alone, I played on my own
I survived
I wanted everything I never had
Like the love that comes with light
I wore envy and I hated that
But I survived
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
I found solace in the strangest place
Way in the back of my mind
I saw my life in a stranger's face
And it was mine
I had a one-way ticket to a place where all the demons go
Where the wind don't change
And nothing in the ground can ever grow
No hope, just lies
And you're taught to cry into your pillow
But I survived
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
You took it all, but I'm still breathing
I have made every single mistake
That you could ever possibly make
I took and I took and I took what you gave
But you never noticed that I was in pain
I knew what I wanted; I went out and got it
I did all the things that you said that I wouldn't
I told you that I would never be forgotten
And all in spite of you
And I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm still breathing, I'm still breathing
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive 
I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm alive
I'm alive, I'm aliveHelp, I have done it again
I have been here many times before
Hurt myself again today
And, the worst part is there's no-one else to blame
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Ouch I have lost myself again
Lost myself and I am nowhere to be found
Yeah I think that I might break
Lost myself again and I feel unsafe
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe me
Be my friend, hold me
Wrap me up, unfold me
I am small and needy
Warm me up and breathe meEach and every day
Hiding from the sunshine
Wandering in the shade
Not too old, not too young
Every night again
Dancing with the moonlight
Somewhere far away
I can hear your call
I’m out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can’t hide
I’m gonna make you mine
Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now
Is crying out for more
Ain’t no fairytale
What I see in your eyes
Awaiting your mistake
Not too close, not too far
Sneaking in the pain
Every truth becomes lie
I won’t trust myself
Once I hear your call
I’m out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can’t hide
I’m gonna make you mine
Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now
Is crying out for more
I’m out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
I’m out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause you can run but you can’t hide
I’m gonna make you mine
Out of my head
Of my heart and my mind
'Cause I can feel how your flesh now
Is crying out for more…Broke down, thought that I would drown
Hope that I'd be found, 'fore I hit the ground
Some days out the corner of my eye, hey
Saw you weeping, saw you creeping
Saw you sneaking in the shadow's long
The fear so strong
Saw you out the corner of my eye

Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
I'm fighting my ego
Lost youth, where did we go wrong?
I'm winning for me, though
I'm lighting the long way home
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still here
It's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past, it's haunted me
Oh the past, it wanted me dead
Oh the past tormented me
But the battle was lost
'Cause I'm still herePoetry in your body, you got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I'm watching?
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you, wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough when I turn up with my rhythm
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight
Poetry in your body got me started, may it never end
Feel my rhythm in your system, this is living, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest, beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from its cage, free the rage like an animal
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body's poetry, move your body for me
Your body's poetry, move your body for me
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body's poetry, speak to me
Won't you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse, use my music and let me be your rhythm tonightI know you, you’re a special one
Some see crazy where I see love
You fall so low but shoot so high
Big dreamers shoot for open sky
So much life in those open eyes
So much depth, you look for the light
But when your wounds open, you will cry
You’ll cry out now and you’ll question why
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out
I am here and I see your pain
Through the storms, through the clouds, the rain
I’m telling you you cannot escape
You can do it, just feel baby
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Here comes the sun
Smiling down
Smiling down
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes out
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as they fall on down
I can see your soul grow 
Through the pain as they hit the ground
I can see a rainbow 
In your tears as the sun comes out
As the sun comes outIt's dangerous to fall in love, but I wanna burn with you tonight
Hurt me
There's two of us, we're certain with desire
The pleasure's pain and fire burn me
So come on, I'll take you on, take you on
I ache for love, ache for us
Why don't you come, don't you come a little closer?
So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came after me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
And we will fly like smoke darkenin' the skies
I'm Eve, I wanna try, take a bite
So come on now, strike the match, strike the match now
We're a perfect match, perfect, somehow
We were meant for one another, come a little closer
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I got to get it
When the fire dies, darkened skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left
But it's a bad bet, certain death
But I want what I want and I got to get it
When the fire dies, darkened the skies
Hot ash, dead match, only smoke is left
Flame you came to me, fire meet gasoline
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, fire meet gasoline
I got all I need, when you came back to me
Fire meet gasoline, I'm burnin' alive
And I can barely breathe when you're here loving me
Fire meet gasoline, burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight
Burn with me tonight, ay, ehA toast to the groom!
To the bride!
From your sister
Who is always by your side
To your union and the hope that you provide
May you always 
Be satisfied 
Rewind!
Rewind!
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I just might
I remember that night, I remember that—
I remember that night, I just might
Regret that night for the rest of my days
I remember those soldier boys
Tripping over themselves to win our praise
I remember that dreamlike candlelight
Like a dream that you can’t quite place
But Alexander, I’ll never forget the first
Time I saw your face
I have never been the same
Intelligent eyes in a hunger-pang frame
And when you said “Hi,”
I forgot my dang name
Set my heart aflame, ev’ry part aflame
This is not a game…
You strike me as a woman who has never been satisfied
I’m sure I don’t know what you mean, you forget yourself
You’re like me, I’ve never been satisfied
Is that right?
I have never been satisfied
My name's Angelica Schuyler
Alexander Hamilton
Where’s your fam’ly from?
Unimportant, there’s a million things I haven’t done
Just you wait, just you wait...
So so so—
So this is what it feels like to match wits
With someone at your level! What the hell is the catch? It’s
The feeling of freedom, of seein’ the light
It’s Ben Franklin with a key and a kite! You see it, right?
The conversation lasted two minutes, maybe three minutes
Ev’rything we said in total agreement, it’s
A dream and it’s a bit of a dance
A bit of a posture, it’s a bit of a stance
He’s a bit of a flirt, but I’m ‘a give him a chance
I asked about his fam’ly, did you see his answer?
His hands started fidgeting, he looked askance
He’s penniless, he’s flying by the seat of his pants
Handsome, boy, does he know it!
Peach fuzz, and he can’t even grow it!
I wanna take him far away from this place
Then I turn and see my sister’s face and she is
Helpless
And I know she is
Helpless
And her eyes are just
Helpless
And I realize three fundamental truths at the exact same time
I’m a girl in a world in which
My only job is to marry rich
My father has no sons so I’m the one
Who has to social climb for one
Cause I’m the oldest and the wittiest and the gossip in
New York City is insidious
And Alexander is penniless
Ha! That doesn’t mean I want him any less
He’s after me 'cause I’m a Schuyler sister
And that elevates his status, I’d
Have to be naïve to set that aside
Maybe that is why I introduce him to Eliza
Now that’s his bride
Nice going, Angelica, he was right
You will never be satisfied
I know my sister like I know my own mind
You will never find anyone as trusting or as kind
If I tell her that I love him she’d be silently resigned
He’d be mine
She would say, “I’m fine”
But she’d be lying
But when I fantasize at night
It’s Alexander’s eyes
As I romanticize what might have been
If I hadn’t sized him up so quickly
At least my dear Eliza’s his wife
At least I keep his eyes in my life…
To the groom!
To the bride!
From your sister
Who is always by your side
To your union and the hope that you provide
May you always
Be satisfied
And I know 
She’ll be happy as his bride
And I know
He will never be satisfied
I will never be satisfiedUnder rich, relentless skies
I've been setting highs
I felt you walk right through me
You're the thing that I invoke
My old, persistent ghost
Sent to make me queazy
And oh, it's hard now
With time, it works out
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
All the tigers have been out
I don't care, I hear them howl
I let them tear right through me
Can you help me not to care?
Every breath becomes a prayer
Take this pain from me
And oh, you're so far now
So far from my arms now
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human
To be human
To be human
Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it
Just 'cause I predicted this
Doesn't make it any easier to live with
And what's the point of knowin' it
If you can't change it? You can't change, can't change it
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
I'm not ready to give up
To be human is to love
Even when it gets too much
There's no reason to give up
Don't give upNights are getting shorter now
Hot chocolate fills the air and Christmas cheer does too
Picking out your Christmas tree, so lovely
The joy this time it brings to you
Santa's coming to town
Santa's coming to town
Sing it to the deer in the sky
Sing it as they jingle, jingle, jingle tonight
Sing it to the moon, set it free

I don't wanna fight anymore
Rough seas will be calm
Hold on while we weather the storm
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance
This too shall pass
We're right where we're meant to be
There's things I don't ask
What I don't know can't hurt me
We fall down like dogs playing dead
But our love's not worth playing chicken with
I'm not discarding you like broken glass
There are no winners when the die is cast
There's only tears when it's the final dance
So don't give up, it's just young lovers' romance

The image of me that you see
Is distorted, twisted, broken, fractured
Isolated miles out to sea
I don't want a separate place
I need to feel safe not thrown away away away away
And I will push  to tear down the walls
Of this box you put me in
Because you don't understand
Push ow hot, push ow hot
And though you push
To find a label that fits me
I'm feeling good on a Wednesday with the sparkling thoughts
Help me unload the car ya ya ya
And so I push to close the door
Of the stall you've made for me to keep me away
And now we push, push to stand together
Because I am Lorde

Abandon myself daily

Rain, it falls, rain, it falls
Pouring on me
And the rain, it falls, rain, it falls

I'm feeling now
And if I move on
I admit you're gone
And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
Step and repeat
Tears fall to the beat
Smile through the pain
Feel the acid rain
And I ain't ready but I'll hold steady
I'll hold you in my arms, in my arms, in my arms
And you're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle
My bags' heavy, been filled by me
They weigh me down, carry them 'round
It's all mine, all mine
I am blinded by the eye of the needle
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needle, eye of the needle
You're locked inside my heart
And your melody's an art
And I won't let the terror in
I'm stealing time through the eye of the needleHello
My name is Mr. Fear
I wish I had a faster therapy
I've come
To mind control your needs
Tonight I'm gonna star all of your leads
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming near
How long
You'll call me insincere?
I'm not here to fulfill your parody
How come
My song becomes unreal?
You never understand my melody
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't fight with me, my dear
Why can't I be in here?
'Cause you make me feel
Like I'm so alone
I know is not real
But is in my soul
And I just can try to face
The dark inside my head
(Fear no more the heat o' the sun, nor the furious winter's rages;
Thou thy worldly task hast done, Home art gone, and ta'en thy wages:
Golden lads and girls all must
As chimney sweepers, come to dust.)
You know
I'll never disappear
Now get me out of here
Just trust in me, my dear
No cure is coming you know
I'll never disappear
Now get us out of here
Don't trust in me my dear
What cure is coming near?I had given up
I didn't know who to trust
So I designed a shell
Kept me from heaven and hell
Ohh oh oh
And I had hit a low
Was all I let myself know
Yeah I had locked my heart
I was imprisoned by dark
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
I was down for the count
I was down I was out
And I had lost it all
Yes I was scared, I was torn
And I took to the night
I'd given in to the fight
And I slipped further down
I felt like I had drowned
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
I was hopeless and broken
You opened the door for me
Yeah I was hiding and you let the light in
And now I see
That you do for the wounded
What they couldn't seem to
You set them free
Like a butterfly kissing a child with an eye for the minor key
Yeah yeah
You found me dressed in black
Hiding way up at the back
Life had broken my heart into pieces
You took my hand in yours
You started breaking down my walls
And you covered my heart in kisses
I thought life passed me by
Missed my tears, ignored my cries
Life had broken my heart, my spirit
And then you crossed my path
You quelled my fears, you made me laugh
Then you covered my heart in kisses
Oh oh oh oh oh
Oh oh oh oh oh
You covered my heart in kissesHo ho ho, bring a bottle of rum

YazidI'd fallen through the floor again, crashed into the basement
The pain was swallowing me
I was like a lead balloon, I couldn't even get up to turn the lights on
The dark is swallowing me
Lord knows you can’t trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can’t trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
I was breaking down, and I saw
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
I forgot the things I knew, it was I who'd abandoned you
Forgive me, I was lost in doubt
You had never left my side, picked me up when I thought I would die
You held me and I was found
Lord knows you can’t trust your head
When you're standing on the edge of breaking down
Lord knows you can’t trust your head
When you're hanging by a thread
And I'm breaking down
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Only two footprints in the sand
Thought you'd abandoned me and let go of my hand
But you were carrying me, carrying me to safety
Two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, two footprints, your footprints in the sand
Two footprints, your footprints in the sandUnder the moonlight within your warm embrace
I feel so safe here, baby, you were worth the wait
I picked the wrong kind time after time
I drank from the poisoned wine
I picked the wrong kind, but baby, you're alright
Baby, I seen the light
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming, oh
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
One million bullets could come my way
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
'Cause I'd take one million bullets, babe
If you were a poet and I was a faultless muse
If you were the hero, yeah, I'd take a bullet for you
So take me in your arms, take me for all I have
'Cause I'd give my life for one of your belly laughs
But I got a feeling, I got a feeling
Danger is coming, a danger is coming
A danger is coming, oh
I got a feeling, I got a feeling
The war has been won here, the war has been won here
Under the moonlight, under your moonlit gaze
I know that I'd take one million bullets, babe
One million bullets should come my way
But I want you to know that I'd take a million, babe
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
How many would you take?
'Cause I'd take one million bullets, babeAll the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
California dreamin', oh, on such a winter's day
All the leaves are brown and the sky is gray
I've been for a walk on a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm if I was in L.A.
Oh, California dreamin', on such a winter's day
I stopped into a church I passed along the way
Well, I got down on my knees
And I pretended to pray
You know the preacher likes the cold
He knows I'm gonna stay
California dreamin', oh, oh, on such a winter's day
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
I'd be safe and warm
All the leaves are brown 
And the sky is gray 
I've been for a walk, oh, on a winter's day
If I didn't go, I could leave today
California dreamin', on such a winter's day
Oh, on such a winter's day
On such a winter's dayMy love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, you have found peace
You were searching for relief
You gave it all
Gave into the call
You took a chance and
You took a fall for us
You came thoughtfully
Loved me faithfully
You taught me honor
You did it for me
Today you will sleep away
You will wait for me, my love
Now I am strong 
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole
My love, leave yourself behind
Beat inside me, leave you blind
My love, look what you can do
I am mending, I'll be with you
You took my hand
Added a plan
You gave me your heart
I asked you to dance with me
You loved honestly
Gave what you could release
Ah, oh
I know in peace you'll go
I hope relief is yours
Now I am strong 
You gave me all
You gave all you had
And now I am whole

Beat inside me, I'll be with you

Coming from your mouth
And I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick, put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning
Coming from your ears
Yeah, I see you're frightened
I can see the lion
Sleeps tonight in the tears you're crying
Ooh, you can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too

Together, we can take it higher
 We can take it higher

I know we're lost but soon we'll be found
I know we're lost but soon we'll be foundA never ending sentence in my head
We lay hollow in the emptiness
I'm too tired to push you from the bed
No more fighting, no more fighting
There's no more fighting for us
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening
The space between is deafening
No one's moving, we lack the courage to
We lay in stalemate, wishing the other would
But we're too tired, we let the embers cool
No more fighting, there's no more fighting
There's no more fighting for us
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafening
No more fighting, we've given up now
Silence says more than words
Imagination cures loneliness
When you become a prisoner
Fill the void in our bed
The space between is deafening
Oh, we don't bend, we're breaking
The space between is deafeningSnowflake, I'll catch you tonight
Catch you and keep you on ice, my love
Snowflake, you know you're the only one
There's no one like you, so I'm gonna hide you
My sweet
Keep you 'til winter when you won't be needing me
Snowflake, I'm tryin' to keep you safe
You gave me your trust and I want you safe
Snowflake, you know I've got your back
There's no one like you, so I'm gonna hide you
My sweet
Keep you 'til winter when you won't be needing me
Christmas day your freedom comes
Unprotected from the sun
By then you'll be cold enough
For me to send you off with love
Snowflake, don't forget us
Snowflake, don't forget us
Snowflake, don't forget us
If I were a betting man, I'd bet a million on you
But there's no way around this, the only way now is through
Snowflake, now you're on your own
I love you, I know you're just here on loan
You blessed us and soon, you'll be on your way
There's no one like you, so I'll cry myself here to sleep
I kept you 'til winter, now you won't be needing me
Christmas day your freedom comes
Unprotected from the sun
By then you'll be cold enough
For me to send you off with love
Snowflake, don't forget us
Snowflake, don't forget us
Snowflake, don't forget us
If I were a betting man, I'd bet a million on you
But there's no way around this, the only way now is throughWe had love so strong my heart couldn't take it
You took it in your hands and resuscitated
You said, me and you against the world
You said, you and me forever girl
I felt every cell fall in love with you, but
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your PlayStation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
You hurt my pride, part of me died, but all of that's ego
And the house we lived in had no doors, and it had no windows
You said, "I'm hangin' with the boys"
You said "Workin' late to pay our bills"
But I found lipstick on your collar, wasn't my color
I watched you slip, slip away, no explanation
You on your phone, your laptop and your Playstation
I stared at the diamond on my finger and I waited
But the truth never came, but I know her name, so see you later
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
No I won't miss you, I won't cry, I don't regret it
No I won't stand for it, no I don't need confetti
And you can treat another to your lies, you'll never get it
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confetti
I'd rather walk alone, I'd rather walk alone
I'd rather walk alone than let them throw dirty confettiYou're dark gray like a storm cloud
Swelling up with rage that is desperate to be let out
And I know it's a heavy load
Carrying those tears around
Carrying those fears around
Worry makes the world go 'round
You're twisted up like a slip knot
Tied by a juicehead who just took his t shot, and I know
There's a hungry dog tugging at your frayed ends
But he's just playing with you, he just wants to be your friend
So don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook 
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook 
Eyes stingin' from the black smoke, new hope
Loose rope, risen from the undertow
All is well
We welcome the cry of the dark night sky
Swallow me peacefully, follow my heart back inside
So don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
Yesterday is gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook 
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook 
Don't worry, don't worry I'm here by your side
By your side, by your side
We're letting go tonight
Yesterday's gone and you will be ok
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook 
Yesterday is dead and gone and so today
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages, let 'em cook I love you so, wanna throw you from the roof
The pressure builds, wanna put my hands through you
I'll squeeze you tight until you take your last breath
Loving you to death, loving you to death
The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal is an assassin's delight
Just blow me up or run me down or cut my throat
And when its time for you to die
I'll let you know
Detonate me 
Granulate me 
Decapitate me 
Emancipate me 
Free the animal
Free the animal
Free the animal
I love you so I'm putting you in quicksand
You take your chances when you kiss the hitman
The animal's inside of this infinite jest
Loving you to death, loving you to death!
The pressure's rising I won't make it through tonight
This love immortal, is an assassins delight
Just blow me up or run me down, or cut my throat
And when its time for you to die

I'll kill you with my loving
I'll kill you with my loving
Murder me, ruin me, look what you do to me
Beautiful pain baby, pour acid rain on me
Kill me with your loving

Free the animal
Free the animalLook at me, I'm such a basket case
Delivered to you wrapped in cellophane
Waiting on your doorstep every day
Delivery, a basket filled with pain
Patience is your virtue, saint o' mine
I'd have fallen through the cracks, without your love tonight
I'm your groundhog and I'm skating on thin ice
But you see me at your feet and carry me inside
Can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can't hide the pain, can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophane
Look at me I'm such a basket case
While I fall apart, you'll hide all my pills again
And all the things I need to hear you say
You'll watch as all my thoughts get right back on the train
Can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can't hide the pain, can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophane
Can't you see I'm wrapped in cellophane
Watch the blood pump through my veins
Electricity floods my brain
Can't hide the pain, can't hide the pain
When you're wrapped in cellophaneDon't let love get in the way
Feel the fear and do it anyway
Take the chance, no it wasn't what you know
Take her hand and don't let go
Oh, yeah, and you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe, yes, you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe
Tell her all of how you feel
Give her everything she needs to hear
Give your heart, and say "come take it"
And she will see that you're a good man
Oh, yeah, and you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe, yes, you can do it
Don't break, yeah you'll pull through it
You're safe
Yes, you can do it, don't break
Yeah, you'll pull through it, you're safeYou terrify me 'cause you're a man, and not a boy
You got some power, and I can't treat you like a toy
You're the road less traveled by a little girl
You disregard the mess, while I try to control the world
Don't leave me, stay here and frighten me
Don't leave me, come now, enlighten me
Give me all you got, give me your wallet and your watch
Give me your first-born, give me the rainbow and the...
So go and challenge me, take the reigns and see
Watch me squirm, baby, you are just what I need
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
You terrify me, we've still not kissed and yet I've cried
You got too close and I pushed and pushed hoping you'd bite
So I could run, run and that I did but through the dust
You saw those teeth marks, they weren't all yours
You had been thrust into a history
That had not worked for me
Into a history, from which I could not flee
So go on, shake me, shake until I give it up
Wearin' me down, baby, I know that we could make some love
So go and challenge me, take the reigns and see
Watch me squirm, baby, you are just what I need
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
And I've never played a fair game
I've always had the upper hand
But what good is intellect and airplay
If I can't respect any man
Yeah, I want to play a fair game
No, I've never played a fair game
But what good is intellect and airplay
And I want to play a fair game
Yeah, I want to play a fair gameOh
Hands out stretch, what you got
Give me your best and I won't turn you down
Cause you're always out to impress 
You're always out to impress 
You're always out to impress

I put a little makeup on
Put a bow in my hair, wore pretty underwear
Hoping you might take it off
Don't know your etiquette but
I'm strapped to my chair, and it ain't 'cause you're pretty
You were charming, until
You saw your chance to kill, your chance to make history
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
My mascara a mess, harsh words for your princess
Boy, you and your promises
If your goal was to love, you scored an epic miss
Now you'll just have memories
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
Boy, you draw me back in
I'm hungry for your bad loving
But will someone find me swinging from the rafters
From hanging on your every word
You went straight for the knife
And I prepared to die, your blade, it shines
Looked me straight in the eye
You turned the gas on high
Held the flame alight
You wonder why I'm scared of fire
You wonder why you make girls cry
You wonder why you make girls cryI've got a crush, la la la la la la
Like a school girl
And I wanna rush, la la la la la la

You keep me silent, when I should shout out
You make me cry and you make me come
You are the cop and I'm on the run
It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love
Then you let me out, and I catch the sun
You give me a taste of you and no one
But you always leave, and again I’m alone
This secret burns, but I'm imprisoned
It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your touch
Secret life of lovers who have others under the covers
And while you break my heart
I'm a criminal in these parts
It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your love
It all begins with just one kiss
I'm held hostage by your love
Put me in cuffs, lock me up
I'm held hostage by your touch
This prison is rough, but I can't get enough
The secret life of us keeps me in handcuffs
Don't lock me up, don't you wanna free us?
I'm held hostage by your loveWatching the sequence of sounds
Coming out of your mouth
But the snore is too loud
Follow the hands as they move
Try to make out your move
But my brain doesn't want to
Hide, ooh the door
Silent call for you
What have I done to you?
Kill and run, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run, kill and run
A bullet through your heart
Interpret the eyes as they die
Should I cry? Should I love?
Your poor lashes blow
Victim of sensory love
You cry over my voice
An innocent call
Hide, ooh the door
Silent call for you
What have I done to you?
Kill and run, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run, kill and run
A bullet through your heart
Kill and run, kill, kill and run
I'm one of the dirty guns
Kill and run, kill and run
A bullet through your heartUnforgettable
That's what you are
Unforgettable
Tho' near or far
Like a song of love that clings to me
How the thought of you does things to me
Never before
Has someone been more
Unforgettable
In every way
And forever more
That's how you'll stay
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, too
Unforgettable
In every way, oh, oh, oh
And forever more
That's how you'll stay, oh, oh, oh, yeah
That's why, darling, it's incredible
That someone so unforgettable
Thinks that I am
Unforgettable, tooI don’t wanna hold your gaze
I’m scared what I might see there
Found myself within this place
And I’m a burning fire
Oh, peace may come
I hope it won’t take long
Just a faith I cannot see
Bring me home
I’m in here all alone
Just me and my melody
So, free me
Oh, free me
From this pain I’ve been running from
I’m tired and I’m free falling
Free me
Oh, free me
From this shame I’ve been running from
I’m lost and I am calling you
I’m lost and I am calling
I’m lost and I am calling
I'm stuck way back down
I'm slipping even further
Take my hand and turn me around
I’m listening to myself
Oh, peace may come
I hope it won’t take long
Just a faith I cannot see
Bring me home
I’m in here all alone
Just me and my melody
So, free me
Oh, free me
From this pain I’ve been running from
I’m tired and I’m free falling
Free me
Oh, free me
From this shame I’ve been running from
I’m lost and I am calling you
I’m calling you
And though I can’t undo
All the things I put you through
And I can’t take your hand
Admit that I don't have a plan
Only you
Oh, free me
Free me
From this pain I’ve been running from
I’m tired and I’m free falling
Free me
Free me
From this shame I’ve been running from
I’m lost and I am calling you
Free me, ooh
I'm lost and I am calling
Free me
Free me
From this shame I’ve been running from
I’m lost and I am calling youHoping for a miracle
I'm not equipped for this, but I can't move until I choose
I need a crystal ball
I'm falling apart and I can't take anymore
Standing at the crossroads
There's no right answer, no one's brain to pick
Under the spotlight
There's no escaping, I'm a deer caught in headlights
I am hoping for a sign
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life
Ego, I am a slave to you
You're running the show, my confidence is bruised
Dumbstruck, I'm falling further
Down a shame spiral, I am left in this
I am hoping for a sign
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life
Something bring me right here
Not in a drink, not in a drift
Please see me through metaphors in blue
I'm holding on for dear life
Spirit
Please don't abandon meLove is the hardest, love is a battle
Oh, love brings out the best, the worst in my shadow
No, love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe
Love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe
Love is the greatest gift, let's kiss under the mistletoe

He wept as he
Took twelve steps
And carried me
Oh, how he wept
For thee

He wept as he
Took twelve steps
And carried me
Oh, how he wept
For thee
Resurrection on me

A fear to abide by
I don't wanna fight
A blinding white light
And I heard a cry
And it was mine
Burning to survive

Oh, clap your hands My summer rain
I prepared for the worst in a storm
It doesn't take long before I'm shaking
I watch the news end, wait for the forecast
I fill a tall glass, tried to be patient
It's been a long time, I feel my temperature rise
You might be moving too fast, oh
Wait for the sirens, sit in the silence
I sit on my hands
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so bring 'em, bring 'em down
I thought you were a hurricane
Turned out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
I was mistaken, but I feel safe here
So now we're making some kind of rainbow
The storm has broken, two words are spoken
And I am soaking in all you're love, so
Love me for all time, and feel my temperature rise
Thought you were moving too fast, oh
But I was just scared to let you into my head
And let you see my past
I feel the breeze, feel the sea swelling and drowning me
I feel the night, feel the sunlight, I feel everything
I feel your love, and I'm done and I surrender now
I want whatever you've got so bring him, bring him down
I thought you were a hurricane
Turned out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
When you live in fear
You miss everything
I was struggling
When you stop fighting
The war within, everybody wins
I thought you were a hurricane
Turns out you were just summer rain
You came to wash away all of my pain
I needed you in every way
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rain
My summer rainI've stuck around through thick and through thin
You cannot deny I've always been in
But I've watched you stand still as a snowman
But I don't see you change, you're always at meltdown
Yeah, I've been your crutch, your smell, sight, and touch
Yeah, I took you home when you've drunk too much
But I can't survive with you by my side
See, I'll never get laid while I'm running your life
No, "I just don't wanna", so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do, I will not stay
No, I don't need drama, so I'm walking away
Yeah, I am a girl with a lot on her plate
So just cut me loose, learn to tie your shoes
There's somebody here, I'd like to introduce
So look in the mirror, look for the glass
Cause you're not my problem, you are my last
No, "I just don't wanna", so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do, I will not stay
No, "I don't need drama", so I'm walking away
Yeah, I am a girl with a lot on her plate
No, "I just don't wanna", so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do, I will not stay
No, "I don't need drama", so I'm walking away
Yeah, I am a girl with a lot on her plate
No, "I just don't wanna", so I'm walking away
There is nothing that you can do, I will not stay
No, I'm not your mama, so I'm walking away
See, I'm just a girl that you lost to cocaineRemember when we had it all?
Remember when you took my calls?
You were my whole world
You were my whole world
Not a thing said to me
Question now if my heart bleeds
You were my whole world
You were my whole world
I can't stop watching my phone
Can't turn it off
What is wrong with me? I can't, baby
But if you change your mind then I'll miss it
Now I'm crying alone
Hotel, never much fun
Not when there's nobody to catch your tears
Out here
I know
Last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
Soothe me now, soothe me, old friend
Warm my body, dunk my head
He was my whole world
He was my whole world
Kill the chattering
Keep the voices from screaming
He was my whole world
He was my whole world
I can't stop watching my phone
Can't turn it off
What is wrong with me? I can't, baby
But if you change your mind then I'll miss it
Now I'm crying alone
Hotel, never much fun
Not when there's nobody to catch your tears
Out here
I know, last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
Pull me out, I wanna fall
Fall into the rabbit hole
Just pull me out, the pain is great
The pain of losin' you today
The minibar, my trusted friend
Never thought we'd meet again
But here you are, one more, again
You're calling me
You're calling me
I know, last night we made some midnight decisions
Did I mess up? Oh God I hope I didn't
It's all a blur when we talk through the liquor
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisions
I always regret midnight decisionsI can't let go of control
I can't let go and not know
Don't know don't way ahead of me
One day out a time is all I need
There was a time without trust
There was a time without love
But it took you to show me
I can handle about it
I let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn, but
I know that I am in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
So let's take a walk and get lost
Let's take a chance on finding us
I wanna see the world with you
Every step feels so brand new
It's hard to jump with no net
But I jumped and I got no regrets
You're my co-pilot and here, that's fine
Now I can just enjoy the ride
I let you lead the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would feel
The road will twist and turn
But, I know that I'm in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a map
Without a map
Without a map
Without a map
I know we're finally falling in
Cause I was giving you help, now I'm all in
My hand in the air, flying proudly
Cause you're leaving, cause you're leaving
Cause you're leaving, cause you're leaving
I let you leave the way now
Cause I want you to take the wheel
I've never been a passenger, no
I never knew how good it would be
The road will twist and turn, but
I know that I'm in good hands
I've never been a passenger, no
And we've seen more without a mess

And I thought that I could save you from destruction
But I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control
Fighting another war
No I was never in contro-o-ol, never in control
Fighting another war
Was fist-fighting a sandstorm
Now I ain't boxing anymore

But I won't fight it anymore
I'm letting go and it's beautiful

Gars j'ai grave la pêche
Faut j'me taille un week end à Casa en passant par Marrakech
Car en France c'est grave la desh
On cherche tous à faire de la mula
Faut que je me bouge de BVS
Donc avec moi j'ramène mon gars Bouna
J'suis toujours à l'affut rebeu, j'suis toujours dans l'actu
Depuis que t'as entendu mon débit, bizarrement gava tu ne jactes plus
J'prends toujours parti pour mes potes mais là mon gars t'abuses
A chaque nouveau couplet je les choque comme mon gars MOH la ruse
Mehdi Benatia dis leur : tous les chemins mènent à l'AS Rome
Ils aimeraient tous rapper comme moi donc jusqu'en cabine ils m'espionnent
Si t'arrêtes de rapper, en vrai c'est mal pour un bien
Les rappeurs sont comme les chanteurs de zouk : toujours à chialer pour un rien
Sianna c'est khatar, j'veux la maille du Qatar
Si tu veux graille arrive à l'heure sinon on prendra ta part
Mes arbis sont tous àl, cette année j'viens tout graille
Histoire de finir mes jours dans une villa à Dubaï
Cette année j'vais être partout comme le drapeau algérien
Mon son c'est de la frappe comme le pilon marocain
Les rappeurs je les ai piqués comme du piment tunisien
Deuxième couplet j'me barre à Alger en passant par Wahrān
De nos jours ce sont les moins âgés, qui sont le plus dans le haram
J'veux me mettre à fond dans la religion donc j'enchaine les rappels
Mais quand j'en parle à mes potes muslim, j'me rend compte qu'ils m'écoutent à peine
Nabila a dit "allo", Bouk Khra Fi Serouel
Au fissa, faut les sous, la carrière et des punchlines à la N.i.r.o
A trop prendre les choses à cœur, on va tous finir sur le carreau
Je leur vend tellement de rêve, les maisons de disque veulent que je baisse le tarot
Faites péter les dirham, arabe money dans ma pocket
J'bosse avec le numéro 7 pour finir numero uno de la compèt'
Wassup mon rebeu ? Dis moi c'est quoi ta vie ?
J'aimerai voir mes re-frè refaits, à se-l'ai comme des Qataris
Sianna c'est khatar, j'veux la maille du Qatar
Si tu veux graille arrive à l'heure sinon on prendra ta palme
Mes arbis sont tous àl, cette année j'viens tout graille
Histoire de finir mes jours dans une villa à Dubaï
Cette année j'vais être partout comme le drapeau algérien
Mon son c'est de la frappe comme le pilon marocain
Les rappeurs je les ai piqués comme du piment tunisien
Bang Bang je suis invincible
C'est bientôt la fin du game je suis indécis
Yo imbécile, faut investir, arrêtez de poser des questions imprécises
Oh oh oh, c'est acide
A une leçon de flow ils assistent
Chaque freestyle je les attriste
J'suis validé par Hafid
Sania dis-leur, on ira jusqu'au sommet
J'ai plus le temps de déconner
Faut que je mette un terme à tous mes projets
Je leur met vite la pression
Khey pose pas trop de questions
Si tu veux que je fasse un vrai son, faut qu'il y ait Mohand comme ingé son
Sianna c'est khatar, j'veux la maille du Qatar
Si tu veux graille arrive à l'heure sinon on prendra ta palme
Mes arbis sont tous àl, cette année j'viens tout graille
Histoire de finir mes jours dans une villa à Dubaï
Cette année j'vais être partout comme le drapeau algérien
Mon son c'est de la frappe comme le pilon marocain
Les rappeurs je les ai piqués comme du piment tunisienBoom, woke me from my sleep
Boom, woke me from a dream
Boom, got me on my feet

It's time to stand up and sing
For my life
I'm here now to try it all
I'm ready to take a fall
'Cause I'm an original
Why deny it?
And I won't waste my life being typical
I'ma be original, even when it's difficult

I'm done with the suffering
It's time to stand up and sing
For my life
I'm here now to try it all
I'm ready to take a fall

I cry out, but nothing comes now
I'm giving my all and I know peace will come
I never wanted to need someone
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
And if you let go I'll float towards the sun
I'm stronger 'cause you fill me up
But when the fear comes and I drift towards the ground
I am lucky that you're around
Yeah, I wanted to play tough
Thought I could do all just on my own
But even Superwoman
Sometimes needed Superman's soul
Help me out of this hell
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Lifts me up like helium
You lift me up and I am found
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I am down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground
You lift me up when I'm down, down, down
You lift me up before I hit the ground
Your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up when I'm down, down, down
When I've hit the ground
You're all I need
'Cause your love lifts me up like helium
Your love lifts me up like heliumTwo hearts, one past
I was your lover
Cruel words broke us
You became another
I'm with the enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
Poor you, so sad
Well I think it's time now
You’re too crying feel so bad
But can I lie down
The enemy in my bed
When the voice in my head
Tells me I should treat myself better
I know you don’t mean to be mean
When you’re hurting you'll see
You can see just how dark it is getting
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away 
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
Feel my heart break
As I walk away 
So one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to fight
But one hand is holding yours while
The other is waving goodbye
I love you, but it's your turn to cry
It's your turn to cry
It's your turn to fightDo you remember
When we used to live
Happy together
We used to live
Now I fucking hate this
And I know you do too
But we're addicted
But we're addicted to us
But we're addicted to us
Fuck love
This is only causing us harm
Riding on the dopamine storm
Dead in the eyes
It hurts to breathe
Passion aside
Just scared to leave
Wandering eyes
Beg for a change
Brain needs to breathe
Mind feels the same
Oh, do you think that were lost
Wish that we could stay lost
Guess that we should stay lost
Grasping nothing
Time is up
We can't break or bend
To save a poisonous love
Grasping nothing
Time is up
Tear apart the
Tear apart the falsely veiled comfort
Take it!
All our photos
Gather dust up on the window sill
Looking backwards
Keeps me holding on to something dear
You swore to always
Bracing for goodbyes
I suffocate
I suffocate
As you speak
I fucking hate this
And I know you do too
But we're addicted
But we're addicted
Oh, do you think that were lost
Wish that we could stay lost
Guess that we should stay lost
Grasping nothing
Time is up
We can't break or bend
To save a poisonous love
Grasping nothing
Time is up
Tear apart the
Tear apart the falsely veiled comfort
Take itWhen I look up from my pillow
I dream you are there with me
Though you are far away
I know you'll always be near to me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I look around me and feel
You are ever so close to me
Each tear that falls from my eye
Brings back memories of you to me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I was wrong, I will cry
I will love you till the day I die
You alone, you alone and no one else
You were meant for me
Oh
When morning comes again
I have the loneliness you left me
Each day drags by until finally
My time descends on me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with me
I go to sleep
And imagine that you're there with meWhen you fight so hard but nothing seems to turn out right
When it breaks your heart and life seems like the longest fight
When all you see is trees but you can't see the forest
Oh baby turn to me, I'll show you where the light is
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart
You know I can't breathe, you're so deep in my lungs
Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on Earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call life
So when you feel alone,  like nobody will help you
Just think of me in all my heart I have kept you
You can count on me, I'll stitch you into my heart
You know I can't breathe, you're so deep in my lungs
Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on Earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call life
Through tsunamis, earthquakes or a broken spirit
When you scream with no voice, you know I will hear it
You know I will come running when I feel the Earth move
Through a flood, toil and blood, through the tides of terror
Feel my love, feel my love, let it breathe forever
You know I will come running when I feel the Earth move
Oh my, oh my love's in the air
The fire, the flame, I'm there
Yes, my love's here on Earth
The ocean, death and birth
Yes, my love's in the sky
The pain you feel tonight
Through this joy I call lifeHey, America, let's turn it up, yeah check out yourselves
Cause you know you're never fully dressed without a smile
Your clothes may be Chanel, Gucci, your shoes crocodile
But baby, you're never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for nothing you'll fall for it all
We got all we need, got love and more
But never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
If it's real, you'll open every door
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile
You're never fully dressed without a smile

But never fully dressed without a smile
And if you stand for something, you can have it all
If it's real, you'll open every door

I turn my face towards the warm night sky
And I'm not afraid of a thousand eyes
When they're above, five hundred smiles
Oh, I used to think
What wouldn't I give
For a moment like this
This moment, this gift
Now look at me and this opportunity
Is standing right in front of me
But one thing I know it's only part luck
And so I'm putting on my best show
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, you see
Now I find myself here and it's time
This is real and it's a goldmine
I'm not afraid to fly
When it's above five hundred smiles
Oh, I used to think
What wouldn't I give
For a moment like this
This moment, this gift
And now look at me and this opportunity
Is standing right in front of me
But one thing I know it's only part luck
And so I'm putting on my best show
Under the spotlight I'm starting my life
Big dreams becoming real tonight
So look at me and this opportunity
You're witnessing my moment, you see
My big opportunity
I won't waste it, I guaranteeI was walking dead
Inside my head
I couldn't get out
Turned the lights down
The voices inside were so loud
Needed a jump start
Catatonia
I couldn't feel
Wished that I could disappear
The voices inside were so real
But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
The wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma
We're lovers again tonight
Back to life, back to life, back to life, back to life, yeah, yeah
[Verse 2:}
Woke me up one touch and I felt alive
Loved me back to life, back to life, thought I died
You woke me up, one touch and I felt alive
You loved me back to life
Back to life, thought I died
The voices inside were so quiet
But you stood by my side
Night after night, night after night
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, the wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight
Strong hands, thick skin, and an open heart
You saw through the pain, saw through the mask
You never gave up on me, life
You love me back to life, life
From the coma, the wait is over
You loved me back to life, life
From the coma, we're lovers again tonight
Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life
Back to life, back to life, yeahOh, you were waiting for me, you saw me, adored me
As I wish the whole world would
You would never hurt me, desert me or work me
For all the things you thought you could
And you would lick the tears from my eyes when I cry
How I missed you when I was gone
Hurt me so to leave you, deceive you, I needed you
I believed in you
Oh, I, I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
Now all I have is riches and pictures and stitches
Money could never buy what you gave
And though my heart is achin' and breakin', I'm makin'
The most of what you send my way
Now I want just to hold you, unfold you, I told you
See, I am coming back for you
Yeah, I know we will be okay everyday
The sun shines a little brighter
Oh, I, I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I never meant to let you down
I'll wait with a stake in my heart
I never meant to put you down
I'm trying not to fall apart
I'm trying not to fall apart
We'll reunite, oh, we'll set a light
I'm pushing with all of my might
Oh no, I never meant to let you down
I never meant to put you down
I never meant to let you down
I never meant to put you down
Yeah, I'm trying not to fallI pray
Yeah, I'm hoping that if I pray
Maybe you'll talk back
'Cause I pray for some faith, some faith today
This walk feels longer in the dark tonight
No hand to hold, no end in sight
I pour my heart out to the blackest sky
Oh, spirit, can you hear my soul's cry?
Can you hear my call? Can I have a sign?
'Cause I am losing hope
Yeah, on my darkest night
This walk feels longer in the dark tonight
No hand to hold, no end in sight
I pour my heart out to the blackest sky
Oh, spirit, can you hear my soul's cry?
No, I don't wanna walk alone, I want to believe
'Cause I am losing hope
As love will speak to me
Can you hear my call? Can I have a sign?
'Cause I am losing hope
Yeah, on my darkest night
I got a feeling you're out there
I got a feeling you're out thereCome on lover, you don't wanna fight me
I want another, you'll regret not hitting me
Can you feel the chemistry?
Yeah, you and me should be doing it right now

Can you feel the chemistry?
Yeah, you and me should be doing it right now

I'm feeling you too
It's your testosterone, testosterone, testosteroneAs I hung up the phone
There was silence
No reason to go home
1100 days
Have come and gone away
It's over
That introduction
Designed a map for the coming years
That tapped connection
Took a hold and would not let go
Murder in my heart strings
Fighting for the bounty
Reaping what I sow
Keeping me infatuated
There's something about the way you stare back
Keeping me infatuated
Your color was always green
I felt us slipping
Faster by the distance
We started shifting
Separate existence
Regret the right decision
The splitting of an atom
I hope it's not forgotten
Again again again the story goes
Reaping what I sow, keeping me infatuated
There's something about the way you stare back
Keeping me infatuated
Your color was always green
I felt us slipping
Faster by the distance
We started shifting
Separate existence
Regret the right decision
The splitting of an atom
I hope it's not forgotten
Again again again the story goes
But we both get along
We both
Get along
Evident that we'll never hold ourselves this long
Evident that our memories always carry onSend a wish upon a star
Do the work and you'll go far
Send a wish upon a star
Make a map and there you are
Send a hope upon a wave
A dying wish before the grave
Send a hope upon a wave
For all the souls you failed to save
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
Send a question in the wind
It's hard to know where to begin
So send the question in the wind
And give an answer to a friend
Place your past into a book
Put in everything you ever took
Place your past into a book
Burn the pages let them cook
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
And you stood tall
Now you will fall
Don't break the spell
Of a life spent trying to do well
Send a wish upon a star
Send a wish upon a starStealing hearts was your pastime
I saw girls falling hook line
You stole kisses and threw them aside
Hits and misses you lost sight
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
Making waves was your hobby, yeah
And I asked you to hold me
And I knew it you do it all over the world
All is different now I'm your girl
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
You've changed
For the better, oh
You've changed, oh
For the better
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
You've changed, oh
For the better, yeah
You've changed
For the better, oh
You've changed, oh
For the betterFor those who've slept
For those who've kept
Themselves jacked up
How Jesus wept
Sunday, Sunday
For those in need
For those who speed
For those who try to slow their minds with weed
Sunday, Sunday
For those who wake
With a blind headache
Who must be still
Who will sit and wait
For sunday, to be monday
Yeah, it will be okay
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away
For those with guilt
For those who wilt
Under pressure
No tears over spilt milk
Sunday, Sunday
Sunday
Sunday
Sunday
Yeah, it will be okay
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run away
Yeah, it will be okay
Do nothing today
Give yourself a break
Let your imagination run awayOh no, you broke a heart again
Now I can't help but feel foolish and ashamed
I am a broken record, a glitch in your iPod
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody
Baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on me
Oh no, I let you fool me once
Shame on you, fool me twice, shame on me
Am I a scratched CD? A glitch in your download?
But could it be an empty track, a lost melody?
Baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on me
Oh baby just burn we'll see
I don't need you to believe in
I've got a new faith in me, you'll see, yeah
You broke my heart and now this is my arena and I'm sold out 
You tried to kick me down but you're hearing this now when your heart is beating 
See, I'm doing fine, better than fine
And now I see that your melody was lost on meYou can be my alphabet and I will be your calculator
And together we'll work out on the escalator
I will time you as you run up to down
And you'll measure my footsteps as I blow through this town
The mean of our heights is divided by the nights
Which is timesed by the daggers in the root of all our fights
The pass of your poem is to swathe me in your knowing
And the beauty of the word is that you don't have to show it
Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love
I am a dash and you're a dot
When will you see that I am all that you've got?
I'm a binary code that you've cracked long ago
But to you I'm just a novel that you wish you never wrote
I'm greater than X and lesser than Y, so why is it
That I still can't catch your eye?
You're a cryptic crossword, a song I've never heard
While I sit here drawing circles, I'm afraid of being hurt
Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love
You're a difficult equation with a knack for heart evasion
Will you listen to my proof or will you add another page on?
It appears to me the graph has come and stolen all the laughs
It appears to me the pen is overanalyzed again
And if I am a number, I'm infinity plus one
And if you are five words, you are "afraid to be the one"
And if you are a number, you're infinity plus one
And if I am four words then I am "needing of your love"
Oh, academia, you can pick me up
Soothe me with your words when I need your love
Oh, academia, academia, academia
Oh, academia, academia, academiaWhile aware the hour
Into something new
Throw away the flowers
They make you feel blue
Throwing stones at stranger
Waiting for the fight
Throwing stones at birds who struggle to take flight
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
Get it out your system
Get it out of you
Send them home with blisters
Send the home with truth
Send them away the daughters
Blind them with your hoof
Try to save the daughters
Try to sell the news
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rain
I am a dark cloud swelling with rainI'm ready for you, I'm ready for life
I trust that I will be alright
I'm ready for us, I'm ready tonight
Catch me, I'm your butterfly
The feeling is right and it can't be wrong
It's what I've been searching for
I think you're the one, I think you're the one
The one that I've been dreaming of
You take my breath away
You got me feeling faint
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me tonight
I can't feel my heart
Yeah, I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
And in your embrace I close my eyes
I'll admit it feels divine
And I feel the heat of your skin on mine
You and I are one tonight
You take my breath away
You got me feeling faint
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me tonight
I can't feel my heart
Yeah I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
Yeah I feel so high, you touch me tonight
I can't feel my heart
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
Yeah I feel so high, you touch me tonight
I can't feel my heart
I feel so high, you touch me in the light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headedHey boy

Hey boy whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
Hey boy whatcha got for me, whatcha got in store?
Hey BoyI start to move forward I'm doing well but
That scab screams my name
So I scratch it to hear what it's saying
To hear what it's saying
Replay
Every scene
Organs freeze
All of my vitals dim in and out 
Desperate to breathe
I have seen months of progression
All wither out
They wither out
So I search agressively in hopes to find the part of me that I used to love
I used to know, but I'm gone
And it's bleeding out
Everywhere that I go theres a constant reminder
A place
A feeling I can't get around
Once I start, I can't stop
And the foliage falls at my feet
In the form of a memory lost
I trip and fall
Maybe I'm subconsciously a masochist who loves to ff my own mind
I wear it out
Aware of doubt
I still search desparately in hopes to find the part of me that you seem to have
It's gone and I'm bleeding out
Everywhere that I go
There's a constant reminder
A place
A feeling I can't get around
Once I start, I can't stop
And the foliage falls at my feet
In the form of a memory
Black and white is how I see
Never inbetween
A dozen weeks of progress
Wither out, they wither out
Searching in and out of me
Planning surgery
I tear apart my ribcage
Just to double check, but still you've got it
You've got it
Tumor 
Growing 
Tumor 
Growing You shot me up, yeah
You filled my cup, oh
You sailed my boat
You were my last hope
You took my very last hope away
Oh, you, you will be loved by someone good
Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good
You have been loved
You dropped the bomb, yeah
And now you're gone, oh
I held you dear
You swallowed my fears
And now I've drunk my last beer with you
Oh, you, you have been loved by someone good
Yeah, you, you will be loved
Oh will you ever know
That the bitterness and anger left me long ago
Only sadness remains
And it will pass
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Yeah, you, you will be loved by somebody good
By somebody goodDeath by chocolate is a myth, yeah
This I know because I lived, oh
I've been around for broken hearts and how
Lay your head in my hands little girl, this is only right now
And death by crying doesn't exist, oh
Though the headaches feel a bit like it
You might explode but you reach the end of the road
And you little tree, I'm certain you will grow
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again 
Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend
And death by anger this is true, oh
Just let him go, he can't hurt you, oh
Oh little girl, this is such a cruel, cruel world
This is the first of a million broken hearts
Tears on your pillow will dry and you will learn
Just how to love again 
Oh my weeping willow, let your leaves fall and return
Oh darling, the seasons are your friend
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, it won't be long, you will grow strong, up, up and away
Oh, he's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leaf
Yeah, he's but a falling leaf
He's but a falling leaf, he's but a falling leafI saw you cry today
The pain may fill you
I saw you shy away
The pain will not kill you
You made me smile today
You spoke with many voices
We traveled miles today
Shared expressions voiceless
It has to end
Living in your head
Without anything to numb you
Living on the edge
Without anything to numb you
It has to end to begin
Began and end today
Gave and got given
You made a friend today
Kindred soul cracked spirit
It has to end to begin
Living in your head
Without anything to numb you
Living on the edge
Without anything to numb you
It had to end to begin
Living in your head
Without anything to numb you
Living on the edge
Without anything to numb you
Living in your head
Without anything to numb you
Living on the edge
Without anything to numb you
It has begunSur la tête de Marine Le Pen
Yo, j'arrive dans l'game, la concu' déménage
C'est le bordel faut se ranger, et c'est pas des menaces
21 balais mais pas pour faire le ménage
Move your body, tout va si vite mais faut pas t'emballer avant que tout tombe à l'eau
Aucune envie de me barrer, et oui ça me rend paro
La vie nous fait pas de fleur, comment la voir en rose ?
Paris est magique, j'arrive et le tour est fait
Ils veulent me tester ? Je vais me les faire
Toujours fidèle au poste comme sur radio FM
J'veux les prendre de haut comme la Tour Eiffel
Préviens mes ennemis, je les ai dans ma ligne de mire
Ils ont dépasser les limites, il faut que je les élimine
Il faut que je les élimine, dois-je viser XXX pour tirer dans le mille ?
Rap français, je balance des inédits
Ça y est j'crois qu'il est temps que je le dise
Dans l'game j'suis arrivée par hasard, j'repartirai sur un coup de tête comme Zinédine Zidane
J'fais la maille, j'me taille
J'laisse le revers, j'prends la médaille
Dans la street, tu joues les gros bonnets mais en fait t'es juste qu'un bonnet d'âne 
Paraît que j'ai percé, moi je sais pas perso
Mais j'ai foutu le feu à Bercy
J'ai tout retourné comme une perquis'
Fuck les bacqueux qui agissent à la dure
Allez le dire à la juge, les coups de matraque ça fait pas que des courbatures
On en a marre des bleus, comme une femme battue
Adama, Théo, Zied et Bouna
En ce moment, j'vois que la France se voile la face mais veut pas que mes sœurs portent le foulard
Du rejet, ça en a tout l'air
J'fais partie de la souffrance, imagine la douleur
Le FN voit la vie en noir et blanc ouais, et nous en couleur
J'en ai marre qu'ils nous parlent mal, envoie le mic'
Ça me dégoûte de les écouter nous insulter de racailles et dire que il y a que dans le shit qu'on est bon à faire de la maille
J'mettrai un point d'honneur
Allez fumer après la virgule Nike
Ils veulent nous voir plus bas que Terre, j'vais les enterrer
Mieux régler mes comptes, et prendre les intérêts
Toujours sur le terrain
Contrôle de police, j'ai même pas révisé
Y'a une balance, on sait même pas qui c'est
J'aimerais que les masques tombent pour voir qui se déguisait
Rimes bien aiguisées, et oui le couz le beat je le découpe
L'album est sortie, va falloir que tu le découvres, cours, cours
J'suis en cabine, mon public m'a bipé
Là il faut que je les rappelle
J'mets des râteaux à la concu'
J'ramasse tout ces MC à la pelle
Ils ont voulu tester, j'étais obligée
Mais bon ça m'a fait de la peine
J'ai la droite à Mayweather, toi à Marine Le Pen
J'ai la droite à Mayweather, toi à Marine Le Pen
J'ai la droite à Mayweather, toi à Marine Le Pen
Tout s'achète, tout se paye 
Sur la tête de Marine Le PenHave you ever shared a premonition
Have you ever lived inside a dream
Have you ever stayed in one position
Terrified by movement on the sheets
It's a cold belief
It's the problem when we believe to see, believe to be the dead
It's a cold belief
It's the problem when we believe to see, believe to live again
Would they give us answers
Would they try to tell us what the rooms say
To tell us what the walls say
The apparition comes to stay with us
In terrible condition, terrible condition
Have you ever laid in one position
Realized that you forget to breathe
Whispers in the wall begin to snarl, begin to talk
We are the problem now
We are the hollow sounds
It's a cold belief
It's the problem when we believe to see, believe to be the dead
It's a cold belief
It's the problem when we believe to see, believe to live again
What's in front of us 
Moving through the walls 
What's in front of us 
Moving through the walls 
What's in front of us 
Moving through the walls 
What's in front of us 
What if we could hear them all whisper
Stuck in the wall, shaking the mirror
What if we could hear them all whisper
Stuck in the wall, shaking the mirror
Have you ever seen yourself asleep
Whispers in the wall begin to snarl, begin to talk
We are the problem now
We are the hollow soundsI'm being dragged down, down by the hand
The hand of a golden giant man
He's crushing my knuckles and splitting my skin
He says he'll let go, if only I'd ask it of him
He says, "Girl, it's your call
You wanna fly? You wanna fall?"
So I shout, "Oh, I wanna get away from you
As fast as I can"
I tell my feet to move it
I hope they have a plan
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
So now I'm free, free
From the big bad giant
Who was stalking me
Thank you feet, for guiding me, yeah
I'm glad somehow I got brains down there, at least
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
Sometimes I'm tempted, sometimes I am
I would be lying if I said I didn't miss that giant man
Oh, he was the line between pleasure and pain
But me and the feet have some years to reclaim
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life today
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Are heading the right way
These little black sandals
Are walking me away
These little black sandals
Saved my life todayFaint light of dawn
I'm listening to you breathing in and breathing out
Needing nothing
You're honey dipped
You are beautiful, floating clouds, soft world
I can't feel my lips
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down
Then all of that's annulled and I'm anyone's, everyone's
We are one
Your face becomes the sun
And I'm addicted to the joy that the little things
Those little things
The little things they bring
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down
So now for restless mind
I could go either way
I'm going down, I don't want to change
I'm going down, going down the drain
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down, I beg you
Don't bring me down, I won't let you
Don't bring me down
There's nothing left to choose
So I fight a war in my head
Stay the night, protect meAppuie sur play mec faut que tu m'écoutes
Des vrais amis y'en a pas beaucoup
Il t'appelle frère t'es même pas son couz'
Il encaisse l'argent toi t'encaisses les coups
Le temps s'écoule vite pour la réussite
Le chemin est long mais la vie est courte
Je vais pas me laisser faire faut rester lucide
Face à Lucifer faut s'serrer les coudes
Le mal nous tourne autour et nos mères en souffrent
En bas de nos tours les petits sont déterminés
A se faire la guerre pour un bout de terrain
Sans passer par le notaire
C'est fini c'est trop tard dans le tiek's y'a trop d'armes
Préviens tous tes contacts
Sors pas à découvert
Conseille de mon comptable
Comme la bac défonce la porte chez toi quand on tape
Ici il y a pas de répit, noir est le drapeau
Doigt sur la détente, seul moyen de repos
La vie nous mène en bateau
Oui dans le mal je navigue
Il est temps de quitter le navire
Que je prenne en main ma vie
Tu crois vivre en enfer
C'est que ce n'est pas le paradis
Je vois des gens nager dans la merde
Et d'autres se noyer dans la tise
Y'a pas de valeurs sûres sur Terre tout est relatif
Pour acheter un havre de paix ou un coin de paradis
Je suis trop terre à terre
Ils l'ont trop ouvert, j'viens faire taire les rappeur
J'ai déjà tout gagné dis leur que j'ai plus rien à perdre
Qu'ils s'excusent c'est même plus la peine
Une fois enterré personne manque à l'appel
Demande à Bernie je fais pas de cadeaux même à Noël
C'est la douche froide il pleut des balles
Tu t'es mouillé t'as pas eu le temps de te vé-sau
Je te laisse dans ton bain de sang
Moi je suis dans mon bendo
Mais c'est pas pour autant que je vais me la couler douce
Je me démarque des autres
Vas-y fais moi la passe
Je fais tourner le business la concu' se tourne les pouces
Je suis venu te prendre ta place, j'tabasse j'tabasse
Ici il y a pas de répit, noir est le drapeau
Doigt sur la détente, seul moyen de repos
La vie nous mène en bateau
Oui dans le mal je navigue
Il est temps de quitter le navire
Que je prenne en main ma vie
Tu crois vivre en enfer
C'est que ce n'est pas le paradis
Je vois des gens nager dans la merde
Et d'autres se noyer dans la tise
Y'a pas de valeurs sûres sur Terre tout est relatif
Pour acheter un havre de paix ou un coin de paradisBack, back, back, back
I know you want me back, back, back, back
I know you want me
All black when I dip it low
Too cold for you when it cold
High heels and a killer glow
Feeling even better than I did before
Top down when we hit the road
And we kick them haters, gonna need a note
More love than a centerfold
From the east to the west coast
Swerve it
Fighting clean but I might talk dirty
Spotlight silhouette, looking curvy
Flyer than a G5 jet
Thought we was finished, you ain't seen nothing yet
When you had my lovin', I gave you all my trust
You was blind on me, now I'm all you see
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me
Crop top, know I'm looking great
Taking pics you might wanna like
Club packed, it's from wall to wall
More stars than a summer night
Drinks up, we gon' celebrate
Might bend, but I didn't break
You want me back, but you hella late
Different than I was yesterday
Swerve it
Got my girls in the whip, sitting purty
Spotlight silhouette, looking curvy
Flyer than a G5 jet
Thought we was finished, you ain't seen nothing yet
When you had my lovin', I gave you all my trust
You was blind on me, now I'm all you see
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me
See me with my new man, now you wildin'
Got a new team, give me no problems
99 reasons why you ain't got me
Ha, you really ain't got me
Damn homie, in high school you was my man homie
But you ain't study up for that exam for me
Now I'm all you see
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back
You want me back again
But I won't do that again
Keep it 100, real shit
Can't nobody do it like I does it
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me back, back, back, back, back
Now you want me
You had a good thing, you was sleeping
Got my starting five, you ain't even my sixth man
You had a good thing, you was sleeping
Got my starting five, you ain't even my sixth manI have seen better days
Seek shelter from the storm
But it follows me
Yes it follows me
The black cloud
Runnin' with no cover
I fear that I may drown
And it follows me
Yes it follows me
The black cloud
And I'm so close to giving up
I have lost my fight
And I start struggling
It knocks me down
I'll let your love wash over me
You'll be my life jacket, and you've come to save me
Here comes the tide, and tries to drag me under
You'll be my life jacket, your love it helps me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Floating in your ocean
I feel like I can breathe
You came for me, you came for me
Before I drowned
But now I won't let my heart stress
For you and me
Finally
Yes, finally
I have been found
I was so close to giving up
I had lost my fight
I had started struggling
It knocked me down
I'll let your love wash over me
You'll be my life jacket, and you've come to save me
Here comes the tide, and tries to drag me under
You'll be my life jacket, your love it helps me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Floating in your ocean
I feel like I can breathe
You came for me, you came for me
Before I drowned
I'll let your love wash over me
You'll be my life jacket, and you've come to save me
Here comes the tide, and tries to drown me under
You'll be my life jacket, your love it helps me
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-ohJ'suis en place, depuis le début tu constates
Quand j'commence à kicker poto tu causes aps
Toujours appliquée t'inquiète tous mes couplets sont intacts
Téma l'impact, j'suis toujours impecc'
J'signerai jamais d'pacte même pour un gros chèque
Tu m'attaques au AK on sortira les roquettes
J'te parle pas d'chirurgie quand j'te dis qu'j'suis refaite
Ok, c'est maintenant, j'vais leur montrer qu'il est temps qu'ils me prennent au sérieux
Capables de critiquer mais incapables de faire mieux
Avant d'l'ouvrir faut apprendre à la fermer
Des lyrics dans l'cerveau, difficile à cerner
Quand j'pose un truc de malade ils veulent tous m'interner
C'que vous faîtes c'est pas mal mais perso ça m'bluffe pas
On vient remettre les pendules à l'heure du Six-Bull au 9-3
Wassup
Bang, Général
On fait de la maille on fait pas de la peine
Je ne laisse que très peu de place à l'à-peu-près
Ça fait bien longtemps qu'on s'est libérés de nos chaînes
Untouchable Soldat devine comment qu'elle s'appelle
Sianna, Sianna, Sianna
Une vraie petite sœur pas une chienne comme Rihanna
Sianna, Sianna, Sianna
Une vraie petite sœur pas une chienne comme Rihanna
Sianna, Sianna, Sianna

Ça fait bien longtemps qu'on s'est libérés de nos chaînes
Untouchable Soldat devine comment qu'elle s'appelle : Sianna
Quand j'rentre dans la cabine c'est pour tout dévaster
Sans rouler en Merco j'vais tous les déclasser
On est un level au-dessus mais ça ils veulent pas l'avouer
Pour rentrer dans l'histoire j'vais devoir les effacer
Ils sont tous à la traîne, ils font tous de la peine
J'suis en cabine mais j'réponds pas aux appels
Ils veulent tous savoir qui a la meilleure paye
Ramène-moi la meilleure rapeuse j'suis bien meilleure qu'elle
Ils sont loin derrière, ils utilisent le flow que j'avais l'année dernière
Sur la route du succès on défonce toutes les barrières
J'ai beau prier pour la paix j'ai un mental de guerrière
J'ai assez d'problème, t'occupes pas d'ma vie
Mes frérots ont la haine comme Saïd Taghmaoui
Ils sont à la traîne, j'les ken en moins d'deux
Moi et mon mic' inséparables comme gégé et son joint d'beuh

Untouchable Soldat devine comment qu'elle s'appelle : Sianna
Faut qu'ils comprennent qu'ils sont tous à la traîne
Faîtes de l'argent au lieu d'faire de la peine
On gagne de l'oseille et on trinque à la tienne
Quand il s'agit d'mailler on a jamais la flemme
Si tu parles mal, tu connais la scène
Crois-moi, j'suis bien meilleure que là-celle
Ma meilleure punchline, j'sais pas c'est laquelle
J'en trouverai une autre à la fin d'la semaine
J'compte tout chambouler et j'veux qu'ils l'apprennent
Mon blaze dans leur crâne je veux qu'ils l'imprègnent
Si Dieu l'veut bientôt j'atteint la vingtaine
Et pour autant tous ces rappeurs me font d'la peine
La concu' j'la ken, et j'le re-ken
Qui est la meilleure kickeuse dans le game ?
J'suis dans la cabine j'réponds pas aux appels
Faîtes de la maille au lieu d'faire de la peine

Sianna, Sianna, Sianna, en mode Untouchable
Sianna, Sianna, Sianna, bang bang ça va faire mal, aïeDéjà tout p'tit on voulait tout faire
On a rien gagné, on a tout perdu
On rentrait de l'école, on était tout fier
Maintenant, c'est la nuit que l'on arpente les rues
On a rien raté, on était du-per
Maintenant, mon ambition a pris du poids
On a beaucoup parlé, on aurait dû s'taire
J'ai grandi, j'ai appris mais ça a pris du temps
En vérité j'voulais pas rapper mais j'ai vu qu'ça passe crème
J'vous ai prév'nus, j'suis v'nu tout rafler donc faudra pas s'plaindre
Depuis 2010 j'suis au taquet mais l'niveau n'est pas l'même
Même avec ton meilleur couplet tu n'pourras jamais m'atteindre
Oui j'ai, oui j'ai charbonné
On m'a fait des coups d'pute mais j'ai pardonné
J'ai v'là les flows, j'ai v'là les phases
Ma vie part en freestyle, tu vas être affolé
J'vais les rafaler
J'vais même pas les graille, j'vais les avaler
Tu crois qu'j'ai peur mais j'suis dans l'game
Comme dans une paire de Tim', j'suis grave à l'aise
Toujours dans mon Six-Bulle
J'ai pas déménagé, j'ai pas trouvé d'excuse
J'ai tout misé dans l'rap, obligée d'm'investir, téma mon dernier clip sur ton Iphone 6 Plus
J'ai jamais lâché l'affaire
Dans la galère, jamais lâché un frère
J'sais à qui j'ai à faire, maman veut qu'j'la rassure
Sa fille  n'est pas rentrée, ça depuis avant-hier
Wassup, j'oublie pas d'où je viens, où je vais, tu sais
On est plein au départ, à l'arrivée très peu
Nan maman, j'suis pas sûr de rentrer ce soir
Mais je ne veux pas échouer j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner,  j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner,  j'vais charbonner
J'ai bien r'tenu la l'çon
Depuis l'début, j'n'ai jamais rien lâché
J'me posais des questions, pour faire les bons choix
J'en ai mal à la tête, j'en ai marre de penser
Et c'est toujours la même : c'est la routine et ça toute l'année
J'passe à la télé mais j'suis toujours la même
Tu peux demander à mes potes, y'a rien qu'a changé
J'suis jamais dans l'excès
T'auras jamais mon flow, tu vois bien que j'excelle
J'dis la vérité, je n'veux pas te vexer
J'suis trop loin pour toi, on n'est pas d'la même espèce
J'demande rien à personne, ça fait des années que je me suis faite toute seule
J'ai appris à marcher avec ceux qui m'ressemblent
J'ai toujours été droite, ils pourront dire ce qu'ils veulent
J'suis fière de mon parcours, d'ici quelques années tu m'entendras partout
Je charbonne, je charbonne, je charbonne pour entendre mon album à tous les carrefours
J'lâcherai jamais l'affaire
Dans la galère, jamais lâché un frère
J'sais à qui j'ai à faire, maman est rassurée est rassurée
Sa fille est rentrée, elle a enfin signé
J'oublie pas d'où je viens, où je vais, tu sais
On est plein au départ, à l'arrivée très peu
Nan maman, j'suis pas sûr de rentrer ce soir
Mais je ne veux pas échouer j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner,  j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner
J'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner, j'vais charbonner,  j'vais charbonner

I'll be around, I'll be your every weatherPoetry in your body
You got it in every way
And can't you see it's you I'm watching?
I am hot for you in every way
And turn around, let me see you
Wanna free you with my rhythm
I know you can't get enough
When I turn up with my rhythm
Your body’s poetry, speaks to me
Won’t you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body’s poetry, speaks to me
Won’t you let me be your rhythm tonight?

Poetry in your body
Got me started, it'll never end
Feel my rhythm in your system
This is living, I'm your only friend
Feel the beat in your chest
Beat your chest like an animal
Free the beast from it's cage
Free the rage like an animal
Your body’s poetry, speaks to me
Won’t you let me be your rhythm tonight?
I wanna be your muse use my music
And let me be your rhythm tonight
Your body’s poetry, speaks to me
Won’t you let me be your rhythm tonight?

Oh, red-handed love
There is smoke and fire
You are the greatest liar
I wish you'd disappear
Now I've seen enough
Of your dirty lo-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-o-ove
Yes, I have seen enou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ou-ough
Of your dirty love
Now I've got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
Your dirty magic, you've broken my heart
With your black art
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram
And I fear you'll be back
Inside all the cracks
No, I can't handle that
History's heartbreak
Was in my mind
Now I no longer cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
I no longer cry, cry-y-y-y-y-y-y-y-y
I'll no longer cry
Now I've got you out, I just want you gone
I need to be alone
Your dirty magic, you've broken my heart
With your black art
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh, oh-oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram
But now the power's out and you are thin air
What an illusion, I coulda sworn that you were there
Smoke and mirrors, you were just a hollow man
Hologram

And sadly they clipped your wings
You can't fly away electric bird
Yeah someone took your tweet
When they fed you that bad seed
You can't fly away electric bird
Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic
Got to set you free
You were blinded by deceit
You can't fly away electric bird
So now this room's your stage
While you're stuck there in that cage
You can't fly away electric bird
Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magic
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-ba
Ba-ba-bahhh-ah-ah-ah
Well you're art, you fell into this part
You play the victim perfectly holding your beating heart
You used to be so smart
You fluttered round the yard making your magicIt's funny that way, you can get used
To the tears and the pain
What a child will believe
You never loved me
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Seems like yesterday
I lay down next to your boots and I prayed
For your anger to end
Oh Father I have sinned
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you had the power
I never felt so good about myself
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Oh Father you never wanted to live that way
You never wanted to hurt me
Why am I running away
Maybe someday
When I look back I'll be able to say
You didn't mean to be cruel
Somebody hurt you too
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you had the power
I never felt so good about myself
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
And you can't make me cry, you had the power
I never felt so..
You can't hurt me now
I got away from you, I never thought I would
You can't make me cry, you had the power
I never felt so good about myselfWe are born, without a care
As we grow old, become aware
As we grow tall, begin to falter
We want to know ourselves, spread love to all
But we falter, yes, we are human
Yes we anger, we feed the hunger
Yes, we push through, just me and you
We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh, how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh, yes, we stand together
A fantasy for you and me
Though beauty lies in reality
No need to fear, the truth sets us free
We're all looking for love and harmony
But we falter, yes, we are flawed
As we play victim to such conviction
And breathe heavily
Both you and me
We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh, how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh, yes, we stand together
Took it day by day, worried we would fail
How we flailed and we wailed and we screamed in pain
Took it step by step, we could not forget
The wounds we felt, how we screamed for help
And the dark, dark nights when you held me tight
And we'd wait for light to rescue us
Oh, we were distressed, now we're nothing less
We are strong, we are blessed, we are united, yeah
We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh, how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh, yes, we stand together
We made it through the darkness to the light
Oh, how we fought yet still we won the fight
Oh, yes, we stand togetherShe cooks you sweet potato, you don't like aubergine
She knows to boil the kettle when you hum bars from Grease
She senses you are lonely but still she can't be sure
And so she stands and waits, stands anticipating your thoughts
How can she become the psychic
That she longs to be to understand you
How can she become the psychic
That she longs to be to understand you
He brushes thoroughly
He knows she likes fresh breath
He rushes to the station
He waits atop the steps
He's brought with him a Mars bar
She will not buy Nestlé
And later he'll perform
A love-lorn serenade, a trade
How can he become the psychic
That he longs to be to understand you
How can he become the psychic
That he longs to be to understand you
So give her information to help her fill the holes
Give an ounce of power so he does not feel controlled
Help her to acknowledge the pain that you are in
Give to him a glimpse of that beneath your skin
Now my inner dialogue is heaving with detest
I am a martyr and a victim and I need to be caressed
I hate that you negate me, I'm a ghost at beck and call
I'm fading and placating, berate myself for staying
I'm a fool
I'm a fool
He greets the stranger meekly, a thing that she accepts
She sees him waiting often with chocolate on the steps
He senses she is lonely she's glad they finally met
They take each other's hands walk into the sunset
Do you like sweet potato?I can feel it
I can feel it coming
I can feel it
I can feel it coming
Moon, earth and the ocean
I walked a lonely path
Yeah, I was waiting for you
I prayed you would come soon
Our hearts were the lowest they had ever been 
I search the world for your light
I was losing my fight
But I held on for just no one, I held on
I could feel something coming
I struggle not to lose hope
Then wash over me all your love, by your love
Two lonely hearts becoming one
I've been asleep for my whole life
A bad dream, but I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I walked the streets like I had died
Now look at me, I'm finally alive
I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming, I can feel it coming
Now electricity is running through my veins
I feel my love light the room
I was lost without you
But I held on for just no one, I held on
I could feel something coming
I struggle not to lose hope
Then wash over me all your love, by your love
Two lonely hearts becoming one
I've been asleep for my whole life
A bad dream, but I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I walked the streets like I had died
Now look at me, I'm finally alive
But I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I'm awake tonight
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it, I can feel it coming
I can feel it coming, I can feel it coming
Ohh, ohh
I'm awake tonight
Ohh, ohh
I'm awake tonightAngels cry for lost souls
And cupid sighs for all they know
The crystal ball sees only pain
For any man, who comes my way
Oh, I love you with all I got
I love you and that is why
I'm warning you, I'll make you cry
Yeah, I love you with all I got
I love you and that is why
I'm your darkest night
Run for your life
I'll wound you boy
'Cause you're beautiful
Run now if you know what is good for you
I'll hurt your soul
You're too beautiful
Run now, 'cause I'll break you
But I won't mean to
You're just too beautiful, too beautiful
You're just too beautiful
'Cause you're pure, you are gold
Run for your life, not in pursue
The crystal ball sees only pain
For any man, who comes my way
Oh, I love you with all I got
I love you and that is why
I'm warning you, I'll make you cry
Yeah, I love you with all I got
I love you and that is why
I'm your darkest night
Run for your life
Run for your life
I'll wound you boy
'Cause you're beautiful
Run now if you know what is good for you
I'll hurt your soul

You're just too beautiful, too beautiful
Ohh-ohh
You're just too beautiful, too beautiful
You're just too beautiful, too beautiful
You're just too beautifulWithout a sound ever heard
Without a lesson I've learned
You're foolish and deluded
Too many lies have you burned
Where there's ice to be found
The seed lies underground
But even if you had it all you would find
I could never let you stay
Cause you blow it all away
You blow it all away
Blow it all away
If you go
I will stall
Yes, I see it
Yes, I feel it
You have no questions at all
But if love is to be found
I'll strip your bare 'till truth comes out
But even if you had it all
You would find
You blow it all
You blow it all away
Blow it all away
Blow it all, blow it all, blow it all
Blow it all, blow it all, blow it all
Forever is your mind to be naive
Remember it will bring us to our knees
You blow it all away
Cause even if you had it all
You would find
I will blow it all away
I will blow it all away
I will blow it all away
You blow it awayWe like you

Stop cryingIs it me?
Or I'm getting stronger
I was a man that I'll
Never be again
Is it me?
That I'm getting older
I tried so hard to get
Your love again
Is it me?
Or I'm getting stronger
But it's your name that I'll
Never say again
I tried to save
All the love you gave
But all the love you gave
Has disappeared again
 your heart
 your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
 your heart
 your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
And I...
Is it me?
Or you're getting colder
But it's your soul that I
Never saw again
I tried to save
All the love you gave
But all the love you gave
Has disappeared again
 your heart
 your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
 your heart
 your heart woman
I realized your fame was gonna hide your heart
 Never had
 I never had
 Never had your heart
 Never had
 I never had
 Never had your heartHow you been feeling
It's not about marbles, snakes or glue
How you been healing
Now that we cannot win or lose
So how you been keeping
It doesn't matter whose dad's richest now
How you been sleeping
From the top bunks further to fall down
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
What you been doing
Still making the world a better place
Never stopped rueing
Making those tears fall down your face
Making you suffer
Wondering how you got your scars
Lonely in hindsight
I wish I had taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
Taken you in my arms
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on me
You turned that around on meWithout truth we lose
Yet we want to spare the feelings of those we love
Don't cry, we've all lied
But there is always room for forgiveness my friend
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
Shine, you're fine
See, I will always have a smile for you, my love
And still we will
Be ok and along the way we'll learn a thing or two
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me, my sweet
Love, don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong, where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
Oh, don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong, where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong, where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong, where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me
So don't treat me bad, just be glad I am strong
I know where I belong
And soon you will see we are blessed and complete
There's a place here for you with me 
Je savais, à quoi m'en tenir
En plus de ça, à c'qu'il paraît
Le meilleur reste venir
Deux pieds dans le rap game, un œil sur la concu'
J'ai fait tout c'que j'avais à faire, et eux ils ont fait ce qu'ils ont pu
Frère tu racontes n'importe quoi, j'écoute pas c'que tu prédis
J'dois jamais rien à personne, c'est pour ça qu'j'ai jamais crédit
Trop d'gens faux ont dit
"Sianna ça y est faut qu't'avances toute seule"
J'fais genre j'm'en fous
Mais au fond je sais qu'ces gens me portent tous l'œil
Bienvenue chez nous on te passe le salam
Debout jusqu'à c'que l'soleil se lève
Reste pas trop près si tu vois qu'je m'énerve
J'dors tellement peu que j'en oublie mes rêves
Quoi qu'il en soit, j'avance j'les laisse derrière moi
Quoi qu'il en soit, la route est longue les miens croient en moi
Quoi qu'il en soit, chacun ses peines chacun ses histoires
Chacun ses joies, chacun ses victoires
J'reste fière devant mon miroir
Je force pas le destin, je laisse les choses se faire
Je marche avec les miens donc j'suis sûre de n'pas me perdre
Quoi qu'il en soit, j'avance j'les laisse derrière moi
Quoi qu'il en soit, la route est longue les miens croient en moi
J'ai jamais compté sur sonne-per
Jamais mieux servi qu'par soi-même
J'ai commencé par des concerts
Et gros maintenant t'as vu où ça mène
Premier son sur Générations
Deuxième clip en haute qualité
Pourquoi ça parle d'égalisation ?
On sera jamais à égalité
Mes gars kiffent, tes gars skizzent
On fait des choses fantastiques
On veut pas d'vos flows en plastique
Et on veut pas de vos caprices
On va venir tous vous choquer
De quoi vous foutre les chocottes
Le rap tu devrais stopper
T'as jamais sorti un son propre
 
Toujours en tête du peloton
Même avec les main menottées
Le flow carré comme Louis Vuitton
On garde notre froc on est culottés
On est culottés
Flow Bugs Bunny j'viens tout carotter
Tu peux pas monter, tu peux pas noter
Car d'un talent tu n'es pas doté
Ils cherchent tous à nous XXX
Pour une histoire de billets
Les filles partent toutes en vrille
Allez vous faire enquiller
J'veux qu'on son soit reconnu
J'm'en fous moi j'veux pas briller
Je sais qu'à la première venue
Comme l'a dit Mac Tyer vous m'oublierez
Biatch
 Bring night, bring the night on

Let's see how far we can run, yeah
Let's play chase, let's put makeup on our face

We can make a secret place
Meet me at the playground
Come with me, fool around
I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find
You don't wanna grow up
You can be my partner in crime
I don't wanna grow old
Bring me all the toys you can find

Ah-ooh-ah-ah-uh-uhI like a smile with a kink in it
A hand with a drink in it
I like a wall with a chink in it
I wanna believe, but I'm just thinking it
I wanna know what you're waiting for
Gonna make a move or debate it more
He who was saying ?I'm later for?
Don't wait all night cause you're beautiful
The first thing I notice, the frame was in focus
Could see you were hopeless
There's no giving up
No giving up

I like a body with a scar on it
My hands so strong you could drive a car on it
Legs so long I could get lost on them
I pick you up when you hit by them
I like a soul with a glow to it
Okay with pain, we can grow through it
I didn't sink, no, no, I knew it
Someone who gets when you do, when you don't do it
Oh, babe, oh, babe

Why you try to change me all the time?
You, you say I talk too much
I know it drives you nuts
You tell me you wish I was better, better, yeah
You roll your eyes forgetting I am in the room
You're hurting me now, you take me down, and you don't even know it
You think it's a joke but, baby, you don't, you don't even notice
You're hurting me now, you take me down, and you don't even know it

But you were fooling around
Oh, baby, I got a gun in my hand
Oh, maybe, I'll pull the trigger to help you understand

We found things, we had given up upon
Now that you have gone

Now I'm taking your love from above, you're here
And you're never gonna leave me
I will carry you on for so long
Your love is never gonna leave me
You're never gonna leave me
You touched my heart and then gave me yours
I was so afraid, I tried to ignore all the butterflies
Taking me over
We are anything, but unremarkable
We found things, that we have given up on
We found love, oh, yeah
Now that you have gone
I know it won't be long
You will be waiting for me
Faithfully
Baby...

I will carry you on for so long
Your love is never gonna leave meToo many days
I got away
Cameras watching actors acting
Paranoid
Dark evil ocean, I'm craving more
Good intuition left at the shore
Drift with my brother, fishing for more
Dark evil ocean, keep us from shore
Smashing up the pieces
Cleaning up balloons
Coming down, coming down
Smashing up the pieces
Lesser now, lesser now
Cleaning up balloons
Wash off the poisons
Dissect in portions
Smash the fucking head
Core removal works the best
Wash out the poisons
Iceberg abortion
Smash the fucking head
Core removal works the best
Come back, come back to me
Foil as the paper, solids turn to vapor
Common sense, distancing
Toxic level danger, destructive behavior
Family, friends, furthering
Superior Avenue takes me
Magnolia Avenue takes me
Muscles aching, routing lacking
Insert substance sequence
Too many days
I got away
Dark evil ocean, I'm feinding more
I only want what I came for
Good intuition left at the shore
This isn't worth what I paid for
Stop!
Everybody's listening, everybody's listening
Coming down, coming down
Lesser now, lesser now
Smashing! Smashing! Smashing!
Smashing! Smashing! Smashing!
Substance Sequence!I want to change, to rearrange
What is going on
I need to change, I need to play
Like a five year old
I can't detach from the past
And all of the pain
I need to laugh, start from scratch
Begin again
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
So I'm going to eat one hundred sweets
I don't care if I get fat
And I'm going to speak, I won't censor me
I know I can take nothing back
And I'm going to jump I will unburden
I cannot go too deep
I will not run from bad things I've done
They're things I'll try not to repeat
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Welcome to
The church of what's happening now
Head straight through
It costs nothing but change
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
Today is a brand new day
Today, yes today
Today is a brand new day
Throw away yesterday
'cause today is a brand new dayIn the bedroom across the hall
There's a sad girl
A distress signal sent to all
Time to be the hero
It's okay that you want me 
It's okay that you need me 
There is nothing more lonely than skimming the parking lot
By myself
It's that time to fake the love game
Spark a shallow flame uh huh
It's that time to fake the love game
Oh oh oh, oh oh
In the bedroom across the hall
Better not be afraid to get awkward
Better not be afraid to feel backwards
You'll learn that the substance is deeper than skin
Better not be afraid
You said that it's not so
I sat there and festered
Nobody trust nobody
Yeah
It's that time to fake the love game
Spark a shallow flame uh huh
It's that time to fake the love game
Oh oh oh, oh oh
Oh the webs that we weave
Oh the signs we receive
Oh oh oh oh
In the bedroom across the hall 
Distress signal out to all 
And so it goes
I walked her home
Another miss
We both forgot
And so it goes
I walked her home
I'll always let you go
Oh the webs that we weave oh
Oh the webs that we weave ohPlease can you stop the noise, I'm trying to get some rest
From all the unborn chicken voices in my head
What's that?
What's that?
When I am king, you will be first against the wall
With your opinion which is of no consequence at all
What's that?
What's that?
Ambition makes you look pretty ugly
Kicking, squealing Gucci little piggy
You don't remember
You don't remember
Why don't you remember my name?
Off with his head, man
Off with his head, man
Why don't you remember my name?
I guess he does
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
Rain down, rain down
Come on rain down on me
From a great height
From a great height, height
That's it sir
You're leaving
The crackle of pigskin
The dust and the screaming
The yuppies networking
The panic, the vomit
The panic, the vomit
God loves his children
God loves his children, yeah!All smiles, I know what it takes to fool this town
I'll do it 'til the sun goes down and all through the night time
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'll tell you what you wanna hear
Leave my sunglasses on while I shed a tear
It's never the right time, yeah, yeah
I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
I'm unstoppable
I'm a racecar with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm unstoppable until you look the other way
Look the other way, look the other way
Look the other way, until you look the other way
Break down, only alone I will cry out now
You’ll never see what’s hiding out
Hiding out deep down, yeah, yeah
I know, I’ve heard that to let your feelings show
Is the only way to make friendships grow
But I’m too afraid now, yeah, yeah
I put my armor on, show you how strong how I am
I put my armor on, I'll show you that I am
I'm unstoppable
I'm a racecar with no brakes
I'm invincible
Yeah, I win every single game
I'm so powerful
I don't need batteries to play
I'm unstoppable until you look the other way
Look the other way, look the other way
Look the other way, until you look the other way
Pretty isn't perfect, they told me I was worthless
Had to dig deeper with my cleats at the surface
Way more than physical, this is soul-searching
Pain from the pressure to perform equals purpose
No sympathy, nervous energy
Second place, one second don't remember me
I'm not stopping 'til the end
Got the sun on my face and my back is to the wind, yeah
What don't kill you only makes you stronger, yes
The road to glory takes a little longer, yes
What don't kill you only makes you stronger, yes
I got the will to go a little longer
I got the will to go a little longer
I'm unstoppable and I'm invincibleWassup
Qué nuevo ?
Qué Tal ?
Buenos diàs, como estas ?
Inutile de préciser que le flow vient de l'espace
Tu m'connais pas mais tu m'prends pour acquis
Qué esta buscando, todo se passa aqui
J'ai un niveau au dessus mais eux c'est pas ça
Demande à la réal, j'ai la technique du Barça
J'vois rouge comme un taureau, j'ai ma place dans l'arène
Le level est trop haut, y a que dans leurs rêves qu'ils m'atteignent
Là j'descends en Espagne, pourvu qu'il fasse chaud
Mes morceaux, des œuvres d'art comme les tableaux d'Picasso
Sianna dans la casa, ils s'demandent c'est quoi ça
À chaque fois qu'j'écoute leurs sons j'me dis putain c'est quoi ça
Pour emprunter mon flow, il t'faut un chèque de caution
Mais pour 200.000 euros, j'te donnerai pas ma potion
J'écoute même pas vos sons, vous n'avez aucune notion
Chaque fois qu'j'sors un freestyle, j'vous donne une nouvelle leçon
What's up ?
Ils font les fous, seulement quand je suis pas là
Ils sont tous à bout d'souffle quand je lâche des flows de malade
Qui va les graille comme un plat de paëlla ?
Hé, c'est Sianna
En direct d'Alicante, Alicante, Alicante
Je vois toujours les trafiquantés
Uno, dos, tres
Sianna toujours rapide comme un go-fast
J'les fait voyager, avec mes freestyles
Ils ont captés l'concept, y en a plus un qui parle
J'suis avec l'homme 7, ils deviennent tout pâle
Tu peux fouiller dans ma team, tu trouveras aucune poucave
Tous les beats j'les fracasse, tous les beats j'les fracasse
Ils jouent tous les brutes mais j'les graille comme des tapas
Sur tous les sons je m'adapte, tous les sons je m'adapte
Tu veux du flow comme dit Many, on t'sert plus vite que Nadal
J'suis venu pour faire de l'argent mais j'ai une voix en or frère
J'porte que des classics, j'suis une rappeuse hors pair
Cette année j'les envoie en retraite anticipée
Ils disent que l'rap c'est mieux avant mais ils sont à l'antiquité
Ils vont pas m’enquiquiner sinon j'vais les piétiner
Ils sont déjà tous cuits donc pas besoin d'les cuisiner
Ils verront que j'suis au dessus après m'avoir sous-estimée
Vous dites que j'me fait rare mais c'est vous qui m'esquivez
What's up ?
J'les rend locos, j'vis la vida loca
J'vis ma vie à fond, à 210 sur la rocade
J'suis toujours au calme, pourquoi s'affoler
Même en Espagne, t'inquiète, toujours moyen d'se follow
Jouez pas les tauliers, vous n'êtes même pas doués
Vous criez qu'vous êtes dans l'game mais vous savez même pas jouer
Fuck les regrets, j'vis ma vie à fond
J'ai comme l'impression d'les perdre à chaque accélération
Comme le  j'la mets au fond dès la première action
Toujours là pour représenter ma génération
Rapper vite c'est mon domaine, eux ça pose un problème
Ils ont des phases en carton, j'me demande d'où elles proviennent
Joue avec moi, tu vas connaître l'échec
Cette année le rap français va devoir serrer les fesses
J'les roue de coups mais rien qu'ils encaissent
Ils m'suffit d'un couplet pour mettre la concu' en stresse
What's up ?Finding out tension will fade out
Time always wins
Ten lines of Adderall
Kicked back with alcohol
Heartbeat is taking off
Glass table starts to step back
Took the pictures down
That's when the words disconnect from my head
Shit that was said leaves a hole in my rep
My former lover knows this
Next day We'll be fine
Dragging on my knees again
Ten times I try to call
Kicked in with alcohol
Heart feels a little off
Glass objects start to talk back
Took the pictures down
That's when my brain steps away from the scene
Emotions pour out as the smoke's flooding in
But my former lover knows this
She hopes I'll be fine
Dragging on my knees again
Emotions out, smoke flooding in
I try to call ten times again
The chemicals I'm letting in
Remember you, ten lines againLike a glass at the wall, I am so shattered
Stuck in a black hole and nothing matters
And no one can change me, I am a damaged dollar
I cannot get out; where they go, I cannot follow
Why have I, I become paralyzed?
I cannot explain it
Afraid of the light, you're bringing me to life
'Cause you kicked the door in
I'm staring into the sun
You leave me so blinded by love
Then in you run, you drag me out of the dark
I'm staring into the sun
Yes, in you come, you got me trusting in lust
You got me blinded by love
You got me blinded by love
You got me blinded by love
Once a cactus and now I am a blooming flower
See, you coaxed me out and you gave me back my power
And no one can change me, I am a damaged dollar
I cannot get out; where they go, I cannot follow
Why have I, I become paralyzed?
I cannot explain it
Afraid of the light, you're bringing me to life
'Cause you kicked the door in
I'm staring into the sun
You leave me so blinded by love
Then in you run, you drag me out of the dark
I'm staring into the sun
Yes, in you come, you got me trusting in lust
You got me blinded by love
You got me blinded by love
You got me blinded by loveBig girl, little girl, you're a ripcurl
Tearing your way through this huge swirl
I know you're mad, you're on a war path
You know you don’t want to bury no more
Friends
Then we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy
Big girl, it's hell being unwell
You know you're stuck where you fell
Your words give birth like Rosemary
You know you don’t want to bury no more
Friends
Then we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy
Friends
Then we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy
Can't bury more friends
Then we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy
Friends
Then we could be friends
I wish that we were friends
But you can't stop, stop seeing us as the enemy
You know with every cruel word that you utter
That you bury yourself even deeper every day
Oh little girl, theres enough love in this circle
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain
You know with every cruel word that you utter
That you bury yourself even deeper every day
Oh little girl, theres enough love in this circle
You can shackle yourself or be free from this pain
You know with every cruel word that you utter
That you bury yourself even deeper every day
Oh little girl, theres enough love in this circle
You can shackle yourself or be free from this painFeels like we are married and I haven't run away, run away, run away
So many years I've carried you in my arms
Yet I stay, yet I stay, yet I stay
And still I come a-running when I hear the telephone, telephone, telephone
And I ask for absolutely nothing in return, in return, in return
I'm gonna watch you drink it all
I'm gonna watch you fall
You'll find me by your side
If you find me at all
So here it is, an offer
Everything I have to give, have to give, have to give
My love for you allows me not to judge the way you live, way you live, way you live
So just remember that whenever you may feel alone, feel alone, feel alone
Yeah, I am here, there's nothing to fear
I will be your home, be your home, be your home
I'm gonna watch you drink it all
I'm gonna watch you fall
You'll find me by your side
If you find me at all
I'm gonna watch you drink it all
I'm gonna watch you fall
You'll find me by your side
If you find me at all
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum dum dum, dum
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum dum dum, dum
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum

Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum dum dum, dum

I'm gonna watch you fall
You'll find me by your side
If you find me at all

I'm gonna watch you fall
You'll find me by your side
If you find me at all
Dum dum dum, dum dum dum
Dum dum dum dum dum, dumI'm sitting in the car again
Waiting for you
You said you'd be a minute
But you've been twenty two
See you've got to do your hair
And get it just right
Sometimes you're in the bathroom
For half of the night
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
Now I'm sitting by the phone again
Waiting for your call
You'd said you'd phone at two
And it's a quarter past four
Now I'm standing out the front again
It's late at night
And I'm truly sick to death of sleazy men
Undressing me with their eyes
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
And I'm waiting for you again
Yes I'm waiting for you
And I'm waiting for you again
Tell me what can I do
So I'm back from the theater
I watched the show alone
See I waited for you and I missed half act one
Have you never heard of the phone?
I don't like being taken for granted
I'm too nice for my own good
See I do what I say and I say what I do
Is it too much to expect that you could?
I wish you would
]
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
It's the usual coup
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't missing nothing for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
I ain't waiting for you
I ain't waiting for you no more
Go find another fool
I ain't waiting, I ain't waiting
I ain't waiting, I ain't waiting
I ain't waiting, I ain't waiting
I ain't waiting no more, yeahPrecious child, running wild
Singing songs for your sick flowers
Meek and mild, overtired
Wind away the hours
On your own
You're alone
Now
Little gun, silent sound
Soldier in his tower
Raging down, you have won
You have all the power
On your own
You're alone
NowI'm a broken biscuit
From the cookie jar
I'm a total misfit
In the puzzle that's so far
Careful not to crush me
In those hungry hands
Careful not to rush me
Into this fine romance
I stand under the weight of your words
Hoping you won't find me
I'm terrified of everything I've heard
Don't swallow
I'm a damaged dollar
That no one wants to change
I'm a bunch of flowers
That need to be arranged
Careful what you wish for
Careful what you say
I've lowered all my armor
Risking the pain again
I stand under the weight of your words
Hoping you won't find me
I'm terrified of everything I've heard
Don't swallow
I'm standing on the edge of your words
That is where you'll find me
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt
But I'm coming
I stand under the weight of your words
Hoping you won't find me
I'm terrified of everything I've heard
Don't swallow
I'm standing on the edge of your words
Standing on the edge of your words
I'm paralyzed by all the things that hurt
But I'm comingIn sorrow
We will come
Refusal
Delusion
Ressurecting souls to breathe
In the form of memories
We can't bring them back
We can't bring the dead back
When searching for the unknown
Do you often feel alone?
Journey folds
We are warm
Senses cold
We're all torn
Say you want their soul to breathe
What is it a soul weighs?
What is it your soul weighs?
When searching for the unknown
Do you often feel alone?
Live it like a funeral
Disown it all
Live it like a funeral
No home
Knowing, honestly it's all we want
So long, our integrity is gone
When searching for the unknown
Do you often feel alone?
Live it like a funeral
Disown it all
Live it like a funeral
No home
Are you searching out a ghost?
Do you find yourself alone?
What's the weight of all our souls?
Holding, holdHello, sweet grief
I know you'll be the death of me
You're like the morning after ecstasy
I am drowning in an endless sea
Hello, old friend
Here's the misery that knows no end
So I'm doing everything I can
To make sure I never love again
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
But if I was stronger
I would love you longer
I wouldn't let you fall
You wouldn't tear it apart
I wish I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If that was unbreakable
I wish I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If that was unbreakable
I wish I had a diamond heart
Goodbye, so long
I don't know if this is right or wrong
Am I giving up where I belong
'Cause every station's playing our song
Goodbye my love
You were everything my dreams are made of
You'll be prince and I'm the crying dove
If I only were unbreakable
I wish that I did not know
Where all broken lovers go
I wish that my heart was made of stone
But if I was stronger
I would love you longer
I wouldn't let you fall
You wouldn't tear it apart
I wish I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If that was unbreakable
I wish I had a diamond heart
Oh oh
I'd give you all my love
If that was unbreakable
I wish I had a diamond heartBreak the last of my heart while we fight
And leave the past behind
I'm trying to get through
All the things we screwed
I don't mind, save your lies, burn them down
What we need is time
And more than me and you
Saying, "Yes, it's true"
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
Make it fast, realize all this crap
Is six feet underground
I have to say I knew
But what is wrong with you?
Such a blast in our lives, turned to dust
What's this all about?
There's something left to do
Now it's up to you!
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
Now we know where we belong
All that we can leave behindI won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me 
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heartShe's half fish and he's a boy
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
She came from the Moon ready to fight
With scales and a tail and a fishy bite
Ready to destroy all of humankind
Fierce and fighting with a brook trout mind
He was born in an airship above the earth
Strong in legend, my soul's in mirth
Son of a mime and a pig farmer
With just a smile for a sweet 
They were never meant to meet 
They were never meant to be 
They were never meant to see 
They were never 
She's half fish, and he's a boy
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to catch you in my net
Now I am awake always
Like the day when I found it
And then one solstice at a fishing hole
He was unsure, cast in his bowl
She swam right up to him and took the bait
He reeled her in and made it a date
When your worlds are worn, you look inside
Fight the power, stop the divide
Four eyes, two gills, one human nose
Wrap your arms around me in the river floes
We're half clothed in island love
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to take a swim in Lake Moon
Now I am awake always
Since I dove into your blue
Moonquake, moonquake
I want to catch you in my net
Now I am awake always
Like the day when I found it
Moonquake, Moonquake, Moonquake
Na na na na na na na
Moonquake, Moonquake, Moonquake
Na na na na na na na
Moonquake, Moonquake, Moonquake
Na na na na na na naWhen it starts
You and I are calmly drinking
Gasoline
Until one of us sneezes on the
Candle
Kindling our lust for violent words
We start killing
Jump in the Earth
Saying shit that doesn't need to be heard of, acid tone
Acts of the past
Are they worth getting off my chest to feel free while she burns?
He won't ever let her go
She won't ever want to go
I am the leech I want removed
I am the leech I once removed
Fighting in the bedroom
I am the leech I want removed
Aggravate a tantrum
I am the leech I can't remove
Secret Crime:
Leave it off the record
For you, for me, for us
This would cut all ties;
Leave it off the record
Off the record!
Apparition truth-crustacean
Hostile in the wrong conditions
Talking once was mass elation
Now aggressive desperation
True feelings failing to show
Secrets pending, keeping you close
Is this worth getting off my chest?
Is this worth getting off my chest?
Is this worth crushing our souls?
Is this worth getting off my chest?
Is this worth getting off my chest?
Is this worth asking, "What's this worth?"
Is this worth getting off my chest?
I am the leech, I am the leech!
Operation desperation
Living in the wrong conditions
Have you tasted the gasoline?
I am the leech! Oh so, your wounds they show
I know you have never felt so alone
But hold on, head up, be strong
Oh hold on, hold on until you hear them come
Here they come, oh
Take an angel by the wings
Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh-oh-oh-oh-oh
Oh
You can, you can do anything, anything
You can do anything

Look up, call to the sky
Oh, look up and don't ask why, oh

Beg her now for anything
Beg her now for one more day
Take an angel by the wings
Time to tell her everything
Ask her for the strength to stay

I'm going round the block
No, I can't cross the road
I'm not allowed to do that
I'm so happy here 'cause
I'm just riding on my bike
I'm going round the block
I'm checking out the dogs
Barking as I pass them, "Woof"
Barking back, I laugh and
I ride on on my bike
I'm going round the block
I'm singing to myself, "La la la"
I'm counting purple flowers
And I'll do this for hours
Happy riding on my bike
I'm going round the block
I'm like an ice cream truck
I'm tasting all the flavors
I'm waving to my neighbors, "Hi"
While I'm riding on my bike
I'm going round the block
I'm counting all the cracks, "Six, seven, eight"
Yeah, I'm the pavement agent
And my house is the station
And I ride past on my bike
I'm going round the block
My tummy's rumbling
My mama's selling tickets
To broccoli and fish sticks, I'm hungryThe moment of creation
‘Though it’s great, it is already fading
And you expect that I’ll be patient but
How can I wait?
No, I can’t wait
You tear apart the gap between what’s “nice”
And what is “amazing”
And maybe if I pay attention
Face my fears & expectations
My head won’t threaten my intentions
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
No, I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
No, I can’t wait
Dazed and tempted
Round & round had a million chances
For so long
On my own
This thought is now
At the top of my mind 
At the top of my mind 
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
I can’t wait
No, I can’t wait
I can’t wait  
I can’t wait  
I can’t wait
No, I can’t wait
I can’t wait  
I can’t wait  
I can’t wait
No, I can’t wait
No, I can’t waitAgainst the will of the unborn
Let them soak around the book
This time
Without the truth allegiance is sworn
Let him soak around the song
This time
They'll propagate with their mind control
Cultivating our brain to mold
Will somebody fix this
Will somebody fix this
They'll propagate with their mind control
Cultivating our right to ?
Will somebody fix this
Will somebody fix this
Freedom for all, except for the lepers
Let them choke around the fun?
This time
Stealing our thoughts
Ignoring reason
They will crawl across the web of lies
And it's alright to lose some
"They hate the truth" said the Holy Ghost?
Nobody's learning to live right
Nobody's learning at all
And it's alright to lose some
"Eradicate" said the cross again
Nobody's learning to live right
It's all acting, we know
They'll propagate with their mind control
Cultivating our right to ?
Will somebody fix this
Will somebody fix this
They'll propagate with their mind control
Cultivating our our right ?

Say to the winter?
The light shining bright
We're gonna burn out the sun
We're gonna drown in our blood
We're gonna live in a story
We're gonna burn out the sun
We're gonna drown in our blood
We're gonna die in a story
Paralyzed
ParalyzedTensions are building inside of the vacant warehouse
Idealism is changing and what's important's really not
Fuck what I'm saying the masses are busy getting off
Go, reveal yourself to me
I can read everything you say. We're all on display
Bold statement with photographs. Thousands of eyes can trace
Words aiding the pictograph. Written on walls in space
 Who killed the culprit?  Who shot him down?
I felt everything around me move
I felt everything around me move
The time it took to get away
Tensions are building inside of the vacant warehouse
Idealism is changing and what's important's really not
Fuck what what I'm saying the masses are busy getting off
Damaged ego, broken stitches, nothing gold can stay

Hashtags to search what you care about
Filter: everything just looks so boring without
Posting your diet like we want to see
Outfits can show just what we care about
Makeup: everyone just looks so boring without
Posting you party to prove that you're fun
What you show: do we all care about it?
Image: we only show what we want you to see
I'm just as guilty as wanting to change such plain reality
It's not what you will see
Interactions will cease
If in person we speak
Candor is obsolete
Tensions are building inside of the vacant warehouse
Tensions are building inside of the vacant warehouse!Scars of winter
And my doubts
On this Saturday morning
Well, I don't need them
But somehow
I end up caught in the warnings
Oh, there's a thunderstorm
Knocking at my door
How can you look into
My eyes
And tell me nothing else
Than lies
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
To run away and hide
Who wants to say goodbye?
And now it's easier
It's always easier
To hold your head up high
Than open up your heart
Knives of water
From my eyes
Now I'm feeling so lonely
While I'm drowning
With the tide
I still remember those warnings
Oh, there's a thunderstorm
Knocking at my door
How can you look into
My eyes
And tell me nothing else
Than lies
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
To run away and hide
Who wants to say goodbye?
And now it's easier
It's always easier
To hold your head up high
Than open up your heart
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
And now it's easier
To run away and hide
Who wants to say goodbye?
And now it's easier
It's always easier
To hold your head up high
Than open up your heart
And now it's easierWow, it’s like a breath of fresh air

Rien à foutre du club, club, j'arrive en mode zbeul, zbeul
Je sens que tu as peur, je t'en voudrai pas si tu pleures
Mais n'essaye pas de me prendre par les sentiments, non je vais te casser le cœur
Négro, ta soirée risque d'être compliquée 
Jette un œil à tes couilles, je crois qu'elles t'ont quitté 
Dawala Diakite
A misé sur moi, donc je me dois d'écraser tous ces faux talents pré-fabriqués
Pas de star-système, viens seulement nous voir sur scène
Tu vas saigner du zen, si tu tises tout mon flow cul-sec
Est-ce que tu peux te pousser s'te plaît ? Je vais pas faire dans la douceur
T'étais dans ta poussette quand je kickais fort le soir tout seul
Courrez si vous voulez sauver votre peau
Fuyez comme El Chapo
W brodé sur le drapeau
Cours, cours comme Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt
Usain Bolt, Usain Bolt, dès le départ j'ai déjà gagné la course

AAAAAAH !!!! Dès le départ j'ai déjà gagné la course 
J'peux les faire flopper juste en ouvrant la bouche 
Toujours de l'avance mais j'arrive en retard
D'ici quelques années venez on en reparle, quand j'aurai fait mes preuves, ils auront tous la frousse
Mamène, je veux le million 
Donc je passe toute ma vie dans le studio 
Reste à ta place sinon tu vas la perdre, en vrai j'crois tu n'en vaudra même pas la peine
Rien que tu fais le mec de rue mais tu nous baratines
Commence à courir où tu vas canner
T'étais déter' un peu comme un camé mais après ce morceau tu vas vite te calmer
Si t'as pas Mohand où bien numéro 7, ta carrière finira forcément aux chiottes
J'représente le six un peu comme mon gars Drake, quand tu m'vois dans la rue, dis moi Sianna what's up ?

It's where it all began
In your music plans
You got up to dance
The way you move, got me lookin’ at my shoes
Forever etched in my heart
What will you do if you should fall in love
If you should fall in love
Please say my name if you fall
See, I was hopin' you would fall in love
'Cause I’m falling in love with you
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Tell me, do you feel this way?
Tell me, is your heart in flames?
Tell me, do you feel this way?
'Cause when we're over the sea, a tsunami, a tsunami
'Cause we're over the sea when you look at me, when you look at me
No way that we can't believe
'Cause see, I can barely breathe
Oh, I can't get enough of you
Oh, baby, tsunami
Run-D.M.C. Whitney and Jay z
That’s where it all began
And where hits would clash
You got up to dance
The way you move got me lookin’ at my shoes
Forever etched in my heart
What will I do if I can't get enough, if I can’t get enough?
Please say my name if you need me, whoa
See how I open u, I will be enough
'Cause baby, you are the sun to me
Tell me, do you feel the same?
Tell me, do you feel this way?
Tell me, is your heart in flames?
Tell me, do you feel this way?
'Cause when we're over the sea, a tsunami, a tsunami
’Cause we're over the sea when you look at me, when you look at me
No way that we can't believe
'Cause see, I can barely breathe
But I can't get enough of you

TsunamiBonjour mon Afrique, j'n'ai pas eu l'temps de te connaître
Mais j'reviens très vite et ça j'peux t'le promettre
Une dame est venue m'chercher, elle vient de France
Elle est belle, jeune, blanche et tout va bien s'passer, je pense
Elle fait preuve d'amour dès son premier regard
Si ça s'passe mal, dans quelques années j'repars
Dans tous les cas, ils seront que j'viens d'ici
Car c'est inscrit sur ma peau, j'ai l'Afrique comme édifice
C'est l'début d'l'histoire de ma vie
A seulement 8 mois je quitte Bamako, ma ville
Je sais pas c'qui m'attend, je sais pas où je vais, mais
C'est Dieu qui l'a choisi, donc forcément ça promet
On verra comment j'grandis, on verra comment j'm'adapte
J'étais loin d'imaginer qu'à peine debout on m'adopte
J'te dis au revoir, bien plus vite que prévu
Et sans l'savoir la séparation est très dure
J'rencontre ma famille, j'apprend à les connaître
Pour certains j'suis pas la bienvenue mais j'ai l'sourire aux lèvres
Mes parents m'aiment et c'est tout ce qui m'importe
Je sais qu'si j'ai un coup d mou, ils viendront me prêter main forte
J'suis plutôt heureuse  donc je souris souvent
J'résume le début d'ma vie, j'te dis ce dont j'me souviens
Et même si au fond je sais
Qu'on choisit pas nos vies
Comment oublier d'où je viens ?
Vous êtes l'encre de mon livre
On y a écrit les plus belles lignes
Sans vous je n'serai rien
Dans mon coeur orphelin
Les années passent et j'ai vraiment pas à me plaindre nan
Je suis bien chez moi car je reçois de l'amour à plein temps
Mais malgré tout personne sait ce que je ressens
Quand je me dis qu'à 20 ans je sais toujours pas à qui je ressemble
Mais c'est pas grave car j'me sens bien dans ma peau
J'ai trouvé des gens comme moi et on rame dans le même bateau
J'découvre la musique sur le tard direct je suis en osmose
Mon histoire ressemble étrangement à l'enfant seul de Oxmo
J'fais mon chemin, tout doucement mais sûrement
J'ai des principes, mes amis peuvent compter sur moi
Mes parents m'ont inculqué tollérence, amour et respect
Aujourd'hui si je dois partir y a que pour eux que je restererai
Et puis bien souvent j'espère être assez reconnaissante
Si le bonheur se définissait je prendrais ma vie comme exemple
J'estime avoir de la chance
Qu'est ce que je serai devenue si j'avais pas connu la France ?
Mais Dieu la voulu ainsi donc ainsi va la vie
J'applique les choses comme je les ai apprises
Et selon mes envies
Ils disent que j'ai une bonne étoiles, moi je préfère dire que je suis bénie
Tout comme le début de mon histoire, je reste fidèle au pays
Et même si au fond je sais
Qu'on choisit pas nos vies
Comment oublier d'où je viens ?
Vous êtes l'encre de mon livre
On y a écrit les plus belles lignes
Sans vous je n'serai rien
Dans mon coeur orphelin
Et même si au fond je sais
Qu'on choisit pas nos vies
Comment oublier d'où je viens ?
Vous êtes l'encre de mon livre
On y a écrit les plus belles lignes
Sans vous je n'serai rien
Dans mon coeur orphelinScratching my back
Scream while looking at me
Locking eyes, flash decision
Turning on the lights to see you
Sweating, always glowing
Are you loving the flesh reaction
Forming the state we're both in
I've already become the root for you and me
To hold the mattress down
Growing around all of the sheets I fold to be
Holding the bedroom down
Fed with perspiration
The sheets are now forming a nest for you and me
Holding our bodies sound
Our limbs are now shaping the way they're meant to be
Growing our branches out
Blossoming arousal
Have you been watching as we're bending in the mirror?
Does all the pleasure cause the pain to disappear?
Does it matter if we love?
We have formed our own compound
Have you been watching as we're bending in the mirror?
Does all the pleasure cause the pain to disappear?
Does it matter if we love?
Breathe me whole, breathe me whole
The sheets are now forming a nest for you and me
Holding our bodies sound
Our limbs are now shaping the way they're meant to be
Growing our branches out
I know how you're so adamant on making sound
I know that you're so adamant on being found
Blossoming arousal
Have you been watching as we're bending in the mirror?
Does all the pleasure cause the pain to disappear?
Does it matter if we love?
We have formed our own compound
Have you been watching as we're bending in the mirror?
Does all the pleasure cause the pain to disappear?
Does it matter if we love?
Breathe me whole, breathe me whole
Shifting the tide
Kicking the sofa
You know baby I can't say no
With you in my sight
I'm setting the tempo
God damn I can't say no
We both want to give ourselves tonight
We have formed the perfect shape tonight
We have rooted up this place tonightSia! N.I.C.K., Nicky Jam!
The Spanglish version!
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
Porque tengo ganas de bailar
No tengo un peso en el bolsillo pero no me importa
A mí no me hace falta na' 
Con tu cuerpo
Y la música me envuelvo
Siento que quemo por dentro
Dirán, que soy loco pero qué va!
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
Come on, come on, turn the radio on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Gotta paint my nails, put my high heels on
It's Saturday and I won't be long
Til I hit the dance floor
Hit the dance floor
I got all I need
No I ain't got cash
No I ain't got cash
But I got you baby
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
I don't need no money
As long as I keep dancing
I don't need no money
Lo que quiero eres tú
Una noche de rumba
La pista retumba
Esa es la actitud
Yo se lo que quieres, tu lo que quieres es bailar
Mami vámonos que la noche no va a parar, eh!
Veo una lluvia de mujeres, colombiana dominacana y boricua
Cual eres tú?
Te voy a hablar con sinceridad, busco tu sensualidad
So girl what you gonna do?
Veo una lluvia de mujeres, colombiana dominacana y boricua

Oh, oh
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
Baby I don't need dollar bills to have fun tonight
I don't need no money
As long as I can feel the beat
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, la, la
La, la, la, la, laBeen a long time, clean washed sheets
And I don't wanna wait no more, for you to touch me
Up, count 'em up, ten to one
So many others linin' up
Nobody's every done this to me
Your body's like a stranger to me
Our last lie, I should've known
But it all looked good on paper
We never allign, took too much space
It's been a lo-o-ng time
So why don't you, show, me something
I don't need much just something
I can't be me, no, no, no
Check my references
It must be you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't reach out for me
I can't be me, no, no, no
I got references
It must be you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why do you let me sleep through the night?
Built from different frames, I was made for higher speeds
And you were slow, hopin' you could change
Switch or step your games up
I often think about all the other lovers that I used to know
And where we were
Dug deep and we'd come back up
Forever lonely when we needed
But when it's you I end up alone
I guess it's on you, show me that you really want me
I've been tryna play my role, probably could've run around
Don't know where I ever found faith
I was hopin' you would take control and hold me down
But I don't know how long I can wait
So why don't you, show, me something
I don't need much just something
I can't be me, no, no, no
Check my references
It must be you, yeah, yeah, yeah
You don't reach out for me
I can't be me, no, no, no
I got references
It must be you, yeah, yeah, yeah
Why do you let me sleep through the night?Clear this up: you're a gem for all to see
But when you open up your mouth, we all wish you'd stop breathing
Intriguing one synching to me
Get off!
Intriguing one, all this talk's no fun
A verbal operation, dramatic conversation holding me down
Other guys, they're always crawling at your feet
I might be putting up with you, cause I like being put onto you, And when you're put back onto me, I bend you like you love to be
Intriguing one, all this talk's no fun
A verbal operation, dramatic conversation holding me down
Talk: you're the melody that I cannot seem to mute
 When you're hanging on my torso
 I could never
 let you go
 But your talking
 gets me thinking
 I should really
 let you go
Righteous when your lips are parting - Save me, save me
Gone before you've finished talking - Save me. Save me now!
There's no need to be free
There's no need to be vulnerable
There's no need to be free
Righteous when your lips are parting - Save me, save me
Gone before you've finished talking - Save me. Save me now!
There's no need to be free
There's no need to be vulnerable
There's no need to be free
Your tongue ties me down. Keeps me onto you
Intriguing one, all this talk's no fun. 
A verbal operation, dramatic conversation holding me down
Intriguing one, all this talk's no fun
A verbal operation, dramatic conversation holding me down
Clear this up: you're a gem for all to see...I am standing on the corner, I am watching traffic lights
I am sinking into concrete, I am watching two girls fight
I'm attempting to move forward but my legs are made of lead
The words you planted on me just keep running through my head
Been pushing on the button that will make the traffic stop
It's hard to be distracted when you know it's all you've got
I barely bat an eye as I watch you cross the line
It's hard to be affected when you're dead inside
You and I
You and I
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
I live here on the corner, I am sucking in the fumes
These appear to my choices and they cannot be improved
I'm all over the corner, all the pieces of my parts
It's time to mend the pieces of my broken heart
You and I
You and I
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over you
What will I do? I cannot move
You are taking all that I knew
Here I will stay, stuck in this place
Trying to get over youOh, sitting on the beach
The storm rose through the hills to find you
Time slows when you're with me
Don't carry this you'll never hold
Don't bury it inside yourself
Oh, standing next to me
But I don't have the means to find you
In time I might forget you
Wish that I could choose
Don't carry this you'll never hold
Don't bury it inside yourself
Don't pin me to the bedroom wall
Don't leave me at the burial
Burial
Burial
Burial
Burial
I'm not gonna take the call
Force myself to throw it all away
Don't carry this you'll never hold
Don't bury it inside yourself
I'm not about to make you stay
I'm not about to run
I'm not about to run
I'm not about to runHealing is difficult
Often results are psychosomatic
I admit to enjoying drugs
They get rid of tension, boredom and static
Hate those adverse side-effects
Forcing the people who love me to scatter
Excuse me for being such a hypocrite
The way I see it really doesn't matter
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
To tell you the truth
I can't believe I love you so much
So much in fact that I don't know whether to weep or wind my watch
I have a sick sense of humour
It amazes me how points it scores
I'm addicted to vice
My best friends are pushers, my boyfriends are whores
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely
Simple to see why I breathe
No one bothers me completely
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Waking up next to you
Your morning breath reminds me of Lucy
The flies in the front room
Buzz round my head and try to seduce me
If I contract illness
The last thing I want is to pass it to others
Fucking leaves guilt pangs
When I start forgetting the names of my lovers
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Why do you cock your head to the side when you look at me?
Why are my skills in bed more important than sanity?
Is it sad that my uncle told me that
He said, "treat people how you want to be treated"
See your character coming near you, tsk
Treat people how you want to be treated
And ain't  scary being judged?
Yeah, I do
You'll get the hang of it
I think I'll be judged by myself
So I just think I'll be judged by myself always
Treat people how you want to be treated
Treat people how you want to be treatedThe sun'll come out tomorrow
Bet your bottom dollar that tomorrow
There'll be sun
Just thinkin' about tomorrow
Clears away the cobwebs and the sorrow
Till there's none
When I'm stuck with a day that's grey and lonely
I just stick up my chin and grin and say
The sun'll come out tomorrow
So you got to hang on till tomorrow
Come what may
Tomorrow, tomorrow, I love ya, tomorrow
You're always a day away
Tomorrow, tomorrow I love you tomorrow
You're only a day awayمنو ببخش که حرمت اون همه خاطره شکست
...یه زندگی به گل نشست
منو ببخش که حرمت اون همه خاطره شکست
منو ببخش که قایق یه زندگی به گل نشست
منو ببخش که بودی و این همه سال ندیدمت
تنهایی گریه کردی و حتی یه بار نشنیدمت
زیباترین خاطره، پاییز پشت پنجره
خواستم بدونی این روزا حال من از تو بدتره
صداقت ترانه‌مه، بغضی که توی حنجره‌ست
این روزا کار و زندگیم فقط مرور خاطره‌ست
نمی‌دونم برای چی صبوری می‌کردی همه ش
غفلت بی‌رحم منو ساده نگیر، امّا ببخش
ساده نگیر، امّا ببخش
منو ببخش که حرمت اون همه خاطره شکست
منو ببخش که قایق یه زندگی به گل نشست
منو ببخش که بودی و این همه سال ندیدمت
تنهایی گریه کردی و حتی یه بار نشنیدمت
زیباترین خاطره، پاییز پشت پنجره
خواستم بدونی این روزا حال من از تو بدتره
صداقت ترانه‌مه، بغضی که توی حنجره‌ست
این روزا کار و زندگیم فقط مرور خاطره‌ست
نمی‌دونم برای چی صبوری می‌کردی همه ش
غفلت بی‌رحم منو ساده نگیر، امّا ببخش
ساده نگیر، امّا ببخشWoke up this morning feeling super human
Restored my faith
Woke up from my illusion
It’s time to leave the agony that made me
I won’t cover it
Getting over it
I’m done
Feeling weak
Telling lies
Playing tricks
I’m done
Feeling weak
Bumping lines
Feeling sick
I’ll tell you with an open mind
I wanna go where I’ve never gone
Cause I’m running out of time
I wanna go where I’ve never gone
Cause I believe oh I believe
It can’t be different took time for me to see
I’ll tell you with an open mind
For you there to read
I spent so many hours
Spent so many night
Trying to fix myself
Trying to do what’s right
I’m done beating myself up over things in the past
I won’t cover it
Getting over it
I’m done
Feeling weak
Telling lies
Playing tricks
I’m done
Every week
Bumping lines
Feeling sick
I’ll tell you with an open mind
I wanna go where I’ve never gone
Cause I’m running out of time
I wanna go where I’ve never gone
Cause I believe oh I believe
It can’t be different took time for me to se
I’ll tell you with an open mind
For you there to read
Don’t tell me who I ought to be
Cuz that’s entirely up to me
No compass but
I’m self-centered by the pain
I’m super human
And I’m not hating on myself again
No more changing up the way I am
No compass but
I’m self-centered by the pain
I’m super humanI'm ready for you, I'm ready for life
I trust that I will be alright
I'm ready for us, I'm ready tonight
Catch me, I'm your butterfly
The feeling is right
No, it can't be wrong
It's what I've been searching for
I think you're the one, I think you're the one
The one that I've been dreaming of
You take my breath away
You got me feeling fade
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
In your embrace I close my eyes
Our love it feels divine
I feel the heat of his skin on mine
You and I are one tonight
You take my breath away
You got me feeling fade
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me in light

I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, touch me tonight
I can't feel my all
I feel so high, touch me in light
I feel so damn light headed
I feel so high, I feel so damn light headed
So damn light headedBy the window
Since time began
Watch the wind blow
Sculpting sand
All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling
Building castles
Tear them down
Mr. Prince has lost her crown
All in letters bound in string
Time is slowly unraveling
She sells
Empty sea shells
Lost in the ocean
Through the window
We can see
Sand and biscuits
Cups of tea
All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling
All in letters bound in string
Life is slowly unraveling
She sells
Empty sea shells
She sells
Empty sea shellsI'm in here
Can anybody see me?
Can anybody help?
I'm in here
A prisoner of history
Can anybody help?
Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Live withinside of me
I'm in here
I'm trying to tell you something
Can anybody help?
I'm in here
I'm calling out but you can't hear
Can anybody help?
Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Live withinside of me
I'm crying out, I'm breaking down
I am fearing it all
Stuck inside these walls
Tell me there is hope for me
Is anybody out there listening?
Can't you hear my call?
Are you coming to get me now?
I've been waiting for
You to come rescue me
I need you to hold
All of the sadness I can not
Live withinside of me
I'm in here
I'm in here
Can anybody see me?
Can anybody help?You're soul is the fuel to my insanity
There's no one who can do what you do to me
'Cause you'll be by my side when they turn of the lights
And a thousand eyes close and call it a night
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
When the winds bring me along
From the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
Straight from the city that never sleeps
Surrounded by filth and scum moving at my feet
Vibrations from underneath, underneath
Hands behind my back, my back
Facedown, my eyes are open, I'm choking, yeah
I spent my whole life running
I spent my whole life running from something 
But I trust the concrete
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
When the winds bring me along
From the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
They say it's safe to fall
If you just trust the ground that you stand on
So get back up, against them all
Don't forget where you came from
Don't forget where you came from
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
Our lives burn bright
Before your eyes
When the winds bring me along
From the place that I call home
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yours
When the lights begin to fade
You will always keep me awake
I want you to know, wherever I go
I'll be forever yoursI'm scared again, with an ode to you
Dear love
I miss you
You were right, you knew
Dear love
I was scared, I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through
Draw me a smile and save me tonight
I am a blank page waiting for you to bring me to life
Paint me a heart, let me be your art
I am a blank page waiting for life to start
Let our hearts stop and then beat as one together
I'll go on, tell you I was wrong, dear love
Start again, find a new sketch, dear love
I was scared, I was unprepared
Oh, for the things you said
If I could undo that I hurt you
I would do anything for us to make it through

I won't ask mom or dad
'Cause I can find this car all by myself
I'll use my eyes, I won't ask those guys
I look around like I'm the FBI
I know that I can do this
It's got to be where I last put it down
This living room is one small town
I'm getting warmer

I'm getting near it, here I've got a hunch
And it's time for lunch...

We're making the most of the nightJ'pense à la quitter depuis 2010
Mais impossible tant qu'j'ai pas vendu plus d'cent mille disques
Parfois j'y croyais plus, j'me suis dit "si j'avais su..."
Commencer cette relation, j'aurai p't-être jamais dû
J'rêve de peu d'choses étant donné qu'j'dors très peu
Ma vie est simple, et ça se ressent dans mes textes
J'mets l'feu, aux problèmes, peu importe d'où ils proviennent
Moi j'vis ma vie, et j'fais en sorte qu'elle m'convienne
Mon cerveau est en veille, là c'est mon cœur qui parle
J'veux qu'tu sois simple auditeur, y'a qu'les fleurs qui fanent
On joue pas dans la même cour
Moi quand j'suis dans la merde j'cours
On s'est rencontrées par hasard, et ouais c'est l'mektoub
Le début d'une longue histoire
J'vis au jour le jour, sauf que j'vis l'soir
Et j'suis toujours la même, et c'est toujours pareil
J't'ai déjà dit, dans c'game j'veux devenir la reine
 
Les obstacles j'essaye de les surmonter
J'oublie pas ceux qui m'ont tiré vers le haut
J'ai encore plein de choses à vous montrer
Mon amour voit l'jour seulement en studio
Y'a trop d'choses que j'essaye d'oublier
Dans ma vie je laisse personne tout piller
Les joies, les peines, t'inquiète tout y est
Mais j'reste quand même, oui je reste quand même
Je reste quand même, oui je reste quand même
Souvent j'hésite, à bouger en Amérique
Et puis j'me dis que t'façon Dieu m'donnera la vie que j'mérite
Donc j'fais c'que j'ai à faire toujours loin des plans foireux
Insatisfaite j'me dis qu'j'pourrais faire cent fois mieux
Et j'fais ma musique, en répandant d'la bonne humeur
Tu veux un tube ? Bouge pas, j'suis là dans une heure
Et j'suis toujours la même, avec mes res-frè
On est au calme, posés, laisse place au refrain
Les obstacles j'essaye de les surmonter
J'ai encore plein de choses à vous montrer
Les obstacles j'essaye de les surmonter
J'ai encore plein de choses à vous montrer
Mon amour voit l'jour seulement en studioSometimes when this place gets kind of empty
Sound of their breath fades with the light
I think about the loveless fascination
Under the milky way tonight
Lower the curtain down in Memphis
Lower the curtain down all right
I got no time for private consultation
Under the milky way tonight
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
And it's something quite peculiar
Something that shimmering and white
Leads you here despite your destination
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
I wish I knew what you were looking for
I might have known what you would find
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight
Under the milky way tonight x2
Unde e ea, unde e ea, unde e ea, unde e ea..
Am paradisu' meu
Doar cu ea, doar cu ea, doar cu ea, doar cu ea..
Impart si bine si rau
Pentru ea, as muta muntii din loc
Pentru ea as opri timpu' pe loc, as scoate piatra din foc
As face tot fara regrete
Nu ma joc, in joc sunt sentimente
N-avem secrete, ca astea dor
Dar visam impreuna la viitor
Cand stam intinsi.. pe covor plutim usor, plutim usor, plutim usor
Si stiu ca nu-ti plac golanii, ca nu conteza banii
Stiu ca nu sunt tocmai genul' pe care sa-l prezinti lu' mami
Stiu ca plec prea des si nu ma-ntorc prea des
Dar toate au un sens cand tu le dai un sens
Ai inteles de la inceput
Nu am ales s-am un trecut
Bineinteles, nu sunt un sfant
Invat din mers, nu-s vorbe-n vant, nu-s vorbe-n vant
 x2
Unde-i ea... e chiar acolo unde-i e locu'
Chiar nu mi se-ntampla des sa-mi zambeasca norocu'
Iar locu' ei, stie si ea, e numai la pieptu' meu'
Indiferent ca ne e bine sau ne e greu
Si unde-i ea fara sa vreau imi gasesc echilibru'
Am invatat sa dau, sa las, toate cu timpu'
Am invatat sa am rabdare, sa fiu relaxat
Am invatat ca mai am multe de-nvatat
Mi-am asumat noptile pierdute departe
Si grijile care nu ma lasau s-adorm in noapte
In ce hal ne certam, sincer, ai zice ca e arta
Da' cat de dulce ne-mpacam, parca ne-am mai dori o cearta
Oricat ar suna de siropos, n-o dau la-ntors
Pentru ca vad oriunde-i ea aproape toate prind un rost
Si doar un prost nu le spune pe nume si uite asa
Sunt indragostit de muzica, da' si de femeia meaPeur que le ciel me tombe sur la tête
Mais j'ai la tête dans les nuages
C'est souvent quand l'étau se resserre
Que j'ai envie de prendre le large
J'rentre pas dans les normes, j'suis inclassable
Même quand je roule en Mercedes Classe A
Tu répare les pots cassés, moi j'suis incassable
La vie suit son cours, pourtant jamais en classe
Mon cartable a prit l'eau, obligée d'sécher les cours
La vie est un combat, faut savoir encaisser les coups
Certains ont finit dans les cordes et se sont pendus avec
On vit sur le fil du rasoir, faut s'tailler mais pas les veines
Augmente le level faut qu'on m'entende
Prod de Djaresma, 
Le poids des pêchés s'compte en kilos, faut pas en faire des tonnes
Les amis c'est traites, un peu comme la rue
C'est pas eux qui t'poussent vers l'avant, nan c'est toi qui les trainent
Allez vas-y prends-en de la graîne, et fait pousser le fruit de ton époque
La richesse c'est dans l'coeur, c'est dur d'aller dire ça aux pauvres
Loin, loin, loin d'la réalité
Loin, loin, loin de tout ces problèmes
Loin, loin, loin pour qu'ils soient prêts
Tu veux savoir où j'suis ?
Ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs
Tu veux savoir où j'suis ?
Ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs
J'sais pas c'que j'ai, j'sais pas c'que j'ai
Là j'suis duper
J'veux m'envoler, j'veux m'envoler
Mais garder les pieds sur terre
Entre le bien le mal, il faut q'j'me cherche
Comment trouver sa place quand t'as l'cul entre deux chaises
Et j'ai tracé ma route avec des bâtons dans les roues
Tu sais j'en ai fais un bout d'chemin
Et dans nos bâtiments tu sais, si on s'attend au pire
C'est pour que le meilleur soit demain
Quand t'es au pied du mur, faut pas rester en bas d'l'échelle
Emprisonnée par le passé, seul l'avenir nous libérera de ces chaînes
La nuit porte conseil sur le jour de la paye
Si tu veux faire la guerre t'auras jamais la paix
A vouloir tout gagner t'as fini par tout perdre
Voir nos mères en pleures tu sais ça m'fait d'la peine
Loin, loin, loin d'la réalité
Loin, loin, loin de tout ces problèmes
Loin, loin, loin pour qu'ils soient prêts
Tu veux savoir où j'suis ?
Ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs
Tu veux savoir où j'suis ?
Ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleurs, ailleursI'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
To you
I'm not important to you
I'm not important to you
To you
You took me for granted
You took me, you took me for granted
But I landed back on my feet
Back on my feet
Cause you don't deserve me, deserve me yeah
You don't have the time that I need, that I want, I deserve
But I got back my nerve
Back my nerve, did what was right for me
I'm using my head, not my heart and I'm starting anew
I'm going to get over you, over you, over you
You happy is all I wanted to see
Is all I wanted to see
To see, and
And so now that's what I'm going to be
That's what I'm going to be
I'll waste some time on me, yeah
I gave you my all and you took it
I saw and you gave nothing back
Your mind on another track
Another track, another, another track yeah
There are plenty of people out there
Who would care about me
You'll see
You'll see
 2x
When I was even sorry
I just felt good about myself
I just felt good about myself
I just felt good about myselfDon’t say I need to realize
Don’t tell me that you hold some truth
Don’t feel like I will compromise
Don’t feel for the brand new you
I got that tunnel vision
Just who do you think you are?
I need that tunnel vision
Don’t care how ablaze you are
Yes, you need to live with what you left
The truth I believe is for the best
Yes, you need to live with what you left
Was it for the best?
I don’t want to love you, it’s the same
I don’t want to trust you, it’s the same
You are you, and that’s what’s wrong
I don’t want to love you, it’s the same
I don’t want to trust you, it’s the same
You are you, and that’s what’s wrong
I'm not mad at you, oh no no
Come and creep around my house
You can do that all night long
And cry me a river if you like
You can cry me a river
Cry me a river
Your hands will never run down this spine
And you will never kiss these lips of mine
Oh no, no, no, no, no
Oh no, no, no, no, no
I got that tunnel vision
Just who do you think you are?
I need that tunnel vision
Don’t care how ablaze you are
I don’t want to love you, it’s the same
I don’t want to trust you, it’s the same
You are you, and that’s what’s wrong
I don’t want to love you, it’s the same
I don’t want to trust you, it’s the same
You are you, and that’s what’s wrong
I'm not mad at you, oh no noYou have her pictures
You have her pictures
You have her pictures
Everywhere
You're covered in stitches
You're covered in stitches
You think I can't see them
But I know they're there
Take her down from the wall
Let yourself fall
You can keep her frozen
Dormant at your core
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
You lost your big heart
You lost your big heart
You lost your big heart
Beating bare
She gave you a new start
She gave you a new start
But you knew you'd lost her to despair
Take her down from the wall
Let yourself fall
You can keep her frozen
Dormant at your core
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
Your skin burns and prickles
Your skin burns and prickles
Your skin burns and prickles
When she's near
You try to play it cool
You try to play it cool
You try to play it cool
But you're filled with fear
Take her down from the wall
Let yourself fall
You can keep her frozen
Dormant at your core
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
Take her down from the wall
Let her go or make her yours
You can keep her frozen
Dormant at your core
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
You can try to move on
Tripped by stitches come undone
You can try to move on
Or maybe she is the oneRose is late for tea
She's been making mischief
Naughty as can be
She's been making mischief
When will papa see?
She's been making mischief in the schoolyard
Rose is pinching skin
Making all the boys cry
She is kicking shins
Making all the boys cry
Papa can't see it
She is making boys cry in the schoolyard
Rose, Rose
Rose, Rose
Rose is throwing stones
Making all the girls scream
Rose is breaking bones
Taking all their ice cream
Papa doesn't know
The havoc she is reeking in the schoolyard
Rose, Rose
Rose, Rose
Rose is on her own
No one wants to play now
Rose is all alone
Pushed everyone away out
Only Rose is gone
Papa sees her sitting in the schoolyard
Rose is papa's seas
She misses mama sadly
This flower's growing weak
No mama to hold hands with
Rose falls to her knees
She lets a tear fall softly in the schoolyardBam Bam
I'm gonna live today like it's my last
Fast, make it last
Yeah
If you're feeling Count all the yellow cars you see
Count things that start with 'M'
Look for the strongest, tallest tree
Hold your breath 'til that bend
Whisper a secret to your right
Shout out but make no sound
At the beach, you can fly your kite
The sand isn't far off now
And we're digging up daisies
Yeah, we're digging up daisies
Imagine the castles you will make
Get your bucket and spade
Let's pretend we have baked a cake
Look at the mess we've made
Let's splash some water on our face
Let's get our feet wet
Let's bury Teddy in this place
Let's hold our breath
Yeah, we're digging up daisies
Yeah, we're digging up daisies
And we're digging up daisiesDon't want to be another case
About rather not see and I turn my face
Don't want to leave you unfinished
And resting on the noise that you left
I don't want to leave you mistaken, forsaken
Lying with the rest
I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
I don't want to be a woman last
Yeah I wish you another man
I don't want you to kill my name
And ask if I'm hovering him
I won't send and gather dust
In the corners of your world
Cause believe me, when you leave me
It will be a military zone
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
I don't want you to be another
Touch, you talk the conversation
I don't want you to be another
Reason for me to leave this situation
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me started
Don't get me startedFar from home, all dismembered and leaving with their limbs on wrong!
Shrapnel spraying
Shrapnel spraying
Shrapnel spraying
Shrapnel spraying!
Camouflage: unappealing with 3 days worth of rotting in
Malnutrition, fecal cause, laceration trophy scars!
Let it be, let it be
Running to the stations
Carnage destination
Carry out the consequences
Let it be, let it be
Weapon calibration, monk self-immolation, pouring on their own death sentence
This land is a ghost, how did it scare? No one was spared
All bodies in rows. Why were you there? Why were you there?
This land is a ghost, how did it scare? No one was spared
All bodies in rows. Why were you there? Why were you there?
Let it be, let it be
Running to the stations
Carnage destination
Carry out the consequences
Futures looking bleak, pass the torch
Earth goes up in flames, keep it scorched
Tally up body counts, why were you there?
Why were you there?
Sick machine, chivalry, hurry up
Aesthetic rethinking, hurry up
Power keeps it in the family
We're the lost. Their chosen sons!
History will you redeem us?
We've succumbed to parasites!
We're carried, we're carried under, under parasites!Lying at night in bed
I heard clock tick and think of you
Caught up in circles
Confusion is nothing new
Flashback, warm nights
Almost left behind suitcases of memories
Time after sometimes you picture me
I'm walking too far ahead
You're calling to me
I can't hear what you have said
Then you say, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
 
If you're lost, you can look and you will find me
Time after time
If you fall, I will catch you, I will be waiting
Time after time
After my picture fades and darkness has turned to gray
Watching through windows
You're wondering if I'm OK
Secrets stolen from deep inside
The drum beats out of time
You said, go slow
I fall behind
The second hand unwinds
 
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after time
Time after timeTon équipe est sur la black liste

Quand j'rappe tu fais les backs backs
T'as l'flow d'un dernier pak-pak
J'me déplace en jet-pack-pack
Bitch, bitch c'est un big deal
Dream Chaser comme Meek Mill
J'répète c'est un big deal
Sur la prod des MCs j'en nique mille
Dé-dé-dégaine, laissez parler les mecs
Tes ladies sont pétés, donc laisse rapper les miennes
Tu m'as entendu rapper, t'as crié AMEN
Tu connais des rappeurs ? vas-y je t'en prie, ramène
Pas le temps de parler, je prends place dans l'arène
Il fallait du nouveau dans le rap, je l'amène
Que tu sois là ou non, d'toute façon c'est la même
Je suis venue, j'ai vu et j'ai foutu la merde
Je m'amuse sur le son sans le moindre effort
Rappeur excuse moi si je t'ai causé du tort
Je m'amuse sur le son sans le moindre effort
MC excuse moi si je t'ai causé du tort
J'ai pas le temps de m'occuper de vos histoires
Parfois je sens que je suis proche de la victoire
Laisse-moi le temps de m'ancrer dans les mémoires
Je suis devant, et ça depuis le départ
Et ça depuis le départ
Et ça depuis le départ
Et ça depuis le départ
MC excuse-moi si je t'ai causé du tort
J'arrive très bientôt, fais gaffe, je préviens pas
Les Mcs poussez-vous et puis poussez les portes
Je ramène du flow, j'ai sorti les AK
Allez-y couchez vous j'viens choquer mon époque
Prévenez vos potes, remontez vos frocs
Désormais tout ceux qui parlent mal on les fuck
STOP ! Ils m'ont certifié que c'est vrai qu'on les choque
Chaque jour j'me lève du pied gauche pour être sûre de rapper vénère
RIP à tous ces MCs dont la carrière est éphémère
Eh ouais mec, j'suis la preuve vivante que en province ça rap sec
Han, t'es vénère, j'ai plus d'un flow sous ma casquette
Comment faire du bon RAP ? faut juste me demander la recette
Evite de m'casser la tête, à mes côtés y'a l'homme 7
Belek, pousse toi, j'ai l'revers de Nadal
18 piges mais dans l'peura les MC m'apellent "madame"
Normal, ils voient que j'kick et que j'le fais à fond
Attention, j'suis l'porte parole, de toute une génération
Félicitations, sans prétention, mon flow frise la perfection
Tu dois reconnaitre que je suis la règle qui confirme l'exceptionCome and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see
Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see
Is there a meaning here?
Is there a meaning here?
Does it really mean a thing?
Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see
I am the real thing
Oo mama mow-mow 
Oo mama mama mama mama mama mama mow
Tryin’ hard to understand it
Tryin’ hard to make things real
Tryin’ hard to understand it
But the real thing's just so sweet
I am not seeing
I am not feeling
Ahhhhh
Tryin' hard to make things happen
Well, that's the way it's always been
Tryin' hard to make things happen
When the real thing can be so thin
Well, there's a meaning here
Is there a meaning here?
Does the real thing mean a thing?
Come and see the real thing
Come and see the real thing
Come and see
I am the real thing
  
J’suis pas attachée au rap
Mais j’veux quand même faire un casse
Parc’que si demain tout s’arrête
J’irai chercher un taf
On a dit “fuck les cours”
Mais maintenant on court à notre perte
Mais à c’jeu-là y’a qu’Usain Bolt
Qui arrivera en tête
C’est dur à dire
Mais ma couleur est un handicap
Ils prennent de l’âge
Mais leur tolérance ne grandit ap
Depuis tout petite, j’ai l’cul entre deux chaises
Chez les çais-fran j’suis une renoi
Chez les renois j’suis une française
Donc j’vis une vie d’métisse
Malgré ma couleur ébène
Mais j’sais qu’on verra rouge
Si on s’met à s’tailler les veines
J’suis parfois maladroite
Mais j’suis pas mieux à gauche
Et si j’écoute plus d’rap
C’est qu’j’ai déjà eu ma dose
Souvent dans l’doute
J’ai jamais connu d’bénéfices
J’ai rien à perdre, malgré de nombreux sacrifices
Pas d’excuses, j’suis pas la plus à plaindre
Mes phobies sont minimes
Car à part Dieu j’ai rien à craindre
Ainsi va la vie, j’écris
Car j’ai un but à atteindre
Ainsi va la vie, tout brille
Et tout finira par s’éteindre
Dans la vie rien n’est acquis
Mais tout est écrit
Mon destin me sourit
Et si il me pleure
Je n’irai pas me plaindre
Beaucoup ont fait l’amour
Avant de l’avoir rencontré
Des histoires secrètes
Trop difficiles à raconter
Mes sœurs faites attention
Et mes frères également
Car dans c’bas-monde
C’est trop petits qu’on tombe dans l’égarement
Mes potes me disent “Sianna bsahtek
Maintenant on t’entend partout”
T’inquiète je sais qui était là
Au tout début du parcours
J’me suis toujours promise
De garder certains principes
J’évite de faire le mal
Même lorsqu’on m’y incite
J’suis seule, j’vais repartir seule
J’l’ai toujours su
On n’en a jamais assez
On en veut toujours plus
J’fais ma musique
Sinon j’traîne avec mes potes
Tout va bien, mais des fois
J’me remets à penser à l’époque
Mais à quoi bon ? 
J’peux pas faire marche arrière
J’suis lancée, j’dois avancer
J’peux pas caler dans ma carrière
J’le fais avec le cœur
En rajoutant un sourire
Même si ça doit s’arrêter
J’en garderai un bon souvenir
Ainsi va la vie, j’écris
Car j’ai un but à atteindre
Ainsi va la vie, tout brille
Et tout finira par s’éteindre
Dans la vie rien n’est acquis
Mais tout est écrit
Mon destin me sourit
Et si il me pleure
Je n’irai pas me plaindre
Regarde où j’en suis
Depuis qu’j’ai croisé Lynda
Ils m’ont donné ma chance
Et ça crois-moi j’le nie pas
J’oublie pas Issam, Mohand
Et bien sûr Numéro Sept
Depuis qu’j’travaille avec vous
Y’a qu’la réussite qui m’obsède
J’veux faire sourire les gens
Leur montrer qu’ils sont pas seuls
Qu’on a les mêmes emmerdes
Et p’t-être même les mêmes passions
J’ai rien d’plus que personne
Si c’n’est peut-être du talent
Mais pour autant
J’me permettrai pas d’prendre du galon
J’passe mes soirées dehors à tourner dans la ville
Mes potes et moi on risque de finir à l’asile
Mais c’est la vie et on s’tue à la vivre
J’préfère rester avec la mif’ à écouter d’la zik
Parc’que en vrai ailleurs bah j’ai du mal à suivre
J’ai fait du mal, j’ai fait du bien
Mais j’ai peur du résultat
Dieu est grand et au Jugement
Y’a des preuves irréfutables
J’me pose un tas d’questions
Comme tous les jeunes de mon âge
Comment vais-je trouver la paix ?
Comment vais-je sauver mon âme ?
 
Ainsi va la vie, j’écris
Car j’ai un but à atteindre
Ainsi va la vie, tout brille
Et tout finira par s’éteindre
Dans la vie rien n’est acquis
Mais tout est écrit
Mon destin me sourit
Et si il me pleure
Je n’irai pas me plaindre
J’suis pas attachée au rap
Mais j’veux quand même faire un casse
Parc’que si demain tout s’arrête
J’irai chercher un taf
On a dit “fuck les cours”
Mais maintenant on court à notre perte
Mais à c’jeu-là y’a qu’Usain Bolt
Qui arrivera en têteCould never met the kind
They keep the stars aligned
Turn out on the spot
Watch it all pass by
I lie here awaiting for the tears
While I pass the years
I kinda seemed to move
Nothing more to lose
Waiting in the base
That we used to use
I lie here awaiting for the tears
While I pass the years
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
It's dirty like it is
Everything's a mess
I can only save but your last kiss
I lie here awaiting for the tears
While I pass the years
I cannot show my face
Blurred in your embrace
I am controlling your taste
I lie here awaiting for the tears
While I pass the years
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
These memories
Weigh on me
I make believe
It sets me free
I long for you...
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me down
You hold me downJ'suis dans tous mes états, prête à faire des dégâts
Si y'a haja t'inquiète, gros j'ai l'flow neuf millimètres
Demande à numéro sept, on connaît pas l'échec
C'est pour ça qu'à session freestyle je les élimine
Et ça polémique, je sais qu't'as l'seum
Mais bon reste poli mec, si j'dépasse mes limites
J'toucherai l'million, toi tu veux le minimum
T'es pas de la team, donc écarte-toi du périmètre
Ça y est j'ai mis les gants, là c'est du high-kick
J'suis dans la cour des grands donc forcément je m'applique
J'les fuck sans préliminaires, sans même forcer
On leur a dit d'se bouger l'cul, ils se sont mis à twerker
Enfermée dans la son-mai pour taffer des flows de taré
Depuis qu'ils font d'la trap j'ai l'impression qu'ils sont décalés
J'te l'ai déjà dit, j'suis pas dans l'rap m'faire des collègues
À la base c'était pour rire mais là j'ai plus l'temps de déconner
 
On te tacle à la gorge parc'qu'elle est trop profonde
On te tacle à la gorge parc'qu'elle est trop profonde
Hula hoop, tu tournes en rond
Hula hoop, tu tournes en rond

Au calme dans le rap jeu
Il pleut des billets c'est le jour de la paye
Vous allez rentrer à la nage
Rien à foutre de ton estime, fuck le prestige
J'rappe en toute modestie, les rappeurs font meskine
Les deux pieds dans l'industrie, tu repars frustré
Tout le monde te vesqui quand tu n'as plus d'succès
Fuck, fuck, à la base on n'est pas célèbres
C'est pas parc'que tu kickes, que mon gava t'es censé l'être
À la base un pied dans le rap, le deuxième sur la sélette
Les vrais amis sont rares, oui j'ai appris à faire belek
O.K.L.M dans le rap jeu, ça y est j'ai mis les gaz
J'suis dans l'illégal, j'rappe au-dessus des lois
J'ai les idées noires, pourtant tout est clair
J'suis dans les affaires #Utréma
2016 premier album crie-le sur tous les toits

Maintenant t'es sur le cul, à toi de faire le choix

Album: The Visualz EP
Song: No Soles' Dopest Opus
Soul brother's on this scene now...gon' really do a COOL one for ya
Siah:
Archery through parched lips I aim rhymes that maim mimes
The verbal darts I rip  your heart skips  a beat, grip your seat
And you can dip your feet in the clear blue, here to
Defrost your rear view, if you're lost then I can steer you
To where I travel, it's always upon the gravel
Cause slaves walk the paved and everybody got a gavel
I could rouse a rabble, but never dabble in that babblin sport
Form a flock, I bring the fodder for your thought
And in the meelee I stay  like icicle licks
The baby Pele here to hit you with them tricycle kicks
Rhymes are tight like vice grips with mic tools, the fools manifest
Jewels to get you high like swimmin in the cesspool
And when you starve I carve a rhyme like a pumpkin
And in the caverns of my soul I go spelunkin
So now you're sunk in the flow, it's mad pure and
MCs who lack the knack are even samplin my urine
Rhymes who eminate from this Yeminite lights
Like a torch I disseminated thoughts in flights
To ignite the four corners of the Earth plus the last world birth
From the sand, now my turf need the astro, I
(leave no footprints in the sands of time
So these wack MCs can't follow me)
Travel on the gravel, never took the taken road
Slaves walk the paved, cravin on the same shit
I explain shit, all you need to pay's attention
Four dimensional, I call it verbal intervention
Travel on the gravel, never took the taken road
Slaves walk the paved, cravin on the same shit
Po ED explain shit, all you need to pay's attention
Four dimensional, he call it verbal intervention
Yeshua:
Keep close, look to peep the roads took since tracks are not left evident
To prevent duplicate footprints
Sprints on the main stream remain lame, spannin only A to B
For me, A and T's the way to be, oh M
Before, then, and after reckon there comes the second
Be  very fast to analyze lines divised
By the rhyme crafter, I have to, define my kicks
While kids be wack, ridin piggyback droppin lint
In hip hop I'm, wishing kids drop bombs, jewels
And next shit, they best shit cool and only a batch do
So I can pick it up and throw it right back at you
Rhymes hatch through, catch too to, match you
View who invite bliss, despite kids
Who force me to write this, sum it up like this
Buffoons, are hot air balloons, find themselves with wealth
Consumin plumes on the moon, spewin lagoons
Now blooms, assumin, cats, on a tune in
Gladly catch due and sadly that' ruinin'
Hip hop as I know it, it stops with the PoED
Not only plant seeds but take time when I grow it
So it, deletes the need for weed whackin seems rappers
Come a dime a dozen, empty minded, they find it's easy
Sayin nothin when they shit drop, the remedy We Be
Formin Only Original Lyrics In Shapin'
Hip Hop
(You know I leave no footprints on the sands of time
So these wack MCs can't follow me)
Siah:
Travel on the gravel, never took the taken road
Slaves walk the paved, cravin on the same shit
We Be explain shit, formulatin a solution
Four dimensional, we call it verbal resolution
Travel on the gravel, never took the taken road
Slaves walk the paved, cravin on the same shit
To be free, explain shit, formulatin a solution
Four dimensional, we call it verbal resolutionWatch my decay
Watch me waste my day
I'm wasting away
Always aware
Can't wait to see your face
My eternal chase
I am your ghost
You can't shake me away
I remember every word you said
I am Ablaze with hunger
I wait
Why don't you love me
Why don't you need me
Why don't you want me
How could you leave me
This is my sempiternal
I wan't your soul eternal
Why don't you love me
How could you leave me
Your scented core
The taste of fear
From your my dear
I crouched down low
Waiting silently
Waiting eagerly
I am ablaze with a broken heart
I run my fingers through your spine
I am ablaze with a broken heart
I run my fingers through your mouth
You belong
To me
YouVerse 1]
Pick me up in your arms
Carry me away from harm
You're never gonna put me down
Oh, oh, oh
I know you're just one good man
You'll tire before we see land
You're never gonna put me down
Oh, I've been running all my life
I ran away, I ran away from good
Yeah, I've been waiting all my life
You're not a day, you're not a day too soon
Honey, I will stitch you
Darling, I will fit you in my heart
Honey, I will meet you
Darling, I will keep you in my heart
You'll risk all this for just a kiss
I promise I will not resist
Promise you won't hold me down
Oh, oh, oh
And when we reach a good place
Let's be sure to leave no trace
Promise they won't track us down
Oh, I've been running all my life

J'pensais que t'étais mon gars sûr
T'as fait des erreurs et oui maintenant faut qu't'assumes
T'as perdu le nord quand t'es descendu dans l'sud
T'as brisé une amitié j'compte même plus les cassures
C'es pas la première fois, j't'avais prévenu
Mais avec toi rien n'se passe comme prévu
Après c'est ta vie privée oui t'as dérivé
T'as préféré nous lâcher pour la première venue
T'as fait que d'la merde
Faudrait pas qu'tu la ramènes
T'as vu les meufs où ça mène
A vouloir trop la ken t'as failli nous la mettre
Elle t'a fait tourner la tête
Surtout ta veste
Devant nous tu joues les fiers
Mais devant elle tu te rabaisse
Oui tu sais au fond j'te connais
On t'a reconnu
T'appelles en masqué, pour moi t'es qu'un inconnu
Surtout un faux cul
J'comprends qu't'aies préféré les seins silliconés
Tu m'as planté dans l'dos
J'croyais qu'tu protégeais mes arrières
T'as dépassé les limites, t'as sauté les barrières
C'est la fin d'ta carrière
Tu m'as mené en bâteau et t'as fini à l'eau
J'pensais que t'étais my nigga
My nigga my nigga

T'es plus avec elle c'est bien c'qu'il me semblait
Au lieu d'faire la sourde oreille t'aurais dû m'écouter
Elle t'as dépouillé maintenant t'es dégoûté
On récolte c'que l'on sème
Toi t'as fini sans blé
Elle a réglé ses comptes elle s'est tapée le banquier
Toi tu penses à elle tu vas pas lui manquer
Tu croyais qu'on mentait
Elle n'veut qu'les intérêts
Elle t'as mis plus bas qu'terre oui elle t'as enterré
T'es tombé amoureux maintenant faut qu'tu t'relèves
La roue tourne à vive allure toi t'as passé le relai
Les soucis s'entassent à cause d'ellle t'as quitté l'taff
Tu sais quoi mon pote on s'en tape
T'as préféré la miss à la mif'
A la fin tu sais elle t'la mise
L'amour c'est comme le café jamais servi sans tasse
J't'avais dit qu't'allais regretter
Il t'reste que tes yeux pour pleurer
Maintenant tu veux qu'on t'aide
Mais mec c'est dead
Pas l'temps sur ma Rolex

My negger my negger
My negger my negger
My negger my negger
My negger my negger
My negger my neggerCan't tell you if it was for nothing
But I just wanna tell you one thing
I should have shown you all my scars
Before they tore us apart
You could have known right from the start
I was so afraid of looking weak
Lost in my ways in too deep
And knowing that my soul was tearing me in two
Im sorry that I couldn't face the truth
'Cause I could feel it in my bones
Before I knew we would never be enough
So I lied to myself
Even though I tried, I can't force the love
You burned yourself on something cold
Because I could never give you what you want
And I lied to myself, еven though I try
I can not force the lovе
I always give up, when things got difficult
'Cause love never fit in with the cynical
And that's why I had to leave
Before you'd see me bleed
I'll never be the person that you need
I hope that you find someone that you deserve
Someone who's not afraid of getting hurt
'Cause I only crawl so I don't have to fall
I'd rather have nothing than take it all
'Cause I could feel it in my bones
Before I
Knew we would never be enough
So I lied
To myself. Even though I tried
I can not
Force the love
You Burned yourself on something cold
Because I
Could never give you what you want
And I lied
To Myself, even though I try
I can not Force the LoveBaby, look at me
Can't you see?
That I'm so in love
So in love
I'm so in love
Na, na, na, na, na, na, na, na
Since you came to me

I've been so in love
So in love

Quieten down
Yo Siah, kick that story, man. You know which one, man
Uh, oh...oh, no doubt, man
Well, it was another  day in the summer
 paid, what a bummer
Layin' in the shade under the boardwalk
 more heads stalk 
And Siah never hawk, 3-6-5 lampin' in New York
Never pork for lunch, strictly Crunch 'n Munch
Plus knishes  washed down wit' punch
Not poutin', spoutin' rhymes from out the snout
And countin' the hours, I believe that we're leavin' on a journey
Cos my soul burns me, that goes for 
And so we be foolishly missionin'
Put the key in its position
And we boat from the harbour passin' all the people fishin'
And 'po had a vision listenin' to the rhythm of the tides
As we passed the great divide...
I sighed, asked Si' why ride wit' no
Idea where, sit your hide here
There's  purpose on this o-cean
But to compare flow, maybe motion
Overdosed in queer notion, almost a magic potion
That I drunk to thunk or maybe think about the brink of a...
 Brother, that we hover over
Soon the sun shows a speck that I suppose to be a vessel comin' closer
Recognised it by the odour of the pipe
Smoke approached like I choked 
The smoker's a peerin' here like he hadn't seen a pier in a year
"Siah, should steer towards him?"
("Yeah...yeah, let's board him, with the swords in the scabbards
And the daggers in the belt though")
"Ahoy! Ahoy! My mellow, my man"
"Uh, might you have a problem, could we lend you a hand?"
I felt that he was needin' help, his hands were bleedin'
Lookin' like he caught a beatin' from beneath the deep blue
He insisted on assistance to catch a fish
That was resistin' its arrest, told him...
 and he proceded to free a few flows
As bait to feed this great flounder
Surround sound's bound to make him deflate
And whaddaya know? 
When the 'po ED spit it
The fish done did it, jumped up and bit it
So hooked he closed his notebook and though the boat shook
We both took the older man upon our shoulders and...
He told us that he got a map of the world
That he'd exchange for the fish and so we gave him his wish
And got a six-pack to kick back upon the high sea
Siah sippin' Hi-C now we're feelin' nicely
In a snap analysed the map and soon found we was North-East bound for sure
 So I took my can to go
Planted toes in the sand and lend a hand to my bro'
See, I was tipsy cos the sip be fruit punch
Spewed lunch, it was too much, too much to keep
Then peeped a cadaver afloat by the boat
Seen somethin' in his hand, E, that looks like a note
An open bottle in his right
"I wonder what he might have wrote?"
"Oh, what's the difference? Check the note, man"
"Just check the note"
My time runs short, for late to come was my retort
Consumed by a plague soon my life will abort
To think I thought that I wouldn't get caught
I was thinkin' a thought that was thought for naught
Yo, the letter didn't make the situation better
We was gettin' wetter plus the breeze made us deader
Movin' to the trees towards an unknown goal
Siah with his Hi-C, and me my can of Old Gold
"Yo, we can't go back now, man
We gotta see this through then, you know."
Instead of goin' through a chorus we entered in this forest
Me tryin' my hardest not to let my teeth chatter
But the fact of the matter was that I was kinda nervous
Didn't have my rhyme rope-ladder at my service
 this here place we were facin'
The sounds of cats chasin' made us feel like rats
Racin' towards scraps, plus bats steady gazin'
Gnats on my back, I was ready to be Swayzin'
Yo, we were trailblazin' through the woods inhabited by rabbits
 I tried to grab it
But it wasn't havin' it, so we jetted after it
Through nature's labyrinth-rinth-rinth
But see the rabbit was quick, it took a year off my kicks
And the 'S' off my chest, felt I needed a rest
("Ayo, 'iah why you stoppin' in that spot in the shade?
Forget the 'S', unless we trap him up in the glade up ahead")
I said, "'po ED, go ahead, distract him
I'll circle around to the back and then attack him"
Me, I'm set to not let him escape from my view
Yo, I see the 'po on the go and the rabbit comin' too
At which point we switched the joint up
Wrestlin' for my 'S', and nestlin' in this nest when I wasn't feelin' it
 "Nah, it's not really on point
But peep this..."
To freak this next beat correctly
I checked see if my specs be placed properly
This rabbit's hoppin' on top of me
My 'S', I grab it, Siah's once again official
Nobody's stoppin' me but then the rabbit gave a whistle
All of a sudden the thistle came alive with eyes
About a thousand surrounded, felt my heart poundin'
The 'po started drownin' in fear leavin' beads of sweat
To wet the ground, reassured him with a pound and an ear...
"Siah, try and see we're encircled entirely
Not even leavin' one degree to slide through
We need to try to make a move before the eyes do
We gotta rhyme our way out, whatever happens I'm beside you to the end"
"No doubt, it's all about breakin' out of this mess
And if I need to bless the beast may they rest in peace"
 Confrontation commenced
 Now check the turn of events...
We stood tense awaitin' motion from the woods
Then a thousand eyes became a mass of cloaks and hoods
I felt the life of the cipher, but this  time with a twist
Sensin' this sense I'm on defense
I knew a miss meant death, rhymin' to save our breath
Was the only path left to take so we took
Siah pulled out his book full of remedies
An arsensal capable of cuttin' many extremities
Lettin' these beasts know when he released flow
Then foes be easily defeated
So Siah been spittin' writtens, none survivin'
The shit was hittin', he asked a few to dive in his mind
They drowned, looked around and found
A scimitar on some next page and got down
Splittin' crown, back-to-back attack on these clown half-breeds
In fact he didn't even ask me to jump in
'Musta been somethin' he drunk', I thought
Siah flyin' heads like some ill-ass sport
Minus the asphalt or the towels
All I saw was all the vowels and consonants
Consequently he disembowelled creatures like white owls
Took out about a half-dozen with a scowl
He cleared a path, "Cousin, yo now let's be jetty
End the medley with this freestyle and then we ready"
I seen this smile on the 'po's face but I'm leavin' no trace
Breathin' at a fast pace after this battle in the glade
I couldn't bring forth laughter
Yo E, yo we gotta move faster 
Passed this spot, blessed it be me and be seein' defeat
And not the very blend of this next beat
The text reads that we found a way out of the forest
Not knowin' about the obstacle that soon loomed before us
We found the route out in a roundabout manner
A scan of the horizon showed us just what was the matter
The matter was a mountain, sproutin' from the ground
Made of granite
Juttin' out this nearly round planet
Cuttin' clearly through my view and it was too high
Like Everest, thought we would never rest, but nevertheless...
We were too clever to stress, felt fresh, sublime
And after all yo, I been climbin' since I first started rhymin'
 shit-shinin'
 type fun but no time to stall
As we ascend the rock we pass a flock at the gate
Waitin' for the same hand that will command our fate
From the sand strait to the land that awaits over yonder
Walkin' with the 'po I start to ponder over climbin' this
Si' and Yeshua 'The Tireless' wander cos a fire sits rockin' in the soul
Droppin' in the coal, it is the way we take control
Started with a stroll and soon expanded to a scroll
Holdin' it, but the plot becomes too thick to think
So we let instinct take its course
Of course it's not a force to be reckoned with
And in a second it's leadin' us up to the source that is beckonin'
Summoned to the summit, "Yo, be careful not to plummet"
Like the rain had just began to
"Yeah, true I understand you
But can you see us reachin' this peak before the end of the week?
I mean it's gettin' kinda steep and I feel I'm leavin' the beat"
"Why you doubtin'? We're too far for that
Besides, the top of the mountain lies at the end of the track..."
Finally we made it up, once again I'm layin' in the cut
Like bacteria, not stayin' in the rut
Steerin' clear of this doubt that's waitin' in the gut
Right about then the 'po decided he would go and scout...
...out the area of this mountaintop
The rain stopped for a hot minute then dropped back in it
But now pourin', plus the thunder made me wonder 'What now?'
Soarin' through the sky I noticed a flock of birds lookin' terrified
Eyes never lie and their's verified my observation
In the distant sky I seen a figure and I figured he was chasin'
Comin' closer, the figure bigger than my imagination
Disturbed, he spotted us and just as quick
Released the birds from a forced migration
Didn't look like he was up for any co-habitation
Came down and we were stuck
Petrified, I'd never seen a beast like this
He had wings made of leather and some feathers on his wrist
Our nemesis, commandin' powers unspeakable
I reminisced back to the forest and the creatures
Who confronted us, I wondered what was the connection?
But no time for reflection, he walked in our direction
Like a thing possessed
I seen him holdin' in his hand somebody's cassette
And he didn't look impressed
He said, ("I heard your tape didn't like it cos you complicate
In fact, I hate all those that elevate
You made it this far, but don't celebrate
Cos your lives I decided to confiscate")
Before I could ask exactly what track aggravated matters
He crushed the tape and rushed straight at us
At a rate that made our hearts race, but we stayed in place
To face this waste of life, that's when Si' hit him with a...
...right at you, you can't stop this flight
I'll strike your dome in like the knight
To leave your whole cipher blown like the last one
So ED stepped past me and then hit him with a...
...left, better than you burn
Permanent like a bad one
Your turn to combust must cause concern
But the beast just laughed and extinguished the thought
Cut his retort in half
I was sort of distraught seein' this beast in my path
Felt we had to release some next...
I knew he wouldn't expect it if we cold connected
On a single perspective, so we collected thoughts and ejected
 cannot  try to defend skies
And send lives straight flyin' through the wind
 the words make things
 the cracks 
Tracks make 'em clap and stomp
 too complex
To let me rise 
Now is the time, I'm seizin' the prize...
We took cover knowin' that we hit the mark
Discovered another level and this brother got ripped apart
He gripped his heart and fell down to the ground
Then smoke started comin' out his eyes and soon we found
A cloud surroundin' him
But I didn't go near for fear that he was still alive
When it started to clear I figured that he had died
He and I, we were surprised, for in front of our eyes
There lay a child, kickin' and screamin', actin' wild, and uh...
(I decided it was safe to pick him up
So we did quick enough and then the baby stopped cryin'
"Yo, you think that we should take him back with us?")
Discussin' this when the baby tapped ED on the shoulder
And attract-ed our attention with a finger
Signallin' somethin' that we couldn't combat
He pointed over (my back, I turned around and dropped my jaw
Siah also looked amazed from the sight that he saw)
This kid found what we didn't even know we were lookin' for
But when the kid noticed it he proved his new friends wrong
 
Well, it was...          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        The boy is out of this world
Down to the ground
He is locked, trapped in a life he wants to get out off
But there ain't no way out
Helping is banned by the nightmares of living
Anxiety can be found in bulk
He's been discouraged
Due to the fact that days have a start and beginning
Does feel like placed in the wrong corps and time
Please, oh
My darling
Stay with me
My darling, my love
Please
The boy wants to get out of this world
To a place
So calm, so peaceful
Where there is no pressure to act in a sensitive way
To be understood
Not to be left alone
Where people don't just walk away
Please, oh
Stay with, hey, stay with me
My darling, my love
Please
The door unable to find
Love
I'll help you to get it over with
I want you to stay mine, oh
And see you being happy
Please, stay with me
I want you to stay with me
My love, my dear
I want you to stay with meYeah.. Yeshua the Po ED, Siah
Gravity
Wind blows in the intro, frontin like I did it
But them elemental forces blessed me with possession
Fraction of my physical action is a tenth
Nine consist of soul but I'm 
The span of my arms does not constitute my reach
That's the sideways A, of the Y's a few feet
Vertical is 5'4, giving you the two dimensional
Third is the depth that's incomprehensible
Fourth is the time that binds space
Situated in the mind with the rhyme race
Like speed I feed the rhythm ill thoughts
Without a hook and it still gets caught
I scale walls like fish
Bringin the mix from across the river Styx
For decipherin like the matrix
In the annals of rap, I want the dog-eared page
Nothin less than that, plus a whole lot more
And it's hard livin by the mental intersection
Where writer's block is sorta like gridlock, yeah
But my connection with the Earth is by finite
So 'til my body's terminated I'm a always rhyme tight
It's like that
Gravity, achin like a cavity
Takin its toll, but not controllin my soul
Gravity, aches like a cavity
Takes its toll, but not controllin my soul
Listen and remember
MCs who render empty compositions tend to
Start rappin like Christians at the end of December
Cold up science to make a deal
Permittin my defiance at gravity in hip-hop
Let's form an alliance, keep me rappin avidly
And you'll be proud guaranteed if you'll only let my shit drop
Pete Morgan demanded me to never harden
Spittin the  but be the regular I beg your pardon
I got a call, on the other line
I reckon your time is precious, so I'll only be a second
With that, I hit that button, it was wife
But she's a bitch, so I switch back, nothing but an interruption
Let's get back to our discussion, is it on?
He said "Bet" and then voices exit
Since then I rip a, rhyme without hesi-tation
As if I, had wings or better
Doing backflips on tightropes it's phat shit that I wrote
And on practice I hang on the factors that I float
Let go, and get so high like my icon be
Ready to check for I.D. to flow beyond me
My jaw, oozin raw rhymes being direct cause
Of Newton's law losing meaning
If there was a chance of history havin me grapple the apple
We wouldn't overstand gravity
Gravity, achin like a cavity
Takin its toll, but not controllin my soul
Gravity, aches like a cavity
Takes its toll, but not controllin my soul
Trapped on this planet, I didn't plan it
Stuck to the granite my shells find light
But the light's infinite, looks right into it
I into it, links like sausages
Kinks in my brain, keeping me sane
On a jet plane, or on ethereal planes
Reach the latter by a former, rhyme rope ladder
Climbin and creatin, rung by line
But an unseen force, plots my course
Down I'm forced, to the ground I slip
And the rhyme rope rips, fingertips are cut
Hands get burnt and I retreat to the hut
You see blisters, turn a boy into a mister
But gravity aches like a cavity
Takes its toll, but not controllin my soul
I hold a hole in my soul to keep it warm in the cold
And in the cold, my winter breath forms words
Literally you see me speak in three dimensional verbs
Intentional swerves, not conventional blurbs
I got forty foes, and roll with forty thieves
Takin beats and breaks and when the Lord Jesus son
And even it come we take flight in the night
With the iron fist, with the iron fist
Defying science...
Gravity, achin like a cavity
Takin its toll, but not controllin my soul
Gravity, aches like a cavity
Takes its toll, but not controllin my soulSo naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
Little man, little man
I'm by far your greatest fan
Little man
I'm endlessly proud of you
In such a short time span
You've filled my heart with soul
As I grow older
You grow wiser
Watching my mistakes
Memorise where I've gone wrong
If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
Little man
Your head is full of dreams
If only I could spend one day
Touring your imagination
Now if I live longer
You'll grow faster
At recognising the traps
That cause me such frustration
If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
If they fall away
I'll stay with you
But do as I say and not as I do
Trust me, you'll see
All I want is what is best for you
So naive, it helps me to breathe
Your smile I keep on file
You tickle me pink
I love the way you think
So when I'm feeling low I know
Little man, little man
I'm by far your greatest fan

I drink you in and breath you out
I'm camouflaged by the timeline
I'm camouflaged when the sun shines
Two ships passing in the night
Two lips pressing ground the tides
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I long to be apart
I isolate my heart
You've drawn me into your world
Now I too spin limbless
One wide hand clapping where's the wind
I stand spanning at your distant wings
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moon
I believe the world it spins for you
We will never be, I am the moonYou and you alone
You and you alone have the power to be the master of your life
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
Granted you're taking me for a sucker
When I am not
Gradually, we'll patch up mends and I'll make you see
What I've got
Apparently you're taking me for a slip on
You've gotta tie me up
Eventually you will tamper mends and I'll make you see
I am enough
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
Obviously you're taking me for what suits you
When I don't
With slow ease I'll show you disgraced, you were on my knees
You know I won
Foolishly you're taking me for a sleeper
When I'm quite away
Evidently will not profit me your intense scene
And you'll now break
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You only see what you want to see
You only see what you want to
You and you alone
You and you alonePetite princesse rêve de devenir une re-sta
À peine majeur
Elle est connue dans toutes les ré-soi
Prête à tout pour briller
Elle s'impose aucune limite:
Elle regarde les Anges, les Ch'tis
Reprend toutes les mimiques
Son ambition c'est la télé-réalité
Elle maquille tout ses défauts
Pour mieux exposer ses qualités
Jeune et jolie
Elle a un but à atteindre
Elle rêve du prince dans son lit à baldaquin
Elle n'a pas eu son bac mais sort en première loge
Elle ne croit plus en l'amour
Depuis son premier love
Tout est faux chez elle
Elle vit dans le superficiel
Elle porte des hauts talons
En espérant toucher le ciel
Ses atouts physique sont devenus sa force
Les mecs tombent dans un cul de sac Michael Kors
Elle fait ses premiers pas
Pour son premier casting
Sa vie ne tient qu'à un fil
Celui de son string
{Refrain: Soprano}
Elle était si jolie
Si naturel si mimi
Son petit grain de folie
Oui elle nous a tous rendu ding ding
Mais les coupures de presses
Les strass et les paillettes
Les drogues et les jour d'ivresse
L'ont totalement rendu ding ding
Aveugler par les projecteurs de ses rêves
Dans ses yeux je ne lis plus que des S.O.S
Que t'est il arrivé ma petite princesse?
Oh-ouh-oooh
{Sianna}
Petite princesse vit sa vie de Rock Star
Partout dans la presse
Le rêve vire au cauchemar
Elle pose des selfies
Enflamme les réseaux sociaux
Au bord d'une piscine
Elle n'a que la peau sur les os
Elle passe au zapping
Les chroniqueurs s'amusent pour le buzz, les tunes
Elle fait la une les seins nues
Elle perds le controle
Trop de phrase médiatique, devenue pathétique
Elle fait son marketing
Elle ne voit plus le jour, sa vie devient nocturne
Sa nouvelle vie l'a fait plongé dans la drogue dure
Et bien plus encore
C'est plus la même qu'avant:
Elle descend des bouteilles et avale des médicaments
Le showbiz l'a achevé
Dans son coin elle s'isole elle fini en HP, camisolée sous courtisone
La lumière s'éteint depuis qu'elle côtoient les ténèbres
Ses nuits sont blanches depuis
Qu'elle est devenue la reine des neiges
{Refrain: Soprano}
Elle était si jolie
Si naturel si mimi
Son petit grain de folie
Oui elle nous a tous rendu ding ding
Mais les coupures de presses
Les strass et les paillettes
Les drogues et les jour d'ivresse
L'ont totalement rendu ding ding
Aveugler par les projecteurs de ses rêves
Dans ses yeux je ne lis plus que des S.O.S
Que t'est il arrivé ma petite princesse?
Oh-ouh-oooh
{Pont: Soprano}
Oui que t'es-t'il arrivé?
On ne te reconnais plus
Mais ne vois-tu pas que tu te détruit à petit feu?
Le rêve ou la réalité?
On voit bien que t'es perdue
Petite princesse réveille toi
Car tu vaux beaucoup mieux
{Refrain: Soprano}
Elle était si jolie
Si naturel si mimi
Son petit grain de folie
Oui elle nous a tous rendu ding ding
Mais les coupures de presses
Les strass et les paillettes
Les drogues et les ivresses
L'ont totalement rendu ding ding
Aveugler par les projecteurs de ses rêves
Dans ses yeux je ne lis plus que des S.O.S
Que t'est il arrivé ma petite princesse?
Oh-ouh-ooohYou say I need prescribing
A dose of your company
But can you teach me what I wanna learn?
Can you give me what it is I yearn?
You say you'd like a chance
You say you'd like a second glance
And I say
Life breathes life
Life needs it
Oh, teach me how to breathe
And take me there
Oh I know I need to get away
Just discover what I won, gem, and have a play
But I've never needed anyone before
Aren't you sick of always giving more?
I might chew you up and spit you out, clenched fist
Are you willing to take that risk?
Oh yeah, life breathes life
Life needs it
Oh, teach me how to breathe
And take me thereJoe Exotic, breeds tigers and lions, chaotic
His obsession with Carol, psychotic 
Turns people gay 'cause he's got it 
It's hypnotic 
Joe Exotic
Big explosion
Competing with others, it's nasty 
Tight jeans on and his brace goes on lastly 
Dropping songs about Carol, it's ghastly
Did you say ghastly? 
Tiger lover
Breeds cubs for money, we discovered
Petting zoos, he ran for governor
Prince Albert to please his two husbands? 
What's up with him?
Carol
Hey, all you cool cats and kittens
Joe Exotic, breeds tigers and lions, chaotic
His obsession with Carol, psychotic 
Turns people gay 'cause he's got it 
It's hypnotic 
Joe ExoticComme une bouteille à la mer
Comme une bouteille à la mer
Je suis perdue, perdue
Les gens me jugent mais connaissent pas
Mes potos m'ont dit Sianna vas-y laisse les parler
Je me contrôle même dans une mauvais passe
En ce moment j'ai les nerfs mais t'inquiète ça va aller
Les pieds sur terre la tête dans l'espace
Les balles pleuvent sous un ciel dégagé
Dégagé, kalash est chargé
Si t'es en batterie faible poto tu vas charger
La rue est traitre comme mes ennemis
Ils ont dépassés les limites
Ouais faut que je les élimine mec
Ouais faut que je les élimine mec
Entre la vie et la mort y'a qu'un 9 millimètre
La vie ça te tue, ça t'torture
Mental d'acier à fini tordu
J'ai perdu des êtres chers et j'te parle pas de leur fortune
Je suis perdue, je vais où le vent m'amène
Oui comme une bouteille à la mer
Tu sais je vis au jour le jour
Mais la routine a fait que c'est la même toutes les semaines
Je sais pas ce que je vais faire aujourd'hui
Je sais pas ce que je vais faire de ma vie
Dans les histoires vagues je navigue
Je suis perdu comme une bouteille à la mer
Comme une bouteille à la mer, bouteille à la mer
Je suis perdue, perdue
Comme une bouteille à la mer, bouteille à la mer
Je suis perdue, perdue
Des problèmes plein la tête oui je pars en balade
La tess m'a rendu malade
J'cause du tort à la mama
J'ai du ma à dire ce que je ressens j'ai du seum en moi pas dans l'emballage
Le roi se pousse quand je rentre dans l'arène
La tess c'est mon château et sur le terrain je règne
Ouais sur le terrain je règne
J'accomplis mes rêves de gosse
J'oublie que je dois être une gosse de rêve
Ouais il faut que je me barre de là
Il est temps de sonner l'alarme
Marre de vivre sur le fil du rasoir
Faut qu'on se taille avant que le fasse la lame
Elle a peur que tu finisses tôlard
Car si elle pleure tout tes dollars, tout tes dollars, tout tes dollars
N'achèterons jamais jamais une seule larme
Je suis perdue je vais là où le vent m'amène
Oui comme une bouteille à la mer
Tu sais je vis au jour le jour
Mais la routine a fait que c'est la même toutes les semaines
Je sais pas ce que je vais faire aujourd'hui
Je sais pas ce que je vais faire de ma vie
Dans les histoires vagues, je navigue
Je suis perdu comme une bouteille à la mer
Comme une bouteille à la mer, bouteille à la mer
Je suis perdu, perdu
Comme une bouteille à la mer
Je suis perdue
Je suis perdue
Je suis perdu je vais là ou le vent m'amène
Oui comme une bouteille à la mer
Tu sais je vis au jour le jour
Mais la routine a fait que c'est la même toutes les semainesMind you mind me
You thought you could climb me
Well, sorry to cut your rope
In you I've lost all hope
Mind you mind me
I haven't seen you lately
Oh, how many times you still to phone
To see if your seed I could sow
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
Mind you mind me
I laugh at your transparency
You're my new best friend
Your fucked up life can I mend
Mind you mind me
How things can change in a good week
Call me ruthless
But you stretch the truth, oh yes
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
Believe me
I know you work insidiously
Believe me
I know you work insidiously
Believe me
I know you work insidiously
Believe me
I know you work insidiously
I know, yeah
Mind you mind me
You smile so sweetly
I'd call you an acquaintance
Stop with your exaggeration
Mind you mind me
I find it interesting to see
When I only offer you a smile
Oh how you forget to dial
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
I tell you if that's what you're about
Friends like you I can do without
If you can write a song, what would you write it about?
Uhm, I think I'd write about me
I did it!
You did it!People are talking, well that's nothing new
And some things will never change
Stories are turning away from the truth
But people will stay the same
It's only natural that we go on
To meet with the days that will come
It's only natural that we all carried forward
So step on, go on
Get rising like the morning sun
There's no need to take it to heart
There's no need to take it to heart
Only the truth can tear you apart
There's no need to take it to heart
Well stand tall and 
And don't let it get you down
Make them all feel 
But for you I will stand my ground
 Every time they turn the lights down
Just wanna go that extra mile for you
You got my display of affection
Feels like no one else in the room but you
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin', we keep on rockin'
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin', keep watchin'
Feels like the crowd is sayin'
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
The center of attention
Even when they're up against the wall
You got me in a crazy position
If you're on a mission, you got my permission
We can get down like there's no one around
We keep on rockin', we keep on rockin', rockin'
Cameras are flashin' while we're dirty dancin'
They keep watchin', keep watchin'
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme more
Gimme gimme more, gimme more, gimme gimme moreI'm me, I'm me
And that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me
Here's my vulnerability
I'm free
And you can't stop me
I'm free
And that's all I can be
Days pass
I'm trynna find who I really am
People don't like the way I dress, or where I am at
I dye my hair and it's not just vanity
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me
And that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me
Here's my vulnerability
I'm free
And you can't stop me
I'm free, I'm me
And that's all I can be
Night falls and I find it's here I am in peace
Making friends with spirits lost and it sets me free
Express myself
Cause it's my liberty
Your validation is just not that important to me
I'm me, I'm me
And that's all I can be
I'm me, I'm me
Here's my vulnerability
I'm free
And you can't stop me
I'm me, I'm free
And that's all I can be
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free, I am free
I am me, I am me, I am me
I am free, I am free
Ohhhhhhhhhh
Create yourself, redo yourself, renew yourself
Be you, do what you do
Hold your head up high, everything's gonna be alright
You're you, I'm me
Let's live in harmony
Coexist with each other, love each other
Be yourself, you have to be yourself
Be real, be honest
Cause ain't nobody got time for that, they really don't
So listen to me, listen to this song
'Cause this is real facts that will help you move along
Yeah
That's all I wanted to say so, I love you guys so much
Hope you like this song and you know, YOLO

Ahahahaعسل بانو، هنوزم پیش مایی
اگرچه دست تو
تو دست من نیست
هنوزم با توام
تا آخرین شعر
نگو وقتی
واسه عاشق شدن نیست
حالا هرجا که هستی، باورم کن
بدون با یاد تو، تنهاترینم
هنوزم زیر رگبارِ ترانه
کنار خاطرات تو می‌شینم
عسل بانو، عسل گیسو، عسل چشم
منو یاد خودم بنداز دوباره
بذار از ابر سنگین نگاهم
بازم بارون دلتنگی بباره
تو رفتی بی من، اما من دوباره
دارم از تو، برای تو می‌خونم
سکوت لحظه‌های تلخ رو بشکن
نذار اینجا، تک و تنها بمونم
عسل بانو، هنوزم پیش مایی
اگرچه دست تو
تو دست من نیست
هنوزم با توام
تا آخرین شعر
نگو وقتی
واسه عاشق شدن نیست
حالا هرجا که هستی، باورم کن
بدون با یاد تو، تنهاترینم
هنوزم زیر رگبارِ ترانه

تو رفتی بی من، اما من دوباره
دارم از تو، برای تو می‌خونم
سکوت لحظه‌های تلخ رو بشکن
نذار اینجا، تک و تنها بمونم
نذار اینجا، تک و تنها بمونمJudge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
It's such a terrible, terrible shame
You keep on judging me in his name
You're so quick to shift the focus
But you can find yourself in today's frame
But I know he'd approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
It's truly sad to see
You suffering so immensely, immensely
You need distracting
So you use me conveniently
But I know he'd approve
And I've nothing to prove to you
He smiles down on me lovingly
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
Judge me and feel free
Cause the freer you feel
The freer you'll let me be
Judge me
Feel free, feel free, feel freeCalled her on the telephone
You picked up, I shoulda known
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
You told me you had to go
You told me you'd be right home
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
What do you take me for?
You didn't think I'd smell her on you as you walked through the door
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
Last, this is the last time
You gotta get out, you aren't a man of mine
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Don't call me up, I won't be at home
Do not write, do not phone
I've had enough, you'll never know
You better pack your things and go
Don't tell me you're sorry
You shoulda thought of that
You shoulda that of me
We'll never be, never be
Listen here, you're dead to me, oh
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Who do you think you are?
You got a lot of nerve, you pushed me too far
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
Last chance, was just enough
She had a little metal thing, keep it zipped up
You couldn't make it through the night
Couldn't make it through the night
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right
Caught you red-handed
Your game is up
I will not stand it
I'm givin' up
Caught you red-handed
And you can never make it right

        J'ai surmonté les épreuves, j'ai surmonté les marches
J'ai côtoyé le bien malgré que j'a grandis dans le mal
Dans ce mil-milieux tout le monde veut le million
Dans mon barillo on se fait la guerre comme à Rio
Une vie d'enfer c'est pas un coin de paradis
N'écoute pas la bonne conscience, c'est elle qui te baratine
J'ai les idées noir, il faut que je les éradique
Sur le terrain je défend mes arrières un peu comme Verrati
T'as une dent contre moi désolé mais moi je suis pas dentiste
Tu vois la vie en couleur moi je la vois en négatif
J'suis saoulé par la vie non pas par la tise
Aucun remède à cette maladie qui peut soigner mes blessures
Le temps presse
Une chose est sûre on va pas s'en plaindre
Pour voir le beau temps faut surmonter la tempête
Ouais faut surmonter la tempête
Si j'écris ma vie, c'est pour pas perdre les mots
Je ferais le mou, quand j'aurais billets mauves
Si j'écris ma vie, c'est pour pas perdre les mots
Je ferais le mou, quand j'aurais billets mauves
On veut tous briller, ma terre a été pier
L'Afrique court à sa perte, toi tu cours après les billets
On veut de la monnaie, monnaie, monnaie
La tess nous connait, connait, connait
On veut s'en sortir, mais pour ça faut des billets, billets, billets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
On veut tous amasser des grosse sommes
Sans savoir où sa mène mais y a que sa qui nous console
On veut la recette maison planquée dans l'appart
Les flics derrière la porte et la on a trop le seum
Pisté par la bac c'est qu'un mauvais sort
Poto fini plaqué a sol
6 du mat voyou deviens voyelle des consonnes
Peur de se faire lever à l'aube mais XX par le soleil on finit à l'ombre
Tout ça pour des lovés, des lovés, des love
Mais dans la misère y a personne pour aidé l'autre
Dans la caille trop se sont égaré tire un trait sur ton passé si t'es mal barré
Sur la barré moi j'y pense sans arrêt mais faut attraper le taureau par les cornes pour sortir de l'arène
Si j'écris ma vie, c'est pour pas perdre les mots
Je ferais le mou, quand j'aurais billets mauves
Si j'écris ma vie, c'est pour pas perdre les mots
Je ferais le mou, quand j'aurais billets mauves
On veut tous briller, ma terre a été pier
L'Afrique court à sa perte, toi tu cours après les billets
On veut de la monnaie, monnaie, monnaie
La tess nous connait, connait, connait
On veut s'en sortir, mais pour ça faut des billets, billets, billets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
Billets violets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
Billets violets

Billets violets
On veut des billets, billets, billets
On veut des billets, billets, billetsJe crois que c'est l'heure
Je crois que c'est l'heure
Je crois que c'est l'heure, ouais
Il est temps qu'j'accélère
Toujours dans l'excès c'est pas de ma faute je suis trop rapide
Ramène tous tes rappeurs je vais les calmer comme une thérapie
Tu rap à coeur nu c'est vrai mais bon maintenant faut que tu te rhabille
T'as un tee-shirt Philip Plein sayer je vois tu joues les ratpis
Oh les gars l'heure est grave
On brûle pas les étapes on les crament
Tu crois me faire du sal mais c'est toi qui est crade
Joue pas les colonel tu vas en prendre pour ton grade
Bang bang
Je creuse l'écart, je t'enterre
Oui, a ta carrière, je compte y mettre un terme
La vie ne tient qu'à un string ficelle
Je compte pas faire dans la dentelle
Oooh, je suis innocente il fallait bien le prouver
Pas besoin d'avocat car seul dieu peut me juger
Tu veux percer je vais finir par te trouer
Pas de balles perdues elles sont toutes retrouvées
Choquée, choquée, choquée x4
J'arrive en bal, je sors du canon scier
Le rap game je l'ai repassé, plié
Etoile montante, destinée à briller
Tu vas finir en pièces à trop courir après les billets
Noyé dans le doute, tu vas plongé dans le gouffre
Je suis dans le sixbulbul, bloqué dans le hood
C'est la shnikov, tu va crier au secours
Meilleure de la news cool même en séchant les cours
Je les prend par surprise mais je fais pas de cadeau
XX
Etre numéro Uno c'est se mettre tout le monde à dos
Ok ok, l'instru est halal c'est normal je la saigne
Je les ai tous grail plus rien dans mon assiette
Je fou le bordel quand je monte sur la scène
Oooh, je suis innocente il fallait bien le prouver
Pas besoin d'avocat car seul dieu peut me juger
Tu veux percer je vais finir par te trouer
Pas de balles perdues elles sont toutes retrouvées
Choquée, choquée, choquée x4
Traumatisé, traumatisé, traumatisé
Je vais les traumatiserRashid:
Am ochi injectati de nesomn
Da' nu cumva sa adorm
Deci fa-mi cafeaua mai tare
Si-n loc de zahar pui sare
Azi e ultima zi
Vineri si vineri stii
Ca o sa fac un efort
Sa fac cumva sa suport
Opt ore de plictiseala
Job-ul asta ma omoara
Intru intr-o stare bizara
Unii i-ar spune oboseala
Da' n-o mai simt demult
Nu ma resimt prea mult
Strang din dinti si suier
Eu cand vreau sa fluier fluier

Byga:
Iar alerg, alerg, alerg
La cap ma leg ca n-am ce s-aleg
Din aceeasi rutina
Straina de-adrenalina
In trafic privesc in gol
E al 7-lea semafor
Claxon, bag a-ntaia, o tai
Si iara blocat pe linia de tramvai
Vad in retrovizoare
Chiar tot orasu-i la plimbare
Mii de roboti programati
Parca in timp si spatiu blocati
Nedormit de multe saptamani
Vreau oxigen urgent in plamani
Stii ceva? Pun ochelarii de soare
Si dau radiou' tare

Sunt epuizat
Cam de cand m-am maturizat
Iar ca zodiac sunt insomniac, timpu' se dilata
Parca nu mai trece odata
Cinci zile din sapte trag
Si n-am cum sa ma sustrag
Dac-o sa ma prabusesc
Macar ma descatusez
Bridge:
Reflexele ma parasesc
N-am chef sa gandesc, nu vreau decat sa evadez

Et j'oublie pas les moments tragiques
Ceux qui m'ont soutenu dans ma carrière, m'ont aidés à sauter les barrières
Des coups j'en ai pris des coups j'en ai donné
J'accumule les victoires, les défaites sans jamais abandonné
Moi j'suis là, moi j'suis là
Y'a trop de gens qui m'oppressent, ils parlent de moi mais faut qu'ils me laissent
Moi j'suis là, Moi j'suis làHan !
Yeah !
What's up ?
Yo !
What's up ?
Hé-hé !
Yo !
Envoyez vos prod' par centaines, j'les éclate avec ou sans thème
Depuis des années l'avenir est gris comme un re-noi sans crème
Les signes sont sous nos yeux mais on fait semblant de pas les cerner
Ils disent qu'ils nous ouvrent les portes, mais moi je pense qu'ils veulent les fermer
J'ai braqué le futur, en faisant comme si j'étais presque parfaite
J'bosse comme une chinoise pour pas que mon avenir ne soit pas un casse-tête
Yo chinoise c'est comment ? Faudrait qu'on se ravitaille
Dites-leurs que si ils font les fous je les grailles comme ça c'est radical !

Yo chinoise c'est comment ?

Je suis en pleine ascension, si tu veux me descendre : fais-le bien
Ils sont tous en beef, moi je me contente de faire le mien
J'essaye de faire le bien, et même quand tout va mal
En rappant dans mon district, j'ai rétréci Paname
On est télécommandés mais je crois que l'Etat manque de piles
J'ai la tête à Hong-Kong et j'ai écris ce texte à l'encre de Chine
J'ai mon avenir entre les mais donc je ne serre pas la tienne
Quand il s'agit de kicker, crois-moi : j'ai jamais la flemme !

J'ai mis les gaz, je te garantis que ça va péter
Prend les choses à cœur, c'est comme s'octroyer quelque chose qu'on t'a prêté
Pour la plupart, vous êtes mort dans le film comme Bruce Lee
J'espère que t'es riche si tu m'souhaite la mort à tout prix
Bosse comme une noise-chi pendant que toi tu parles chinois
J'ai trop d'actu' c'mois, toi tu sors tous les six mois
C'est tous des pâle  copie c'est pour ça que je les corriges
Je leur arrache les poils du torse à la Chuck Norris !Now I don't mind If you find
That I'm a shoulder to cry on, rely on
But the burden is just too much
I'm losing touch
With myself and my health
What you gonna do if you get me
I can heal your problems if you let me
What you gonna do if you get me
I can heal your problems if you let me
Now I don't keep you from your sleep
I need some ease
I'm tired of trying to please
And it seems that my dreams
Are coming farther and fewer in between

Cause I need an understanding
I'm tryna get my love together
It always starts off cool, but I can't ever take em serious
Don't wanna cuddle up with these niggas cause they ain't worth enough
They just a bullshit accessory
I'm tryna find someone who ain't tryna look better than me
But betters me
Ain't 1, 2, 3 steps ahead of me
All in the goddamn mirror tryna compare to me, naw
I'm so sick of inconsistencies
If your out there listening
5'10, brown skin, sum'tin round there
Soft heart
Strong hands
A good man
My man
Superman come and save me baby
Until then
I'm single as fuck
I can go where I want
But I'm sick of being lonely
I'm single as fuck
I can do what I want
But I'm sick of being lonely
I'm single as fuck
And this ain't something that I'm used too
I like it better with somebody there
Stargazing through the moon roof
Blue dream clouds everywhere
Someone to build up my self-esteem 
Cause I be over thinking everything 
I'm tryna find someone who ain't tryna look better than me
But betters me
Ain't 1, 2, 3 steps ahead of me
All in the goddamn mirror tryna compare to me, naw
I'm so sick of inconsistencies

I'm young and I'm having fun
But ain't nothin like having someone to hold me in the dark
And know the secrets of my heart
I'm young and I'm having fun

If you, if you're afraid of something that isn't there
Sometimes I do have fears
Shaking a bit, like I've seen ghosts or something
Sometimes I do have fears
Sometimes I do have fears
My mother's afraid of the subway
It's a living bad dream
I hold her hand as the doors close
And she pales and stifles a scream
Ali's afraid of ad-libbing
Of improvising at jams
She is not very happy right now
And spends all her money on grams
And Ade is afraid of commitment
So Carla dumped him today
She was very disappointed
She was hoping he'd beg her to stay
And Ayo he just wants a girlfriend
He's afraid of dying alone
But he doesn't go out very much
Sits at home a lot getting stoned
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
Ella is worried about her weight
She won't eat in public anymore
She is fucking her ex again
When they've finished she sleeps on the floor
Nate has a heart of gold
But give it away he will not
His mother abandoned him at ten
It's a pain he has never forgot
Mary's afraid of herself
Her sentences often cut half
She will never give her own opinion
She's afraid that people might laugh
And I am afraid of sharks
I will not swim out past my head
And sometimes I worry my boyfriend will die
My first love is already dead
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
Candy is having a baby
She fears she will be like her mom
Her friends say "relax, take a deep breath"
And march to a different drum
Sacha's afraid of her Marco
She thinks that it's all her fault
But if he did what he does to a stranger
He'd be locked up and charged with assault
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off track
You see fear is only holding us back, holding us back
There is usually one thing that keeps us off trackI won't give up, I won't give up
I won't give up, I won't give up
And another one bites the dust
Oh, why can I not conquer love?
And I might have thought that we were one
Wanted to fight this war without weapons
And I wanted it, I wanted it bad
But there were so many red flags
Now another one bites the dust
Yeah, let's be clear, I'll trust no one
You did not break me
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got an elastic heart
Yeah, I've got an elastic heart
And I will stay up through the night
Let's be clear, won't close my eyes
And I know that I can survive
I'll walk through fire to save my life
And I want it, I want my life so bad
I'm doing everything I can
Then another one bites the dust
It's hard to lose a chosen one
You did not break me 
I'm still fighting for peace
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heart
I've got a thick skin and an elastic heart
But your blade, it might be too sharp
I'm like a rubber band until you pull too hard
Yeah, I may snap and I move fast
But you won't see me fall apart
'Cause I've got an elastic heartCause I
I have nowhere left to hide
As I feel my soul relapse
As I’m left with no more pride
I feel to little
And think to much
Caught in the middle
Feeling out of touch
I feel to little
And think too much
Cause I’m at the ocean bed
Digging for who I am
To tell you I’m sorry
I know that you worry
Cause I’m at the ocean bed
Hoping that it won’t be the same
To tell you I’m sorry
I know that you worry
So I see the ocean catching fire
Feel mountains drop for miles
As I drown in who I am
I feel to little
And think to much
Caught in the middle
Feeling out of touch
I feel to little
And think too much
Cause I’m at the ocean bed
Digging for who I am
To tell you I’m sorry
I know that you worry
Cause I’m at the ocean bed
Hoping that it won’t be the same
To tell you I’m sorry
I know that you worry
Pain is stronger than pleasure
And hope is weaker than fear
It's depth is harder to measure
Hope is weaker than fearI eat food to satisfy my hunger
I drink water to quench my thirst
I use my mouth and air to blow balloon up
I prick with pin to watch it burst
To make noise I use my breath
To unlock doors I use a key
When I'm looking for something I use my eyes
I use booze to unlock me
I sweep so I can sleep
I sweep so I can sleep
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep
I wear shoes so I can run
As to avoid the broken glass
I wear the pants because they suit me
And to discourage the pinchin' of ass
I'll tell a joke to make you laugh
I'll close the door to have a cry
They say that change and pain is a positive thing
So have I changed since you died?
I sweep so I can sleep
I sweep so I can sleep
Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep Sweep
Don't ask me why I smoke, I don't know
But I drink to get drunk
Don't ask me why I smoke, I don't know
But I drink to get drunk
Don't ask me why I smoke, I don't know
But I, but I, but I drink to get drunk
Don't ask me why I smoke, I don't know
But I, but I, but I drink to get drunk
That noise again
That noise againTell her when it rains
I don't feel it
Tell her I'm to blame
Didn't see it
Winter's snows
Don't hide my woes
I can't lie to you
I tried to warn her that sometimes we fall in the dark
It's summer time
Singing Al Green in your car
Heading to a party
And the night air feels alive
Just sitting here
I'm waiting, oh yeah
And he's not by my side
Feeling dazed and I can't get him out
Stuck in yesterday
He don't know it
I rarely showed it
I can't lie to you
I tried to warn him that sometimes we fall in the dark
It's summer time
Singing Al Green in your car
Heading to a party
And the night air feels alive
But in my life
I never meant to cause no harm
Never hurt nobody
Just wanna take this chance to fly
On this summer night
But in my life
I never meant to cause no harm
Never hurt nobody
Just wanna take this chance to flyYou don't know me
You can't hold me
I'll slip through your hands
I am one single grain of sand
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
I'm an empty space
I can't be replaced
So when you're finished with this dream
Delete, begin to rewrite me
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
If that is all you need
You are free to love
Happily received
You are free to love
Delete and rewrite meLosing you is a winter's day
I confuse to state of play
And you can't make it stay
But I was wrong and I lost us again
I am sorry for the things I've done
Can you forgive me now you won
I'm on my knees
I can't stand losing you
Losing you
Losing you
Losing you is a broken glass
Losing you is a hollow laugh
Take girls' mistake and watch me grain
I can't get back the time you gained
I am sorry for the things I've done
Can you forgive me now you won
I'm on my knees
I can't stand losing you
Losing you
Losing you
I cannot blame you
If you want to shame me
I will still love you
If you need to hurt me
I hate apologies
For the tears and the lies
I will never love again
I will never love again
Losing you is acid burn
Losing you is miss a turn
Losing you has made me learn
A living rope for your return
I am sorry for the things I've done
Can you forgive me now you won
I'm on my knees
I can't stand losing you
Losing you
Losing you
Ohh....تو بارون که رفتی، شبم زیر و رو شد
یه بغضِ شکسته رفیقِ گلو شد
تو بارون که رفتی، دلِ باغ چه پژمرد
تمامِ وجودم توی آینه خط خورد
هنوز وقتی بارون تو کوچه می باره
دلم غصه داره، دلم بی قراره
نه شب عاشقانست، نه رویا قشنگه
دلم بی تو خونه، دلم بی تو تنگه
یه شب زیرِ بارون که چشمم به راهه
می بینم که کوچه پرِ نورِ ماهه
تو ماه منی که تو بارون رسیدی
امید منی تو شبِ نا امیدیJ'me sens incomprise, j'viens raconter mon mal-être en chantant
Écorchée vive, écorchée vive, mais personne me comprend
Personne me comprend
Solidaire mais solitaire car l'un n'empêche pas l'autre
À cause de certains problèmes je m'entête jusqu'à l'aube
J'ai vu des gens m'aimer vraiment et d'autres faire semblant
C'est cool de traîner sur les Champs, mais pas sans blé
À trop gueuler notre âge, est-c'qu'on s'entend ?
Pour mes proches et ma famille je souhaite la santé
J'ai un but dans la vie donc faut qu'j'reste dans la surface
J'vais y aller solo, éviter les mauvaises passes
J'fais comme si, mais en fait je n'suis pas sûre du tout
À l'heure y'a qu'une minerve, qui m'ferait tenir le coup
Comment veux-tu monter, quand on t'fait des coups bas ?
Noire donc souvent coupable, t'inquiète bientôt j'suis tout-par
À seize piges j'savais déjà c'que j'voulais devenir
Sans jamais l'avoir vue, un jour j'espère qu'elle va revenir
Tu m'vois comme ça, mais j'cache ma peine depuis tant d'années
Inculpée pour incompréhension, dix-huit ans j'fus condamnée
J'me sens incomprise, j'viens raconter mon mal-être en chantant
J'me sens incomprise, j'appelle à l'aide mais personne ne m'entend
Écorchée vive, écorchée vive, mais personne me comprend
Personne me comprend
J'garde toujours une âme de vainqueur quand la coupe est pleine
Comment veux-tu atteindre le sommet avec une courte échelle ?
J'me pose plein d'questions, j'ai plein d'impressions
J'suis grave sincère, suis-je en train d'faire un vrai son ?
J'rappe même plus, et non je parle mon texte
Pour ne pas être nostalgique bah je garde les restes
J'suis pleine de vie, pleine d'amour, et de convictions
On m'propose des plans et moi j'impose mes conditions
La tête sur les épaules, et puis les pieds sur Terre
Y'a des erreurs qu'j'ai su éviter, d'autres que j'ai su faire
Je sais d'où j'viens, et ça jamais je n'l'oublierai
Je serai fière de mon teint, et ça peu importe où j'irai
J'ai l'Afrique dans mes gênes, peu importe si ça les gène
J'vous connais pas mais j'suis fière d'avoir votre sang dans mes gênes
Que Dieu m'pardonne mes erreurs et mon passé
Aujourd'hui j'me dois d'construire un futur presque parfait
 Got to go
Got to let this feeling flow
High and gold
Hiding from my self-control
I can't let this cocaine kiss
Take me into serenity
I don't need it, don't want it
Taking all of my sanity
Will I ever get it back again?
A certain taste of soul and chemicals
Of soul and chemicals
Of soul and chemicals
If I think that this will grow
I will open up and tell you more
Cause the uneasy in my heart
It might tear up everything I have
I can't let this cocaine kiss
Take me into serenity
I don't need it, don't want it
Taking all of my sanity
Will I ever get it back again?
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain taste of soul and chemicals
Of soul and chemicals
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain shade of soul and chemicals
High and gold
Lost all of my self-control
With a restless soul I stand
Relentless of my shaking hands
I got it, don't sweat it
I'm dancing in serenity
I need it, I crave it
Eating all of my sanity
Oh, will I ever get it back again?
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain taste of soul and chemicals
Of soul and chemicals
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain taste of soul and chemicals
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain taste of soul and chemicals
Of soul and chemicals
Commit another sin, take it from within
This is what you do to me, this is who I am
A certain taste of soul and chemicalsI told a lie, my guts are tight
I know I gotta come clean or I won't sleep tonight, yeah
I told a fib, just fell outta my lips
Don't wanna be that kid 'cause I was scared of something, oh
I'm in trouble, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh 
I'm in trouble 
I'm in trouble 
Yeah, I told a lie, my guts are tight
I looked you straight in the eye and I could tell you know
I was on the spot but I gave it a shot
But I know you know, I know you know
I'm in trouble, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh, yeah, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh 
I'm in trouble 
I'm in trouble 
I'm begging you please, take pity on me
I know it was wrong, that lie just fell outta me, oh
I told a lie and I feel so mean
And so here I am trying to come clean
I'm in trouble, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh, oh, oh, oh 
I'm in trouble, oh 
Am I in trouble? 
Am I in trouble? 
Am I in trouble?
Am I in trouble?I never thought a man could sink
The heart of a coward will never sleep
I fill my lungs into this beat
With closed eyes we’re hoping for remedy
Shattered not broken
We stand our feet
Houses rebuild on
These bloody streets
I fill my lungs into this beat
With closed eyes we’re hoping for remedy
And in this world
We’re nothing but animals
With blood they paint the broken streets
The houses we build we will never see
They burned the hopes of all the free
The heart of a coward - he was the thief
Shattered not broken
We stand our feet
Houses rebuild on
These bloody streets
I fill my lungs into this beat
With closed eyes we’re hoping for remedy
And in this world
We’re nothing but animals
It takes a killer
That thinks he’s a saint
It takes believing
To be this insaneFor the AM, for the FM
For the Am, for the FM
Yeah, Yeshua Da PoED,  Siah
Bout to set it like this, what
Physical angelic being, Yeshua the Po ED in
The process of freein minds from all the nonsense
Ejected but unperfected rhymes design
My self-elected MCs who thought they wrecked it it's time to
Really get down to the writin before recitin
Tryinto frighten is cool but not excitin a fool from writin
We be lightin on mics in unison
We meant the Nutramint the lip pours I get looser than big draws
More tits removin bras usin raw metaphors
In twos and fours when I get mines
That means you're losin yours,no 
See I'm the best in sexin a chicks 
 hoards his reflection 
But vocal chords pour in form of rhymes
Metaphors are tickets for trips through my mind
I freak first class seats over beats through my horizon
I've been awaitin lovely from last weeks arrivin
The process repeats, got lines for signin
Vibin off my rhymin, describin, live in
Detail is when we prevail and the frail MC's derail
Also leads up to girls even wet
Like I left the toilet seat up
So brother eat up...eat up...
Yeah, we're doin this for everybody
It's the Visualz
In case you didn't know
I'm gonna tell you who you're seein right now...
Yo, this is who you're seein
Yeshua Da PoED and I'm Siah
Here to take you higher than you ever been
Ideas accumulatin but my mind's constipated
Peels release the skills in the rhymes activated 
I quote the  to feel the rap click the weeds I whack
Siah so the seeds I feed to flow through the track
To your mental, I could beat a batter like a baker
Bring in the sweet and sour dough
Inside I gather words the herbs scatter
Raise cadavers crews skedaddle rhymes befuddle
While I pedal over puddles like Atlantic
Then I get specific, and heads be gettin frantic
Pause for a second and you're stranded
Reckon I been wreckin to rock the mic steppin aside
Be the fire see Siah leaves crews passed out like fliers
I'll take you higher than a reverend ever been
Feedin off of heads cause my bretheren be clever, and
My continent is the east Asiatic
Complex grammatic consonants cling like static
To concepts, this is flourescent manifested
All the while I live within a black and white context
It's like that, what
Yo, this is who you're seein
Yeshua Da PoED and I'm Siah
Here to take you higher than you ever beenYou thought that you got the last laugh baby
But look who's laughing now
Yeah look who's laughing nowI'm in the wars
Can't speak for crying
Close all the doors
Since I am dying
Pick up the phone
Attempt to call her
I'm all alone
Until she answers
Momentarily, she brings peace to me
Momentarily, she brings peace to me
She barely speaks
But I hear her breathing
And that's all I need
Someone who's listening
And still she stays
Her time is precious
Until I am safe
She gives her presence
Momentarily, she brings peace to me
Momentarily, she brings peace to me
Momentarily, she brings peace to me
Momentarily, she brings peace to meتو عاشق نبودی که درد دل عاشقا رو بفهمی
تو بارون نموندی که دل‌گیری این هوا رو بفهمی
تو گریه نکردی برای کسی تا بدونی چی می‌گم

پریشون نبودی که نگذشتن لحظه‌ها رو بفهمی

تو عاشق نبودی که درد دل عاشقا رو بفهمی

Dites leur que j'suis de retour sans jamais vraiment être parti
Je leur ai déjà mis deux tours pour eux c'est le début de la partie
Plus d'un flow sous ma chapka
Je les tue tous après basta
Quand je joue j'suis toujours 2-2 comme Yatabaré à Bastia
Quand t'as plus rien à perdre j'peux te dire que t'es prêt à tout miser
Depuis mon arrivée je vois que tout leurs rêves sont brisés
Ma lame j'suis venu l'aiguiser
Je suis venu déclassé l'Elysée
J'ferai pas tout ce que vous désirez, yo si tu fais le malin t'es viré
Tu seras jamais des notres et ça copine il va falloir t'y faire
Je rappais déjà comme pas permis bien avant d'avoir le mis-per
J'ai arrêté l'école mais j'peux te dire que tout les jours j'en apprend
Et vu que je me fais chier dans ce Rap Game, j'viens lever le niveau d'un cran

Premier EP personne n'est près
Dans le business personne ne m'effraie
Je les écoute rapper ça fait pas d'effet
Pendant que moi j'fais des tubes sans faire exprès
Tu cris partout que t'as le bras long, mais t'es manchot quand faut khalass
En mode ruskov j'passe le salam, en débitant à la vitesse d'une kalash
Alright c'est quoi le plan ? Si ça  parle  pas money  moi j'ai pas le temps man
J'ai pas le temps, j'ai pas le temps, écoutez vos délires chelou moi j'suis pas dedans
Prévenez j'ai encore plus d'un flow à vous révéler
C'est merveilleux quand je vois que vous kiffez mes sons allez y les gars saignez les
Laissez moi dans mon monde, j'fais confiance qu'à mon nom
Mon but sera atteint seulement le jour où j'aurai une baraque à mon nom
On arrive, on fout le del-bor et puis on repart
J'suis noir mais t'inquiète le jour de la paye j'serai pas en retard
Une nuit entière au studio pour pouvoir progresser
Même sans autothune je leur fait trop d'effet
Trop de gens comptent sur moi j'me sens trop oppressé
Tout le monde dit que je vais cé-per mais j'suis pas trop pressé
J'crois qu'ils ont validé mon flow depuis que j'ai sorti "kick off"

Mi sono, mi sono, mi sonoتو که بارونو ندیدی، گل ابرا رو نچیدی
گله از خیسی جاده های غربت می کنی
تو که خوابی تو که بیدار
تو که مستی تو که هوشیار
لحظه های شبو با ستاره قسمت می کنی
منو بشناس که همیشه نقش غصم روی شیشه
منه خشکیده درخت توی بطن باغ و بیشه
جاده های بی سوار و سال گنگ بی بهارو
تو ندیدی، به پشیزی نگرفتی دل مارو
تو که بارونو ندیدی، گل ابرا رو نچیدی
گله از خیسی جاده های غربت می کنی
تو که خوابی تو که بیدار
تو که مستی تو که هوشیار
لحظه های شبو با ستاره قسمت می کنی
لحظه های تلخ غربت
هفته های بی مروت
تو نبودی که ببینی شب تار انتظارو
همه قصه هام تو هستی، لحظه لحظه هام تو هستی
تو خیالم، توی خوابم، پا به پام بازم تو هستی
منو بشناس که همیشه نقش غصم روی شیشه

Then you’re never gonna get to your heart
Put 'em back together, side by side
And your feet will be back on the ground
We're more than just two feathers
’Cause together we can fly
But these wings are broken
And there's no reason why
One day maybe we'll get it
It's gonna take some time
All that we had chosen
Is being left behind
And all my senses are so defenseless
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Then you're never gonna get to your heart
Put 'em back together, side by side
And your feet will be back on the ground
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Then you’re never gonna get to your heart
Put ’em back together, side by side
And your feet will be back on the ground
Who knows if this is better?
Don't tell me that it’s fine
Words that are not spoken
Ain't doing any harm
Whenever and wherever
Despite this wounded heart
With my arms wide open
You know I can be found
And all my senses are so defenseless
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Then you're never gonna get to your heart
Put ’em back together, side by side
And your feet will be back on the ground
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Then you're never gonna get to your heart
Put 'em back together, side by side
And your feet will be back on the ground
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Put 'em back together
Put 'em back together
If you're down, stuck in your mind
Put 'em back together
Put 'em back togetherYo négro c'est comment ?

J'viens leur montrer que j'fais la différence
J'me fous de ce que vous sortez tant que moi mon biff il rentre
J'me dois de faire du lourd et respecter mon ego
J'arrive en soirée solo et j'repars aux bras de ton négro
Le beat j'le monopolise, crois pas que je joue au monopoly
J'viens refaire ton anatomie, gros vas y appelle la police
Très peu de rappeurs, beaucoup de choristes
Les jeunes maintenant pensent plus qu'au biff
On sait pas qui sont les fautistes mais on sait qui sont les grossistes
Les les les négros ont la colique, à deux doigts de devenir alcoolique
De mourir à bord d'un bolide
Moi j'ai que mon rap comme brolic
Les les les négros frisent la folie
Moi au mic j'suis hermaphrodite
Je sais bien que j'te l'ai trop dit mais j'ai que Sagna comme acolyte
Yo négro c'est comment ?

J'prends place derrière le micro, j'viens leur montrer qu'on sait kicker
Tu pronnonces souvent mon blaze, perso j'sais même pas qui t'es
J'viens me faire un nom dans le peu-ra, effacer les autres
T'es qu'une baltringue, c'est jamais toi c'est toujours les autres
Toi t'es dans le passé, moi mon avenir est tracé
Donc me racontes pas ce que t'as fais, quand j'prends le cro-mi tu restes assis
Le rap m'a lassé, là j'suis en train de me faire masser
Je rappe et puis je t'entends tousser donc gros rends toi à la pharmacie
Qualité, lourdeur, mon rap c'est du deux en un
Les rappeurs bluffent comme un manchot qui dit : "J'viens prendre les choses en mains"
Le savoir est une arme, t'as le cerveau dans les douilles
J'ai su que le Diable avait des cornes donc j'ai pris le taureau par les couilles
J'vois que tu patientes mais est ce que tu sais ce qu'il t'attend ?
Tu cours après l'argent, moi j'garde mon souffle pour ves-qui Satan
Je m'occupes même pas de vous, j'écoutes même pas vos propos
Grandes gueules petits bras, vous êtes des fucking crocos
Négro qu'est ce qui t'arrive ? Tu fais le fou on ramène Sarif
Et après on ramène la miff et tu verras qu'on fait la diff
On viendra le jour de ton anniv, ouais t'inquiète on sait où t'habites

Question d'respect gros même si tu connais pas tu check
Ouais c'est comment ? Où sont passés les kickeurs

درایِ قلبتو وا کن

من چه کردم با دل تو؟
کاشکی تو لحظه‌ی آخر
عشقو تو نگاهم می‌خوندی
قلبِ تو صدامو نشنید
رفتی با غریبه موندی
اگه یک روز
بگم از این حکایت
که به تو کردم عادت
دلم پیشِ دلت مونده
تو زندونِ رفاقت
اگه یک شب
برسم به حقایق

Yes, you can take that to heart
It was meant to sit close to the bone anyway
You can make it a big issue
Make it a battle of your own and that's ok
You can feign a distant familiarity
Say you understand the similarity
Think you see me with great clarity
But you're actually not necessarily
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
Yes, you can call that a start
It was meant to begin kind of slow anyway
Yes, your deceit is an art
I knew you would sink kind of low anyway
You say you have the best intentions
You fill me with fickle suggestions
Logic is fired by inventions
But your concern is much more than you mention
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly know
You say you're in my situation
You say you've been confused by my complication
You think my soul makes negotiation
But you don't see my hesitation
Only if you steal my shadow, will you truly knowOk, en vrai j'crois que j'suis dopé
Dans le milieu rien que ça parle, j'vais finir par tous les bloquer
J'vais finir par tous les choquer, mon flow ils veulent tous le choper
J'viens tout liquider, négro t'es pas prêt pour tout ce que j'ai stocké
Beauvais ouais c'est l'adresse
On est les best et ça tu l'attestes
Mon gars j'crois que t'as perdu la tête
T'as rien à envier mais tu te la pètes
J'connais peu de rappeurs avec un bon CV
Car la plupart connaissent pas le procédé
Ils sont obsédés ils sont possédés
On roule en cosmer, toi tu roules en OCB
On me dit : "Sianna c'est quoi la suite ? On a besoin de toi prends pas la fuite"
"Ah ouais elle rappe pas mal la petite", c'est ce que j'entends dire dans la street
Bienvenue dans le six bull, bienvenue dans le six bull
Chez nous on aime les grosses sommes avec plein de chiffres avant la virgule

Han ! Moi j'fais que des passe-dé
J'suis pas comme toutes ces tasses-pé
Mais j'sais qu'avec de grosses punchlines, j'peux tous les faire fantasmer
Yo j'fais le boulot sans taffer, toi dis moi qu'est ce que t'as fais ?
Toujours à-l, posé j'cuisine mon flow presque parfait
Arrêtez les blablas, yo arrêtez de parler pour nada
Dites leur que pour faire des sons diaboliques on s'habillera pas en prada
 sur le shorty, wize & Ope sur la casquette
Vu le nombres de paires que j'ai, négro je n'peux qu'être bien dans mes basket
Emmêlé dans la mêlée on met le paquet
J'suis alaise comme Lebron sur un parquet
Mon son dans toute la France, tous les quartiers
Depuis le début je leur dis qu'ils sont pas prêts
Poto si tu fais le fou saches que je risquerai de me fâcher
Gros mollard sur le beat, ça c'est du Sianna tout craché
On me dit : "Sianna c'est quoi la suite ? On a besoin de toi prends pas la fuite"
"Ah ouais elle rappe pas mal la petite", c'est ce que j'entends dire dans la street

Seems like life is just too much for you
Finally, you've been brought to your knees
Finding no relief that you desperately need
Until then lean on me, friend
Boy, let me love you
'Cause I will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Boy, let me love you
I know your demons
I'm not afraid of your personal hell
Boy, let me love you
And will love you
Until you learn to love yourself
Boy, let me love you
A heart of darkness
That's brought to life
I'll take you thereCu show-ul cel mai carismatic
Ne-ntelegem telepatic
E party salbatic, ostatic, tati
Mereu de veghe pe rap, nu pe reggae
N-avem pereche, da' stii c-avem ureche
Scoala veche, staif, baietii
Te dau din tobe cu capu' de toti peretii
E scandal vandal cu jandarm
La cat sarm am, sclipesc in vacarm
2-10 plus 2-10 e 24
Vreau exact cantitatea care sa-mi rupa capu'
Pub-uri, cluburi, show-uri, drumuri
Struguri si muguri, vinuri si fumuri
La o parte, frate ca simt nevoia
Sa-mi dau peste fata, altfel ma ia paranoia
La o parte, frate ca simt nevoia
Sa-mi dau peste fata, altfel ma ia paranoia
24 de ore cu daune majore sunt aici, indiferent de sezon
24 de ore grijile sunt minore, le-amanam pentru extrasezon
24 de ore cu daune majore sunt aici, indiferent de sezon
24 de ore grijile sunt minore, le-amanam pentru extrasezon
Zi-mi Rashid, vindec prin sunet ca samanii
Voi aruncati cu banii ca beat-ul suna arab money
Detonez bombe-n club, dau cu sub bass
Vin din sud, sa v-aud care are hazz
Sa curga alcool in valuri
Ce-avem in punga sa arda prin baruri
Ridici mana stanga, dreapta-i ocupata
Vezi cine-i pe langa si bea apa plata
24 din 24, 7 din 7 vrem
Acelasi anturaj, alta zi, alta noapte e
Un fel de lungmetraj cu si despre depravare
Cu pahare, sticle goale si plante ilegale
Atunci cand soarele rasare tu devii sedentar
Eu imi pun ochelari de soare si o ard superstar
Vezi tu, dupa show, raman in club doar eu
Ca dupa afterparty vine afterhour, bro
La o parte, frate ca simt nevoia

24 de ore cu daune majore sunt aici, indiferent de sezon
24 de ore grijile sunt minore, le-amanam pentru extrasezon
E panica atunci cand intervin
Sar banii, ca stiu sa rulez fin
E BB King, nu BB Queen
Byga e "Mustapha Ibrahim"
Uite-ma cum pierd noptile cu toti nebunii
Teleghidat de apetit si de lumina lunii
Imi zice Philahimovic, amice, nu Zlatan
Flancat de Hash ce-nvarte planta pe platan
N-am cum sa trec neobservat, sunt hamesit
Cot la cot cu Hennesy si cu Jack in Tennessee
Ridic o mana-n aer pentru brigazile din tara
Care traiesc la fel si isi fac viata usoara
La o parte, frate ca simt nevoia

J’rappe partout dans l’monde tu comprends pas c’qu’il s’passe
L’album est fini, j’le balance d’ici peu
Va l’chercher poto, ne me déçois pas
Ça s’voit qu’l’équipe adverse n’est pas ien-b
J’suis avec les frérots du Bayern
Ils s’disent “putain la petite elle est loin
Pourtant elle n’en a pas l’air”
En vrai j’crois qu’j’mérite le ballon d’or
Cette année j’me suis baladée
J’ai cassé des reins oui j’ai des remords
La concurrence a mal au dos
J’amène du chaud quand c’est la Sibérie
Tu veux être le meilleur, mais est-c’que tu l’mérites ?
Demande à Ribéry c’est là c’était terrible
Prévois ton parapluie, j’créé des intempéries
T’as sous-estimé maintenant t’es qué-cho
Tu m’adresses la parole pour demander quelqu’chose
Un milliard de problème à m’en tirer les cheveux
À l’allure où ça va j’crois qu’j’vais finir chauve
Fais-moi la passe, poto démarque-toi
J’ai l’flow, la classe, Mehdi Benatia
Demande à Alaba comment c’est à la base
J’ai déjà fini le livre, t’as pas tourné la page
Si vous m’cherchez sur Google Maps
J’suis en Allemagne et j’vous passe le Guten Tag
Si vous m’cherchez sur Google Maps
J’suis en Allemagne et j’vous passe le Guten Tag
J’crois qu’la Mannschaft m’appelle
Maintenant appelle-moi Sianna Merkel
J’crois qu’la Mannschaft m’appelle
Maintenant appelle-moi Sianna Merkel
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
On les laisse derrière on les a dépassés
J’paye pas d’mine mon avenir est tracé
Mouille le maillot pour ne pas être à sec
Tu me vois sur ta route faut nous laisser passer
On débarque dans la mêlée j’ai la Mannschaft dans l’dos
Laisse beaucoup d’MCs dans l’doute, mental à la Django
My nigga c’est comme ça qu’ça s’passe dans l’hood
Ok, j’suis lancée, ça y est j’suis dans les starts
Nan, j’fais pas partie des stars
J’suis plutôt discrète donc j’reste à l’écart
Ça t’regarde pas, dis-moi pourquoi ler-par
Ça t’embrouille pour un simple regard
Cartes sur table, ils attendent ton flop
Pour te retrouver à la case départ
Augmente le volume, fais ronronner les basses
En c’moment je suis off parc’que tout l’monde m’agace
Demande à mon gars Gas, on a déjà mis les gaz
Fuck le succès, les strass, on est déjà dans l’espace
Toujours bien sappée, première de la classe
Y’a qu’dans un parking que t’auras ma place
T’écouter rapper provoque de l’asthme
Et vos couplets ratés ouais en vrai ça me lasse
Si vous m’cherchez sur Google Maps
J’suis en Allemagne et j’vous passe le Guten Tag
Si vous m’cherchez sur Google Maps
J’suis en Allemagne et j’vous passe le Guten Tag
J’crois qu’la Mannschaft m’appelle
Maintenant appelle-moi Sianna Merkel
J’crois qu’la Mannschaft m’appelle

À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dich
À tous les rageux
Ich liebe dich, ich, ich liebe dichN-n-n-n-aveai nimic de pierdut, erai la început
Şi trăgeai tot mai mult ca să ai şi mai mult
Spuneai "Sunt gata să lupt. "
Te luptai cu principii, toate mori de vânt
Nu cer mai mult decât sunt
Am talent şi carismă, am promis că m-arunc
În gol, după faimă şi bani
Concerte şi fani;
Trag să ajung să zbor deasupra lor
N-am trecut, doar prezent, privesc spre viitor
Mult mai uşor, acum toate s-au dus, grijile nu-s
Văd la televizor, iau în râs sărăcia, privesc România de sus
Mai am multe de spus sau de dovedit
Am ajuns unde-am vrut, cunoscut şi iubit
Am auzit că limita-i cerul şi-am zis "Fără limite"
Am cheltuit, m-am rugat, am băut şi-am trăit orice zi fără limite;
Ísta sunt eu, nu pot fi oprit de nimic, practic n-am limite
Acum lumea-i a mea şi pare prea mică, sunt gata să rup orice limite
 x2
Trăieşti fără limite
Când nimeni nu tre' şi nu poate să ajungă să te imite
Eşti tu cu ale tale, ei tot cu ale tale, vezi? Totul se permite
Crezi că n-ai probleme când ca aliment ai doar laude primite?
Oare-oglinda te minte
Ori tu, chiar pe tine, nu te mai ţii minte?
Prieteni, tovarăşi, fraţi, familie, atâte-amintiri
Îngerul tău păzitor ce păzeşte când tu peste tot eşti înconjurat doar de vampiri
Cât de sadic te perie, câţi experţi în materie te-atrag în mizerie
Dar te fac să crezi că eşti zeu, iar acum nimic nu te mai sperie
Când tragi, ajungi; când ai, arunci;
Când urci, aluneci; atunci să fugi
Pluteşti în derivă, fără perspectivă
Nici iniţiativă - eşti gata!
Revino-ntre noi, între muritori
Între oamenii simpli, necazuri, nevoi
Încearcă şi caută cumva să-ţi primeşti şi pacea-napoi
 x2
"Sunt deasupra lumii acum, nimic nu poate să mă atingă, sunt aici sus şi trebuie doar să
Priveşti în sus ca să mă vezi. "I've been away, I had a day in sorrow
I will return tired and somber tomorrow
I've had a sleep on this grey beach in my head
Now here's the sun, warms us, began ignite it
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
To you
So now I'm back to the long track, you broke me
Came to the end, made a new friend, she woke me
I carried this weight, tried to negate the rainbows
What's your success, amazing how quick the pain goes
Now there's rainbows
Now there's rainbows
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
To you
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
To you
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
I am happy to return
To youBaby I was born to shake it
Baby I was born to run
Come now, I wanna get naked
Let me out, into the sun
I'm on the hunt for loving
I'm on the prowl for life
I want somethingThere’s been a terrible drought
It's been too cold to get out
I needed to scream and shout
But it’s over now, it’s over now
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
And here you are holding my hand
Here by you I’ll always stand
It’s raining its pouring love
Warm drops of joy fall from above. Above!
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
Yeah I’m getting lucky tonight
I'm getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
Yeah I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
I’m getting lucky tonight
And so are youRashid:
Ca vorbim de Tudor Gheorghe, Balaci sau Amza Pelea
Rashid, Byga, Mutu, Phila, MCA sau Alex Velea
Simtim la fel, gandim la fel, traim la fel
Avem acelasi sange, acelasi vis, acelasi tel
Noi am deschis un drum interzis pana acum
Nu iese fum fara foc da' nici foc fara fum
Aveti in fata o noua generatie, in strada pentru natie
Un nou punct de atractie
Monden, nu, in nici un caz, aici nu cer
Sa se mute Prada, Richmond sau Dior in cartier
Nu cer masini, le avem deja pe toate aici
De la Dacii ruginite pana la Bmw seria 5
"Dolla dolla million", asta vrem sa avem
S-aruncam industria muzicala in aer cu tot cu sistem
Cu tot cu CNA, cu toate curvele din presa
Atentie copii puteti gasi olteni pe piesa
Mutu:
Noi ne pastram credinta in inimi langa Stiinta
Si sangele fierbinte din Lapus in Craiovita
Iesim din cartiere in zgomot de mortiere
Mirosu' de asfalt si bassu' in portiere
Perfectu' e prea simplu aici, deci ne bucuram de defecte
Suntem deja prea multi chiar daca nimeni nu ne vede
C. I. A. , Mutu, Viollent si MCA
C-avem ce arata si raspundem ca RCA
De aici in 10 ani vom fi tot aici nu pentru bani
Nici pentru fani, nici pentru p***, ca le avem deja
Si daca muzica ne facem sa spunem ce simtim
O sa cantam si fara bani, asta conteaza prea putin
Dar e nevoie si de asta intelege
Ca fara apreciere nu poti face sa se lege
Macar doua cuvinte, ce sufletul le simte
Daca eu iti dau ce simt sa cumpere cine simte!
Phila:
N-am nimic cu Bucurestiu', acolo se-ntampla tot
Insa, o singura chestie nu halesc deloc
Suferinte gen "****, noi suntem din capitala"
Cand toti va trageti din neamuri de undeva din tara
Intrebati-va parintii, sigur nu se dezic
Asta daca nu le-a fost ciobanu' Bucur strabunic
Si chiar si-asa, hai sa dam mana cu mana
Desi, tot parca seaman-a dinastie de stana
Hoo, ma ca glumeam, stiu ca acum zambesti
Da' mai patimasi si patrioti ca noi n-o sa gasesti
Tot ce-auzi facem cu drag si zau ca are haz
Si ne e lejer, c-o durere maxima-n praz
Aici chiar e hip-hop, asculta, nu deliram
Fara influentze grave, mereu ne reinventam
Pana si judetu' e element indiscutabil
Cu mii de DJ inmatriculati in carosabil!
MCA:
Suntem olteni adica suntem multi
Osteni gata sa mute munti, gusteri sar sprinteni da-s mult prea muti
S-ar tripa dar cad pe rand pierduti
Las' ca-s demult tinuti in cuib multi pe baricade dati disparuti
Scuip ascuns printre betoane intr-o metropola ce sare
Din tipare, muzica sacra ce cade greu in timpane
Spui ca sunt taran priveste in dotare
Am bate, seceri, coase, baieti cu priviri brutale
Sunt vremuri grele noi avem zile cu soare
Acelasi sange in vene vere provincie latina nemuritoare
Condusi la razboi, decimand zeci de armate
Vegheati de Mihai, Arghezi si vocea lui Tudor in spate
Deci lupta taras pe coate cu truda suporta forte brute
Dau pace din valcea pana in rovine oricarei redute
Dau gloante de avertisment fugi, du-te, fereste-te
O ardem ca la Craiova "gen" vrei sa ne opresti? Opreste-te!
Byga:
Hip-hopu' n-a murit, intre noi doar fie vorba
S-a mutat mai hacana, ia ghici unde? la Craiova
Febra Sudului contamineaza tara
Cu flow-uri ametitoare-n cascade ca Niagara
Nu seamana a nimic, suna putin altfel
Orice rima, orice beat, suna putin altfel
Pentru ca suntem aparte, insa ne vezi peste tot
Si ne recunosti usor, dupa vorba, dupa port
Din zeci de mii de inimi ce tuna pe Oblemenco
Venim in pas allegro mai spontani ca trupa Deko
Zburdam pe orice tempo, aroma a la Prazilia
Cu Proxima Evita, ViolLent, ori La Familia
Avem oltencele fiebinti ca zilele lungi ale verii
Noptile nebune-cu picaturile reci ale berii
Iti luam ceasu' de la mana, nu vezi nimic inapoi
Ca de-acum ora exacta se da numai la noi!I'm sorry mamma
I'm not the man you thought I was
Either a liar
Or just a rebel without cause
I'm gonna be protected
Never gonna burn again with fire
I'm gonna be protected
Never gonna burn again with fire
I'm sorry mamma
I'm not the man you thought I was
Either a liar
Or just a rebel without cause
Stop the drama
I'm doing business on my own
"Go get 'em tiger!"
Release the pressure on my bones
I'm gonna be protected
Never gonna burn again with fire
I'm gonna be protected
Never gonna burn again with fire
I don't need to be protected
I'm gonna be protected
I don't need to be protected
I'm gonna be protected
I don't need to be protected
I'm gonna be protectedImi plac oamenii simpli, nu sunt sofisticat
Am cautat un anturaj ce imi cade ca turnat
Inca sunt cel mai mare fan hip-hop, inca dau din cap
Inca sunt aici, deci nu ati scapat de mine inca
N'am plecat, sunt tot in studio
Asta e inca un album ce nu intra pe radio
Nu ma incanta da' inca pot sa rad mereu
Soarele va rasari intr-un final pe cerul meu
Inca la prima dragoste, suna ciudat
E al dracu' de bine sa fii barbat
Inca n'am un loc stabil de munca
Inca invat despre vata, nu stiu cu ce se mananca
Spun ca'i scumpa, da' imi place sa traiesc
Inca mai iubesc mancarea cu specific romanesc
Inca mai gasesc minuni ce m-I se intampla
Sunt inca un naiv aici, incurabil inca
Evadeaza pentru cateva secunde
Conteaza doar ce ai cand ai de unde
Pai de unde? n-ai de unde
Dar prefer sa fii aici cand ai putea sa fii oriunde 
Sunt tot acelasi Phila, tot cu ale mele
Ca tot romanul ma strecor printer belele
Le evit in slalom, invat din mers
Eu apreciez ce am, cand am, ca n-am prea des
Sunt degajat, tot timpul cu zambetul pe buze
Curios din fire, destul cat sa te amuze
Cine ma stie, nu ma mai descifreaza
Chiar daca acum am devenit jumate din juma de fraza
Crescut, trait prin fel de fel de carciumi
Imi place sa cer mai mult, ma cert pe mine insumi
Ca musafir, nu fac precum majoritatea
Ca plec ultimul mereu, mi-am disperat si jumatatea
Imi plac gratarele, imi place la iarba verde
Raspund primu' present, astept alte oferte
Raman cu ai mei in aceste vremuri incerte
In rest ce sa.... ne vedem pe la concerte
Evadeaza pentru cateva secunde
Conteaza doar ce ai cand ai de unde
Pai de unde? n-ai de unde
Dar prefer sa fii aici cand ai putea sa fii oriunde 
Imi zice Byga sunt un tip deschis
Momentan fumez Dunhill lung albastru-inchis
Conduc un Ford Focus de cam 4 ani
De vreo 27 aici, undeva in Balcani
Microbist de mic, echipa se subantelege
Mai tin cu Milan, Champions League e lege
Putem vedea impreuna, insa daca ne chemi
Tre' sa ai in beci unde ne ducem niste Heineken
Consummator de IMDB, cam cinefil
De la Martin Scorsese la Nae Caranfil
Imi place Stand up comedy, oamenii spontani
Muzica e inca in suflet cu sau fara bani
Imi place marea noastra, n'am preturi de statiuni
Unde ii am pe ai mei cu mine avem atatea optiuni
Romani intre romani, copii sa asculte
Ne multumim cu ce avem, desi mereu apar mai multe
Evadeaza pentru cateva secunde
Conteaza doar ce ai cand ai de unde
Pai de unde? n-ai de unde
Dar prefer sa fii aici cand ai putea sa fii oriunde Oh so i heard you're a saint
I know that you ain't, you left some tears on her face
Niggas be running a race
That shit is insane
We all gonna die, it don't matter the place
Oh so I heard you're a saint
I know that you ain't, you left some tears on her face
Niggas been running a race
I'll see you in hell with a smile on my face
You left some tears on her face

You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on a saint, you ain't a saint
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on her face, yuh
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on a saint
I know I'm running out of time
I don't fuck with the devil but I'm guessing I'm his type
And they say I lost my mind
Suicide was still on it so I'm guessing that I'm fine
And I got nothing left to hide
Shit I'll tell you all the truth but you'll hate me like I lied
I stopped reading comments since you wanna criticize
Now tell me that you hate me if it helps you sleep at night
Dressed like a motherfucking god when I reach the spot
Niggas talk a lot, out the blocks, like we taking shots
Hit em up, tell your boys that its over
It ain't new, this some shit that "I told you"
Sippin tea, barely sober
With this ice on my neck why you think I got a cold shoulder
I can not act like I'm pure, niggas been asking for war
They'll find you dead at the shore, burnt up and torn
I'll put your name on my list and put you on TV like its Forbes
Blessings are cursed
Pour out my blood when I'm writing a verse
This shit is fire like me in a church
You heard of the devil? My nigga I'm worse
Ayy
Oh so i heard you're a saint, you left some tears on her face
Niggas be running a race
This shit is insane
We all gonna die, it don't matter the place
Ayy
Oh so I heard you're a saint
I know that you ain't, you left some tears on her face
Niggas been running a race
I'll see you in hell with a smile on my face
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on her face, you ain't a saint
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on her face, you ain't a saint
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on a saint, you ain't a saint
You left some tears on her face
You left some tears on a saint Хе-хе-хе, ну вот и вторая часть, ровно три года
Каждый день сабантуй, каждый час сабантуй, каждый год сабантуй, сабантуй, сабантуй. Каждый день сабантуй, каждый час сабантуй, каждый год, сабантуй, сабантуй, сабантуй
Сабантуй
Рэхим итегез, идёт третий год, парень кутак баш, если ты не знаешь что такое сабантуй?
Каждый день как праздник, эчпочмак на завтрак, и на полдник
Во мне сил будто бы я Салават Юлаев, поднимаю этот флаг за весь башкир народ. Я врываюсь в сабантуй, будто бы в мушки, выпиваю весь кумыс, и я готов урал-батыр. Почему такой большой да это всё учпочмак, я не пью водку пиво или ж только жихан, если нужен лимонад, то только жихан. Если что-то другое то ты еблан. Где лучшие тусовки? Правильно в уфе. Где лучшие девчата? Правильно в уфе. Где лучшие рэперы? А-ну в СПб?
Залетел на сабантуй, сука залетел на сабантуй. Я просто забрал этих шкур, и насадил их на шампур, ведь это сабантуй, сабантуй, сабантуй, каждый день, сабантуй, каждый год, сабантуй
Я самый пиздатый залез на столб и достал сапог, вот хоть самый первый на финише
Вломился в твою хату, и спиздил весь чак-чак, щас с тобой козел мой звездный час, твоим сукам вышел шанс
Это просто фейк, сабантуй мой дом, блакшери естейт, бум бичес я башкир, самый меткий прямо в тир, выжал всё из твоих сук, свежих сок святой кумыс. Моя моя мечеть, как будто Бурдж-халиф, Влад Павлов это стиль, позову его на слив, в рот снимаю с неё платье, на нем висять монеты, тут кеша больше чем, ты получил залеба
Каждый день сабантуй, каждый час сабантуй, каждый год сабантуй, сабантуй, сабантуй. Каждый день сабантуй, каждый час сабантуй, каждый год, сабантуй, сабантуй, сабантуй
СабантуйLet's play pretend now
Don't be afraid, no
Stop being worried
This could be the way
We are what we made up
Ready for a new start
Follow your dreams
No other way will be that great
And I'll keep searching for all the best
Picture yourself in a rocket
And believe you can be anything you want
The meaning of our actions
Feeds the power of attraction
Let it flow
Just let it flow
It's right under our noses
Going through our minds
With passion and devotion
Your light can be our sun
Picture yourself in a rocket
And believe you can be anything you want
The meaning of our actions
Feeds the power of attraction
Let it flow
Just let it flow
And I'll keep searching for all the best
And I'll keep searching for all the best
Picture yourself in a rocket
And believe you can be anything you want
The meaning of our actions
Feeds the power of attraction
Let it flow
Just let it flow
And I'll keep searching for all the bestAnd you make me feel like horrible
But I will not give you a reason
To destroy me more and more again
And again
And you make me feel like horrible
But I will not give you a reason
To destroy me more and more again
And again
And you make me feel like horrible
But I will not give you a reason
To destroy me more and more again
And againSiah: ah
Vocals rise
From a localized setting and globalize
Hah
Yes: check it out
Siah: this is how we do it
Yes: 1-2
Siah: I leap from lily to lily
Never set type
Funny how i sully the beauty of a valley though often tread light
Sunny though money has not begun to rain down on me
It's a brand new day
Yes: and we stay makin melodies
Yeshua da poed'll be steadily tellin these fellas the time
It's the present if you askin or bask in the sunshine
Or just unwind
Siah: into a summer time rush
Of active kind of spastic actions my elastic faction
Got a fraction of this earth sewn up
Rest calmly by the beach where we all have grown up
Yes: live by rhythms and beats with the microphone clutch
Flows zonin in on those that'll touch
I play the background sippin much too much
Siah: riffin at such and such
Keepin my distance indifferent
But with persistence the paradigm shifts
{siah freestyling/talking in the background}
Siah: quietly keepin the peace, replenish our surroundings
Yes: drowned in release of breath, in depth oceanside
Siah: ......in the deep
Both: upon cliffs mad steep
Yes: open wide as we glide on the tide
Siah: cause it's a constant, despite monstrous uprooting and brooding
Beside the ocean, a motion for some order now
Nautical audible through recordable cassette
Yes: sort of a vet, brain soaking wet, using my jaw to project
In order to set the content correct
Siah: so in the table of contents
Yes: you know which page to check
Siah: prepare the endeavor so i can sever ties quick
And be spied in a remote, quote waterfall cave
Plottin the overthrow of the world with some girl
Or pumpin propaganda with my sonic brigade
I gotta glisten and glade, my molecular clever
Specifically effects intellectual...
Yes: ....meanwhile find me either convincing non-believers
Or just coolin like a freezer
See i leave a
Nuff time for rhyme and leisure
Wherever i happen to be, catching the breeze
Siah: it's like that
We take you out....
Yes: like that
Siah: with the good feelings
Yes: what it's all about
Siah: It's what it's all about in 1998
I said it so many times
Buy yo, i keep rhyming off the top of my melon
Said we're not gonna compete with it again
But yo, i complete the blend, yeshua da po again
Like that full track/ yo i hit you in your whole back
With the called facts opinions
Yo i got millions of writtens manhattan beach everybody
Yo blaze up to this
Yoooooooooooooo.....I want you to know
One thing
If you little by little you stop loving me
And if you have given up on what we could be
I will understand
No more second chances
But I want you to know
Just one more thing
I know I made mistakes
I was on the run
Cause I’m the one to blame
I know I did you wrong
But now I'm singing
Don't you give me up
I know I made mistakes
Cause I was so numb
Caused all it to break
I know I did you wrong
But now I'm singing
Don't you give me up
I want you to know
Before we crack
It’s my fault we’re on the brink of collapse
I am dark and you are the light
If we part I will not fight
I will understand
No more second chances
Just so you know that I’ve grown
I want you to know that I’ve grown
Hold on the light. Let go of the nightNew dreams replace the old ones
The old ones that never came true
And the same things that make you smile can make you cry
And I know it took a while
But look at me now
Why they hatin', why they hatin'
Wish you and yours the best
Feel so blatant now I tribute it to Satan
I do me, made it for the rest
You live and you die, in between's the real test
It starts in the mind, ends with the soul
So I need blood on the net of every goal
Slidin' on my knees and I'm praying to the lord
Beggin' "God please let this will be yours"
Who knew I'd open up this count of sales
It was always true I rap out like I'm Santa's elves
I need it all, don't try to give me half
This is for who said I never will and never have
Add it to the top, follow that cab
Shit could get cray, I don't hustle ever
Hope your niggas respect ya'
Trouble neglect ya'
Angels protect ya'
And the heavens accept ya'
I'm almost home
I know you miss me girl, when I walk through the door you better kiss me girl
I done run through hell's fire just to get to you
And to think, I loved you when I barely knew you
Imagination just a runnin' wild, wanna rubble over you and make a love child
I'm almost home, and I'm sorry if I took to long
Okay, okay
We ran the street like Usain Bolt
Everybody ganging' up in the same boat
Miami wind just blowin' through her hair
 in the same boat
She wanna live life without a care
Now she pourin' champagne down her damn throat
Not tryna fit in I was born to stand out
Cake's in the oven, watch how it pans out
Ran and I ran 'till I couldn't no more
I wanted more than the money and the lord
When you, hear the truth it's so hard to ignore
Do they not see it, or are they unsure
Either way I'm out, get into my zone
High as the Northstar, I work hard as a drone
Either you love me or not, if it''s on it's on
But that don't change the fact I'm almost home
I'm almost home
I know you miss me girl, when I walk through the door you better kiss me girl
I done run through hell's fire just to get to you
And to think, I loved you when I barely knew you
Imagination just a runnin' wild, wanna rubble over you and make a love child
I'm almost home, and I'm sorry if I took to long
New dreams replace the old ones
The old ones that never came true
And the same things that make you smile can make you cry
And I know it took a while
But look at me now
I lost a friend to the game and another to the fame
Look into my eyes, can tell it's weighin' on my brain
So I, so I smoke 'till mama say "that's a shame"
Then I light another for the night they killed my brother
I try to run but it drew me back in
Now I'm thinkin' I can swim, I can swim
Somehow I knew we see better days
At last, at last, say it ever change
When the real around, the fake they shrink
I can look in your face and tell your heart'll sink
They took the hourglass and left me the sand
And I can feel time slippin' through my hands
I call my girl "should I be home by eight?"
Whatever you cooking' baby, make me a plate
I'ma kiss yo' neck, you can rub my back
I'ma love on you and you can love me back
I'm almost home
I know you miss me girl, when I walk through the door you better kiss me girl
I done run through hell's fire just to get to you
And to think, I loved you when I barely knew you
Imagination just a runnin' wild, wanna rubble over you and make a love child
I'm almost home, and I'm sorry if I took to long
Okay, okayHey you out there in the cold
Getting lonely getting old
Can you feel me?
Hey you standing in the aisles
With itchy feet and fading smiles
Can you feel me?
Hey you don't help them to bury the light
Don't give in without a fight
Hey you out there on your own
Sitting naked by the phone
Would you touch me?
Hey you with your ear against the wall
Waiting for someone to call out
Would you touch me?
Hey you, would you help me to carry the stone?
Open your heart, I'm coming home
But it was only fantasy
The wall was too high, as you can see
No matter how he tried, he could not break free
And the worms ate into his brain
Hey you, out there on the road
Always doing what you're told
Can you help me?
Hey you, out there beyond the wall
Breaking bottles in the hall
Can you help me?
Hey you, don't tell me there's no hope at all

Ohhhh
Like a waterfall
Like a waterfall

You took it all-alllll
You took my love
And now I'm crying

And now I'm cryingLet every nation know, whether it wishes us well or ill
That we shall pay any price, bear any burden
Meet any hardship, support any friend, oppose
Any foe, to assure the survival and the success of 
Hip hop's commodified, so my style is modified
Not to meet the times rhymes, written fit between the lines
Ends weave up the trends to make it up art
I'm out for means cause gettin there's the best part
Weekly we get freaky seekin this next porter
For some R and R, I keep a fake plush rutabega
Like real snakes, they wrap around but never enter
Wrappin around my neck but it's never too tight
You might just snap back like a old ass turtle
But I could leap that hurdle like Moses
Peace to E.D. from the We Be Fools that do be free
Droppin stools and jewels upon the M-I-C
The maxilla willa spin a rap to fill your cap
Then split it clean cut like guillotines but still you ask how
I had a illa metta, 
But since then a caterpillar better offered this now
Fell down to, earth but I fly to counter
Acts be right on out the beach I teach how to
Wrap around heads in the urban like turbans
Founder of the virgin: tight!!
 see these fools be truly writin right and
Tools be usually lightin sh-- up
Heads get done better when Ken Boogaloo release the flow
Bust, don't recline, just sit up
We be in the mix, it's time to build
With rhymes I swell skills you get your mind swelled
Design lines filled with logic the objects
That the god gets styles from the burbs to the projects
Universally my verses be touchin kids from nursery
To universities, you heard of me, Boogaloo
Comin off like burglary, personally I murder trees
That leave my eyes burgundy, word to me
So peep the baddest in action apparatuses waxin
Definite satisfaction, heads be fakin jacksons like Janet
Or dots mark planets like Bambaata
The man got to get a sham hotter than an enchilada
No digs I blow wigs with the flow so big
To show kids a demonstration how I'm lacin the nation
Makin' power moves like Ant. Mason
And wastin crowds with the mics I'm embracin
Peep the situation that you're facin
The foolish empire, word, Yeshua can Siah
Oh yes, droppin gems and sapphires We can take it higher
I can hear the thunder
Coming from your mouth, and I know my number's up
Give me some Stevie Wonder
Quick, put it on before we go under
I can see the lightning
Coming from your ears, yeah, I see you're frightened
I can see the lion
Sleeps tonight in the tears you're crying
Ooh, can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothin' but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
 We can take it higher
Come now, set the past on fire
Stand up, raise your face to the sky, my love
Together, we can take it higher
 We can take it higher
I can see the rainbow
Coming from your heart, see, it's all okay, so
Come now, see, you're my angel
Say, "Bye" to the past, "Hello" to tomorrow
Ooh, can't love me unless you love you too
Treat yourself like nothing but a fool
Can't love me unless you love you too
Love you too

Ca péra dans des grandes, et des petites salles
Ca part en freestyle, on pari mille balles mec
Qu'avec mes rimes j'tue plus de rappeurs qu'une mitraillette
Pourquoi tu parles, on s'connait même ap
On est dans l'même freestyle mais on fait pas l'même rap
Dis-leurs, nous on donne pas notre langue au chat
Tu connais le rap, donc parlons peu mais parlons sah
J'ai déjà plus rien à prouver, le rap m'a déjà saoulé
Vous prétendez faire du lourd, mais tous vos sons j'les ai soulevé
Yo mon négro destresse, parlons un peu d'espèce
Mental africain, papier français, et petit flow des states
Je fais le ménage, j'viens mettre des balayettes
Toujours un couvre chef, un paire de jojo à mes yep
Pour mesurer mon flow, il te faut un barometre
Comment veux-tu qu'on deal ensemble mon négro si t'es pas honnête
Eh yo on s'amène, on passe le salam au pote
Même si ça gène, toi tu galères, on a un salaire au top
On est sur la voie du succès, toi tu t'arrêtes au stop
On est des génies, et à ce qu'il parait on choque
Je les ai mis à l'amende
Mais dis moi qui peut me stopper?
J'ai mis leurs talent à l'ombre
Les classics je les ai stocké
Je les ai mis à l'amende
Mais dis-moi qui peut me stopper?
J'suis pas névrosé, j'prends le flow de Rozay
Je viens te tirer la moustache... José
On vient t'arroser, on n'peut pas s'arranger
Je les entend ces jaloux qui vont dire que j'ai changé
J'fais peur à l'ingé, il voit la lourdeur en indé
En main j'ai, à peut prêt tout c'qu'il me faut pour dans 10 ans être blindé
J'rap comme un keumé, t'as une tête de camé
Tu dis partout qu'on se connait, gros j'vais finir par te canner
La j'crois que j'ai gagné, Dunk, j'm'accroche au panier
En quelques années j'vais arriver et tout niquer comme Kanye
J'remplis des cahiers, et là j'crois que ça y est
J'entends plus personne, j'ai finis par les calmerOne foot in front of the other babe

You'd never think that a girl so young
Could be so smart, could be so dumb
I stepped on the lines, I stepped on the cracks
Breakin' backs, I can't take it back
Strung myself out of my home
I cried, cried, cried for the virgin genocide
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all the nursery rhymes
Running fast, running last
Pretty sure I failed his class
Running shoes, running loose, loose
I can't get it back, it's a cold sharp snap
It's a scarlet letter, it's the tenth black cat
To cross my path
I cried, cried, cried for the virgin genocide
Cried, cried, cried, cried, cried for what we left behind
Cried, cried, cried for the life that is misaligned
Goodbye, bye, bye, bye, bye to all the nursery rhymes

Non mi faccio neanche un tiro

Ma carico impari come una puta che fa ride' con la tuta
Come ricomincia eppure fai che ride
Va' studia che cadi, sembro un computer

Yo bitch is just like a shark she be swallowing semen
Pockets is strong they He-Man
Them niggas think they killing me, you niggas is dreaming
Pockets on you never seen it
Please tell me where the drink and the weed is
I'm leanin, I'm leanin
Im hot as a demon
I'm rolling with niggas who shoot for no reason
I'm hot now I'm cold fuck I'm switching up seasons
He showed me this beat I told him I need it
I told em I eat it I rip it to pieces
The weed is too loud I can't keep shit a secret man
I'm the type to spend a hunnid grand on a wrist band
I'm leanin, I'm leanin shit I might need a kickstand
{BRIDGE}
I'm leanin X15
{VERSE #2}
I throw up on tracks I'm bulimic
I'm sick I get squeamish
My jewelry is gleaming
He told me hard and I didn't believe it
I swim in his bitch till I'm sea-sick
It's like the dictionary, why?, If I say it I mean it
I roll with day ones so don't ask who my team is
Can't trust these niggas cause they be scheming
They try to catch a nigga while he leanin, red dot strap to the gun I be beaming
Run up on me bro, can't run up on me bro
Got a pistol thats bigger than Beyonce's ego
Try to play me wrong, guaranteed that bitch will get to spinning like the migos
It's a bad hoe watching Manny like tevo
But Manny my people, But I don't think she know
But the bros can't fold unless the bitch going for the team, so that mean that you gotta fuck me hoe
I walk in the spot, got on true religion, you see it
My name is Messiah but hoe that do not mean you gotta treat me like Jesus
Only thing that I ask of the hoe is just to show me where the weed is and the lean is
I'm leanin X3
{BRIDGE}
I'm leanin X22Oh there is life after death
The death of all those parts of you
You thought you needed
And there is sweetness left
You thought that none would survive
You were so bitter
But you will taste again
No you will not stay numb for long
I'll pinch you
And after all the tears
There will be laughter too
I promise
You're stronger than it
You're stronger than this shit
You're stronger than it
You're stronger than this shit
And you are coping now
Although it may not feel like it
You are okay
And you will love again
And you are loved right now
Forgive yourself
And you'll help you
You'll do enough
You'll help enough
You are enough
And you will lose again

Oh, oh...Yeshua:
There's no, chance of heart transplants of mines, can't dance
But this case displays just a smile can enhance
Visions like Rembrandt but she enchants like a prism
Never asked for the next villain to seal so I deal with them
Daily, direct MCs in my head that mainly oppose, but I suppose to be said
Bendin the script so the ending is flipped in my favor
Enabling me to savor the flavor of her lips, what a trip
But it's not reality considering the tragedy of her not knowin
What's flowin through my mind it's all you'll find, runnin laps to catch
Crampin
The stands tramps lamp watch for father to start
Is not aware while she's there, or since when still strange
It all became from the exchange of a pencil
Incidental, but sentimental like a monument
I wish feelings were congruent but she's not even on to it
Intuition tells me she never felt the
Kind of energy from me that I do from her, uh-uh
I'm just cool peeps that keeps the We Be
Fools sleepin, uneasy, why couldn't I tell her
Well the, feelings are deeper than just a jam
Damn, every time that I peep her I just can't stand
To keep the truth concealed but feel too scared
To reveal, cause rejection would mess things up
I still have to greet an occasional meet and I
Be speedin through the beltway congenient
Pulled by a strange force, she's feeding my heart
Appetizers, but I strive to try the main course
A plain loss of words...and it disturbs...
Chorus:
Intoxicatin vibratin through my mind
Bobbin her head to the same tunes I do
Intoxicatin vibratin through my mind
Bobbin her head...
You gotta think multi-vitamins, she's quite a collection, I invite her in
Reflection might have been, if shit was different, but it isn't
Isn't, it, my place to forget
That all it takes is to see her face again
Curly crown, right down to her toes, fly high
Light skinned nubian, best believe intriguing
I breathe in, hold the moment seized in my mind
Treatin time silently but reminds 'til I'm leaving
Even her aura glorifies, beauty truly fortifies
The mortal side through the, deft in her eyes
A portal to the next definition of disguise
My best better mission to reside by hers is expressed
As a currency I don't possess unless
I'm holdin a microphone enrolled in cipher obviously
Purely MC related, seems I made it
So my dreams stay sedated, and I hate it...
ChorusWassup ?

Wassu-wassup ?
Yes, yes
Hello, quoi d’neuf ? Ça y est j’brûle les étapes
T’étais prêt du but mais moi j’t’en écartes
Quand j’rentre en studio oui je m’éclate
Et oui j’les épate ils sont tous sous l’choc
Ils se demandent tous ce que j’ai sous l’froc
Car les rappeuses en France font des flops
Sache que j’suis pas venue pour m’faire des potes
Pour moi c’est le début j’ai des preuves à faire
Beaucoup trop de débit j’mets des prods à terre
J’m’en vais sur la Luna j’décolle de la Terre
Chez nous y’a pas d’justice on va régler nos affaires
Sopra , steuplait , pousse le volume à fond
Ce soir les filles rappent comme les garçons et au passage remets nous des glaçons
Wassup
Montre moi comme tu es
Ce soir est un jour de paix ! 
Montre toi comme tu es
Ce soir pas de tenue exigée ! 
Laaaalalalaaaaa 
Danse ce soir, oui c’est la folie
C’est souvent tard, que vient la mélancolie
J’les mets à l’amende tout en restant poli
On s’donne rendez-vous en Cosmopolitanie
Ok, j’leur fait l’effet d’une bombe
Si le rap est mort j’vais ouvrir sa tombe
Et puis j’vais rapper jusqu’à l’hécatombe
Paraît que j’suis la relève de cette rappeuse de l’Essonne
Monsieur, Madame, Smith & Wesson
La Frenchie c’est comme ça qu’on m’appelle
Big up à Sopra le Fresh Prince de Marseille

ما همه مون مثل همیم
صبحا که از خواب پا میشیم
نقاب به صورت می زنیم
یکی معلم میشه و
یکی میشه خونه به دوش
یکی ترانه ساز میشه
یکی میشه غزل فروش
کهنه نقاب زندگی
تا شب رو صورت های ماست
گریه های پشت نقاب
مثل همیشه بی صداست
هر کسی هستی یه دفعه
قد بکش از پشت نقاب
از رو نوشته حرف نزن
رها شو از پیله ی خواب
نقش یک دریچه رو
رو میله ی قفس بکش
برای یک بار که شده
جای خودت نفس بکش
کاشکی میشد تو زندگی
ما خودمون باشیم و بس
تنها برای یک نگاه
حتی برای یک نفس
تا کی به جای خود ما
نقاب ما حرف بزنه
تا کی سکوت و رج زدن
نقش نمایش منه
هر کسی هستی یه دفعه
قد بکش از پشت نقاب
از رو نوشته حرف نزن
رها شو از پیله ی خواب
نقش یک دریچه رو
رو میله ی قفس بکش
برای یک بار که شده
جای خودت نفس بکش
می خوام همین ترانه رو
رو صحنه فریاد بزنم
نقابمو پاره کنم
جای خودم داد بزنمToc toc, ouvrez la porte
Si on vous demande, vous dîtes que c’est Mohand à la prod
Préviens tes potes, évite-leur l’état de choc
Car c’est fièrement que j’viens représenter mon époque
J’reviens décapiter, rapper des rimes en quantités
Mon panda j’crois qu’t’as pas pigé, pourtant ce n’est pas compliqué
Le rap on vient s’accaparer, ces rageux n’ont qu’à parler
On sait c’qu’on vaut donc on s’en fout à qui t’as beau nous comparer
On kicke en équipe, solo ou pas on t’liquide
J’fais ça depuis peu, tu croirais qu’ça fait dix piges
J’reprends du service, ça va aller super vite
Tu vois qu'on est les best poto, pourquoi tu persistes ?
Un flow de l’espace, les MCs sont en extase
Tu vois qu’on est au top poto, donc poto reste calme ?
L’avenir du game est entre nos mains
On vous a dit d’les prévenir, si j’suis là c’est pas anodin
 
Là-haut dans ma fusée, perdue dans les étoiles
Posée sur la Lune, j’écris ma life
 
Prévenez-les, prévenez-les, prévenez-les, prévenez les
J’débarque sur Cap Canaveral
Prévenez-les, prévenez-les, prévenez-les, prévenez les
Pendant qu’tu rêves d’un Panamera
On vient tout retourner, quand on part en tournée
Prévenez-les, pré-prévenez-les
On vient tout retourner, quand on part en tournée
Prévenez-les, pré-prévenez-les
On vient tout saccager quand on débarque en concert
On est dans l’futur ils ont validé nos concepts
On changera pas, même avec un compte blindé
Même signés, on s’comportera comme en indé
Donnez les commandes, la concurrence est trop lente
J’suis trop loin poto, j’arrive dans l’game en soucoupe volante
Rangez les strass et les paillettes, nous on s’en ballec
On frime pas, avec des choses qu’on peut pas yep
 
 I ride for my brothers
And I'd die for my sisters no

But still I, do what I need just to get by
That's no lie, that's no lie

Is you down to ride
I just wanna know if you down to ride
Yeah
Down 2 RideYou are not the one you used to be!
When she was still looking at him
While he was running off the dance floor
Pink was the sound
Squares on the ground
Mixed up with the sound
With the shame of disaster and the fire on the walls
She used to blame herself
Scared to death
Afraid to fail
But it was enough
So she played it rough
And said:
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to be
If she was wrong, he was right
Oh it was so long was a blight 
Any spark would start a fight
They used to dance out of spite
And from the bottom of her soul she said:
"Leave him to me
I can't stand him anymore"
But it was enough
So she played it rough
And said:
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
You are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
Ah, you are not the one you used to be
No matter how you walk into my place
'Cause you are not the one you used to be
No matter how you look into my face
You are not the one you used to beAll for you boy
All for you boy
It’s all for you
Hardly even notice their advances
Honestly baby the chance is
You’re on my mind
Always on my mind
No matter what I do
If you ask if I’m in love
I'll say I might be
Leaving you’s unlikely
They heard I got that top shelf
So they wanna try 
One hit oh shit can’t quit
Got that good good boy they ain’t lie 
But they can’t get to shorty
Cause they know I keep that
Body on lock and key 
There’s only one person that I want to put their body on me
In so many words
I’m your Private Reserve
Finally found someone who deserves
To get all my Private Reserve
I’d be blind not to see your worth
So you get all my Private Reserve
It’s exclusive and baby boy the truth is
You deserve my Private Reserve
There’s only you boy no substitute of this I’m sure
Unless a man might mess around and waste my
Love and that ain’t easily replaced you
Know that I’m the best
Treat me with respect
Like a connoisseur
So when they ask if I’m in love
I'll say I might be
Leaving you’s unlikely
They heard I got that top shelf
So they wanna try 
One hit oh shit can’t quit
Got that good good boy they ain’t lying 
But they can’t get to shorty
Cause they know I keep that

There’s only one person that I want to put their body on me

Good love, got this good love
But you gon' have to find your own way home
Some call it a weapon
It falls with no mercy, like always
But if I dealt with it alone I wouldn't be as strong
I'm going to dim the lights on this side of happy
I wouldn't pay it no attention
Didn't want to find out
You gave it away, the look on your face, yeah
Sitting here waiting on you
Ain't no more entrances, ain't no room
I don't wanna make amends, make amends
Put it all on hold
I wish you good luck, baby, good luck
If you make it back, I got some good love for you
It's your life and it's true love
Even you take the long way home
Good luck, baby, good luck

Good love, got this good love
But you gon' have to find your own way homeI just wanna drive you crazy
So we can catch up with the world
Every day a new disaster
It keeps crumblin' down, burn to the ground
Before it all goes
Tryna get a hold of you now
We plan enough
Runnin' away enough
Find a place to buy some time
Ooh, actin' friendly
I just wanna feel a little bit
For a little bit
Ooh, got the crowd of
I just wanna feel a little bit
For a little bit
We should prolly, prolly focus on the present
Hide out under covers
It's not like there's too much we can do
And I don't wanna lose from tryin'
If the walls are fallin'
Let them come in, come in
You and I, we wouldn't, wouldn't move an inch
We let them bullets ring
Never let Hell distract us
I'm sure they'll shoot back if you want
You know I'll shoot back if you want it
You ain't gonna ask, this is love
You'll never have to ask, girl, there's nothing
Away enough
Runnin' away enough
Find a place to buy some time
Ooh, actin' friendly
I just wanna feel a little bit
For a little bit
Ooh, got the crowd of
I just wanna feel a little bit
For a little bitI'm not taking the easy way
I'm saying what's been on my mind
Hoping that we will be okay
Although I know that you had your doubts
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
Cause I've been falling your friends will say
You'll never change, you should walk away
And if you do, won't complain about it
But I find no doubt about it
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
Is there somebody having a thing like we do
Somebody like me needs you
Cause you're loving the way
You wanna tell me the way
The words you say just won't do
And there's no one like you who would love me like you do
And you trust my embrace, even through my mistakes
Cause we fall out, breaking down
Everyone can see it now
Through it all, everything
I can't believe when I hear you say
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
Having you makes it easy babe
Every day, one day at a time
I know that we won't be the same
I can't believe that I made it out
I made it out, I made it out
I made it out, I made it out
Now we're talking about our kids' names
And the pain seems so far away
Every time I made you doubt and
I would never have to think about it
I made it out, I made it out
I made it out, I made it out
Is there somebody having a thing like we do
Somebody like me needs you
Cause you're loving the way
You wanna tell me the way
The words you say just won't do
And there's no one like you who would love me like you do
And you trust my embrace, even through my mistakes
Cause we fall out, breaking down

Through it all, everything
I can't believe when I hear you say
I'll make it out, I'll make it out
Trust me I'll make it out, I'll make it out
Just the way I 
Let me hear you sing it
Make it out, I'll make it outI sometimes believe that everything I dream
Will one day be my reality
I sometimes think that every move I make
Will gather in shape in my reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I sometimes search for signs my dreams can work
Until I stand alert with my reality
I sometimes look in paradise by the book
To give back what I took from my reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality
I can only dream
I can only hope
That one day I will see
A beautiful reality
I can only wish
And I can only want
That I will one day see
A beautiful reality
Beautiful, beautiful reality
A beautiful reality
Beautiful, beautiful, beautiful, beautiful
Beautiful realityI really love his arrangements
He always comes with such a sweet bouquet
When I feel under the weather
He brings the medicine that gets me straight
And though we aren’t together, no
But he knows he’s got my loyalty
And he come through when I need him
With my special delivery
And he knows exactly what I need
Sometimes you just want to take it easy
Roll up and float on these Cali breezes
And if you feel low then get on my level
Cause we get so high I don’t wanna let go
Every time he brings me
Flowers
And he’s always right on time
Cause he knows that I
Really love my
Flowers
Think I just might make him mine
Mine mine mine
Wait a minute I'm not finished
I’m in love with what he give me
I can’t stop but I don’t wanna
So good that you could sell it on the corner
So give me that bass that bass that bass
Baby why don’t you come my way
Got other customers I get it
After you done won’t you come visit
I just wanna show you I appreciate ya
So baby come and get this paper
I’m impatient so don’t keep me waiting
Running low baby elevate me
Sometimes you just want to take it easy
Roll up and float on these Cali breezes
And if you feel low then get on my level
Cause we get so high I don’t wanna let go
Every time he brings me
Flowers
And he’s always right on time
Cause he knows that I really love my flowers
Think I just might make him mine
Mine mine mineIntro:

Strofa 1:
Hopa! Cade iara bomba!
Ne revendicam viitoru', intram cu japca-n Europa
Cand vine vorba de HIP-Hop, luam doar ce e al nostru
Si-al vostru', si-al lui, deci n-are rost sa faci pe prostu'
Spargem bariere, vere, explodam din cartiere
Dam fara frontiere, rabufnim din tacere
Motivati de palcere, facem o diferenta clara:
Printre interesele materiale si muzica de calitate superioara
Suntem multi, mai multi, tot mai multi, foarte multi!
Ne educam intre noi, nu mai umblam desculti
Vad tot mai multe trupe, noi B-Boy, noi DJ
Vad lumea mai deschisa, s-avem si noi cateva chei
O ardem in familie sa nu zic in grup, ca e ciudat
Da' stai putin ca parca mai apare un baiat
Pai da... as rupe si eu ceva, da' nu prea stiu ce...
Da' hai c-o rup... Hai rupe-o... Hai c-o rup... Hai rupe-o!

Strofa 2:
Brutal; intervin pe instrumental in plin
Momentu' zero punct de plecare sau declin
Treptat miscarea Hip-Hop ia forma de fenomen
Din Timisoara-n Bucuresti se cam resping la Occident
Apar adepti nu doar baieti de unde sigur nu te-astepti
Istoria-nca se scrie si-n versuri si pe pereti
Dispar figuri mondene, apar atleti pe scene
Cu lumini de girofar, si sunet de sirene
In cluburi mainile se ridica din placere
Eu ca M. C. o cer, ah... si muzica o cere
Pai de ce? Cum de ce? In nici un caz ca se poarta
Nu uita ca asta e cultura noastra, e arta
Pe harta, Craiova e undeva la sud
De-acolo tip sa m-aud, eu tip si-o sa v-aud, daaa
Mai zic ceva poate ne-nteleg si altii
Asta nu e vocea mea, e vocea unei generatii!!!

Hai să vorbim despre ce-auzim zilnic
Sfaturi, cum s-avem traiul cel mai silnic
Cum ne-nvaţă pe toţi să fim roboţi
Cum ne injectează, cum se derulează
Spală creiere vere ca şi cum l-ai cere pané
E modul de preparé, fluieră un greiere
A pagubă, ce dracu mă mai tolerăm
Cât să le mai dăm peste nas, noi tot le dăm
Nu-mi plec urechea decât la Petrache Berchea
Nu caut perechea, nu sunt vreun terchea-berchea
Berchea mondialu' şi mii alte mizerii
Mă sperii de TV şi dacă-l văd pe Jim Carrey
Hai rol de entertainment, te iei prea serios
Când controlezi mase, generezi grimase
Iar dacă umbli după bani totul va fi pe dos
Pentru noi rămâneţi farse, cele mai false
Ne place viaţa o trăim din plin cu
Sare, zahăr şi grăsimi
Va fi la fel pân-o să şi murim de la
Sare, zahăr şi grăsimi. 
Karie:
Unii se dedică misiunii persuasiunii
Dar eu sunt dedicat pasiunii
Vor să ne-nveţe ca pe proşti de parcă noi nu ştim
Vor să renunţăm la ce iubim
Vor să ne ia banii pe orice nimic, apoi zic:
''Consumul excesiv de.. '' se contrazic
Bagă reduceri ca să faci ulcer
Apoi îţi cer bani să n-ajungi în cer
Am ajuns să ţin televizoru' doar ca bibelou că mi se face rău şi-mi pierd controlu'
De bună credinţă refac cunoştinţă cu alcoolul
Şi-mi aleg o cârciumă să moară de invidie mall-ul
Şi de când mă ştiu aprind calculatorul
C-ăştia cenzurează, protejează pe minoru'
Ăstora le pasă şi au grijă de poporu' care până să-i cunoască avea în faţă viitoru'
Ne place viaţa o trăim din plin cu
Sare, zahăr şi grăsimi
Va fi la fel pân-o să şi murim de la
Sare, zahăr şi grăsimi. Quién iba a pensar que esta noche llegaría
Tanto imaginarte y ahora aquí estamos los dos
Le dije a tus manos que no suelten a las mías
Porque ahora mis labios, no quieren decir adiós
Si te he buscado tanto y te esperé, no miento
Que te iba a conocer, tenía el presentimiento
Sabes que nada de esto es un error
Te toma por sorpresa y es mejor
Y ahora que se hace tarde no se cómo decir
Quédate aquí, que el tiempo nunca es suficiente
Quiero sentir, sentir que al fin cambió mi suerte
Quédate aquí, al menos quédate esta noche
Quiero sentir, que ahora no voy a perderte
Y aunque se que no es tan fácil de decir
Confieso que he soñado contigo estos días
Y cuando despierto me preguntó dónde estás
Si digo que no te extraño, yo te mentiría
Por eso está noche voy a decir la verdad
Quédate aquí, que el tiempo nunca es suficiente
Quiero sentir, sentir que al fin cambió mi suerte
Quédate aquí, al menos quédate está noche
Quiero sentir, que ahora no voy a perderte
Y aunque se que no es tan fácil de decir… Solo quédate aquí
Quédate conmigo aunque sepamos que nada es eterno
Dame solo un momento y en secreto quedará
Quédate acá, sabes que mañana es tarde
Está muy claro que nada será como antes
Quédate acá, solo quédate una noche más
Quédate aquí, que el tiempo nunca es suficiente
Quiero sentir, sentir que al fin cambió mi suerte
Quédate aquí , al menos quédate está noche 
Quiero sentir , que ahora no voy a perderte
Y aunque se que no es tan fácil de decir…
Solo quédate aquí'Cause I feel it kickin', you get that tone
I’m feeling reckless and nervous 'cause you're my ghost
This situation it's both our faults
I feel the water is rising, the walls are small
I never said anything to offend you
Not patronizing what you've been through
And what you claim that I said, it was not true, it was not true
So for the last time
There are things we can't undo
And everyday with you feels like a review
So what you claim that I said, it was not true, it was not true
A million times, one million fights
It's nothing, just another game of who's to blame
It's never alright, we're never just fine
And now forever seems like yesterday

Kailan man 'sahan di mag kalayo

Walang ibang hiling kundi ang yakap mo't halik

One breath leads to another, yeah
Just keep moving, oh
Look within for the strength today
Listen out for the voice to say
Just keep moving, oh
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this
So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, in flames
Don't stop, tomorrow's another day
Don't stop, tomorrow you'll feel no pain
Just keep moving
Don't stop the past'll trip you up
You know, right now's gotta be enough
Just keep moving, oh
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, but don't stop moving
Go, go, go
Figure it out, figure it out, you can do this
So my love, keep on running
You gotta get through today
There my love, keep on running
Gotta keep those tears at bay
Oh, in flames

I never have believed that we would separate
What we have now is how it stands
And now I wish you'll try to make it stay
The way we are is here and now
I wish you'd make the most of all we have today
Before you go and give it away
Hold on for one more shot
Before you let it slip away
Hold on for one more shot
I did not believe, I did not mean to hurt you no more
I never meant to let you down, down
Though the silver lining wears through
I still do not mean to hurt you, no
When the sound of your voice is not ringing through
Beginning to question whether I should be around
 Povestea mea povestea ta povestea lor
Poate fi povestea noastra Povestea tuturor
Eeee
Povestea mea povestea ta povestea lor
Poate fi povestea noastra Povestea tuturor
Mi-aduc aminte varsta la care ma indragosteam
In fiecare zi de fusta care mereu trecea
Pe unde noi ne strangeam ---- si la geam
Dar nu prea intelegeam de ce taceam
Si-am iubit asa saptamani si luni intregi
Vreau sa vad ca ridici o mana in sus daca ma intelegi
Ea
Habar n-avea cum ma cheama eu nu ma bagam in seama
Nu ca imi era frica sau poate putina teama
Ca
Poate n-asculta muzica ce-mi place mie
Si poate n-o s-o impresioneze nici o melodie
Poate nui place la cinema
Poate ii place de altcineva
Stiu ca n-o sa am pace cu atatea griji ce ma pot macina
Dar
Ce pot sa fac ce pot sa-i zic cum sa incep
Imi ard urechile cand ma gandesc cat sa pricep
Acum ori niciodata daca vreau sa ies din impas
Tre' sa las refrenu sa faca primu pas
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea
Te-am vazut intr-o luni dimineata
N-am putut sa te abordez nu esti genu ce se agata
Esti genu ce se incalta pe tocuri la piata
Femeie independenta iti face fata in fata
Era clar, stateai cu mine in cartier
Ieseai rar si nu-ti placeau bagabonti de fel
Nici macar n-aveam curajul numarul sa ti-l cer
Stiam ca doar ca stai la scara B undeva pe la parter
Si ne-am vazut, intamplator cateva luni in sir
Si am inceput sa ne zambim putin cate putin
Si am facut cam tot ce se putea sa te coving
Cand tu spuneai obsesiv ca nu sunt decat un copil mare
Dar nu te deranja prea tare iti placea cum suna mami
Coboara sunt in parcare iti placea cum suna mami
Fa-mi ceva bun de mancare iti placea cum suna mami
Cam in orice imprejurare
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea
Te-am vazut trecand pe strada mea
Si am ramas blocat asa
Nu stiu ce se va intampla
Cu noi cu mine cu ea

Flamesمن برای تو می‌خونم
هنوز از این‌ور دیوار
هر جای گریه که هستی
خاطره‌هاتو نگهدار
تو نمی‌دونی عزیزم
حالِ روزگار ما رو
توی ذهن آینه بشمار
تک تک حادثه‌ها رو
خورشیدو از ما گرفتن
شُکرِ شب، ستاره پیداست
از نگاه ما جرقه
صد تا فانوسه
یه رویاست
من برای تو می‌خونم
بهترین ترانه‌ها رو
دل دیوارو بلرزون
تازه کن خلوتِ ما رو
هم غصه، بخون با من
تو این قفسِ بی‌مرز
لعنت به چراغ سرخ
لعنت به چراغ سبز
هم غصه، بخون با من
تو این قفسِ بی‌مرز
لعنت به چراغ سرخ
لعنت به چراغ سبز
من برای تو می‌خونم

And all the special people who cannot be replicated
Real rap isn't being demonstrated
But I'm the bomb so it's 'bout time that I detonated
I'm estimatin' that whack rappers are hesitatin'
To come back at me cause I'll start devastatin'
And depricatin'
Separatin' one by one and have you speculating
I had to come out hard, no time for under-estimating
I'm penetrating your mind
I'ma start relegating
New definition of lightskin no disrespect to drake
After my rhymes you're enlightened, didn't finish your plate
Think about it, you weigh less
Hot air leaves your brain weightless
That's why my flow cold and hard
So I'll start cashing paychecks
Do I got to break it down like a dope line?
Don't censor that cause I'm talking 'bout dope rhymes
That direct me towards greatness like most signs
Pursuit of Happiness, I'm just chasing my dreams
It takes some classiness to be a part of my team
Pretty boy, don't like ashy-ness I can get you some cream
Broke before but now my pockets the grassy-est cause I'm all    about 
 Remember When I used to drink tang?
And them talent shows when little homie used to Sing?
And back in them days when break dancing was my thing?
Damn
But nowadays I'm perfecting my craft
Got a verse ready for anyone
I dare you to laugh
I ain't a king yet
But y'all  can prepare for my wrath
That's why I call myself the savior of rap
Just save all your crap
Throw them notebooks away and put your pen back in the cap
I ain't really want to have to change the game
But every time I switch the radio it sounds the same
It's not an art anymore
The lyricism is lame
So right about now you should get used to my name
I understand if y'all just trynna get the party jumpin'
But if you make a mil off it don't think that you're somethin'
They don't like your words son
They liking the beat
Merked on the track
How you liking defeat?
I'm bright as can be
I strike like a bee
Except, I don't down boy
Vikatin's weak
I'm lightin' this beat
Fire in the booth and can't nobody put it out
When they say my name I know that you be looking out
Couple people never heard of me
They said I ain't making it
We know how the saying goes
But trust that I ain't' faking it
The beast is still asleep, don't worry, yet
I ain't waking it
I could set the bar real high
Instead, I'm just taking it
A flagrant
Every time I see a mic, it's dangerous
My flow is something new, and it's pretty flavorous
If you pick a pen up after this it's pretty traitorous
And don't think you know my next move, I'm spontaneous
I'm not arrogant, I just speak the truth
No 34
Come near me with a dis, I'll sweep you up like a dirty floor
If you ain't notice yet, your girlfriend is a dirty 
Back-track
Starting with that "whack rap"
Jnice get yo shit together, put it in that backpack
Don't ever look back at, any of them flashbacks
Just focus on your abstract
Test 'em like a lab rat
Then make everybody's brain flip out, like a flapjack
They looking at my poker face, but they playing blackjack
My chances are higher now like I work with the Black CatYour insensitivity is your personality
Trait least favourite
Ha, ha! Funny
You think you're so funny
But you hurt my feelings
We've had some good dealings
What have I done recently
To make you so mean to me?
I'm oversensitive you say
But I think you were nasty today
You make me feel nasty
Like a control freak
I just want to feel helpful
Like I'm needed, a sense of reason
You tell your friends I'm a fucking kook
Look how long it took
I've been like this all the time
You don't know what it's like to be me
You're not paranoid, neurotic
You're free
I don't like me much anymore
You make me feel a burden
You make me feel like a boreTeko
Stai pe loc...! CIA a revenit
Nu te ridica, ascultane pe noi cu noul hit
Nu suntem, cei care canta la "Mai vrei"
Avem milioane de idei fata de ei
Cantam rap, din 97 pana-n coa...
Exact la fel  ca Mafia
La fel ca Codu Penal 
Vin dupa tine
Si bag versurile astea direct in tine
Urmatoarea strofa... o va zice nakata
Sunt Teko si am inkeiat strofa mea
Refren
Sunt cu frati mei acum George, Nakata
Versurile astea le trimit, in mintea ta
Pentru voi si pentru care ne asculta-n 07
Stiti ca C. I. A va merge mai departe
Nakata
Suntem aici cu toti si inregistram
Negativu l-am facut si-l repetam
Am ajuns in 07 nu vorbim in soapte
Spunem totu-l pe fata si merge-m mai departe
Nume de cod... Nakata
Reprezint C. I. A si nu uita
De mic de cand eram pitic ascultam rap si nu regret nimi
Ultimile randuri vreau sa le inchei...
Va las cu George... dragi mei
Refren
Sunt cu frati mei acum George, Nakata
Versurile astea le trimit, in mintea ta
Pentru voi si pentru care ne asculta-n 07
Stiti ca C. I. A va merge mai departe

Sunt George..!!
Fac parte din C. I. A
Cum au zis si frati mei 
Niste derbede-i
Noi visam la bani, masini, femei
Totu-l pentru ei.... pentru frati mei... pentru C. I. A
Incheiem toti trei.....
Toti trei
Suntem 3 frati de belea
Versurile astea le bagam in mintea ta
Pt voi si pt care ne asculta-n 07
Stiti ca C. I. A va merge mai departeI am so bored
Think I'm going to die
I'm so empty
I cannot even cry
Crush my eye in your tender hand
The death of romance
I’m grief stricken
Killing time
Amputated, broken smile
I feel so weak
Undignified
I didn't realize
I'm isolated sick with fear
I lost my sight
And cannot hear
Imperfect world, desensitized
Our truth been compromised
I’m so bored
I think I might die
Burned, burnt-out and dried
Oh lord uninspired
Cross my heart I hope to diePhila: Pune o lacrimă, o rază de soare
Un pic de gheaţă, un strop de speranţă
Amestecă-le special într-un coktail
Trimite-ntr-o scrisoare, nu prin e-mail
Suntem atâţia responsabilizaţi prea devreme
Atâţia capturaţi prea devreme
Din naştere am fost făcut să nu dau naştere
Deși la fel ca tine-am un copil în mine, cu sete de cunoaştere
E, maturitate, unde eşti?
Dacă mă cauţi şi tu, de ce nu mă găseşti?
Gândesc iresponsabil, poate inconştient
Poate naiv, poate inconştient de inocent
Refuz să mă port cum s-ar cuveni
Refuz să-mi doresc să m-asemăn cu semenii
O să iau în joacă ce iau prea-n serios acum
Şi o să plec la drum când sunt pregătit de drum
KrafTu  :
Hai Doamne fă cumva
Să mai fiu iar copil
Să îţi alerg senin
De toate care vin
Byga : Hai Doamne fă cumva
Să ne întorci vremea
Când ne sclipeau ochii la o caramea
Când hoinăream până ne prindea noaptea
Când nu prea conta ce zicea lumea
Chiuleam în masă
Prieteni, colegi de clasă
Săream în sus când rămâneam singuri acasă
Ne bărbieream da n-aveam un fir în barbă
Ne ruşinam când atingeam fete la baba oarbă
Dar ne-am plictisit şi-ntr-o bună zi
Ne-am trezit maturi, nu mai suntem copii
Umblăm după bani, ne pierdem sănătatea
Apoi ne pierdem banii să recăpătăm sănătatea
Ne gândim prea mult la viitor, neglijăm prezentul
Sigur cunoşti sentimentul : Când eşti copil vrei să fii om mare, e infantil
Iar acum ai da orice să mai fi iar copil!
KrafTu  :
Hai Doamne fă cumva
Să mai fiu iar copil
Să îţi alerg senin
De toate care vin
Rashid :
Nu mă-ntreba cum am trăit, că am uitat
Nu mă-ntreba ce o să fac că viitoru-i nelimitat
Pot doar sa spun că trăiesc în prezent
Contează doar acum, eu şi mâine sunt doar fum
De-aia râd mereu atunci când mi-e greu
Dac-aş face altfel sigur n-aş fi eu
Umblu teleleu îmi văd de drumul meu
Putin schizofrenic, puţin derbedeu
Ca orice român am bani de dat, am bani de luat
Da-i dau la stat
M-am relaxat când am alfat că pot să scap dacă
N-am nimic defapt
Mi-e dor de copilărie
Mi-e dor de anii-n care vedeam viaţa ca pe-o jucărie
Mi-e dor de copilărie, mi-e dor de anii-n care viaţa nu era o isterie
KrafTu  :
Hai Doamne fă cumva
Să mai fiu iar copil
Să îţi alerg senin
De toate care vinVrei rap, iti dau rap, il fac ca nimeni altu'
Dar nu ma confunda cu el, eu vad altfel hip-hop-ul
Sunt artist independent deci pot sa fac ce vreau
N-o ard trist, e evident mainstream sau underground
Ma mananci de cur esti hater, iti doresc doar pofta buna
N-am ales un gen anume spune-i doar muzica buna
Am cules in general cam din orice gen normal
Tot ce mi-a placut cum suna, tu asculta si consuma
Daca faci rap, iti dau rap didactic, ia notite
Vad prea multi gangsteri in clipuri ce pe strada sunt fetite
Vad prea multe garofite si mimoze emo-rap
Isi taie venele, fac poze si posteaza imediat
Ai mei fac rap pe trap, boombap sau gangsta s***t
Au flowul asezat rapid sau sacadat pe beat
Ai tai fac c***' praf, vor sa sune diferit
Doar ca publicu' a uitat de cand n-ati mai cazut pe beat...
PHILA:
Casca gura, ochii mari
Urechile ciulite ca la lautari
Fete ciufulite ca la p****r
Nu s-a terminat, incepe iar
Intrebai de-ai mei, suna-a C.I.A
Noi stim ca mai vrei Olteniada 3
Ridic maini la cer, la zei, chiar si la dj
Strica tracku'...N-ai cum sa te tii de ei
Oltean istet, un mare pleonasm
La slujba tusesc cum are-un preot astm
Ibracadabra, nu-mi ajungi la nas
Ana n-are mere, are ananas
Senile-n catrene sfarama muntii
Sange, cad trene, ca-n noaptea nuntii
Incetam seceta, ne zicea cineva
Ca ce facem noi aicisea e altceva!
JIANU:
Salaam Alaikum, bonjour bitches!
Jianov, va scriu din varfu ligii
Cu varfu pe foaie apasat sa despice
Penita mea arde, n-o atinge ca frige
Ce sa fac daca nu pot sa tac
Oare ce am bagat de mananc asfalt
Oare de ce-s fenomen pe track
16 linii la bar, Escobar s-a tirat
O iubesc pe Katherine Pancol
O imagine frumoasa, caterinca, alcool
5 pagini pe masa, esti nebun? ador
Sa-mi las mintea sa zboare cand sunt matol
...revin la BOR
C-astia nu stiu sa conduca si ma simt dator
Sa le arat ce am eu in laborator
Si cum dobor cand pornesc aparatu respirator
Apropo, am un aspirator de litere
Plus un plaman si doua maini libere
Bun, acum cred ca ti-e limpede
La show ridic sala ca un scripete
Cad pe beat, atac grav
Nu dau inapoi, te fac praf
Cu flow de fapt iti sparg capu' 
Ihmm, de fapt sunt dat...dat...
BYGA:
Adult printre adulti, gen Ron Jeremy, m-asculti
Te ridic ca Grig pe cric, in spirale verbale
Cad rime ca pietre la vale
Auzi, da' matale esti gay cumva? Gen Macklemore
Cu mecla-n salata la Mac in Mall
E hardcore, e Rock'n'Raw
Iti dam rachete-n cap ca McEnroe
Fa-mi un favor, nu fii judecator
Ca satra-n stabor, pe scena-o sa mor
Clasic raman, Charles Aznavour
Tu stii Albatros, Generic, Azur
Fur show' cu totu', sunt cleptoman
Il duc in Oz cu Toto, pui botu', man
La ce povesti delirez, iara derulezi
Sa realizezi cat e de incredibil, man!
MUTU:
Iti dau sa-ti sara casca
Sute de linii, zi-mi Nazca
Sute de linii sub nas ca tizul meu
Deschide Feteasca
Ca nu pot sa ma las de tras pe de-astea
Cand publicu-i tripat pe alte de-astea
Eu vin cu un flow sa te inghet ca Alaska
Stim cine esti, arunca-ti masca
Hip-Hopu' e o arta, Hip-Hopu' tau e popo
Oriunde pe harta c-o mie de coco
Te iau si te f*t in cur, zi-mi Rocco
Sifredi sau Titus Steel
E la figurat, hai nu fii figurant
Ca s-ar putea sa pleci desfigurat
Pana te lasi de gesticulat
Invata limbajul articulat
E 2015 inca te pisi pe tine
Cu rime care nu pot sa miste
Toti sunteti niste maimutoi
Cereti atentie ca p***, voi
Vorbiti de c****, ouale moi
Purtati tricouri ca fetele, boy
Nu poti sa-mi declari mie razboi
Cand tu esti vai de steaua ta, Mirel Radoi
Stai, pune mic-u' jos
Lasa Hip-Hopu' ca ne-am intors
Am sute de linii de tras cu rechinii
Oltenii sunt primii voi capu' jos!
Stai, pune mic-u' jos
Lasa Hip-Hopu' ca ne-am intors
Am sute de linii de tras cu rechinii
Oltenii sunt primii voi capu' jos!Cu asta am facut revolutia, cu asta v-am facut oameni, cu asta te-mpusc...

Si pe timp de pace raman acelasi luptator
E nevoie de un efort enorm
Sa va deschidem ochii mari ca dupa cloroform
Ne-ntoarcem la radacini
Cu imnu' pasiunii pure nimeni nu poa' sa-l fure...
Nu mai depindem de nimeni, ne hranim din multime
O sa revendicam singuri tot ce ne-apartine!

Hit the blue and im off to the moon
It feels so right, yeah
I’m down for the ride
Let the dream take over your mind
And travel light, light
Hoping to fall into ecstasy
I want it to get the best of me
I know there’s levels I’m tryna go deeper
Third eye wide open off of that sativa
Soul lifted up can’t see no low

Dreaming of whatever I like
Till it comes to life, life

Just to start the week off
Working sometimes
Take up too much space in my head
I’m leaving my clothes off
Ain't put no make up on

HEY, DON'T YOU KNOW?O noapte albă-n față avem, avem, avem
Ceva rece la gheață avem, avem, avem
Regrete dimineață avem, avem, avem
Doar o singură viață avem, avem, avem
Sunt din nou cu ai mei la un pahar de, la niște sticle de
Ceva bun, că pe gât ne arde
Recomandabil și la sănătate
Dacă nu, hai măcar să ne urăm sănătate!
La ora asta, sunt cu toți, frate
N-am nevoie de vreo piedică să cad pe spate
Am nevoie de-o nebunatică să mă care-n spate
Când 'om pleca de-aici, mâine noapte, mâine noapte
Un fleac, m-au ciuruit cu niște shoturi de tequila
Sau ne-au ciuruit, că-l văd praf și pe Phila
Măcar să-l văd doar io, c-ar fi cam trist
S-ajungă să fie tras pe nas de vreun fotbalist
Ospătar, vino că e secetă la masă!
Chiar crezi că ne pasă dacă vrei să pleci acasă?
Ia mâna de pe scrumieră, lasă-ne cu gargara!
Aștept un cutremur să-mi scuture țigara
O noapte albă-n față avem, avem, avem
Ceva rece la gheață avem, avem, avem
Regrete dimineață avem, avem, avem
Doar o singură viață avem, avem, avem
Mă scuzați dacă deranjez, pot să mai stau
N-am nici o treabă, zău, da' numa' nu-mi da să beau!
Eh, dacă tot insiști, dă-mi decât să gust...
Știi că peste patru ore tu ești mort, io încă gust
Tratez orice pahar cu unghiul necesar
Să fie doar perpendicular pe buze
Rog fetele să mă scuze
Că m-am rătăcit repetat sub bluze
Azi învățăm litera J, copii
Adică: Jim, Jack, Johnny sau J&B
O ardem și plini de harfe, dacă ne permitem
Suntem deschiși cam la de toate, permite-mi
Să te combin la încă una de la rece
Hai, frate, că merge și zău de n-am sânge
Pentru ce? Să fiu p******l! Mă, te-mbătași?
P******, frate, c-o bebelușă de la Cârcotași
O noapte albă-n față avem, avem, avem
Ceva rece la gheață avem, avem, avem
Regrete dimineață avem, avem, avem
Doar o singură viață avem, avem, avem
Am zis că trag tare, bag mare
Nu mai văd, da'-mi rup muia-n continuare
Bag cu sare și mi se pare că văd vreo două animale
Cu care m-aș lua un pic la încercare
Cele mai multe p***-l caută pe Mista' Lova
Da' n-au aflat că io-s plecat în deplasare la Craiova
Unde explodează bomba, unde explodează blonda
Fiindcă-n morții ei, așa e moda!
Haide, n-o da de parcă nu știi vorba
Bunica bate toba până-ți sare ție ciorba
Noi scoatem fum exact ca soba
Și Byga-i pe sub masă, cre' c-o caută sigur pe blonda
Rashid e pe weed și Phila pe tequila
Io îi cunosc pe amândoi, mă combin ca asta-i șparla
Fără harfe, că n-avem, n-avem, n-avem
Da' niște boarfe vrem, harem, harem, haremLyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been releasedLa tête dans les calculs, j'sais plus sur qui compter
Pas d'temps mort sur l'rain-té, pourtant il est hanté
N'essaye pas d'y rentrer, tu vas pas t'en sortir
J'reviens d'loin, Siannalicente
J'ramène d'la frappe en mode Go Fast, qu'est-ce tu veux que la concu' fasse
J'accélère j'enchaîne les passes, tu vois bien que je mets la gomme
Je les efface, j'laisse place
Laisse place, à la recherche de l'espèce
La richesse commence par les p'tites pièces
On est tous en manque d'espace
A peine commencer, j'ai déjà envie d'les terminer
Il n'y aura pas de d'élimineur, à l'heure qu'il est c'est terminé
En ce moment je suis sur les nerfs j'ai envie de les éliminer
J'ai un flow à la Eminem je les vois tous halluciner
J'pose du C4, appelle les démineurs
Faut pas faire de faux pas sur un terrain miné
Comme la mort tu sais j'arrive toujours à l'heure
J'vais les monter en l'air, j'vais au charbon comme un mineur
 x2
Mon avenir entre mes mains, le volant entre mes doigts
J'fais du Rap sans frontières, j'force le péage à la douane
Chargé comme un Go Fast 
1,2,1,2,1,2 test micro, sur le terrain pas de matchs amicaux
C'est tellement le feu dans mes concerts, ils voudraient que je rappe à huit clos
Arrêtes de porter l'oeil, tu vas finir cyclope
Ça fait le warrior en roue arrière, les keufs sur les côtes
Les keufs sur les côtes
Le savoir est une arme je l'ai appris à l'école
Je l'ai appris à l'école, avant que je te monte en l'air, va falloir que tu décolles
Décales en bécane, percé par le bruit du deux-temps
J'allume la mèche il faut que ça détonne, ça t'étonne
Trop en avance, pourtant je rappe bien dans les temps
J'suis sur le terrain, tu fais deux tours de piste
La concu n'a pas le niveau comme la tour de Pise

Suntem tot aici, tot aici, tot aici *2

I'm wearing your last embrace
Like a cold quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be cold and thirsty
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be cold and thirsty
I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten no protest
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be bored and lonely
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be bored and lonely
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste linger left on lips
I'm tasting your sweet kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers left on lips
So when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be sober and unkissed
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Cause soon I'll be sober and unkissed
Oh, when are you coming?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Oh, when are you coming around?
Come around
When are you coming?Imi spui c-am vicii 
Dar iti placeau la inceput
Nu-ti plac amicii 
Dar de la ei m-ai cunoscut
Imi spui ca beau si cand beau
Nu mai stiu ce vorbesc
Spui ca fumez, dar fumez
Doar ca sa ma relaxez
Ma parasesti, apoi te intorci
Spui ca de fapt ma iubesti
De fapt te joci cu nervii mei
Nici nu mai stiu ce gandesti
A fost frumos, da' ce-i frumos
Stii ca dureaza putin
Totul era lapte si miere
Acum e numai venin
 x2
Vreau sa te uit
De-aia beau pana uit
Unde stau ca ma uit
Cum te pierd si mor usor
Singuratate, strange-ma-n brate tare
Poarta-ma iute catre uitare
E-asa de frig aici unde-am ramas
Cutite reci arunci din glas
Si am aflat durerea
Si-am ascultat tacerea
Si nu pricep placerea ta
De-a ma tortura intr-una
Ura nu e totuna cu amoru'
Trecutu' mi-e viitoru'
Cat de lung e coridoru'-n care devii amintire
Desi ochii tai inca soptesc iubire
"Maine e-o noua zi", da' e-n zadar
E-o noua zi in care sufar iar
La hotar: patima sau despartire
Te rog lasa-mi inima sa respireWell I live here with you
In, in a kind of "yes, will do"
Oh what part of now don't you understand
I'm showing you well apparent
Yeah I get the bluff if I'll get out
No room for three, you, me and your doubts
One of us has got to leave
And it'll sure be me
And I think we could have a situation
We could have a situation
Any reason we can't just settle around now
Yeah, ok, and how?
Rather than shout and praise
 with them, not without 
Oh, what part of our old tune don't you understand
I think I made it clear that you're in the mend
In the mend
Oh, we could have a situation
Oh, we could have a situationHello

Helloالهی خم نشی، وقتی که دردات
روی شونه ت مثِ یه کوله باره
تو میتونی بری، از پا نیوفتی
دیگه این راه برگشتن نداره
مسیر زندگی مثل یه روده
که آخر دل به دریا می سپاره
اگه بالا و پایین داره امّا
تهش حس رسیدن موندگاره
قبولش کن اگه حتی شکستی
نگو، «هرگز»، امیدت میره از دست
تو میتونی بری و پر بگیری
اگه شوق رهایی تو دلت هست
نگو، «هرگز»، امیدت میره از دست
مبادا وقت رفتن کم بیاری
مسیر زندگی مثل یه روده
که یعنی راهی جز رفتن نداری
برو تا آخر دنیا سفر کن
سفر کن تا دلت آروم بگیره
سفر مثل یه مرهم دل نشینه
نذار حسش توی قلبت بمیره
مسیر زندگی مثل یه روده
که آخر دل به دریا می سپاره
اگه بالا و پایین داره امّا
تهش حس رسیدن موندگاره

'Cause I've been wondering for far too long
How to cure my sorrow 
The kind of high
That makes me feel alive
And then I start to wonder
Is it ever gonna be alright?
I've seen it all, I've seen it all
I'm still young and restless
How foolish can you be?
There's no room to hide
'Cause I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't no wrong that's gonna last forever
I'm no fool to cry
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't so strong
If doesn't bring us together
Let the shelter burn
You were hiding there
Far too long
Worried 'bout tomorrow
Confused inside
But not afraid to try
'Cause we are not numbers
Playing just another song
I've seen it all, I've seen it all
I'm still young and restless
How foolish can you be?
There's no room to hide
'Cause I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't no wrong that's gonna last forever
I'm no fool to cry
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't so strong
If doesn't bring us together
Life is not easy, it is not, don't try and make it that way
Life is not fair, it never was, it isn't now, it won't ever be
Do not fall into the trap, the entitlement trap
Of feeling like you're a victim
You're not
There's no room to hide
'Cause I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't no wrong that's gonna last forever
I'm no fool to cry
Yeah, I know
I know, I know, know better
Ain't so strong
If doesn't bring us togetherY’a ceux qui ont peur du droit chemin, ceux qui ont pas le permis
Qui m’aiment me suit n’a pas le vertige
Henné-Hennessey, j’roule sur mes ennemis
Peu importe la cérémonie j’ai le cœur terni
J’apprends à lire et à écrire entre les lignes
Souhaite une longue vie à ceux qui savent que la vie est dure
J’peux tout rendre magique, tout faire briller
J’blesse la vérité, les fils de pute c’est dans leur gènes de se faire niquer

Clean, E.S. E.S

J’ai quitté la maison passe de deux à quatre, seize ans
Presque plaisant, quand j’écoute ma raison mieux vaut piller dans la caisse que d’cracher dans la soupe
S’faire tirer dans la tête que d’glisser dans la douche
J’fais qu’des images pour illustrer mes tirades
Au large comme des pirates, quoi d’neuf sur le rivage
Ils disent que la route est longue, sont là à freiner dans les virages
Et tu croyais aux miracles? Y’a qu’des mirages
Des étoiles dans l’ciel qui nous regardent et qui ricanent
J’fais pas la gueule, j’ai juste un masque sur le visage
Pour mieux endormir les putes et les fils de pute, les gens sont bizarres
Clean, yo
J’suis foncé, j’suis foncé, j’suis foncé
Merde, les racistes essayent de bronzer 
J’suis jeune, j’suis français
C’que j’aime, tout niquer écrire quand j’suis fonce-dé

Chiche, riche avant 30 piges

The way that you're climbing inside me
How could I ever deny you
The way that you never deny me

How can I open and find you
And feel you the way that you want me to feel
I want you to know what I'm thinking of
I want you to read my mind before I write it
I want you to know that I have stories to tell

Then I’m glad you hating
Ex man was a simp

Fuck 12

Fuck jail, got my cousin in cuffs and chains man

PerfectEverybody wants to be a wolf, oh
Anyone'll become prey, oh-oh
Don't make it easy, baby
You know I like to chase
So keep, go wild, 'cause I don't need them down
'Cause I won't be around long enough for them to fall
Baby, this is what it is, another week, another chance
To let me go, to let me in
I feel the wolf for you
Or are you gonna lose sleep wishin' this was something more?
I can't do more, is it a love for you?
Or are you tellin' friends that you can't do this anymore?
Anymore
This is a row when we straight lines
Just play your part and I'll play mine
'Cause they'll throw roses when we're done
It's lookin' different in the daylight
If you're tired of waitin' at this red light
Then move on, stay 'round, keep your
Walls, 'cause I don't need them down
I won't be around long enough for them to fall
Baby, this is what it is, another week, another chance
To let me go and let me in
Is it enough for you?
Or are you gonna lose sleep wishin' this was something more?
I can't do more, is it a love for you?
Or are you tellin' friends that you can't do this anymore?
Anymore
It's on you, up to you, I'm alight 
After you, all on you, up to you, I'm alright 
After you, it's on you, it's up to you 
I'm on you Something's wrong and I can feel it
And if the surface tension breaks
Then we will drown here in it all
'Cause you can't look me in the eye anymore
But if you do it's clear inside
You're fighting in the wood
But you can't hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say
So hush now, and don't cry
Mistakes are part of life
I wasn't born yesterday
And I see it on your face
I wasn't born yesterday
And I am not your baby anymore
You took my heart and now it's broken
So take your things, you gotta go now
Don't say a word, or it might go down, go down, go down
And I'll stay cool until you walk out
But when you're gone I'll lie here hoping that I will not drown
But you can't hide, your shame tonight
And I can't take the words you cannot say
So hush now, and don't cry
Mistakes are part of life
I wasn't born yesterday
And I see it on your face
I wasn't born yesterday
And I am not your baby anymore
You took my heart and now it's broken
I ain’t your baby anymore
Don’t call me baby
Don’t say a word because I know
Don’t call me baby
I ain’t your baby anymore
Don’t call me baby
So save the word because I know
Don’t call me babyByga:
Arici Pogonici, pai ce faci ma pe-aici?
Uite-ma cum dau iama-n futicioasele-astea mici
Piu, piu, piu, e rost de pasarici
N-am cont pe Hi5, am pe hai sictir de-aici
Ne-asortam minunat, ne-aproba si ofticosii
Eu mereu cu ochii rosii, tu cu genunchii rosii
Hai c-am terminat, doua minute, imediat
Doamne, fata mea, da' ce ne potrivim la pat
Lirica am, lirica dau, lirica vrei, lirica iei
Cat ma tin plamanii-astia ai mei
Si nu scriu de ieri, am scris inca din pantec
Ca m-am nascut cu cantec.. m-a-ntampinat tata cu lautari
Iar peste ani, inopinant, m-am tampit atata-ntre-atatia oameni mari
Tot lautari... si la final intr-un exces de politete
Tot va dau binete, ura si fuga la zdrente!

Hai sa vorbim despre activitati nocturn-matinale
Fara trucaje, silicoane sau efecte speciale
Nimeni nu e interesat de defectele tale
Ne iese whisky prin piele, da' gatu' cere, e jale
Nu e momentul sa ma intrebi de cui oricum e arssss
Scrumul ramas acum e tras pe nasss
Nu ma combin din principiu la dava zic passss
Ma simt atras de ciocolata cu rom de pe boxa de bassssss
Sssssssa mor mai vreau
Nu ofer nimic in plus mai mult decat pot sa-ti dau
Auzi vorbim dupa ce termin, promit sa mai stau
Acum trebuie sa cant, sa beau, sa beau
Nu o ardem pe ritmuri cica cicalaca cica la
Muzica stii ca incita gagica cica e boala
Arunca toala adica cica toata lumea e goala
Implica risc pe disc cand pic ca cica se despica sala

Tot prefer o noapte alba nu un pui de somn
Ce viata de caine
Nu lasa pe maine ce poti sa faci poimaine-n
Miez de noapte batem in usi la haimanale
Buna fetele, am venit sa ne dam tarcoale
Hai s-alergam o raita
Si-nc-o raita, stim ca esti haita
Dintre sticle si tone de scrum
Hai s-auzim cum se crapa de ziua acum

Augmente le volume, c'est maintenant qu'ça s'passe
J'viens prendre le brassard, fuck le capitaine 
J'ai trouvé le rap, j'ai pas trouvé d'taff
C'est soit le travail soit l'était qui paye 
J'ai fait l'tour d'la France, elle est magnifique 
Elle est bien plus belle que c'que les médias disent 
Ils veulent nous diviser, mais il faut qu'on résiste
Ils attendent un faux pas et ils le médiatisent 
Fuck ! C'est négatif
J'ai fait un bout d'chemin, maintenant j'dois faire la diff 
Fuck ! J'suis dans le six
Hier ils m'ignoraient, maintenant ils m'font la biiise
Okay, okay, ouvre, grand, tes oreilles 
Il est temps d'remmetre les pendules à l'heure 
Et j'ai plus l'état d'âme avec eux depuis qu'je sais qu'ils ont vendu la leur, mais fuck
J'suis dans le bendo là 
J'ai été adopté, j'peux pas abandonner 
Tu peux parler sur moi, t'inquiète pas, j'ais l'dos large
J'ai perdu des amis à qui j'ai tout donné
J'repète
J'suis dans le bendo là

R.I.P., personne n'a résisté 
Fuck la mala, les carées VIP, moi, j'veux voir la Mama à bord d'un gros féfé, car dans la vie on a que c'qu'on  a mérité
Tout l'monde se ment, y a plus d'réalité, mais c'est pas grave, en vrai, on s'est tous habitué , fuck la quantité, on veut la qualité

Guiness Book of World Record
I hold the seraphin Shady
You know we love hip hop baby
I took the 360 day field trip to the Milky Way
All expense paid hip hop holiday
The audio blaze I'm physically engaged
Visually the display changed to a spiritual
Collisional cascade
When I rap this way
Generation X, Generation RTJ
I praise the creator for doing me a favor
My theta waves translate into some dark thoughts on paper
Personal labor  in the pyramid chamber
Concentratin'  on  the prime dwarf and the doomsday danger
Propulsion attraction propulsion action
Taos in New Mexico is where they closed rappers
Revolution right here raise that ratchet
To blow you out the bracket
Rip the Jacker
M-Eighty
Rhymes are incitin' greatness
Hitler teachin' youth with these track on your playlist
Run circles in these aces
Hip hop basics these laces
Fitted for fitness like the Matrix
Got my dame dash in the stash
By your anklet
Revolvers a must  prime revelation
Patience a virtue to murk you
Unearth you
Tactics I print like Cs ease the body  crew
Botty Boy Boom bash
Shotty blast killer rap
Militant Matter of rap Rip the Jacker is Back
Click clack comstacks
Quick tracks outlast
And the emcee in my path
Who's master's not amassed the wealth
Knowledge born college dorm
Where Neil Arm spit fire!
The cajun corridor time for   in the commons
We bombin' 'em and  such a charmin'
You will see the architect designin' the future of rhymin'Had to go and block your number over again

Matagal na rin kitang gustong makita
Mula nung ako ay bata pa
Pangarap na kitang makasama
Kya ikaw na ba yan o santa?

Saming bubong ay dahan-dahan pa
Meron ka bang dala-dala at ako'ng bubuhat, pwede ba?
Sa pag bibigay ng regalo ay tutulungan ka

At sasakay sa karwahe na lumilipad sa gabi
Hilang mga reindeer na si Rudolf ang bida sa byahe

Balbas saradong mama at nakapula
T'wing sa pasko ikaw ang kilala
Pero 'di naman nakikita
Kaya ikaw na ba yan o Santa?
Ikaw na ba 'yan o Santa?
Bakit sa mukha ay may medyas ka pa?
At iba ang 'yong kinakarga

Pati ang konti kong pera'y dinagit pa

Nangayayat at mukhang naghirap na
At dapat ng mag-ingat sa kanya

With someone new beside you
Guess we had the same idea
Cause I’m with someone else who’s
Got his arms around my waste
Like she’s all up in your face
We both hate a PDA
But we love to play this game
I know that you’re tryna make me jealous
Cause you know what my idea of hell is
And i’m not seeing anyone elsе, but I couldn’t help myself
You know I’m just tryna make you jealous 
How the hell did we get here, this toxic situation
Wish that they would disappear
They were just for decoration
But I won’t be the first to say
That we made a big mistake
Wipe her lipstick off your face
God I hate this stupid game
I know that you’re tryna make me jealous
Cause you know what my idea of hell is 
And i’m not seeing anyone else, but I couldn’t help myself
You know I’m just tryna make you jealous
J-e-a-l-o-u-s hmmm it gets to me, hmmm it’s killing me
This is what we both do best, jealous you’re making me, I’m making you jealous
I know that you’re tryna make me jealous
Cause you know what my idea of hell is
And I’m not seeing anyone else, but I couldn’t help myself
You know I’m just tryna make you jealousBreak the last of my heart while we fight
And leave the past behind
I'm trying to get through
All the things we screwed
I don't mind, save your lies, burn them down
What we need is time
And more than me and you
Saying "yes, it's true"
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
Make it fast, realize all this crap
Is six feet underground
I have to say I knew
But, what is wrong with you?
Such a blast in our lives turned to dust
What's this all about?
There's something left to do
Now is up to you!
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
We can see from within
We're brothers with the stars tonight
I believe there's no need
Or reason that could break us down
Now we know where we belong
All that we can leave behind
We're brothers with the stars tonight

Tanto non lo scelgo io come il televoto 
Dimenticano l'h e dicono: "È arte"
Sai, mica c'è una laurea per i babbi 
Okay, fanno: "Beh, per il market" 
Di me dicono goat come Sgarbi
Che c'ho la maturità ma poi ritardo 
Frate', sì, che è una casualità quando faccio lo zaino
Tipo che senza la squadra non lo passo l'anno 
Faccio come fa un po' l'Italia con il calcio, dai mo
Che c'ho la maturità ma poi ritardo 
Frate', sì, che è una casualità quando faccio lo zaino
Tipo che senza la squadra non lo passo l'anno
Faccio come fa un po' l'Italia con il calcio 
Sto nel bus, up 
Vado liscio più di burro 
Tutto l'anno è come luglio 
Il tuo album è bello come al buio 
Sto nel bus, up
Vado liscio più di burro 
Tutto l'anno è come luglio 
Il tuo album è bello come al buio
Brr
Ho il burro nella giacca
Lei mi ha già capito
Su una Jaguar antica
Flow che gioca, rido come pochi
Volti vuoti, voti nuovi, suoni
Il mio cuore va a fuoco come il bus, oh
Bus, oh
Senza ticket niente lusso
Più sto in para per il controllore
Affronto e imparo, scenate come la D'Urso, ah
Yah-ah 
Con Siaga mi fermano e dicon: "Yah-ah"
Collabora a meno che sei una guardia 
Conta ancora almeno se poi mi guardi, ah, yeah
Non ho il biglietto ma ho il flow
Appena sale prenoto
Non mi nota, mami, che culo
Mi lavi, te curo
Ogni barra che suona, frate', ma-ma
Dammi lei, giuro, che sbavi a me, chiudo
Mollami, non la molla 
Volare in aria come bolla 
Spero mi tolga dai follow 
Forse c'ho una follia
Parlo di flow, yah-ah
Ma sul bus prima la folla
Ora non vola una foglia, eh 
Mollami, non la molla
Volare in aria come bolla 
Spero mi tolga dai follow 
Forse c'ho una follia
Parlo di flow, yah-ah
Ma sul bus prima la folla
Ora non vola una foglia, eh 
Sto nel bus, up 
Vado liscio più di burro 
Tutto l'anno è come luglio 
Il tuo album è bello come al buio 
Sto nel bus, up
Vado liscio più di burro 
Tutto l'anno è come luglio 
Il tuo album è bello come al buio
Bus, up 
Burro 
Luglio 
Come al buio 
Bus, up
Burro, brah
Luglio, uh, woof-woof
Bello come al buio
Okay{Refrain]
Ne t'en fais pas, pour moi, tu m'as bien éduquée
Tu seras fière de moi, je me bat pour t'honorer
Tu peux dire à, papa, que je nage sans bouée
Si je tombe dans le vide, je vais me relever
Maman
A trop être déçue des autres on finit par tout faire sois même
Y a qu'sur sa mère qu'on peut compter, j'ferais tout pour qu'elle soit reine
Je m'en fou de vos soirée people moi j'veux juste faire ma musique
Sortir un max de single jamais taffer a l'usine
Et c'est le rap qui m'a choisit, et maintenant me voici
Ma philosophie dans mon art comme Leonard de Vinci
Besoin d'apprendre de nouvelles choses, pour pouvoir avancer
J'ai d'jà les murs de mon avenir j'ai plus qu'a l'agencer
Mais c'est facile à dire et c'est bien plus dur à faire
Tout ce qu'on ce tue à gagner en fait et si facile à perdre
Le temps, l'argent, le pouvoir, tout ce dont l'homme est avare
Ne t'en fais pas j'ai pas d'arme, à part mon savoir
Ne t'en fais pas, pour moi, tu m'as bien éduquée
Tu seras fière de moi, je me bat pour t'honorer
Tu peux dire à, papa, que je nage sans bouée
Si je tombe dans le vide, je vais me relever
Maman
Maman, maman, ne t'en fais pas, ne t'en fais pas 
Laisse les croire que j'suis débile, ils comprennent pas mon délire
Ils me voient maigrir dite leur que j'tape pas mais que j'gratte des lignes
Si tu me voit réussir ne jalouse pas j'essaye d'faire mon trou
Surtout que j'souhaite la même pour toi, vu que c'est chacun son tour
J'voulais qu'on s'sert les coudes mais, eux, ils m'ont mis des coups
L'Homme à de nombreux vices, et chaque jours j'en découvre
Pleine d'ambition, depuis mon premier cartable
Même ruiner je marquerai l'Histoire comme à Carthage
Vous en faites pas, oui j'ai la tête sur les épaules
J'ai la main sur le cœur et je rêve de toucher les étoiles
Dites à mes proches que je ne changerai pour rien au monde
Et oui je crois en Dieu mais je n'ai pas confiance en l'Homme
Ne t'en fais pas, pour moi, tu m'as bien éduquée
Tu seras fière, de moi, je me bat pour t'honorer
Maman, maman, ne t'en fais pas, ne t'en fais pas 
Ne t'en fais pas, pour moi, tu m'as bien éduquée
Tu seras fière, de moi, je me bat pour t'honorer
Tu peux dire à, papa, que je nage sans bouée
Si je tombe dans le vide, je vais me relever
Maman
Maman, maman, ne t'en fais pas, ne t'en fais pas دارم پير مى شم ولى عاشقم
جهانم پر از حس و حال توئه
همه خنده ها دلنشينن ولى
فقط بهترين خنده مال توئه
دارم پير مى شم ولى عاشقم
تو اين حال و روزُ برام ساختى
با اون خنده ى دلفريبت ببين
دلم رو به چه روزى انداختى
كنارم بمون و بهم تكيه كن
به جز عشق چيزى نمى خوام ازت
كمك كن دلم قرص باشه، همين
كمك كن عزيزم، كمك كن فقط
مى خوام دل بدم، ذوب شم، بشكنم
چشام مثل ابراى پاييز شه
مى خوام زير بارون برم، خيس شم
ولى روحم از عشق لبريز شه
مى خوام تازه شم، سبز شم، گل كنم
بدونِ زمين خوردن و باختن
از اين خاطرات بَدم رد شم و
برم سمت آينده رو ساختن
كنارم بمون و بهم تكيه كن
به جز عشق چيزى نمى خوام ازت
كمك كن دلم قرص باشه، همين
كمك كن عزيزم، كمك كن فقط

        Can I even open up to ya?
Ooh
Can I sneak off in the car with ya?
Yeah
You say you like that I'm so sensitive
And when I'm moody, you just let me live
Baby, you know that I reciprocate
How was your day? And askin' if you ate
Yeah, yeah, yeah
It just might be
 It just might be
It just might be
No longer uno
No more uno, yeah
It just might be
 It just might be
No longer uno
No more uno, yeahКогда ты станешь умным,твоя музыка для глупых
В школе одни двойки,проведёшь все лето дома
Мама заберёт тебя с разборок очень трудных
Папа снова задвигает речи про районы
Мама Папа,мама мама Папа! Родители не правы эй вы сейчас не правы
Иду к мечте,забираю трофей
Забил на уроки,мне нужно поверь
Мама прости,не такой как все
Молодой и глупый,допиваю эссе
Твоя Музыка поверь,не доедет до людей
Открываю эту дверь,КАК в последний день
Забираю весь свой гэнг
Я спускаюсь по реке
На уроки сука лень
И шихан в руке
Эй шихан в руке,эй шихан в руке
Получу по шее скалкой, я от мамы на легке
Снова Папа скажет «сын,у тебя ебаный день»
Не был на учебе сын,пора доставать ремень
Мама Папа,мама мама Папа! Родители не правы эй вы сейчас не правы
Иду к мечте,забираю трофей
Забил на уроки,мне нужно поверь
Мама прости,не такой как все
Молодой и глупый,допиваю эссе
Мама Папа,мама мама Папа! Родители не правы эй вы сейчас не правыVERSE 1:
Alone with my mind now
Reflecting on how things could have gone wrong
I stare at the ceiling
While the smell of your perfume is fading away
PRE-CHORUS:
I know we were broken But it’s so hard to let go And I remember when you Said you wouldn’t let go
CHORUS:
Now I sit, at a table in a bar and I’m looking down an empty bottle In a mix, of liquor and emotions, the truth is really hard to swallow So I sit in silence, numb from crying
And I’m stuck, living on repeat killing time as I drown my sorrows
*DROP*
VERSE 2:
Moments of darkness
I look to the past for the answers I need
Memories haunt me
I play and rewind everything that we’ve done
PRE-CHORUS:
I know we were broken But it’s so hard to let go And I remember when you Said you wouldn’t let go
CHORUS:
Now I sit, at a table in a bar and I’m looking down an empty bottle In a mix, of liquor and emotions, the truth is really hard to swallow So I sit in silence, numb from crying
And I’m stuck, living on repeat killing time as I drown my sorrows

BRIDGE:
Now I sit, at a table in a bar and I’m looking down an empty bottle
*DROP* 
Now I sit, at a table in a bar and I’m looking down an empty bottle In a mix, of liquor and emotions, the truth is really hard to swallow So I sit  in silence , numb from crying  And I’m stuck, living on repeat killing time as I drown my sorrows - Hey bro, I wanna tell U some
- Wassup bro?
- Aight, listen. If I hit the switch, i can make Yo' azz DROP!
Yo
Wykład bym Ci dał, ale czy byś tego chciał – a?
Mała, odpowiedź jest niechciana, ha
Nie robię z siebie chama
Choć wg Ciebie była to zabawa
Lub Twych koleżanek wersja oficjalna
Że widzą inny świat niż my
Że wieszają na mnie tylko psy
Że zostaw go, bo się Tobą bawi
I w pewnej chwili by nawet się zabił
… Ach, emocje kurwa
Wykrzyczałbym to na cały bulwar
Ona po jajach po smyra, a on po dupie klepie
Jest trochę szkoda, lecz tak będzie lepiej
Słów kombinacja moja, przepraszam
A końca zechciała Ona, peta dogaszam
Kuuuuuuuuuhwa, to niemożlywe
A po co po wódce lać podpiwek?
Skaaarbie, wiesz o czym mówię
Twa Cucha i mój Szeregowy to zgrany duet
Lecz Pani Kapitan się pokiełbasiło
Bo już ot tak nie wierzy w miłość
Choć, uprawiała ją z klasą
Минет zawszeee trzymał fason
Scenic odhaczony i zerwała lasso
Baj baj kochany, wolę Xsarę Picasso!
Bądź Freelandera, Imprezę lub Evo
I tak wiem, że wolisz Szeregowego
Ahh, isn't it honey?
Ni**a, no money no honey!
I ain't lyin', I wanna smacc thiz azz again
She was tasty, believe me, man!
Pękniętą gumą oraz alko historia pisana
I ktoś posmakował soku z banana
Haha! Prawda boli, kochanie?
Więc czemu nie patrzę na Ciebie, a na papier?
Na pewno nie przez to, co słyszysz teraz
A można było zacząć od zera
Pamiętasz figle przy Tedzie 2.,
Jakbyśmy byli po magicznej pigułce?
В полном кайфе płonęłaś
A czy pamiętasz jak go wyjęłaś?
Wstydu nie mieliśmy wcale
O czym Smoczyca wiedziała doskonale
Raz zadzwoniła po jedenastej
Gdy byłem we włościach Twej ciasnej
„Ach, dobra. Ach! Spoko.”
Теперь дорогая oddychaj głęboko
Chyba nie wiecie obie, że jestem Esta Loco
A nie jak Numer Raz zawsze spo -
- Koooooolczyki miałem dla Ciebie
Ojebałem je, bo byłem w potrzebie
I słów zaczyna mi być szkoda
Choć w sumie mam ochotę na hmm.. :)
Czujesz? Życie depcze wyobraźnię
Schowam Twój epizod głęboko w baśnie
I nie na Twoje, a na moje łóżko
Spuszcza mi się długopis nie na próżno!
Asów mam więcej, powiem je za hajs
By ku temu nie dopuścić, sama mi płać!
Ciebie to boli? Mnie to pierdoli!
Postąpiliśmy tylko wg Twej woli!
Myślałem chwilowo o „Kim” Eminema
Oraz na kim jeszcze można polegać...
Na pewno już nie na Tobie bejbe
Sorry, zapukam, ale nie wejdę!
- Daaaamn homie, You've burn this shit dog!
- I ain't lyin' dog, it was real, kno' I'm sayin'?
- Yea, I got U man
- Yea, U kno' me. Remember bitch, I DON'T FUCK WITCHUU!!Hindi mo ba alam na ako'y nasasaktan
Sa tuwing ikaw ay aalis at hindi nag paalam
Nais kong malaman mo na ako'y nag tatampo
Pag nalimutan mo ang pasalubong ko
Hindi mo ba alam na ako'y nasasaktan
Pag nakikita kitang may ibang ka kwentuhan
Nais kong malaman mo na ako'y nandirito
Pwede ba ako kahit maki usyoso
Chorus
Ngunit pag sapit ng gabi heto ka sa 'king tabi
Sa pag ibig mo 'di ako nag sisisi
At pag gising sa umaga maamo mong
Mukha ang nakikita
Na sa akin ay lubos na nagpa-paligaya
Hindi mo ba alam na ako'y nasasaktan
Sa tuwing ika'y na lulungkot at mata ay luhaan
Nais kong malaman mo yan ay pupunasan ko
Sa katapatan ng pagmamahal ko sa iyo
Repeat Chorus
Solo Guitar
Repeat Chorus
Hindi mo ba alam?لحظه ای با من باش
تا از آن لحظه برویم
تا گل که ببندم از نگاه تو
به هر ستاره پل
لحظه ای با من باش
تا که از تو نفسی تازه کنم
تا از آن لحظه ی با تو
سفر آغاز کنم
سفری تا ته بیشه های سرسبز خیال
تا به دروازه های شهر آرزوهای محال
سفری در خم و پیچ گذر ستاره ها
از میون دشت پر خاطره ی ترانه ها
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
تا به باغ چشم تو
پنجره ای باز کنم
از تو شعر و قصه و
ترانه ای ساز کنم
شعری همصدای بارون
رنگ سبز جنگل و آبی دریا
قصه ای به رنگ و عطر قصه های عاشقای دنیا
از یه لحظه تا همیشه
میشه از تو پر گرفت تا اوج ابرا
کوچه پس کوچه شهر و
با خیالت پرسه زد تا مرز فردا
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
تا از آن لحظه برویم
تا گل که ببندم از نگاه تو
به هر ستاره پل
لحظه ای با من باش
تا که از تو نفسی تازه کنم
تا از آن لحظه ی با تو
سفر آغاز کنم
سفری تا ته بیشه های سرسبز خیال
تا به دروازه های شهر آرزوهای محال
سفری در خم و پیچ گذر ستاره ها
از میون دشت پر خاطره ی ترانه ها
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
لحظه ای با من باش
... لحظه ای با من باشE timpu sa luam inapoi strazile
Adunati brigazile
Auzi cum rasuna sirenele
Cand te rup iara ca trenele
Tot pe baricade
Rima tot nebuna cade
Mai ai nevoie si de M. C
Atatia baieti cumsecade
Haide haide...
Pune pumnu sus in uppercut
Sa vedem impreuna
Cum sar din ghete rapperi de c***t
Tot musti din microfoane
Cu pofta, cand dau cu sete
Tot foc pun pe foaie
Foc original juvete
Ia-l pe FiliPili
Afili, afilimon
Provine Craiova ne bate nu din Pantelimon
Nu ne zice "sia" "cia"
Ca nu vorbesti d-ai mei
Hai sa incercam pe litere
Zice: C I A
Tot la curent cu tot
Oltenii inca pot
Meltenii toti scot
Dar nu e rapp deloc
In FM acelasi refren
Prost, prea soft da-ne hip hop pe post
Una
Strada numai una
Scena numai una si una
Ramane pasiunea
Intotdeauna
In viata numai una
Muzica e una
Si nu am de gand acum sa abandonez nici... x2
Stii ca n-o s-o lasi
Stii ca n-o, n-o
Stii ca n-o
Stii ca n-o s-o las x4
E rappcore
Pe cord deschis, mor
Nu raman dator
Livrez din Craiovita pana-n Dristor
Direct din laborator HaHaHa
Vine spre consumator
Rima e grea nu uita
Nu te las
Stii ca nu te las
Cat am glas
O sa zbier
Numai eu stiu cat am tras
Ca sa ies din cartier
Nu ma las
Stii ca nu ma las
Pentru el reprezint
La cel mai inalt nivel
Una
Strada numai una
Scena numai una si una
Ramane pasiunea
Intotdeauna
In viata numai una
Muzica e una
Si nu am de gand acum sa abandonez nici... x2
Stii ca n-o s-o lasi
Stii ca n-o, n-o
Stii ca n-o
Stii ca n-o s-o las x4You turned him down
And baby you fall
A little piece of you
And it's a piece left in tact
A part that won't act
But it's overdue
So, you could just fail
You could lower your tail
And just lay down to die
But a sliver of hope
And a dream to elope
So sees my good eye
And I
I see your infinite and I
I see your definite
You push that shapeshifting smile
And as your defense falls
Like your castle walls
It comes crashing down
It comes crashing down
But I heal you
You don't want love anymore
But you're drowning, oh
And I feel you
You shut love out evermore
Peace surrounds you, oh
So, you could just fail
You could lower your tail
Don't just lay down to dieHindi nila naririnig hinanaing sa barung-barong
Dahil palasyo nilay may matibay na bubong
Hindi nila naririnig mga kumakalam na tyan
Hindi tulad nila ng mesa nilang parang laging may handaan
Ikaw ba? Naririnig mo ba sila ikaw ba?
Chorus
Gawin langit ang mundo makakaya natin to
Sa simula ikaw at ako tapos sila
Hanggang maging lahat na tayo
Oh kay gandang masdan sa bawat taong
Nagugutom at nahihirapan meron kang
Matutulungan gawing langit ang mundo
Wala silang pakiramdam sa nangyayaring kaguluhan
Basta mabulsa lang nila ang kaban ng ating bayan
Wala silang pakiramdam magkaroon man ng digmaan
Kapangyarihan na nilang gawin tayong tao-tauhan
Ikaw ba? Nadarama mo ba ito ikaw ba?
Habang maaga pa kahit man lang
Sa kapakanan ng iba ng mga bata'ng maglalakihan makikinabang sa ating maiiwanan na pagmamahalanLa fel ca tine aveam tovarasi
Cu care poate nu mai sunt tovaras
Intre timp am ajuns sa fim cunostinte
Realmente inconstienti de consecinte
Oameni simpli, simple suferinte
Apropiati, diferiti in atatea privinte
Destine pline de dorinte
Atat de triste intinate de neputinte
Am cunoscut multa lume, oameni de sprit
Oameni de glume, oameni cu nume
Oameni ce nu se lasa ghidati de sume
Oameni ce nu-s teleghidati de alta lume
Intre multi e inca vrajba
Tu cand se apropie aproapele ai grija cine-i prin preajma
Eu mai cred in umanitate
Atata timp cand nu-ti accepti conditia de normalitate
Refren:
Oameni ca noi
Oameni normali
Oameni simpli dar speciali 
Strofa 2:
Vad oameni nemultumiti cam peste tot
Un fel de fel de motive incat nu pot
Sa nu atrag atentia ca ne-am indepartat deja
Noi ne-am distras atentia
De la multe aparent neinsemnate
Lucruri marunte dar nestemate
Cel mai usor e sa complici apar tample carunte, riduri pe frunte
Nu prea vinde chesti marunte, si cand se aduna multe vrute, nevrute
O lume de ingeri intr-o lume de brute
Caut o cale catre simplitate, catre modestine nu vreau banalitate
Cer oameni sinceri fara obligatii, oricum o sa fac ce vreau eu nu ce vor altii
M-asez pe un scaun sa avem o conversatie
Un zambet intre oameni e cea mai buna conversatie
Refren:
Oameni ca noi
Oameni normali
Oameni simpli dar speciali 
Strofa 3:
Azi e joi e 0 1 2
Cred ca-i 2 si ceva
Pe cas e 14:22
Scriu pe coltul unei foi noi
Eu oameni normali, voi nu oameni ca noi
Aici nu sunt eroi, eroi sunt doar in filme
Aici sunt oameni simpli, dorinta de mai bine
Aici avem nevoi, da' navem nevoie de nimeni
Sa ne transforme in orbi si sa ne spuna cu cine
Ar fi bine sa votam, ce-ar fi bine sa mancam
Cate ore sa lucram cat de des sa facem s*x sa nu suprapopulam
Vreau oameni normali in jurul meu
Oare cer prea mult e atat de greu
Sa primesc ce ofer cand iti cer fara sa strig sa zbier
Vreau oameni normali in jurul meu
Oare cer prea mult e atat de greu
Sa primesc ce ofer cand iti cer fara sa strig sa zbier
Refren:
Oameni ca noi
Oameni normali
Oameni simpli dar speciali 
Oamenii ca noi, oameni normali
Oameni simpli dar speciali 
Oameni ca noi, oameni ca noi
Oameni simpli, simpli dar specialiKahit ano basta ikaw
Walang problema
Kahit buhay ibibigay
Ito'y pangako ko sinta
Dahil ayokong malayo sa 'yo
Magmukha man akong gago
Pagkat minamahal kita
O giliw ko
Kahit ano basta ikaw
Ay aking susundin
Kahit bituin susungkitin
Wag lang akong mabibitin
Siguro ay wala na akong
Dapat pang ipangamba
Sa ganitong paraan
Di mo na 'ko iiwan pa
Peksman, mamatay man
Basta't iyong kagustuhan
Hindi magdadalawang isip
Ika'y aking pagbibigyan
Buong oras ko
Iuukol lamang sa 'yo
Bulaklak para sa iyo
Piso tumpok ang bili ko
May kasama pang lobo
Kahit ano basta ikaw
Matutupad ang pangarap
Kahit hirap ay sasarap
Habang ako ay kayakap
Huwag ka sanang maniwala
Sa sinasabi nila
Hindi mo ba nakikita
Sa aking mga mata?

Tumingin ka kung saan
Kikislap ang 'yong mga mata

And you should know she's a freaka
But you won't hear a peep
I am a beast and a menace
If you get offended
Respond you'll regret it
They do not like me
Just spite me
For being like Nike
Bitch I just go do it
Wait
Really you stupid for thinking niggas are politicking are on the same mission
Listen
I'll bully a wannabe
I reached my own peak in like 2017
Wanna be the next with your flexing
Test me
I could make your dream girl pregnant
Hate in my heart so restless
Rock-less necklace
Looking like a hippie on xanax
Please talk shit with the lean that you sip
Got a white bitch
A nigga still whipped
Ain't on a wave but I nigga still drip
Drip, drip, drip
Shit so wet I could get a little sip
Caution tape, don't trip
Walk on the edge of a roof
I rock this chain like a noose
Live like a corpse in a womb
Cause I am the heartless truth
Written and told in the booth
Cherish and value your youth
Soon
Caution tape round your room
Caution tape round a room
Caution tape round a room
Caution tape round a room
I will forever be hated cause I am the truthDisaster

We are the bastards
We are not the sons in law
There’s no time for waiting
We’re the underdogs
We are the bastards
We are the sons in law
There’s no time for waiting
We´re the underdogsLike a new winter's coat
I'm wearing your last embrace
Like a cold quenching glass of water
I hold a clear picture of your face
Where are you? 
Where are you? 
Where are you?
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty
Soon I'll be cold and thirsty
I'm hearing your last telephone call
Ringing louder and clearer than the rest
I hear your invitation to see it all
Better written I am smitten no protest
Where are you? 
Where are you? 
Where are you?
Soon I'll be bored and lonely
Soon I'll be bored and lonely
Like a story well told
Your conversation can hold me or soothe me
Like a funny time to share you were there
And your comfort and support me
Where are you? 
Where are you?
Soon I'll be restless and weary
Soon I'll be restless and weary
Like another man
I want hold you within me
Like a good day without care
I just want you to last
I just want you to last
I'm tasting the last glass of your wine
The sweet taste linger left on lips
I think of your kisses with mine
The sweet taste lingers left on lips
Where are you? 
Where are you? 
Where are you?
Soon I'll be sober and unkissed
Soon I'll be sober and unkissedSomehow it went the wrong way
Hope I didn’t go too far
Swallowed it
I’ve fallen on my own, fallen on my way
I’ll follow you to Hell
If that would make you stay
Go ahead and do your worst
Do your worst to me, baby
Go ahead and do your worst
Do your work on me now
I need you to do your worst
Do your worst to me, baby
Get what I deserve all on me
Yeah, I can take the way you put it on me
I can’t see my halo around 
Lately, I ain’t seen no halos around 
I’ve been down on my knees before
I know, I know, I know, I know
And you could put the blame all on me
And I can take the weight, put it on me
You first, yeah, you first, baby, yeah
Work, yeah, I could go to work, yeah
The worst, yeah, blessin' and a curse, yeah
On a rush, I know you on a rush
I know I’ve done a few things
And you will laugh at me
And you need a little water, baby
Please, don’t you leave me
Stay and do your worst
Do your worst to me, baby
Do your worst
Do your work on me, baby, baby
I’ll get what I deserve all on me
Yeah, I can take the weight, put it on me
Ain’t no halos on me 
Leave it all up on me
I’ve been down on my knees before
I know, I know, I know, I know, boy
Leave it all up to me STAND TALL
Stand tall for a minute
Gotta get a taste of what the air's like up here
‘Cause it taste so sweet when you’re next to me, ‘ey
Stand tall for a minute
Gotta see the scenes that I see right up here
Cause I'm feeling weak when your next me
I'm collapsing right on down to the floor
Not feeling high, not anymore
Stand tall for a minute
‘Cause that early light you see
I think your seeming so low
Stand tall for a minute
The air up here is crisper than you even know
Well I'm feeling found
While you're  feeling lost
Cause I've never had to take roads you've crossed
Nah, nah, I never had to
She said
Just fall for a minute
Gotta let those bones mellow out to the floor
‘Cause the coffees cold and I'm all alone
Just fall for a minute
My wings are far too heavy to fly
But they'll brace you when you’re caving in
Wrap them round your body and hold you so tight
I'll trade you that if you let in light
Just stall for a minute
It ain't the distance that I need
So come and meet me at home
Just fall for a minute
My confidence is thinning down, let down your rope
Well you're feeling found
While I'm feeling lost
Cause you’ve never had to take roads I’ve crossed
Nah, nah, you never had to
Stand tall, stand tall, stand tallMy mind is clear like the ocean
When the tide comes I ride the wave
I’m floating on vibes I’m so open
No stress come my way
Hear me when I say
I got the remedy no joking
You’re focused on the wrong idea
Listen here got to live
While your eyes give you light
Be not led astray
Oh I
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
I got to believe in my journey
My feet get dirty
No need to worry
There’s power running through my soul
I have no control
Hands to the source
I don’t care if you can't see my vision
My heart pours through these vibes
You should listen while I roar
Live my life watch me soar
Oh yeah, oh yeah
So there ain’t no pulling me down
No not me
Don’t feel the pressure cause my spirit’s free
You can’t come around
With your negativity
Unless you tryna grow
Then baby you should learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a little
Learn to live a little, live a littlePhila:
Orasu-l stii deja
Numele n-ai cum sa nu-l stii deja
Te vad neprotejat, de vad ramai tablou
Cand vezi ce flow dinamita te pune pe jar
E Phila, Rashid, e Byga si Hash
Ti-era dor de cum sunt oltenii pungasi
La fel e strada de sub adidasi
Indicat ar fi sa te lasi pagubas
Muzica n-o poti opri
Baieti ca noi chiar n-o sa poti opri
Indiferent ce-ar fi, roboti de-am fi
Prin piese reusim sa ramanem vii
E pentru oameni simpli
Noi simpli cantareti
Inca ne facem damblale atata timp
Cat vedem ca nu cantam pentru pereti

Rashid:
E dans murdar sau poate dans mortal
In pas de vals urban, asfalt tango sau doar balans
Nu te lasa prostit din nou
Suna diferit, balcanic destul sa ramai tablou
Io-ti dau si flow si basi si beat
Vulgar, pervers, ma lasi nu-i hit
Fa pasi grabit, ce esti tampit
N-am nevoie de tine tu ai nevoie de mine, hai flit
Nebun sa fac ce vreau cand vreau
Nebun sa beau capac cand beau
Nebun sa spun tot pe sleau
Prea bun sa pierd, nu pot nici daca vreau
Ca trec peste toate cu toate ca poate
N-am parte de toate ca toate sunt luate
Fac parte din toate pacate si fapte
Imi permit doar o viata si-o singura moarte
Traiesc prin muzica mea
Iubesc ca un latin sadea
Gandesc ca nu pot pretinde
Sa fiu pentru altu cand altu ma vinde
Pe 2 bani, prefer sa cant pentru 2 fani
Sa-inteleaga ce spun nu doar tarani
Ce se misca de fel
Gen dama de lux din cel mai ieftin bordel
Tu nu esti Danzel, eu nu sunt Pharell
Ea nu e Cantrell, deci cine el
Ca-s fel de fel de Gigi
Ce se vor "baiat gigel"
Roc'a'fell vanat de paparazzi in jartiere
Pustiu nostru n-a calcat niciodata in cartiere
Fara portofel sau gel "Cordel" esti mai ok

Byga:
Muzica e singura care mai permite sa visez
Sa fug, sa nu ma plafonez, sa nu clachez, vreau sa creez
Desi lumea mi-a zis ca-i nebunie
Tot mi-am rupt inima din piept, am stors-o, am pus-o-n melodie
Nimeni nu poa' sa ne-abata
Avem beat-uri pe banda rulanta
Acum la contrabanda
Care vrea sa vada cuvinte-n cascada
Ia rima cuminte cum vine sa cada
E tot ce stiu sa fac
E tot ce mi-am dorit sa fiu de fapt
Pe scena sunt drac, n-am pic de trac
Te-atrag cand simti ca trag cu drag pe track
Cultura hip-hop la noi? Daca intrebi tu prin norod
Se opreste la 50 cent, putin Eminem, California love, Next episode
La televizor vrei sa fii rapsod? Fa si tu o cascadorie
C-o s-apari decat daca te-njuri cu lume sau poate cazi la puscarie
Cand trendu-i superficial, doar comercial, nimic special
Apreciati ce-i artificial, devin oficial antisocial
Privesc in viitor increzator cat mai pot sa-l schimb
Prin vers nemuritor va ramane copilu' meu peste timp

It's hard to argue when you're so true
It's tearing me apart when you're acting like a child
But there is nothing I can say
I've been trying with my heart
But I can't change a thing
I guess it's driving me insane
And every time you speak to me
My world is crashing down

This is the final straw

I'm pushing you away

Strazile o asteptau pe asta de cand s-a turnat asfaltu'...
Cu scaunul pe spate, sprijinit in cotiera
Cobor geamu' discret adancit in tetiera
Cu inca 3 indivizi rulez pe sosea
Nu e niciunul stramb, dar ne indreptam undeva
Ma retrag intr-o tigara. cobor si aud discret
Aud in stanga mea:"Ichide ba ca e curent! "
Ne combinam la benzina, da, sunt amator
Mai saritor ca un olog la semafor
Chiar nu e interesant subiectul combustibil
Oricum o luam pe cel mai lung drum posibil
Viteza nu ne incanta, nimic nu-i prea departe
Mergem atat de incet, parca am avea rotile dezumflate
Ne bubuie masina, niciunul n-avem planuri
Ne auzi, dar nu ne vezi, ca avem folie pe geamuri
Si-mi place s-o ard cu astia ai mei, derbedei
M-am dedicat ca o manea la un botez de puradei!

Din nou Rashid incheie cubano
Reprecenta C. I. A romano
Simti si tu aroma de havano
Deci n-o face pe grozava Loredano
In balans, o facam ca la Craiova
Nu e dans, e hip-hop, nu e pas de bossa-nova
Am bas in timpan, ceva parmezan
Pe Byga la volan
Yo n-am carnet momentan
Mergem ca pe macadam din cartiere spre centru...
Inca de pe maidan, n-am avut atractie
La orice usa inchisa in nas am patruns prin efractie
Situatia e propice
Provocam boli cronice
Dam drumu' la volum, si-i dam sa se ridice
Spre dimineata amice
Ma retrag cum s-ar zice
Cu doua fetiscane care imi zambesc poftice...

Si uite cum rulam, cum ne ducem
Degajati ca tot acolo ajungem
A fost mult pana ne-au dat cheile
Intre timp tot am trait si ne-am iubit femeile
Strada-i mai accesibila
Se circula mai usor
Cand lumea-i in campanie
Ori iesita din decor
Nu e loc de tras pe dreapta
Revenim in trafic
Cu frana de mana trasa
Reintram in trafic
Alex:N-avem probleme de adaptare
Alegem drumul la intamplare
Masina-i tare, muzica-i tare
Tine-te dupa noi daca te crezi in stare...

Ne acuzati de vagabondaj
Ai uitat
Oricum dam peste cap orice kilometraj

i see you sharing
black lives matter! dope post!
i see you marching
on instagram! dope post!
i see you donating
to THE cause. dope post!
your cousin in mountain view,
your best friend from college,
your aunt on your dad's side.
NOT YOUR RESPONSIBILITY!
what his fascination with asian bodies got to do with you???
what her view on black men in the club got to do with you???
what auntie say about towelheads got to do with you???
you got bills, career instability, failed romance, a painful relationship with your father, global fear, comparison judgment, and the new season of favorite tv show on your plate,
what more can be asked of you?
you already have a puerto rican friend,
you already teach kids who's future assignment is prison,
you already passed 2010's ally exam.
i get it. there's just not enough time for anything more.
besides,
it's not your responsibility.
and anyway, we know how hard you try.
we're all trying so hard, i know.
we are all frauds & failures & fucking wack
in the eyes of those who condemn us
to the color of our skin.
we let ourselves be agents of hate,
as if the power of our silence at thanksgiving,
in the boardroom,
amongst shared ethnic background,
will evolve from within
what silence has yet to evolve
in anything.
II.
i thought i could click like my way to evolution.
i thought revolution was proven on the internet.
i thought my face excused me from others' struggle.
i thought example would magically transform all i touched.
i thought writing the poem was the most i needed to do.
i thought all the world's problems separated by borders.
i thought responsibility was only what i did for myself.
you are not responsible for
the other asian people.
the aunt who still clutches her purse to acknowledge black.
the best friend from college whose best friends are now all white.
the cousin fucking his hate into the poorest nations on earth.
you are not responsible for
the other asian people.
you can talk your way out of any wrongdoing.
you can make believers out of anyone.
you can present like corporate long game.
you are only responsible
for who you are.
III.
you're not a coward.
you been living
in a reward system
that erases
us all.
when we gonna challenge the roles we been assigned?
when we gonna challenge the comfort of our peers?
when we gonna challenge the traditions of our past?
when we gonna challenge the way our daily ignores color?
when we gonna challenge the narratives of war?
when we gonna challenge the truth of ongoing slavery?
when we gonna challenge the fear of facing our own hate?
when we gonna challenge the people against humanity?
when we gonna challenge the 8 men who rule over everyone?
when we gonna challenge the how that keeps failing truth?
when we gonna challenge the world made by our choices?
don't worry,
making buzzfeed rich
is probably enough.
don't worry,
becoming my friend
is probably enough.
don't worry,
sharing this
is probably enough.
i mean,
what else can you do?
you're not responsible
for the other white people.
you're only responsible
for who you are.
and who knows
where you at
in understanding
that truth.
and who knows
whether this is something
you listen to
or become
defensive about.
and who knows
their responsibility
waking
into the reality
we've lived
the shared lie
that
we only have
as much power as
the masters give us.
you're not responsible
for the other white people.
keep saying it
until all the mirrors die.
until there’s nothing left
of us.

May damdaming, paggalang sa lumikha
May pusong pagmamahal sa kapwa

باید رفیق آرزوهام‌ باشم
باید بتونم اون که می‌خوام باشم
دیگه بسه، پا پس کشیدن بسه
دیگه باید دست بذارم روی زانوم پا شم
وقتی عمرت با حسرت
یا از روی عادت
از دستت راحت می‌ره

شاید یه روز یه جایی

Je suis écouté par ceux qui me connaissent donc lèves une roue en l'air
Je suis écouté par ceux qui me connaissent donc lèves une bouteille en l’air
Je suis écouté par celles qui me connaissent et qui prennent des bains de mer
Lunettes de soleil en écailles
Ma vie découpée en détails

        Exista, un singurel un unic dumnezeu
Exista un singur fel de al iubi numit mereu
Chiar daca in buzunar nu gasesti urma de leu
Persista ideea ca fericirea apare des intr'un bmw'u
De jos privesti supus in sus cerand ajutor divin
Cand ajungi sus privesti in jos, superior putin
Combini saracie cu un gram de lacomie
Si iata produs finit un bastinas de romanie
Hranit cu paine pe cartela a fost invatat sa creada
Ca daca nu curge pica si daca nu pica trebuie sa cada
Obligat sa calce cade?? intai mai la parada
Din reflex bate pasul pe loc in ultima decada
Roman fiind nu iti permiti prea multe alternative
Caci ce fac astia cu noi le zice UE directive
Raman doar stivele proteste aflate'n stadiu de proiect
Dar inca ai un pumn in gura ce'nchide orice subiect
R:
Liber sa plang sa tac, liber sa mor sarac, liber sa fac doar ca tine
Liber s'ajung sa plac, sa fiu la liber furat de'un om mai liber ca mine
Comunistii au ramas tot aia de'au apucat sa fie
Deci nu'inteleg ca noi cuvantul democratie
La revolutie sau cine'au servit in 89'
Interesele si motivele erau deja impartite'n doua
Pentru o gaura in steag si istorie fara coperti
Mult prea multe facultati au ramas fara studenti
Cu ce s'au ales ca v'au facut cadou o tara
Ca milioane de romani sa munceasca acum pe'afara
Noi am ales sa ne confectionam singuri soarta
Avem si chei si levier daca vreti sa ne'nchideti poarta
Educati in greutati si'n insincte native
Mai bine decat ce'ai invatat din manuale alternative
C'am crescut descult cu tudor gheorghe'n suflet
Si acum strig destul razbate cu rasunet
Am aer in plaman inima nerabdatoare
Europa libera nu se mai asculta la lumanare
R:
Liber sa plang sa tac, liber sa mor sarac, liber sa fac doar ca tine
Liber s'ajung sa plac, sa fiu la liber furat de'un om mai liber ca mïne
Liber sa plang sa tac, liber sa mor sarac, liber sa fac doar ca tine
Liber s'ajung sa plac, sa fiu la liber furat de'un om mai liber ca mïneThey in and they out
They come and they go
They quick to get out when they say they gone roll
Give em my all and they leave me out cold
Poured out my heart til that shit over flowed
It’s my feelings that I’m dealin with
I can’t help it I’m so self less
There's some things I need
Some things I want
Something consistent
That’s not gone leave
Won’t lie to me
Gone ride for me
Ain’t got no mistress
Only got eyes for me
I just need somebody that gone be there
Be there

Yeah, you got me nervousL'histoire est simple, comme un disney
J'écris et j'm'endors, je rêve comme Walt
Y a qu'ces putains d'oiseaux qui chantent comme oim
J'ai la famille, quelques home-boy
Je reste en rasse-té, j'ai vue sur l'enfer
De marbre, comme un haussman
J'suis pas d'ici j'veux pas qu'on m'enterre
J'emmerde l'époque j'suis comme mon grand père
J'ai une sale humeur
C'est la vie, ferme la et danse 
C'est la nuit, fumée blanche 
J'tutoie les anges, les yeux purple billets de banque
Sous les lunettes noires, je sais j'suis différent
J'vais dans l'espace tuer le temps
Est-ce la guerre ?
Positif y m'faut toute la panoplie, faire du rap comme de la politique
J'suis jeune et con le rap c'est pour la frime
Premier à chaque tour l'or est pour ma team
Faut que j't'encule sur ta colonie
Que j'gagne la partie d'Monopoly
Que pour la Madre j'sois exemplaire
Que l'nom du Padre soit légendaire
C'est ça l'humeur
Comme Walt
Y a qu'ces putains d'oiseaux qui chantent comme oimLolByga:
Încotro?
Şi tu vrei potu' la loto
Rătăceşti fără busolă, ţinut sub control
Degeaba ai potenţial, te-au iscusit
Iar nimic nu e mai trist ca talentul irosit
Ne bucurăm ca nişte copii la locuri de parcare
Ne-ntâlnim, nu vorbim, stăm cu ochii-n telefoane
Totu-i anapoda în parcuri, e plin de pet-uri
Se ridică noi clădiri ca să deschidă second hand-uri
N-am vrut să fur, să fug, n-am vrut să-nşel
Am vrut reuşesc singur, tot învăţ din greşeli
Din toate m-am alcătuit
Fii şi tu nebunul care n-a lăsat regretele să-i umbrească drumu'
Bogaţii devin mai bogaţi, săracii mai săraci
Iar tu tragi, tragi, la ghiozdan ceva să bagi
Când ai vreo cumpănă du-te şi cumpără
Sau, banii la plic, pentru că altfel n-o să rezolvi nimic
Nu tre' să ne ştim ca să ne-mprietenim
Şi găsim noi metode doar să supravieţuim
E un mod de-a fi, un alt fel de-a trăi
Cred că aş înnebuni dacă n-aş refula în melodii
Şi, trece timpu şi creşte fii-meu
Şi-o să fiu primu care o să-i zic: tată, să fii tu!
Speranţa moare ultima, eu râd în rituri
Citeşte printre rânduri, priveşte peste ziduri
Încotro?
Oameni buni mereu ne grăbim
Încotro?
Căutăm fericirea dar nu ştim încotro
Şi ne supunem pentru că n-avem încotro, n-avem încotro. 
Mutu:
E despre noi, o generaţie
Care refuză să facă parte dintr-o naţie
Care vede respectu' doar ca obligaţie
Informaţii la TV caută senzaţie
Sărim din staţie-n taxi către distracţie, maxim
Că suntem tineri şi avem poftă de viaţă, vedem la alţii
Şi vrem şi noi
S-avem eroi
Carieră, bani, succes, rămânem goi pe interior
Şi fiecare-i superior faţă de restu'
Da fieacare te vede cam cum îl vezi tu
Repet şi printre gesturi, încotro vrei să te-ndrepţi?
Asta nici nu contează, important e să te-ndrepţi
Deci zi-mi încotro te tot grăbeşti
Să îmbătrâneşti, preocupat doar să strângi, uiţi să trăieşti
Opreşte-te, priveşte în jur umpic şi mulţumeşte că respiri
Că văd priviri din ce în ce mai pierdute
Vrei să pleci? Du-te
Da vezi că iei cu tine ce gândeşti şi ce-ai în suflet
Încă din scutec ai fost învăţat să vrei, să fii ca cei din jur
De ce te miri că eşti ca ei şi
Pui rău-n faţă
Că rău sau bine nu există, ai doar o viaţă
Şi-ţi garantez că nu e tristă, lumea te-nvaţă
Că trebuie să urmezi o pistă, încă un nume pe o listă
Încotro?
Încotro?
Oameni buni mereu ne grăbim
Încotro?
Căutăm fericirea dar nu ştim încotro
Şi ne supunem pentru că n-avem încotro, n-avem încotro. Chorus:
Ikaw ba yan?
Muntik na di makilala
Marunong ka na rin
Pala ngayong tumawa
Tunay kaya itong
Aking nakikita
Mukhang natapos din
Ang 'yong pagdurusa
Dati rati pag kasama ka
Punong puno ng drama
Gusto mong magpakamatay
Inawat lang kita
Alam kong makakaya mo
Ang lahat kahit anong bigat
Mabubuhat
Dati rati pag nagkwento ka
Bukambibig mo sya
Hindi mo matanggap
Kahit siraan ko na
Pero nadala rin ang tao
Kahit magpaka bobo
Matututo ugh!
Dati rati pagbinibiro
Napipikon ka na
Ngayong inaasar kita
Ngiti'y hanggang tenga
Ang nawala hindi man mabawi
Kahit kirot at hapdi
Mapapawi

Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distratto
Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distratto
Son distratto da 'ste pute, uh
C'ho un infarto se le chiudi 
Mi riscaldo con 'ste tute
Ridi che non te le sudi, huh
Sto col fre' che mi porta in giro
Fra', pare che mi scorta
Prendo in giro chi di me poi si scorda
Fuck, arrivo primo anche se mi scotto 
Salgo se fatico, huh
Non solo se faccio il panico, huh
Tu bla-bla, mica ho la car io ti carico
Bеllo il coltello, c'hai il manico, huh
Non fare il coatto che cadi prima o poi, lo dico
Mami è colpa di contarе il mattino
Cresco veloce, non faccio casino
Che se esco ho la voce che fa il suo cammino
Non mi distraggo se parlo con te
No che non calcolo chi ho attorno
Mi parlavi di quando stavi con me
Ma ripeto, indietro non ci torno
Mi sono rotto il cazzo di fare: "Eh?"
Sì, ciò che ti pare senza un motivo
Se mi davi del falso pensavo che
Lo ero davvero, poi non dormivo
Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distratto
Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distratto
Distratto da tutti 'sti demoni
Sono dovunque, non vogliono crederci
Passo per pazzo, matto a volte
È una passione, lo faccio per sport, huh
Ho problemi più grossi dei vostri stupidi amici
Vi sfido a mettervi in 'sti posti e rimanere felici
Voglio vedere come si vede dall'alto
Rivederli tutti, sì, ma sotto a un palco
Vedere tornare chi diceva: "Perdi"
Vederli tornare per i complimenti
Mi godo il tramonto mentre esce luna piena
Vorrei rivederla rispogliare quella schiena
Ormai non ho tempo per una storia seria
Sai, mi ci vedo a trenta come Dan Bilzerian 
Mio fratello mi sostiene anche nei miei giorni no
Me li scanso con 'sto flow ed un giorno riderò
Sì, ho un problema, poi ci penso, grazie, ora scrivo un po'
Voglio quello che non ho, ed un giorno brinderò
E c'ho barre che me mannano ar gabbio
È per questo che se rappo lo devo fare calmo, oh
La rabbia è il mio veleno e ci convivo
E sotto sotto
Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distratto
Non vedo l'ora che mi sposto, sì, ma da te
Io voglio il mio posto, non voglio il cash
Tu che parli di strada, eh-ehi, vuoi il riscatto
Ma non sai niente di strada, eh-ehi, sei distrattoYou know all the cracks in me
I know all those scars you hide
Thought you'd always stay right here
Such a shame you'd change your mind, oh yeah
And everything I said back then
I didn't mean it with my heart
You know it was a self defense
I never want you to run
Can we just go back to 1984
When all we were once kids and kids dream
Can we just go back to what we had before
Just like in the movies
Can we just go back to 1984
When all we were once kids and kids dream
Can we just go back to what we had before
Just like in the movies, ohYung flossa, in this thang you imposter
Black like a mobster, popping like a shasta its real
Cooking game like a pasta
Lil' nigga wolfin' he ain't talking bout nada
My nigga brought the llama, talking i ain't gotta
Yo girl ain't got no father, so she call me da-da
Hit it then i ta-da, I don't need a water
I'm a kick her out Juan Mata
Belly of the beast survived and overcame
I been gone for too long i'm back now i'll explain
Tryna' take the vision from sidewalks to planes
The day I said I could make it I didn't say it in vein
Build a court right outside they gon' see us ball
Man they rather set a trap wanna see us fall
Real ones build bridges no we don't build walls
Real ones build bridges no we don't build walls
They say why you always wildin'
In my own lane, If I get any bigger I'd deserve my own island
Boy i'm like butter how i'm always sliding
Thought I was a bird how i'm always gliding
I don't do the whining, look at my timing
It just hit midnight, i'm always shining
Top of the top for a nigga just climbing
A hater plain sight but to me you just hiding
London to South France, why I get to it cause nigga I got plans
Boy you don't tap in you just dance
They gunning for you in your city can't take a chance
You just seen the story and yeen know what it told
Got to keep a swivel you out there on the road
Look into the future and i don't know what it holds
But I'm a keep me a sweater the world is getting coldWe move, oh how we move
To the black that's on the water up
That mood bigger than the moon
Taking  to be driving back
There must be somebody that we can thank
We better play  better than anyone else
We move, oh how we move
To the black that's on the water 
I miss the bloom of the sea
As we dry on rain
I miss laying on the grass
As cities die in the sun stare
I miss the bloom of the sea
As we dry on rain
I miss laying on the grass
As cities die in the sun stare
As cities die in the sun stare
As cities die in the sun stare
Dance, oh how we dance
As the sun blazes the water runs
For you, bigger than you
As we 
There must be somebody that we can blame
We rather blame ourselves than blaming anyone else
We dance, oh how we move
As the sun raises the water runs
I miss the bloom of the sea
As we dry on rain
I miss laying on the grass
As cities die in the sun stare
I miss the bloom of the sea
As we dry on rain
I miss laying on the grass
As cities die in the sun stare
As cities die in the sun stare
As cities die in the sun stare
This is how we move
Bigger than the moon
Cities in the sun
This is how we move
Bigger than the moon
Cities in the sun
This is how we move
Bigger than the moon
Cities in the sunBlinding lights
Thunder tremble pack
Muddy hearts
Beanie babies lies
There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land
Shining high
Rumbles in the dark
Torn apart
Devil in disguise
There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone
Tumbling dice
Sentimental crap
Who's the smart
Leading daily cries?
There's no lullaby
In this nowhere land
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
What's the meaning
When you have a broken home?
Home, home
Where's the love
When you were left on your own?
So alone
Who said you're on your own?You say for months now you’ve tried to find That certain someone that will hear
You out Someone to tell you that you are gonna be alright Who can keep guiding
Your mind in a different light I know I was never there  Looked
Like I didn’t even care And this pain that you feel Coming in from
The head Left me all out of air I can tell it from your blue eyes you’re feeding me
White lies And I know I know when you seem to lose heart whenever you are in
Doubt Youre not alone alone And know that looking back At it now I know it all
Too well For all you care I could go to hell
When you loose heart
When ever you’re in doubt
You’re not alone. You’re on the wrong side of 25 And your emotions are an
Empty hive And you still wake up alone in the gloomy night Saying that crying a
Lot means you’re still alive
I know I was never there  Looked like I didn’t even care(I’ll give
You that) And this pain that you feel Coming in from the head Left me all out of air겨울이 오네
뜨겁던 여름은 가고
겨울이 오네
스산한 밤공기 가르며
나는 옷깃을 여미다
문득 너를 떠올린다
이별이 오네
초라한 날들은 가고서
이별이 오네
난 어떤 준비도 하지 못하고
다시 길을 잃고 말았네
너의 손을 놓고 말았네
사랑한단 말도 못하고
가지 말란 말도 못하고 보내는
계절과 같은 사랑
바람과 같은 사람
그 사이에 슬픈 가을
우리
추억이 지네
더디 흐른 외로움 보내고
추억이 지네
영원할 것만 같던 시간이
너의 이름을 부르다
결국 울음을 쏟는다
사랑한단 말도 못하고
가지 말란 말도 못하고 보내는
계절과 같은 사랑
바람과 같은 사람
그 사이에 슬픈 가을
사랑한단 말도 못하고
가지 말란 말도 못하고 보내는
계절과 같은 사랑
바람과 같은 사람
그 사이에 슬픈 가을

They Said that they’re ready for Siah this year and it’s a... rap
Said that I’m ready for fire this year and it’s... the truth

That’s funny it’s true
Chorus:
Said that you really involved, ain't really involved
I’m not In the mood
Said that you read for me
You ain’t ready for me but I’m ready for you
Said that I’m ready for the game

You ain’t talking bout money it’s quick too
You should quit too
With that next bitch
In that x6 I’m like fuck that
Ain’t into that violence
But let a nigga try it you know I’ll buss back
I got money on the way
I got homies on a wage
Couple hunnies on a wave
Acting funny in the base
You ain’t talking bout that shit
You ain’t even in the place
I got, I got, I got
Irrelevant niggas that I drop, I drop, I drop
Drive by
Cool say nada
If you’ve got a girl best hide her
Cuz she knows I’m a rider
Knows that my flows too fire
Know why they call me Siah
Said I don’t like you
And I don’t like her either
Chorus:
I ain’t got money to loose, got hunnies to loose
That’s funny it’s true
Said that you really involved, ain't really involved
I’m not In the mood
Said that you read for me
You ain’t ready for me but I’m ready for you
Said that I’m ready for the game

It shouldn't have to be this way
After all, you're supposed to be my best friend
Do you regret taking what's mine
How could you think that it's all fine

How could you go and do me wrong, oh
You can replay this pretend
Quit saying that we can, we can still be friends
I know your lover and your lies
How could you think that it's all fine

Sunt satul sa fiu sarac

Am fost mintit, furat

Lumea e plictisita
Satula sa-nghita momeala
S-o-nghita, nu se mai lasa prostita
Sa fi roman e-o aventura
Inzestrat de natura
Cu calitati reale
De pugilist pentru centura
Ai o barbie dura
Si-un ficat de fier
Brate de otel
Muncite pe santier
Esti roman
Esti satul de adrenalina
Muncesti fara odihna
Alergi parca n-ai splina
Satul sa va car in spate
Hotia si lacomia
Sunt satul de toate astea
Da' nu-s satul de Romania

Si n-am fugit printre straini
Am ramas aici

Indiferent de cate piedici

Cate vile, terenuri
Toate furate peste noapte
Satui de-atatea abuzuri sau combinatii

Doar sa plateasca rate
De birocratie

De medicamente scumpe
De spaga din spitale

De atunci nimic n-a mai contat si nu va conta
Cat timp vom fi doar noi doi
Doar noi doi pana la cap si-apoi
Femeie, te iubesc ca un nebun
Te iubesc, da' nu o sa pot s-o spun niciodata
Ma cunosti, stii cum sunt
Nu-mi iese, am repetat la nesfarsit soptit in gand
Daaa, ai uitat cum ne-nchideam in casa
Uitam de lume, uitam de ai mei, uitam de acasa
Treceam prin orice pasa, oricat de prosta
Lasa, spuneam, nu-mi pasa de lumea voastra
Aveam buzunarele goale si datorii
Visam la o casa, la tine si doi copii
Credeam ca impreuna noi doi vom reusi
Acum uita-te pe geam sunt jos, urc eu sau vii?

Nu uita sau ai uitat deja
Vorbeste lumea, imi spui, nu asculta lumea
Lumea e rea, lumea nu vrea sa ne inteleaga
Vedeam in tine exact o lume intreaga
C-au aparut minciuni ca din nimic
Si n-am vrut sa le cred pentru nimic
Stii, acum e prea tarziu, nu mai regret nimic
Zii ce are in plus fata de mine acel nimic
Nu-mi mai rosti numele, n-o sa-mi porti numele
Cum te suporti? Esti o mizerie si spumele
Nu-si au rostu', nu ti-ai gasit in mine prostu'
Fii c***a altuia daca vrei sa te scoti tu
Femeie, de ce taci, de ce faci ce faci si apoi taci?
Incearca sa ma asculti, sunt plin de draci
Ti-aduci aminte ce mi-ai spus cand ai plecat
Eu n-am uitat, vom merge impreuna in viata asta pana la cap

Голову печёт солнце, но ещё ведь май
Я проезжаю мимо улиц, мимо этих краль
Еду по обрыву, но это не край
Cry baby, cry baby, cry baby
Таких больше не увидишь на белом свете
Чёрные оттенки на белом лазарете
Белые ребята, трехочковый в сетке
Я гуляю по району, белые высотки
Чёрные шорты, в кармане по сотке
Nike Air Jordan, жёлтые полоски
На кроссовках пыль, но это не обноски
Я шагаю мирным строем, короткие юбки
Голову назад, я смотрю на бути
Моя жизнь приключение-американский мультик
Мама мне звонит на сотик
Каждый новый день, как будто новый life
Я всё тот же настоящий и так же ловлю кайф
Даже без джони, но рядом со мной Джонник
Мы играем в игры, не опуская водник
Самый красивый, рядом блики
SIAL сият, стрызы на блинке
Надуваю шины, всё по-старинке
Одеваюсь строго, в магазине binco
Я гуляю по району, белые высотки
Чёрные шорты, в кармане по сотке

Refugee A hated man who is inbetween I go wherever These songs take me. I’ve
Learned that the roads they made me A citizen a refugee And I’ve been traveling
For miles to see
Unified
We’ll never be
We won’t align
We don’t believe in what they speak
Different and will never change
Make it so we get the blame
Oh unified
That’s what we’ll never be
I remember 40 sleepless hours The Waves, and patrolling towers The world is a
Refugee
Cause the world doesn’t want to see
We go wherever they will take us
Keep telling us that these roads they made us
So I follow this path I lead
Cause that’s what I wanna be
This is who we areسن و سالم کم بود غرق بازی بودم
به همون دنیای ساده راضى بودم
شاد بودم شاد و سر خوش و بازیگوش
سادگی دنیامو می گرفت در آغوش
هر کجا می رفتم می شکفتم در خود
شیطنت میکردم عشق جاری می شد
اون روزا یادم هست زندگی با ما بود
پدرم می جنگید مادرم زیبا بود
روزهای خوبو بی صدا سوزوندیم
بین اون بازیها کاش جا میموندیم
روزهای خوبو بی صدا سوزوندیم
بین اون بازیها کاش جا میموندیم
عشق میدادیمو میگرفتیم از هم
قهرها کوتاه بود دوستی ها محکم
زندگیمون خالی از غم و ماتم بود

Oh how I hate this feeling
Cause I know that I’m gonna give in
Even though it really doesn’t make much sense
Here comes the sick sick part
I’m on my knee begging for forgiveness
Lose another level in your game
And so I play the part
I should’ve known it from the start
I keep faking it but how much can I take?
It takes a man to take the blame
And suffer ignorance
Not Coming home
So let the flames burn out our names
Cause we are history
Not coming home
So even when I’m right I’d have to take the blame
I have to soldier on like any given day
Cause you don’t need a reason
And there’s no room left to breathe in
You're testing me, pushed me too far away
Here comes the sick sick part
I’m on my knee begging for forgiveness
Lose another level in your game
And so I play the part
I should’ve known it from the start
I keep faking it but how much can I take?
It takes a man to take the blame
And suffer ignorance
Not Coming home
So let the flames burn out our names
Cause we are history
Not coming home
So let the flames
Burn out our names
It takes a man to take the blame
And suffer ignorance
Not coming home
And I will let it take me
And let it levitate me
So let the flames
Burn out our namesRuszyła wielka maszyna, ciekawe czy się zatrzyma
Ciekawe czy zapłoną stosy, jak potoczą się moje losy
Czy żar mocny i miłość gorąca dadzą ciepło sercom, w zamrożonych lodach
Słyszę jej oddech tuż przy mojej szyi czuję dotyk jej dłoni
Albo coś mi się myli, albo jesteśmy jak oni
Za dużo wypili miłosnej trucizny, za dużo pochodni w wodzie topili
Bo tak będzie lepiej, bo inaczej być nie ma prawa
Teraz byłoby cieplej i wokół byłaby wielka wrzawa
Jak na meczu narodów zapłonęlibyśmy pasją, okazałbym męstwo
Idźmy po zwycięstwo, czy razem czy osobno
Ja wiem czego chcę, chwycisz mnie za rękę czy nie?
Mam iść dalej? Zawracam się i czekam na twój bieg. Może i na stałe, zatrzymuję się
Nie ma konsekwencji gdy czegoś bardzo chcesz, pozwól się ponieść i dalej sens mieć
Stoję przy tobie chociaż mnie nie widzisz, jestem jak duch, ty przecież z duchów szydzisz
Widzisz mnie, lecz nie dostrzegasz, krzywdzę cię lecz nadal biegam
Co za temat, weź się przełam, postaw pierwszy krok, ja ci nie dam, tego postanowienia, to jest w twoich przemyśleniach
To jest moim ego, to jest tym kolegą, tym przyjacielem, matką bratem, całym światem, a świat jest brutalny, nie czuj krzywdy a będzie banalny
Tyle razy wbiłaś mi miecz w brzuch tyle razy ścięłaś głowę
Ale biorę następny tlenu buch i nadal tutaj stoję
Nie wzruszony, przestraszony, zniesmaczony, nadal przeoczony i kochany, nauczony, by to uczucie gromadzić
Niech wybuchnie jak fajerwerki w nowy rok, w usta cmok, i następny krok robimy wspólnie
Zacznij myśleć obupulnie, to co zyskasz i ja zyskam
A co stracić można, kiedy świat nas wykorzysta?
Nic nie stracisz nic nie zyskasz
To następna nasza przystań, następny przystanek, od ciebie zależy co z nim się stanie
Będzie końcem i początkiem, czy początkiem końca?
Musisz ustalić swój priorytet
Ruszyć gońca bo jego ruchy są nieprzewidziane, postaw tam też damę, ona daje trochę możliwości, pionki?
One jak morze nieprzebrane
Lecz nie zapomnij o swym królu, on jest tu na ziemi i wysoko sięgając nieba sklepieni
On na górze i na dole wszędzie, oko ma w swym oczodole i widzi jak wszystko pędzi
Nie zapomnij że król królowej potrzebuje, ty nią jesteś
Więc weź następny dech i dalej spróbuj biec, jesteś mi potrzebna jak tlen
Bez ciebie duszę się, muszę się domyślać, to jak co2
Zwalczać można to w jakiś sposób, odkryj swoją kartę ja pokażę ci kartę losu
Odkryj przede mną całą talię, wtedy zgubię się albo pokażę ci sposób
Setki tu osób podobnych jak my, dużo ich problemów to oni sami
Jesteś ze mną czy obok mnie, ja idę ścieżką niepewną, czytając swoje znaki
Mijają mnie następni ludzie, oni są ze mną czy obok mnie?
Mijają mnie a ja podnoszę swój cierń, podnoszę następny problem, potrzebuję kogoś komu pomogłem
Czekam na gest, choć sprawy muszę trzymać w swoich rękach
Proszę cię, wiem że potrafisz, proszę pomóż mi biec
Ja zatrzymam się kiedy już nie dasz rady, bo bez ciebie nie wygram tej olimpiady
Ja to wiem bez żadnych ściem
Czekam
Podasz rękę czy nie?اگه تنها موندی با این همه تنهایی و درد
اگه هیشکی به دل ساده تو وفا نکرد
نذار تا غصه بشه ترانه خونه زندگیت
بگیره رنگ اسارت همه دلبستگیت

به دلت می ارزی تو بیشتر از اینا کم نشو

------------------------------------------------------
From the gaps between the skyscrapers in the city
A parade that rarely stops
Comes flowing out together with the morning sun
I'm heading underground
Feeling that something is missing
Starting to want at least the bypassing people
The place I found going against the stream
I'm walking toward north
If something is stupid then just spit it out
If something is unbeliveable then just question it
Even if you vaguely continue to deceive your heart
You cannot love that who is the most valuable, yourself
The period changes the answer
Everyone is searching for happiness
There's no such thing as perfect prophet
I'm walking toward north
Even if you're afraid of the invisible tomorrow
And crushed by the unchangeable yesterday
You won't find any kind of way out
Watch the present, watch only this moment
If something is stupid then just spit it out
If something is unbeliveable then just question it
Even if you vaguely continue to deceive your heart, you cannot deceive yourself
How far do I need to run to...
How long do I need to scream to...
...remove the violent noice from inside my heart?
I don't know, so I still continue runningWalang biro na di natatawa
Ewan ko ba pag ikaw ang nag bida
Walang pag kain di gaganahan
Kahit ano ay pag sasaluhan
Lumampas sa langit ang saya
Nabaon sa limot ang problema
Kung walang tulad mo ngayon na nag lalambing
Paano ko mapapansin na masarap palang gumising
Kung walang tulad mo ngayon na natatanaw
May puwang ang bawat galaw
Kung walang ikaw
Walang awit na di nakakanta
Kung kasabay kita damang dama
Walang oras na di nasusulit
Ang haba ng gabi parang saglit
Tinangay na ng hangin ang himig
Bumalot sa ating daig dig
At pa-ano kung wala ka pag harap ko sa umaga
Eh ikaw ang dahilan bat ito gumaganda
At pano –pano nga ba pag sikat ng araw
Kung walang ikaw – kung walang ika haw
Lumampas sa langit ang saya
Nabaon sa limot ang problema
Kung walang tulad mo ngayon na nag lalambing
Paano ko mapapansin na masarap palang gumising
Kung walang tulad mo ngayon na natatanaw
May puwang ang bawat galaw
Kung walang ikaw
Kung walang ikaw
Kung walang ikaw
Kung walang ikawمیدونی از تو توو قلبم
یه جای خالی یه حسِ کشنده مونده هنوزم
برای اینکه نمیرم برای اینکه نبازم
یه عکس خنده یه برگِ برنده مونده هنوزم
یه عکس از اون شب خوبی
که حتی فکر نکردم
قراره خاطره‌ هاتو یه عمر اشک بریزم
قرار شد که تو از من فقط یه عکس بگیری
نه زندگیمو عزیزم نه زندگیمو عزیزم
خراب شد همه دنیام
اگه بیای قراره چیو دوباره بسازی
فقط قراره به یادت غمامو جشن بگیرم

تو رو به یاد میارم با هر چی از تو ندارم
با حرفایی که نگفتم
توو بغضِ آخره پاییز
من اتفاقِ یه برگم که از درخت میوفتم
یه عکس مونده از اون شب
که عشق زنده بمونه ولی محاله یه روزی
یه عکس ساده بتونه
تو رو به من برسونه تو رو به من برسونه
یه عکس مونده از اون شب
که عشق زنده بمونه ولی محاله یه روزی
یه عکس ساده بتونه
تو رو به من برسونه تو رو به من برسونه

Kegundahan dan galau yang tak berkesudahan
Bila malam datang perlahan-lahan
Disitu moment teringat kamu
Situasi ini bukan sekali
Tapi ini sudah berulang-ulang kali
Dan ku tak tahu mengapa begini
Dan kamu, kamu yang tahu itu
Sedikit marah langsung putus
Hubungan apa itu
Bila hanya mau ini itu
Tanpa pikirkanku
Tiap detik hanya untukmu
Namun kau begitu
Ku teringat kamu
Meskipun begitu ku tetap rindu
Bagaimanapun kau slalu ada dihatiku
Entah sampai kapan ku kan menunggu
Menunggu, sampai kau tak begitu
Sedikit marah langsung putus
Hubungan apa itu
Bila hanya mau ini itu
Tanpa pikirkanku
Tiap detik hanya untukmu
Namun kau begitu

Cred sincer in destin in divin sau in puterea mintii
Da' pana ajung la Dumnezeu ma mananca sfintii
Asa ca n-am de gand sa fiu un alt contribuabil
Furat, sarac lipit, umilit si dispensabil
Dati-mi un AK 47, stergeti-ma din acte
Nu vreau statut in acest stat fara identitate
Unde sunt toate? toate-s furate
Cum de se poate? aici e Romania, frate
Rashid mujahedin dezlantuit in Jihad
Incarc arma si trag, descarc arma-n Mossad
Nu ma numi antisemit cand eu sunt anti-sistem ticalosit
Anti-mason cosmopolit
Aici eu decid cum sa ma imbrac cum sa ma port
Cum sa traiesc cum sa iubesc nu va suport cand ma numiti neadaptat
C-am atentat la bunul mers al societatii
Sunt vinovat, ardeti-ma pe rug in numele libertatii

Suntem un neam crescut cu grija zilei de maine
Suntem un neam crescut cu sare si paine
Mereu in calea lor, mereu de partea lor
Mai mereu sclavii lor sau gazda tuturor
Cand se scria istoria noi nu stiam ce-i aia scoala
Ar fi fost biblioteci daca-ar fi fost cerneala
Rareori am mai contat cat sa mai umplem o coala
Ca ai nostrii sunt viteji doar cand au burta goala
Ultima reduta am pixu' infipt adanc in foaie
Te umplu de mesaj c-am credit cu tot cu Dae
Ingenunchiat de sistem ma tem ca intr-un tarziu
Daca de jos ma mai ridic sa merg n-o sa mai stiu
Simt cum s-au strans atatea, incat incep sa doara
Daca tot suferim sa suferim ultima oara
N-avem blestem pe tara avem fantome din trecut
Am inceput acum, o sa terminam ce-am inceput!

La modul la care davaua intarata drogatii
Mirosul de sange scoate din minti soldatii
De-aia rup microfonu' ca nu mi-am rupt coloana
In locuri in care altii-si rupeau si colonu'
Nu vreau nimic de la voi c-am vazut prin clipuri
Ca vin la pachet cu droguri si microcipuri
Angajeaza-ma pe "te miri ce" si trateaza-ma
Tot ca pe-un barbar care te invadeaza, ba
Opreste-te sau continua sa ne minti
Si opreste-ne cand o sa calcam ca pe pres pe dinti
Si crestete de presedinti pervertiti
Luand la p**a tot ce crezi tu si reprezinti
Nu suntem ai nimanui condusi de mamaligi
Vanduti de pacalici, cumparati de inamici
Nu suntem nici nebuni da' ne luati legati de-aici

دوباره خاطره‌تو بوسیدم
این سوال بی‌جواب
رو از خودم، تا حالا
هزار دفعه پرسیدم
با کدوم ترانه
باز جون می‌گیره
نبض اون حنجره‌ی فیروزه
می‌دونم بدون تو
فردای من
رنگ خاکستریِ دیروزه
تن تشنه
مثل خورشید
بی‌سرزمین‌تر از باد
کولی‌تر از ترانه
بی‌پرده مثل فریاد
تنهاتر از سکوتم
روشن‌تر از ستاره
عاشق‌تر از همیشه
با من بخون دوباره
پِلکای پنجره رو وا می‌کنم
تو کوچه، زمزمه‌ی مهتابه
همه‌ی پنجره‌ها خاموشن
انگار این کوچه‌ی خلوت، خوابه
بی‌صدا، اسمتو فریاد می‌زنم
هق‌هقم، پنجره رو می‌بنده
دوباره دستای نامرئی شب
پلکای پنجره‌مو می‌بنده
تن تشنه
مثل خورشید
بی‌سرزمین‌تر از باد
بی‌سرزمین‌تر از باد
بی‌سرزمین‌تر از باد
بی‌پرده مثل فریاد
بی‌پرده مثل فریاد
بی‌پرده مثل فریاد
تن تشنه
مثل خورشید

با من بخون دوبارهI told you: you get what you give
I told you: you get what you give
They say I'm an asshole, when they have been giving me shit
I got problem wid weed, so imma just stick to the cigs
Heard you don't fuck with the kid
So why is you up on my dick?
Get off of it quick
You should have thought twice before you said that shit
Little-bitch-niggah, suck my dick
Who's this kid?
Hol' up, who's this kid?
I grap the clip, extend the clip and rain on kids
A passivist, with too much shit, can barely think
Wait for things to kick off and kill you quick
These violent thoughts, they don't even come from me
You see the key, and don't think to set me free
Its not in the way that I think
Been brought up to murder and kill
He live in the suburbs, so clearly my songs aren't as real
But heres some advice, stop being a bitch stop fighting with colours
I think the same way that you do, but I choose to move, alone, don't fuck with the otheres
Nø.siac, you don't act the way you should
Shii, I only glow at night when these rappers getting Suge
Girls wanna hit, so niggas don't like me
Searching for the truth, I guess I'm coming out of hiding
Sixteen doing 16s, same time
I'm in my head, they twenty something by my waistline
Getting wavy on a like a bassline
Niggas see defeat erryday, its like facetime
No fucks, ain't ever had non
Surely got no time for a nigga throwing tantrums
New wave anthem, bitches say handsome
Prolly on shuffle but a nigga not random
Too fast way fast can't catch me
Pockets looking thin like some long distance athletes....and thats where I fucked up
Thanks for listening :)Chorus:

Matter of fact, you might as well get used to
S-I-A-H leader of the new school
If I can, you can too, Blue's Clues
Everybody gon' jig to this
I'm in the party and I'm actin' real ignorant
Boy I been cheffin' peep the way I flick my wrist
Spit dope, homie come an' get a hit o' this
I got hits and hits and hits and hits, I never miss
Climb until I reach Everest
So fly, tell me how they gonna feather this
You top five better bet I'm on a better list
I got a flow that's crisp
Need a ghost to whip I pose for flicks with poster chicks
Have you ever seen a rover drift?
Name somebody cold as this, tell 'em hold my dick
Then the chorus hits, like
Boy turn your speakers up
Know you feel it heatin' up
Chase paper ain't keepin' up
You ain't starve, you can't eat with us
Drift Team countin' cream, you know
Y'all faker than some Sweet'N'Low
All my niggas feastin' yo
Cause ya boy been beastin', whoa
Don't say a word, just move your feet
Don't be afraid to lose your seat
I'm Mayweather, can't be beat
No backup plan, I can't retreat
Duckin' and dodgin' me but my verses hot commodities
I'm humble as I can be but I just be bein' honest, B
I put it down just in case you still haven't noticed
I got the drop, boy, I'm focused
I'm dippin' off in the lotus, whoa
Swear I need that Lam now, even though I am the G.O.A.T
World in my hands before I even wrote my senior quote!تو هر شهرِ دنیا که بارون بیاد
خیابونی گم می شه تو بغض و درد
تو بارون مگه می شه عاشق نشد ؟
تو باورن مگه می شه گریه نکرد ؟
مگه میشه بارون بباره ولی
دل هیشکی واسه کسی تنگ نشه؟
چه زخم عمیقی توی کوچه هاست
که بارون یه شهر به خون میکشه
تو هر جای دنیا یه عاشق داره
با گریه توبارون قدم میزنه
خیابونا این قصه رو میدونن
رسیدن سر آغاز دل کندن
هنوز تنهایی سهم هر عاشق
چه قانون تلخی داره زندگی
با یه باغی که عاشق غنچه هاست
چجوری میخوای از زمستون بگی
یه وقتا یه دردایی توی دنیا هست
که آدم رو از ریشه میسوزونه
هر عشقی تموم میشه و میگذره
ولی خاطره اش تا ابد میمونه
گاهی وقتا یه جوری بارون میاد
که روح از تنِ دنیا بیرون می ره
یکی چترِ شادیشو وا می کنه
یکی پشتِ یه پنجره می میره
تو هر جای دنیا یه عاشق داره
تو هر جای دنیا یه عاشق داره
با گریه توبارون قدم میزنه
خیابونا این قصه رو میدونن
رسیدن سر آغاز دل کندن
هنوز تنهایی سهم هر عاشق
چه قانون تلخی داره زندگی
با یه باغی که عاشق غنچه هاست
چجوری میخوای از زمستون بگیNo existe nadie más que pueda soportarme
En estos días del mes en que no quiero levantarme
No existe nadie más que pueda descifrarme
No existe nadie más que logre despertarme
Estas ganas de ser un superhéroe y salvarte
Luchando contra el mal. No existe nadie
Y es que no hay nada en este mundo
Sin tu amor que quiera yo
Lo que yo necesito son los besos de tu boca
Que me llevan a la luna y como nadie me provocan
Que me dejan sin respiración
No existe nadie más en el latido de mi corazón
Que nada es como antes, que tu risa me hace grande
Y cuando todo estaba oscuro
Tú llegaste a mí y encendiste la luz
Y sé, no existe nadie, nadie, nadie, nadie más que tú
No existe nadie más que pueda acompañarme
Hasta el final del mundo y sin temor a equivocarme
No existe nadie más que pueda descifrarme
No existe nadie más que logre derretir mi corazón
Con tan solo mirarme, no existe nadie más
No existe nadie
Y es que no hay nada en este mundo
Sin tu amor que quiera yo
Lo que yo necesito son los besos de tu boca
Que me llevan a la luna y como nadie me provocan
Que me dejan sin respiración
No existe nadie más en el latido de mi corazón
Que nada es como antes, que tu risa me hace grande
Y cuando todo estaba oscuro
Tú llegaste a mí y encendiste la luz
Y sé, no existe nadie, nadie, nadie, nadie más que tú
Y es que no hay nada en este mundo
Sin tu amor que quiera yo
Lo que yo necesito son los besos de tu boca
Que me llevan a la luna y como nadie me provocan
Que me dejan sin respiración
No existe nadie más en el latido de mi corazón
Que nada es como antes, que tu risa me hace grande
Y cuando todo estaba oscuro
Tú llegaste a mí y encendiste la luz
Y sé, no existe nadie, nadie, nadie, nadie más que tú
No existe nadie, nadie, nadie, nadie más que tú
No existe nadie, nadie, nadie, nadie más que túKonting bilis ako'y naiinip
Baka magbago pa itong aking isip
Kulang pa ba san ba nagpunta
Itong gamit ko ay plantsado na
Okey nato pahingi nga ng tisyu
Kahit pano makakalarga tayo
Ang mundong tabi tabingi
Iniwanan muna natin kahit sandali
Saan pa nga ba tayo pupunta?
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Walang gulo walang pangangamba
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Wag malikot nasasayang ang usok
Habang si wowie ay abala sa pagkakalikot
At si meniong panay pa ang gitara
Kay oyie jason at darwin na kumakanta
Saan pa nga ba tayo pupunta?
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Walang gulo walang pangangamba
Kundi sa langit na maganda yeahhh!
Ooh
Saan pa nga ba tayo pupunta?
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Walang gulo walang pangangamba
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Konting bilis ako'y naiinip
Baka magbago pa itong aking isip
Kulang pa ba san ba nagpunta
Itong gamit ko ay plantsado na
Saan pa nga ba tayo pupunta?
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Walang gulo walang pangangamba
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Saan pa nga ba tayo pupunta?
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Walang gulo walang pangangamba
Kundi sa langit na maganda
Sa langit na maganda
Sa langit na maganda
Sa langit na maganda
Sa langit na magandaAko'y may alaga asong mataba
Buntot ay mahaba, makinis ang mukha
Mahal niya ako, mahal ko rin sya
Kaya kaming dalawa ay laging magkasama
Kung ako ay aalis, siya'y sumusunod
Sa aking pagbabalik pamawi ng pagod
Mahal niya ako, mahal ko rin sya
Hindi lang sya alaga, kaibigan ko pa
Kahit hayop ay dapat ring mahalin
Lalo't maamo at masunurin
Sila'y alagaan at wag pababayaan
Tao at hayop may unawaan
Sa aking pag iisa aso ko ang kasama
Sa aking pagtulog, katabi ko sa kama
Mahal niya ako, mahal ko rin sya
Pag lalambing niya aking damang dama
Pag siya'y binabato, aking pinagtatanggol
Pag ako'y inaaway, kanyang tinatahol
Mahal niya ako, mahal ko rin sya
Kaibigan tunay sa hirap at ginhawa
Kahit hayop at dapat ding mahalin
Lalo't maamo at masunurin
Ngunit minsan ay di mo rin akalain
Ang pangyayari ay nagbabago rin
Kahol sya ng kahol, ang aso ko'y nauulol
Laking gulat ko pati ako ay hinabol
Mahal niya ako, mahal ko rin sya
Kaya ganon nalang ang aking pagtataka
Ako'y may alaga asong mataba
Bunto't ay mahaba, makinis ang mukha
Kinagat niya ako, kinagat ko rin sya
Ang kawawa kong alaga, pulutan ko naEto pakinggan nyo
Sobrang lakas ng tama ko
Wag n’yong pigilin ‘to
Wag n’yong awatin, baka biglang
Sumabog ang aking damdamin
Bulag ang pag-ibig
Kasabihan na sa atin
Ngunit para sa’yo
Ang pag-ibig ko ay duling
Pagkat dalawang beses
Ako sa’yo may pagtingin
Kaytindi ng ‘yong dating
Sa puso’t damdamin
Sa tunay kong pagmamahal
Natotorpe sa’yo
Mukhang pinasukan ng daga
Ang puso kong bato
Dahil alam ko rin
Walang ibubunga ito
Natatakot akong mawala
Ang isang katulad mo
Chorus:
Lakas-tama! Ako’y nawawala
Nawawala ang isip ko
Pag nakikita ka sinta
Di ko alam ang gagawin, meron ako
Para akong mababaliw
Sa kakaisip mula gabi
Hanggang umaga
Mahal mo ba ako, tamang hinala
Tamang duda napa-praning
Wag n’yo ng hintayin ang
Paningin ko magdilim
Kung hindi ka rin lang
Magiging sa’kin
Mabuti pang maglaho kasabay
Ng hangin
Mga kama’y ko ay
Nanginginig na sa iyo
Na makayakap ka
Sa tuwing giniginaw ako
At ang iyong labi
Na sa’kin ay tumutukso
Kailan mahahagkan
Ng matapos na ang gulo
Sa Pagputi ba ng uwak
Mo ako sasagutin?
Kung ang kulay ko nga
Ay kay hirap paputiin
Ipagpatawad mo na lang
Kung agad kang mahalin
Gan’to ako kung umibig
Medyo napa-praningMINSAY NAGSASAWA TAYO DAHIL SA PANG AABUSO

HOOOOO AAHHHHPizdo weź się do pracy, a nie ciągle marudzisz o masturbacji, Pierdolenie o Chopinie dawno wyginęło
Między Tobą, a mną żadnej przyjaźni nie było
Różnimy się, a Ty wolałaś gadać o polityce
Weź ogar pizdę i edytuj, edytuj, edytttuj sobie pizdę, edytuj y u j
Robiłaś screeny Andrzeja Dudy i mówiłaś, że się z nim ożenisz
Chyba Cię popierdoliło
Na Tinderze stworzyłaś konto i lubiłaś czasami oglądać Pornhub
Głupia jesteś, czy co, że oglądasz kutasy?
Pierdol, pierdol, ja posłucham
Udajesz perfekta od polityki
Jesteś nudna, jak kisio skorupa, ale Ty bardziej
Edytuj, edytuuuj, pierdol, pierdol, y h j k
Pierdol się
Idź się ruchaj z Arabami z Mesa, pizdo, cmokOne more teardrop
The surface tension breaks
And if the surface tension breaks
Then I will pour my pain and more
Then my heart stops, what will it take?
'Cause if it breaks, if it breaks
'Cause if it does, I'll turn to dust
One foot in the past
And one foot in the future
I need to take a class
On staying right here with you
I'm drowning in my history
Prisoner of past defeats
Tell me what the future holds
Tell me baby 
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tеll me what the future holds
Tеll me baby 
Stuck in quicksand, I think of us
I think of us, in my mirage
I can't get out and I'm scared now
One foot in the past
And one foot in the future
I need to take a class
On staying right here with you
I'm drowning in my history
Prisoner of past defeats
Tell me what the future holds
Tell me baby 
So kiss me 'till the break of dawn 
And I will lie here in your arms 
And I will try to live tonight
Like it's the last day of my life
'Cause I love you, baby
Please save me from my mind
I'm drowning in my history
Prisoner of past defeats
Tell me what the future holds
Tell me baby 
I'm terrified of things to come
Paralyzed, I cannot run
Tell me what the future holds
Tell me baby 
I'm drowning in my history 
Prisoner of past defeats 
Tell me what the future holds 
Tell me baby 
I'm terrified of things to come 
Paralyzed, I cannot run 
Tell me what the future holds 
Tell me baby Aku mulai kesal
Dengan minyak berlebih
Membuatku tak siap bertemu kamu
Facial foam tak mampu
Menghilangkan dirimu
Pergilah kau dari kulit wajahku
Andai wajahku berseri
Ku kan percaya diri
Takkan menghindari lagi
Tatapan indah matamu
Serum dan pelembab
Juga bukan solusi
Tetap saja kusam dan bikin malu
Andai wajahku berseri
Ku kan percaya diri
Takkan menghindari lagi
Tatapan indah matamu
Andai wajahku berseri
Ku kan percaya diri
Takkan menghindari lagi
Tatapan indah matamuIn your eyes
I see myself
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
Tonight
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
To fill my empty soul
To drown into your love
Pretty baby from above
I will die if you say no
Играет музыка, тут все мои друзья
Не хватает одного, точнее одной тебя
Радость или семья
И мы вместе поем, покажи надежду
Но куда мы идём
Новый миры, новый день за окном
Я жду тебя один и ору на весь дом
Ну где же ты, ну где же ты
Похитель моих снов
Каждая мысль и каждый покров
Каждый сантиметр и сила твоих слов
Все о тебе, все об мне
Я вижу тебя, но вижу в огне
In your eyes
I see myself
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
Tonight
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
To fill my empty soul
To drown into your love
Pretty baby from above
I will die if you say no
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
Она слишком мала чтобы остаться со мной
Она слишком мила и ей не стать самой собой
Само собой идёт дождь, а я на встречу к нему
И если вдруг ты позовёшь, то я его обгоню
И нас кружит летний вайб, как будто это вальс
Для меня уже осотый, но для тебя как в первый раз
И ведь я знаю знаю, что абсолютно всё равно
Тебе, ты злая злая, но лето скрасит ничего
In your eyes
I see myself
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
I'm flying through the sky
Tonight
I need your vibe
I need your vibe
To fill my empty soul
To drown into your love
Pretty baby from above
I will die if you say noKu tenggelam dalam keraguan
Tak satupun pilihan menggiurkan
Jika bukan karna kesepian
Ku memilih untuk sendirian

Dan terbawa arus perasaan

How the lights glow, when it’s dark and cold
Have you no idea
That I’m the one and only one without the fear?
Something’s missing here
It’s just a puzzle in the city’s atmosphere
All my life
Running wild
Working hard
Dancing with the dancers in the city
Nameless streets have their meanings though
You can’t choose but you don’t have to fault
Have you no idea?
That I’m the one and only one without the fear
Something’s missing here
It’s just a puzzle in the city’s atmosphere
All my life
Running wild
Working hard
Dancing with the dancers in the cityHe wants to please but no one sees
The visions in his head
He gave his soul to rock and roll
But rock and roll is dead
And in his mind
The dreams are real
Just for tonight
He'll make them all believe
Where are we going now
With pockets full of love
Out of the underground
We're higher than the sun
We're higher than the sun
She pays her bills, she takes her pills
But all she cares about
Are melodies and harmonies
For every wounded heart
And in her mind
The dreams are real
And so am I
Waiting patiently
Where are we going now
With pockets full of love
Out of the underground
We're higher than the sun
Where are we going now
With pockets full of love
Out of the underground
We're higher than the sun
We're higher than the sun x3Hit My Line
Intro:
Ohhhh
Ooouuuu uh oh
Verse 1:
What’s the truth
I don’t really feel like I’m getting over you
And it’s not right
Tryna make me think that I’m getting all your time
Know you haven’t been with it all night
Can you just give me a sign baby
You been saying that it don’t feel right
Tryna deny
I been feeling like I been done wrong
You’re taking way too long
You’ve been saying that I’m not your type
Chorus:
So Why’d you hit my line
Call me all the time
Say you’re feeling me but there’s never a vibe
Why’d you hit my line
Tryna waste my time
If you’re wanting me what you tryna deny
So I wanna know why you can’t get it right
Cause I told you what is on the line
And I wanna feel like I’m not just a side
Can you let me know what’s on your mind
Verse 2:
All I’m thinking is what I gotta give
I’ve been trying my best but you don’t wanna live You’ve been stiff so what it is can’t you hear the sound of it
All I know is when you go my heart hits the ground So what I got to do to get to you I’m feeling so down
Know I haven’t been with it all night but can we make it right cause boy you’re the only one that I got in my sight I can’t lie
I’ve been feeling like I’m all alone you don’t hit my phone
Even though we both know that I tried
Chorus:
So Why’d you hit my line
Call me all the time
Say you’re feeling me but there’s never a vibe
Why’d you hit my line
Tryna waste my time
If you’re wanting me what you tryna deny
Bridge:
Tell me what, I gotta do x2
To get to you x3
I feel like I’ve been wasting all my time
Can you let me know what’s on your mind
Chorus:
So Why’d you hit my line
Call me all the time
Say you’re feeling me but there’s never a vibe
Why’d you hit my line
Tryna waste my time
If you’re wanting me what you tryna deny
So I wanna know why you can’t get it right
Cause I told you what is on the line
And I wanna feel like I’m not just a side
Can you let me know what’s on your mindمث آب خوردن ازم دل برید
مث آب خوردن ازم دست کشید
تو رویاش اصاً برام جا نبود
شاید جای رویاش اینجا نبود
قرار بود بمونه، قرار بود قراراش و یادش نره
چقد صبر کنم تا یه روز فکر این عاشقی از سرم بپره؟
قرار بود بمونه، قرار بود قراراش و یادش نره
چقد صبر کنم تا یه روز فکر این عاشقی از سرم بپره؟
چه جوری از این درد باید نشکنم؟
وقتی یار غارم شده دشمنم
دلم گیره امّا کم آوردم از عشق
سر سادگی‌هام رکب خوردم از عشق
قرار بود بمونه، قرار بود قراراش و یادش نره
چقد صبر کنم تا یه روز فکر این عاشقی از سرم بپره؟
قرار بود بمونه، قرار بود قراراش و یادش نره
چقد صبر کنم تا یه روز فکر این عاشقی از سرم بپره؟
چه جوری از این درد باید نشکنم؟
وقتی یار غارم شده دشمنم
دلم گیره امّا کم آوردم از عشق
سر سادگی‌هام رکب خوردم از عشقThe answer to the riddle is Who is next. That is also the question. Now answer & come
correct or enter her mouth like a sacrifice, it is not your blood she wants, she has long since forgot
what blood does the body, it is your honeyed heart, your tinned blush, your whimpering pride
she will swallow. Do you know what is not a dying
art form? Architecture. It's alive and eating good
& bad, wiping away whatever is not remembered
from its mouth. It’s a caressing pain, a trumpeted slap
into the belly of a beast you thought you
imprisoned. Into the gut of the lion --
So now the riddle gos:
If I don't eat you, how can I prove I was here?

از وقتی که نیستی حالم خیلی خوبه
آره، زندگیم آرومه

بشینیم چند تا ستاره بشمریم
نشون شهر همیشه روشنو
به دلی که غم نداره بسپریم
اگه میخواییم واسه ی هم بمونیم
بیا تو عطر گلها لونه کنیم
بیا رو لبای غمگین وفا
صدای گریه رو وارونه کنیم
بیا از پله ی نور بالا بریم
موی خورشید خانومو شونه کنیم
بیا با هم بشنیم گوشه ی عشق
رفتنه تنهایی رو نگاه کنیم
غربت ساکت هر مسافرو
به تماشای هم آشنا کنیم
بیا تا آخر دنیا بمونیم
تو صدای چیک چیکه قطره ی آب
بیا تو رنگ گلها زنده باشیم
یا سبک بریم تو سنگینیه خواب
اگه هر جا تو بری من میدونم
نشونیت همیشه عطر تنته
نشون منو یه دنیا میدونن
که یه عمری هوای موندنته
بیا با هم بشنیم گوشه ی عشق
رفتنه تنهایی رو نگاه کنیم...میای از دورترین نقطه ی ایمان من
اونجا که لحظه هام پر شدن از یاسمن
میای از سکوت شهر پر از ستاره
میکشی دستامو روی موهات دوباره
میبری با خودت تا اوج بی نهایت
اونجایی که تو چشمات موج میزنه نجابت
آخ که دیگه دل من از تو جدا نمیشه
تو کتابای قصه کسی که ما نمیشه
وقتی که بجز عشق چیزی نمیشه که دید
غیر از گلهای بوسه چیزی نمیشه که چید
اونجاها آسمونشون رنگ طلایی داره
جای سیایی های شب حباب آبی داره
آدما از محبت برای هم میمیرن
تو سختیه زندگی دست همو میگیرن
آخ که دیگه دل من از تو جدا نمیشه
تو کتابای قصه کسی که ما نمیشه...نگو که چتر تو عاشق نکرده بارونو
قدم بزن شب تنهایی خیابونو
دوباره آه بکش تا دوباره آب کنی
دل شکسته و یخ بسته‌ی زمستونو
دوباره آه بکش، آه تو بساطم نیست
کسی به فکر منو مرگ خاطراتم نیست
نگیر دستمو وقتی دوتایی غرق می‌شیم
منو نجات نده، موقع نجاتم نیست
تو خسته‌ای خودتو جای من نذار، برو
به آخرین سفر دور از انتظار برو
یه کاری کن که نتونم بیام دنبالت
خلاص کن منو، با آخرین قطار برو
خراب کن همه‌ی ریل‌ها رو پشت سرت
بذار خراب بشم پشت آخرین سفرت
یه عطر تازه بزن، غیر عطر محبوبم
نذار که بو ببرن آدمای دور و برت
یه کوه یخ شدم و قطره قطره آب شدم
نیومده رو سر زندگیت خراب شدم
باید نگفته بمونه نگفته‌ها، اما
من انتخاب نکردم، من انتخاب شدمبرو اگه میخوای بری دلت نسوزه واسه من
اینجوری که کلافه‌ای بدتره خوب دل‌ و بکن
بکن دل‌ و از این همه خاطره‌های روی آب
فکر کن ندیدیم ما هم و حتی یه بارم توی خواب
راحت برو یه قطره هم گریه نداره چشم من اشکاش و پشت پای تو می‌خواد بریزه دل‌ بکن
من که نمیمیرم اگه بخوای تو از اینجا بری چون میدونستم که تو از اول راه مسافری، مسافری
شاید نفهمیدی که من بی‌ اون که تو چیزی بگی‌ سپردمت دست خدا که بی‌ خداحافظی نری
غصه راهم و نخور شاید همین جا بمونم شاید به مقصد رسیدم خودم فقط نمی‌دونم
راحت برو یه قطره هم گریه نداره چشم من اشکاش و پشت پای تو می‌خواد بریزه دل‌ بکن
من که نمیمیرم اگه بخوای تو از اینجا بری چون میدونستم که تو از اول راه مسافری، مسافری

Open the door, open the door

It's a very bad match
He's a very bad man
We swat the fly
Roll back your eyes
Open the door, open the door
I got cigars in my back pocket, back pocket
Open the door, open the door
I got cigars in my back pocket, back pocket

Kill your god, kill your god

He's not a god at all
He's just a piece of creamParoles de la chanson Entre tu y yo :
Aunque me digas que esto no esta bien
Aunque me digas que ese beso que me diste ayer
No fue de aquellos que vienen y van
Son esos besos que no son casualidad
No hay una regla ni ecuación
Perfecta para el corazón
No te preocupes todo sigue igual
Solo fue un beso nada malo va a pasar
Aunque sepamos que no fue un error
Tu y yo sabemos que nos gana la ilusión
A donde vamos a parar
El tiempo ya nos lo dirá
Coro:
Entre tu y yo la vida es buena
Volverte a besar vale la pena
Son juegos del corazón
Se fue de las manos el control
Entre tu y yo se acaba el mundo
Ojos de mar, azul profundo
Contigo me atrevo a ser
Te pido permiso para entrar y amanecer
Nos conocimos hace un tiempo atras
Tenemos juntos una historia que contar
Hay una linea que quiero cruzar
Hay una puerta que no se abre si no estás
Seguramente la razón
Se esta riendo de los dos
Coro...
Por cada duda, una respuesta para compartir
No te preocupes que la vida lo va a decidir
Solo dios ya lo sabe
Por cada paso hay un camino para descubrir
Por cada nota, una cancion que nos hara vivir
Coro...Cuando tu me amabas
Cuando tu me amabas
Nunca tuve dias grises
La melancolia no tenia estas raíces
Era mas sensato el corazón y el vino sabia mejor
Y esa tarde blanca
Cuando me besaste
Dios fue mi mejor amigo
Y lo sigue siendo aunque tu no estés conmigo
Solo tardes negras tengo hoy
Debe ser que Dios esta con vos
Cuando tu me amabas
Cuando tu me amabas
La melancolia ni pasaba por aqui
Siempre me buscabas
Me necesitabas
Y hoy esta mas cerca
Buenos Aires de Madrid
Si algún día apareces
Voy a procurar hacerle caso a la decencia
No te extrañes si ha cambiado un poco mi apariencia
Desacostumbrarme de tu sabor
Me dejo secuelas corazón
Si no te apareces
Voy a prometerme
Conocer a otra persona
Y que no me deje recaer
Si en esta historia
Llego a tropezarme con tu luz
En los libros de algún autobús
Cuando tu me amabas
Cuando tu me amabas
La melancolia ni pasaba por aqui
Siempre me buscabas
Me necesitabas
Y hoy esta mas cerca
Buenos Aires de Madrid Bulag ang pag-ibig
Kasabihan na sa amin
Ngunit para sayo
Ang pag-ibig ko ay duleng
Pagkat dalawang beses ako
Sayo may pagtingin
Kay tindi ng 'yong dating
Sa puso't damdamin
Sa tunay kong pagmamahal
Na totorpe sayo
Mukhang pinasukan ng daga
Ang puso kong bato
Dahil alam ko rin
Walang ibubunga ito
Natatakot akong mawala
Ang isang katulad mo

Nanginginig na sa iyo
Napapayakap ka
Sa tuwing giniginaw ako
At ang iyong labi
Na sakin ay tumutukso
Kailan mahahagkan
Ng matapos na ang gulo
Sa pag puti pa ng uwak
Mo ako sasagutin
Kung kulay mo ay
Kay hirap paputiin
Ipagpatawad mo na lang
Pagkat kang mahalin
Ganto ako kung umibig
Medyo napapraning

Calling to your love

Calling to you love, to your love

Calling to your love, to your love

Calling to your loveKwentuhan na kabulastugan
Hindi malilimutan ang asaran
Na mayroong pikunan
Lalo na rin ang unang niligawan
Unang kabiguan
At dyan nagseseryoso ang usapan
Ang pagdadamayan
Nang tunay at tapat na
Kaibigan
O mga buang
Kaibigan
Lubhang maaasahan
Ooohhh
Di na tayo pabata
Edad mo di nahahalata
Sa mga trip unti-unti na tayong nagsasawa
Pero kahit ganun
Barkadang matatag hanggang sa ngayon
Minsan man magkita
Tiyak may kwela
Yan ang aking mga tropa...
Inuman na pangmagdamagan
Minsan inaabot pa ng ayaan
Na kung saan-saan
Na para bang walang kinabukasan
At kahahantungan
At dyan nagseseryoso ang usapan
Ang pagpapayuhan
Nang tunay at tapat na
Kaibigan
O mga baliw
Kaibigan
Namang nakakaaliw
Ooohhh
Di na tayo pabata
Edad mo di nahahalata
Sa mga trip unti-unti na tayong nagsasawa
Pero kahit ganun
Barkadang matatag hanggang sa ngayon
Minsan man magkita
Tiyak may kwela
Yan ang aking mga tropa...

Di na tayo pabata

Tiyak may kwela

Di na tayo pabata
Edad mo di nahahalata
Sa mga trip unti-unti na tayong nagsasawa
Pero kahit ganun
Barkadang matatag hanggang sa ngayon
Minsan man magkita
Tiyak may kwela
Yan ang aking mga tropa...

        You got me pushing imaginary buttons
Step away from me, lover
Away from me, lover
You got me counting imaginary school children
Get away from me, lover
Away from me, lover
Yes, I can see that your carpet is animated
Walk away from me, lover
Away from me, lover
Yes, I see open wounds in everyone I've dated
Away from me, lover
Yeah, away from me, lover
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
You got me turning all the lights on and off
Walk away from mе, lover
Away from me, lover
Whеn will you see that I am carrying this stuff?
Walk away from me, lover
Away from me, lover
Can't you see that I am losing my marbles?
It's marvellous losing another
Losing another
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
I am no good for you
I'm seeing ghosts in everything I do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
