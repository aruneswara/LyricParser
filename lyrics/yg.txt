Pull up on the block, like, "What!"
Fuck the police, niggas better call the SWAT
I ain't never played with the pot
I was in your house tryin' to find a spot to extend my knots
I went to jail for a flock, came home with a strike
You went to jail as a bitch, came home as a dyke
Nigga, yikes! I don't play that shit
Wifey like SEGA; I don't play that bitch
I’m a real Bompton nigga with a motherfuckin' attitude
Walk up in the spot, you would think that a nigga mad at you
I was on the block chillin'; homies, what's the mission?
Came back in a quickness, hoping there wasn't no witness
And they came back shootin'
My homies went back shootin'
Ain’t nobody hittin' nothing, man, this shit getting stupid
And my homies with the news, so they grabbed that tool
This all started from a day of niggas bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back being bool
I'm just bicken back, bicken back

That's probably why they try to rob my style
And karma is a motherfuckin' biatch
You got your homie in jail, you sniatch
All in the court telling the judge who it is
Like a bitch when you get to the pen, niggas on your wig
Niggas be lurkin', bitches be slurpin'
Niggas got caught up on them Nextels chirpin'
Did some months in the county, I ain't have no patience
My bitch wouldn't come see me, I was in there masturbatin'
Smoking on a bigarette, eating a bowl of bereal
Niggas on the block selling O's like Cheerios
Aye, nigga, nigga, nigga
I got a whole zone right now

Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? 
I need a baecation
I need my bitch in an apron
Booty all out cookin' bacon
Orange juice and Ace what we drinkin'
I only come out when the stars out
I'm on a mission, but we far out
This city talkin' with a large mouth
Yeah, they after the boy like Fall Out 
Drop it, give me fifty, girl, drop it, give me fifty
You should slide with me 'cause you be trippin' when you miss me
You gon' hold me close and on your neck gon' be a hickie
I ain't gotta do too much, I know what get you sticky
I ain't gotta know astrology, I know your vibe
Skip the foreplay, you don't let niggas fuck with your mind
I ain't givin' out apologies when I'm behind
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new ride
Doin' our thing, movin' too fast
Candy paint with the windows all black
Seats crème brûlée, what they gon' say?
With the top down screamin', "Money ain't a thing"
And we up 'til six in the mornin'
When the sun rise, we be on it
Ooh, I got five, you know it's all live
Tell me when to go, baby, when we gon' slide?
Baby, when we gon' slide? Hey, huh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Yeah
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Oh
Up all night, baby, when we gon' slide? Uh
Fuckin' up the seats of the brand new rideI woke up this morning, I had a boner
I went to sleep last night with no bitch, nigga, I was a loner
I be goin' through shit, losin' bitches and homies
If I don't make it with this rap shit, nigga, I might be homeless
My moms don't got a job, my pop's checks ain't enough
If ain't bringin' home that money, my whole family is fucked
That's why I move like the mob, I'm watchin' movies too much
If niggas wanted you dead, what would you suggest?
They wonder why I do drugs and hang with thugs
Since I made it, the city hated, wait, where is the love?
I ride around with my gun, this is not for fun
I stay protected 'cause my homie just took one to the lung
Had him on life support, with his family support
He knew who shot him but he ain't even show up in court
Yeah, that's a real G, nigga, he on a kill spree, nigga
The homie popped him so I hope he don't kill me, nigga
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
Now I'm ridin' through traffic, with 2Pac blastin'
With a bitch that's irritatin' from all these questions she askin'
Like what bitches I fucked, when, how and where?
You ain't my main bitch so why the fuck do you care?
That's why bitches get fucked then turn around and get left
Somebody need to teach them "less talk, more sex"
I'm pressed when I'm stressed, my granny tell me I'm blessed
Well, why the fuck do Jesus Christ got me goin' through this shit?
Everybody need favors, what happen if I go broke?
Or say I ain't got it and buy my lolo some spokes
Right up in your face, said "I'll fuck you up like some mace"
So fuck your handout, give a young nigga some space
Give a nigga some Ace, give me a blunt that's laced
Sprinkle some molly in it, watch me take this shit to my face
The snitch is the shooter, they took time away from his case
Holy shit, oh, lord, where is the world today?!
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
I swear this industry shit, to me, is one big-ass lick
I walk inside of a buildin', tell the A&R nigga "strip"
Tell 'em I need all of my chips, my life been on Section 8
I've been a welfare case, AFDC pump fake
Meanwhile, I'm grindin' 'cause drug money ain't like rap money
Four white kilo, snow-bunny, equal one whole show, dummy
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, they killed Braze
They killed Chad, my big homie Pupp
Puppy eyes on my face, bruh
And I really be drinkin', why the fuck I really been smokin'?
What the fuck? I'm the sober one
Man, I'm so stressed out, I can't focus
Hide out when I ride out, ski mask with the eyes out
Speed past in the Cutlass, me and little Ocho
Every young nigga hop out
Two tears in a bucket, I feel like "fuck it"
The price of fame, recognize my pain, it's all I know
All out war but I'm out here though
Call my troops like, "vamonos"
I'm on this tour bus and I'm fucked up
I got a bad call, and it's all bad
Off a OG with my OG and some OE by the tall glass
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
That's why I really be smokin' and I really be drinkin'
I be goin through some things, you don't know what I be thinkin'
What's happenin', nigga?

Nah, I'm serious though, like, already checked it out, feel me?
Man, look, check this out, homie, I'm with the shits, man, you already know, what's happenin', what you tryna do?
Man, nigga tryna get paid, like, is you serious or is you playin'?

Nigga I'm done straight 'bout to pull up, though, nigga, for sure, I'll holler
Aight, hold on, though
My nigga, this shit cool? You ain't tryna, you feel me, like?
Like, what's up, nigga?
Nah, you my nigga, cuz!Came in at first, had bad luck
Got a whole lot, remember I ain't had nothin'
We done sold out, now everybody mad at me
Tell 'em roll out, now everybody smashin'
Get ready cause you know we 'bout to be a problem
Hope you ready cause you know it 'bout to be a problem
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Fancy when I drive, six cars in the driveway
Cash in the driver door, spend it, do it my way
I fight you like a matador, fresh out the catalog
One fall we all fall, crew like dominoes
Paper chase, vamanos, all my dogs riding smoke
Mob heavy like the Pope, for that pot of gold
We are not alone, boy, better check your tone
You gone need a lot of help, I ain't talkin' bank loans
Sit with us, table last supper
Toast to the brothers, some bad motherfuckers
Yeah, ain't nothin' but pure luxury
You lookin' left to me, should be looking up to me
Preferably one of the best
She ridin' cause we next now and forever to death
Be loyal, real, and respect, stay ahead of the rest
We just sit back, relax, doin' things to impress
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Got no time to waste
And no way these niggas stoppin' me, oh no
Flyin' from a mile away
It's not a problem, only real ones follow me
And I can do this with my eyes closed
Blindfold two times over
Ride solo, I got women and got soldiers
I ain't trippin', you try to get it your night's over
Talkin' on Melatonin, get it and fight coma
What's a flea to a giant, niggas feedin' the fire
History, niggas be less them niggas flee when they flyin'
You don't believe it? Then try it
We don't believe in just tryin'
I call it peoples and leave 'em in 100 pieces divided
That's cold-blooded
And I've been this dope for like four summers
And I ain't really going for the he say, or she say
Keep it G for Pete's sake
I know this shit that bone you pick
Might leave you niggas fillets
It's the only way we know to go
Squad up, never roll alone
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
Pull up right in your zone
Take over the street, that's how we roll
And we gon' ride on forever
We ride out together
It's YG 4hunnid!
Is you ridin'?
Is you with all the burglarizing and the violence
If Jimmy got caught up, but you was right there with him
So the police askin' you questions, is you gone keep quiet??
Is you loyal, is you real, is you fake?
When I can't tell that's the type of way that I hate
You got that fake-friend syndrome
There's no cure so them symptoms is gon' show
You know the code, stick around, hold it down, never fold
Like it's a crease up in your Dicky Browns
Hold up, each one teach one
Motivate each one to be something
Cause I ain't just another statistic
I do this, this, and that if you wanna get specific
I'm just tryna make bread come quicker
For me and my day one hittas
Ride out!You shoulda seen how a nigga pulled up in the ride

Why all these rap niggas wanna be bloods?
Never see them in the hood only see them in the club
Ask Snaz I snuck in with the snub, and I just left the block
Had the homies say I'm dumb
What's up with that, shit
Nigga I don't fuck with that, shit
I'm 'bout to pull a Suge Knight and press the issue on sight
The real bloods either get a check or we own your ass
I went to sleep flamed up but I woke up in my Polos
I rock a low cut and wear my socks like a cholo
I coulda got a Ghost but I went and got a Lo-Lo
Cause copying off you rap niggas is a no no
I can hop out solo, tucked is a 4-4
I probably need three more, cause these niggas is emo
And see my altitude, they have an attitude
But I'm a solid ass nigga, what you niggas mad at me for?

And she ain't never got to tell me how she want it
I'm a real one baby, I'm already knowing

Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
I got a question 
How'd he make it this far? How the fuck did it begin? 
A Trump rally sounds like Hitler in Berlin
Or KKK shit, now I'm goin' in
I'm just sayin' what's real, I don't give a fuck who I offend
'Cause it's gotta be said, it's gotta be said
It's off the top like the toupee on Donald Trump's head 
This man's not peaceful, racism's evil
This man hates Muslims, that's a billion fuckin' people
If truth be told, Donald is a terrorist
Reasons why the world's got a problem with Americans
The fuck is goin' on? People just passed
A mass murder happened, you said thanks for the congrats 
You tryna get your votes up, you don't got class 
Orlando was a tragedy, you react fast
And then made it 'bout you, to boost your campaign 
It's goin' all bad if he wins this damn thing
Man, America's fucked if he's next up
Take a day to undo what Obama fixed up
It's Young Gerald so you know who said it 
And Ivanka can get it, straight up
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Oh, we ridin', check it
Now, we protest when we see the tour bus 
Too scared to get out, that's why the door is shut 
Your politics are like a Starburst pack 
Nobody fucks with the orange one 
Bannin' all Muslims? Aight, fool 
What if we ban all the white dudes?
Because a couple have run up in trenchcoats and rifles
And killed in the name of Jesus Christ at the high school
How 'bout we stop sellin' automatic guns?
You got rich 'cause your daddy gave you automatic funds
Add it up, you an automatic punk, what it is?
I'm just tryna make America great again! 
Party in the streets when Hillary wins
If she don't, my girl's half Canadian
Actually nah, I'm not gonna stay with them
I got an eagle on my arm, I'm a patriot
I'ma stay right here, I ain't livin' in fear
With my people who are Muslims, Mexican and Queer
And we ain't gonna let you fuck up four years
Ain't gonna let you fuck up four years
Fuck Donald Trump

But come to find out your own kind don't even like you
Macklemore don't like you, G-Eazy don't like you
The rest weenies, they scared to say it, but they don't like you
Obama don't like you, Michelle don't like you
Been tryna make it to one of your rallies but I ain't have time to 
Piss on your golf course just to find you 
Like where you hidin' at? Who you lyin' to?
Fuck your get rich scheme, I've been ballin' out
You're too old, you keep lyin', that's why your hair fallin' out
Donald Trump, call him out, KKK supporter
His favorite phrase, "Deport 'em," how the fuck y'all endorse him?
Since America's fucked up anyway
Give Obama a third term, that's what plenty say
Just left Texas, hit the stage for a couple thousand
And had your same color people hollerin'
Fuck Donald Trump
Fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, nigga, fuck Donald Trump
Yeah, yeah, fuck Donald Trump
YeahMeet the—Me—Meet the...
First: You find a house and scope it out
Find a Chinese neighborhood
'Cause they don't believe in bank accounts
Second: You find a crew and a driver
Someone to ring the doorbell
And someone that ain't scared to do what it do
Third: You pull up at the spot, park, watch
Ring the doorbell and knock
Four: Make sure nobody's home 
They gone; okay, it's on
Don't be scared, nigga, you in now
If the police come, you gon' find out who your friends now
That ain't me talking, that's your mind playing tricks on you
You conscious 'cause you know you got nines with two clips on you
But fuck that, motherfuck that plasma
And fuck that laptop, go and get that jewelry box
You tryna get paid? Go take that jewelry box to the Slauson
They'll give you cash back in the same day

I seen a bad bitch, I swing my hat back
And after I hit, I still on my back
Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid
Cause I toot it and boot it
And made her feel stupid
I met her at the club, then I said wassup
I took her to the crib and you know I fucked
Yeah, toot it and boot it, toot it and boot it
Toot it and boot it, that's why I toot and boot itAll my life, once say they love you, want to make you cry
Said they'd never leave, oh how they've lied
Gave up my loyalty and paid the price
Got me asking why these people wrong you, but you done them right
They giving up and all you do is fight
You sacrifice and you would even die
And I thank God for never leaving me alone even when I'm on my own
Won't break, I'm standing strong
And I thank God for showing the road to go
When I'm weak and feeling low, built tough, but never show
Sorry, Ms. Jackson, I hate to call in this fashion
I understand it's late and you work harder than average
Plus I'm knowing that you and your son have been clashing
But Keenon called and told me to tell you what happened
He hit a lick with his homies, his homies switched it on him
They spent the money, he got greedy and put the pistol on him
Shots fired from both sides, but nobody died
I thank God he survived and got out alive
But this gon' hurt you to hear
Keenon went to jail, might be facing some years
Police say it's evidence he broke into someone's residence
The neighbors say they witnessed it and plus they found fingerprints
They say the bail like fifty thou'
But it's gon' be like five thousand to get him out
Man, I told him not to fuck with them niggas
I'm sorry, I don't mean to curse, but I just never trust 'em at all
And he up in the pound, my dawg
And his girl ain't accepting his call
Can't let him fight the charge in his cell, he didn't bail on me

Pirus love me solo all inside a rare breed 
And shit, I'm coming from a rare breed 
Nowadays, these niggas snitching 
Give you digits off a scared plea 
Hold on, YG, since you came out with BPT 
These niggas think it's cool to come down to the CPT 
Remember back when rappers was scared to come into town 
Now it's Hollywood passes man that shit all watered down, damn!
A lil' change got you workin' like a slave 
Pac prolly rollin' in his grave, shit is sad, cuz
Ain't no more passes on the set
All you niggas out here fucking up the West, on God!
So don't come to LA

So don't come to LA
Nobody fucking with me
I go broke, rob fools for their jewelry
Stick your hand up like you guilty 
Doing things that my momma said I shouldn't be

Yeah, you better check in if you niggas want room
Look, one call on my phone
My Tiny Locs pull up, put that thing on your dome
Your money chain and Rollie, 60 seconds is gone
Man, I rather text a nigga
Fuck a feature for songs 
Run up on 'em like
"Nigga, where the scene at?" 
My niggas on go like 60 green lights
Just  got jacked tryna eat right
When my niggas off drugs, they don't think right
It's a recession, man, the hood fucked up
If a nigga ain't tripping, got the heat in the club
You walk around like you can't get touched
But JFK was the president and still got his head bust
So don't come to LA

Doing things that my momma said I shouldn't be

AHhhhHHH!!Woke up this morning feelin’ bool and balm
Ain’t have to drank no drank a niggas nerves was calm
Was it cause last night I had some bomb
She got ratchet in the red dress we had a bomb
Then I pulled up at the lights them niggas banging real hard
I had to tell them little niggas I never heard of yall
Tryna make a nigga lose his composure
I had to hit the gas on em’ almost spilled my whole soda
Still in motion, can't let em get the best of me
My curve skills on deck they want the recipe
They like how you do it and then keep it movin’
Cause see me I usually lose it
When nigga act stupid, like he ain’t know my record ruthless
Actin’ like he with the business but he ain’t worth me down’ detention
Sittin’ in prison waiting’ for my niggas, asking for money from these bitches
When niggas start trippin’ I be wanna start tripping’
But I’m just bicken and act like the bigger nigga
Cause
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective

So I pull up at Pammy House
Pammy stay next to my family house
And tell you something I used to dig out
I stopped digging she start tripping I had to dip out
Smashin' out of the driveway she threw a brick at my window
So I stopped she ran up and Keyed my 6-4
See when a real nigga hit it needy bitches go schizo
This dick is not a rental, should of knew from get go
Get get go, get, get get go
I’m friendly like Casper but I wait until I hit to get ghost
She called her brother on me, Stacy from The Wood but I ain’t pussy
Real niggas don’t get it between dick and pussy
10 minutes later got a call on my cell
From a nigga sound like he was fresh outta jail
“Like Aye little nigga don’t put your hands on my sister
Cause I just gotta outta jail
For manslaughter with a butcher
And she ain’t no hooker, she ain’t no bitch
My momma raised her right, my little sister got sense"
I told him I ain’t touch her I just stopped giving’ her dick
Then I told him, "Fuck you!" and hung up like click
Cause
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective
I’m bool, balm and bollective

Gotta call little later bout this and that
All drama, have to hang up like this is wack
I shouldn’t be talking’ on the phone either cause I’m strapped
If the police pull me over, my black ass goin’ back
And thats right up they alley, but I ain't a alley cat
I’m a red nose pitbull matter of fact
Turns on some Jeezy that's what street nigga slap
Right on Oleander left on Spruce we in the back
Now my older homie hollering’ at me
Bout some real life shit and how its ‘sposed to be
So he approaches me, get real close to me
Try to tell me bout some niggas thats close to me
So I listen and I listen
And I had to put my bid in
Can’t keep it real with some niggas that ain’t real with me
He said to keep it P you is right
They ain’t never bool they better respect your life
Cause

See my hood shine, pray I live to see the day
Rest in peace to my homie, he got hit up with that 
 
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace
But his chopper piece a bad outcome
I'm vicious, and my house is a red light district
And my couch is a porno star, out of town from Houston and Memphis
And I never gave a fuck and I never did fuck with y'all so I kept my distance
Just me and my day-ones, and a thousand ones for these strippers
Ho I been on my own, get on the song then pee on the song
My bladder is gone, I shatter your dreams
I'm Freddie it seems
My shadow is wearing expensive cologne
Pigtails and dookie braids, cabinet full of Kool-Aid
I'm ghetto as fuck and my pedal is up
But I'm gassing on all of you niggas man
Kendrick Martin, Hootie Malcolm
I'm screaming out peace, but his chopper piece a bad outcome
Stale face, how come?
Is it cause I do me? Or your main bitch wanna do me?
Face shots - we call it Call of Duty
K-Dot now bitch give me two feet
Made my bitch come give me two G's
Raised by wolves and we do eat
Play by rules and you might live
And I try to do this shit for the kids
But y'all got different prerogatives
And y'all rot in hell
And I dwell where the fortune live
And that's vicious
Big mouth, settle me down
Tell YG this how you hold a choppa
I ain't gonna lie I be feeling like Obama
Shootin shit wit Dave, mama knock 
This is illusion by the Patron
Chopper cocked and I'mma clap mine
Homies in the pen ain't never coming home
Creamed out car from the Chevron
Me and my mama in the county line
It was food stamps, now it's passport stamps
Bout to come back to the deuce line
Told you we'll blow like deuce nines
BSM - we cannibals
Eat your flesh, no antidote
Kendrick - that's family though
We on Rosecrans, it's a party ho
This right here's that Martin-Malcolm
Only difference we still alive
By any means necessary, squad life we down to ride
Interstate, rival Pi's
Seen them tears on my mama's eyes
Do whatever it takes to keep my daughter fly
I'll do whatever it takes to be immortalizedI'm a nigga and I can't go outside
We looking bad on the news black on black homicide
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
I need them dollars, got these problems with this llama on my mind
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, gotta keep this hope alive
I'm a nigga and I can't go outside
Cause if my homies say it's on then you know I'm down to ride
We make it hard for us with all this black on black crime
In the same state we gotta pay our tax
If we get locked up it's double rate
We get popped then retaliate, and they sell us these guns
In these fucked up schools where they teach us what they told to
Half the shit I learnt in school I ain't never used
These fucked up rules the government trying to control you
That's why we saying fuck the law, we act like we the ones with the juice
It's fucked up around here, some niggas luck up out here
The rest end up stuck up around here
So I'm speaking for my peers cause I still see their tears
I ain't sugarcoating nothing nigga, this is what it is
They supply us with the county to make us feel comfortable
Couple years pass, we in the same spot we was before
We was content on that section 8 shit
At the first of the month we got them groceries for them kids
But nah, they're fucking up our mental
Keeping us slaves so we can't be successful black people
We need to come together, fuck they system
Tired of being a victim, tired of racism
So I'mma spit this ism 'til this shit stop
Cause this that "nigga, we all we got!"
We need to stop hating on what the next black got
Give him his props to figure out how he ran shop
So our kid's kid's can be good
On a house in the hills, and with a house out in the hood
 Cause them folks that be wealthy
We never thinking of tomorrow, it's so unhealthy
We killing ourselves, they killing us too
They distract us with entertainment while they get they loot
They never gave us what they owed us, put liquor stores on every corner
Welcome to Lost Skanless, California
Haha, buenos dias motherfuckers
I'm Sadboy Loko, and I'm here to speak for my people
We need to come together, look around
They made the border for the browns cause we're not allowed
Gotta get the green card for me and my child
Those assholes payment under the table that don't last a while
Those jobs getting passed around, they dog our people
Why we gotta look for work at Home Depot?
It was us before the natives, why we ain't equal?
But why you give us no perks, fool we need those
"And we're trying to make America Great"
Fuck you esé, somebody bring him to the Treces
And  just for disrespecting
Black, brown or pale, it don't matter to me
The only color that call shots in this world is green
And at eighteen they want you to sign up for war
That's why most rather bang and hang around at the store
So to you, it's just another selling corn
To me, we out here hustling for the mortgage
Fuck you think we crossing the border for?
Why you think in a bedroom there's more than four?
You explored my country but can't accept my people
But who you want to run your business? My people
My flag is green, white, red, in the center's an eagle
Brown Pride, fist high, this is for my illegals
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
A brown cop harassing me, I guess we all look alike
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
This happens daily, all the time, I can never ask why
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
They make it harder by the day, tryna keep this hope alive
I'm a Chicano and I can't go outside
Cause if my homies say it's on, then you know I'm down to ride
Don't shoot...don't shoot officer, don't shoot, my hands up...my hands up...

I fucked his bitch, I took that pussy from a pussy nigga 
I'm bringin' real niggas back, they overlooked a nigga 
You like to show these niggas guns, I beat him, took your pistol 
I fuck her all off in the kitchen and I'm cookin' with her
She made me bacon with the eggs, thought she was cookin' dinner 
Two hours later, you on IG takin' pictures with her 
Soon as I woke up, gave me head, that's breakfast in bed 
Told on your nigga, he went fed, they found out you scared 
You play with me, you gotta go, I ain't gotta say it 
I pull it out, bitch, I'ma blow, so watch how you play it, you lil'...

And if the door's locked, I'm jumpin' through the window
I might be wrong but I ain't tryna work a 9 to 5
So if I gotta sell these pills, I'ma sell 'em high
Go get your business straight on renovated condos
Ratchet bitches whippin' chicken like a Roscoe
Niggas face tatted like Baby, Bomb and Bosco
And my city, niggas judgin' for what you got on
I'm well known from Atlanta past Fig homie
Me, TeeCee  400, Mustard gettin' rich though
No Limit  gettin' money like what they hittin' for?
Follow code, gotta value morals and principle
Niggas actin' like they're pimps but they paid the bitch
Some of us ain't in the position that we say we're in
In one year I done moved in 3 different residences
I fell asleep and woke up in a new Mercedes Benz
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I just want a dime on me
Snitchin' throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I gotta keep the fire on me
I'm ridin' dirty on the L-O
Cause the judge givin' niggas body parts, elbows
So I paid 15 hundred for my stash spot
This janky dude, if you fuck with it, it'll pop out
Ooh I got a strike and a felony
But the homie ridin' with me say his record clean
So you would take this case is what you tellin' me
Oooh, you better not tell on me
You went to jail for a nickel, came home too quick
And you wonder why your homeboys never wanna tell you shit
But you wasn't too sure so the homies still let him lurk
'Til niggas saw that paperwork
Told the DA, he was just drivin', he plotted, he did it
He even threatened to fuck me up if I wasn't with it
Now it's all bad in the hood and he can't come around
Conversation's like, "somethin', somethin', somethin', gun that nigga down"
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I just want a dime on me
Snitchin' throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I gotta keep the fire on me
I made it through my situation and I stayed down
For niggas  it's nothing much you can say now
I'm so accustomed to sucka' niggas that hate now
I pokerface and then touch 'em, my niggas play foul
It ain't no rules cause these niggas threw the rules away
If I could pick a place and time I would choose today
See I'm the type of nigga die for his jewelry
Gang related homicide is what the news'll say
Playing with my reputation ain't amusing me
Playing with a nigga patience who are you to say
Short temper, fuck it, I'ma blow a fuse today
And when I lose my mind I'ma shoot a face
I seen 'em get away with murder cause he knew the way
Killed a nigga, went to trial, then he beat the case
So what type of example do it set, nigga
Play with mine, you can fuckin' get wet nigga
Yes, nigga
Niggas wanna shine with me
But they won't do the time with me
Snitches throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey
I just want a dime on me
Snitchin' throw their time to me
That's why I always ride lowkey

This song right here about a girl named Keshia
I know we all know a girl named Keshia
If you don't, listen to this
Young Keshia, so fly, so diva
So wise, so eager, so hot, high fever
Everybody in the hood wanna taste her, she was teasin'
Everybody thought they had a chance with it, she wasn't easy
She knew the Earth was made of dirt
Daddy wasn't around but she knew her worth
You ain't have to tell her cross her legs when she wore a skirt
Life goal's to be a lawyer or a nurse
She let Ray hit it at 18 years young
Them grown-up bums had Ray sprung
Everybody knew she was the one
She ain't fuck with lil' boys since dun-dun-dun-duns
Photogenic, she knew her angles, huh
Everybody shot they shot from different angles, huh
Lookin' in her eyes, you saw angels, huh
You would've swore she was an angel, huh
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a baby
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a...
Ray was a young boy when Chris start comin' 'round
Chris was playin' ball so she couldn't turn him down
He was full of game, she got hers from her mama
Ray was lame compared to Chris, but Chris came with the drama
Mama always said she was Michelle, she need Obama
Mama said don't settle with no broke nigga, that's a problem
She ran that same game on Ray, that's sad
She left Ray for Chris, she in her bag
Now Ray all fucked up, Chris just lucked up
Ray probably suicidal 'cause he really love her
Chris a first round draft pick, he 'bout to blow up
Ray somewhere gettin' drunk, face on sad pup
Keshia ain't trippin', she don't think 'bout it at all
Months later, Ray seen Keshia pregnant in the mall
Jaws dropped like, "Ahh" 
Ray was really her dawg and she did him like a dog
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a baby 
Keshia had a baby
Keshia had a...
Chris finally made it to the league
Chris was scoring thirty points a game, MVP
Twenty mil' a year, the highest paid on the team
Life was good good, Keshia neck bling bling
Keshia wrist bling bling, Keshia ring bling bling
He was a made nigga with a bad bitch on his team
Couple goals, they was a meme
Anywhere they came, they came clean

You don't wanna rumble  , these niggas can't take me 
Niggas said that they love me , but they show me they hate me 
It's a cold, cold world, no need for AC 
Nigga I have my own bag, rich nigga I own that
Nigga I'm from the projects, got a house where the Combs at

Tried to take it and you gotta-
Fight, fight, fightOoh, top five top five top five top five I mean no doubt
True, repo make sure we took your house we need the couch

Mayne, so much that kid snuck from the bathroom off the fence
Mayne, we bump your shit like when I'm high and when the rent
Ain’t, several, figures, where your friends?

Be who you are

Nigga, bigger and better than all of y'all, anyone

Shit, riding round with the bass like
20 inch rims with them center plates absolutely
Sick of the lies, shucking and jiving
More conniving, I'm riding in my G-30 fizz-ive
Rolling up weed in my G-30 fizz-ive
Made a lot of green in my G-30 fizz-ive 
Back and bossed up
I just touched down, I Randy Moss’d 'em
I be taking the payment, stacking the savings
Can't blow all your cheddar my dog, you do better
Running through the city sitting pretty like hair on hoes
I'm here, I'm home, I'm high off life
I'm high off sprite, mixed with a little hi-tech
We got twenty bags, we got dime sacks
Never play myself short now it's off to the airport
Another classic got niggas waiting to export
More spiritual than lyrical
But still I need my residual, absolutely
Never find it even with credit cards
I hold my nuts, and when I hit that wall I run through it
'Til my niggas hit that mall and run through it
This is more than music, nigga I swear that
I'ma get a Roley and a house just like Uncle Willy
Big ass house in the woods
Kick my shitty ass bucket to the curb when I start rollin' 'round in a Bentley
Got a ride in a big ass ride

Stunt on them broke ass hoes

Preacher's Son a year old and it still slap
I might, pull up on a rapper tell 'em get on this shit
Boy you a mess, make it look so easy do you see the finesse? Building your job
Searching for your surface out of vacant facade

When he go to court, that the feds don't open it
Fake niggas putting up, "Free you" when they be posting it
But ain't no money orders in the mail when you open it

Before Worldstar, head ups weren't televised
Crack sales with shoe box deposits
Homie lived outside and the cleaners was the closet
Work got swallowed, enemies got knocked off
Give her to the driver have the nigga's top gone
Work, sold for it, young niggas flocked for it

Enemies all foul, snitch when you bust at 'em

I know preachers needing Jesus - and I know I’m far from perfect
But I know I’ve got a purpose - what it is, I’m not for certain
Life is like a circus - but I ain’t trippin, I know I’m blessed
But if I ever make it to the grammies, I can finally tell my granny looking back I got no regrets
Do it like we’ve never ever seen it done
There’s no way that you could ever kill the flame
So hot it’s like we’re living on the sun
Living on the top of the world
Like we’ve never ever seen it done
There’s no way that you could ever kill the flame
So hot it’s like we’re living on the sun
Do it like we’ve never ever seen it done
There’s no way that you could ever kill the flame
So hot it’s like we’re living on the sun
Living on the top of the world
Like we’ve never ever seen it done
There’s no way that you could ever kill the flame
So hot it’s like we’re living on the sunHe's Back!

Tonight I'm bringin' you somethin' new, somethin' special
You see the highlights of a life was not as a teen
Baby girl was homeless, had a nigga thuggin' in the streets
18, runnin' plays in the streets, dealin' with them weirdos niggas
In-between family wasn't no real love she ever seen
Head beat, mentally depressed, baby was not what she seemed
Always gleam, kept a smile on the face, avoid the questioning
Even though apparent how she moved, she done seen some things
Prolly had some dreams, diminished by the luck of things
Reality, lost her way and started strippin'
More pain, 13 and the fam yellin', "Prolly all you'll ever be
Ho-in', strippin' in the streets, you'll be pregnant by 15" Said bet money, they bet money
Mama ain't have time for her, daddy never cared for her Never had the guidance, only downin' words that's drownin' her
Cut off from the world, shit was cold to her
Tried to kill herself but shit, it didn't work
Mama laughed, it broke her heart
Built from scabs, so pain don't hurt
Never built a day she worked
Hard to get it back when all they did was stomp it in the dirt
Now look at her, 21 and numb, she still feel pain but it don't bother her
Puttin' family first, even after all the dirtMan... uh, first off, I wanna send all my love to the family. Moms, pops, g-moms, Lauren, Emani, Kross, Blacc Sam, Adam, George, BH, Cobby, um... JStone, Jay, Jay Rock, you know what I'm sayin’? The whole family already know what it is with me. Um... Nip, you feel me, that's... you feel me, my brother from the other color, you know what I'm sayin’? Um... he was like a real big brother to me, like we... like we... like every time I'm with Nipsey, we not talkin' about no nothin' that don't mean nothin'. We always talkin' about goals, family, homies, plays we tryna make. Like... like I was havin' conversations with Nip about... I’m like, "Look, bro, we got, we got some light skinned pretty girls we gotta raise, we in trouble, my nigga, what we gon’ do?" You know what I'm sayin’? And uh... bro always gave me advice. You feel me? This locc'd out Crip nigga, he gave me books to read and shit like that. I'm like damn, this nigga different, man. You know what I'm sayin’? Uh... I mean, I could talk about a lot, but bro fought for me, I fought for him. You feel me? That's... I look at bro like a real big brother. He sent me a text message on my birthday, March 9th. He texted me like, "Happy birthday, bro, I wanna congratulate you for building a brand that's gon' last forever. Respect." And I replied like, "Good lookin', bro." I told bro, I said, "Hussle the motivation, my nigga." You know what I'm sayin'? So... so... so, um, I just wanna let bro know. I wanna congratulate bro for his legacy and everything he did, all the game he gave me, all the people he touched, and for the brand he left behind. On behalf of the West Coast, on behalf of L.A. The streets, my nigga, we love you, my nigga. I'm gon' miss you, my nigga, and you already know what it is. All money in, 4Hunnid on mines, um, and like Lauren said, "The mothafuckin' marathon continues, nigga." West side, niggaIt's the motherfucking house in this bitch
We got Kevin Adams coming live from the motherfucking basement
It's the house, it's trill dreams
Fuck them niggas, I said that
Fuck them niggas
Fuck my P.O
Trill dreams muthafucka

Young nigga big balls, big dreams
Money scheming, bad bitch
Mixed Breed, sayin she ain't a freak
But her panties are see through
Sure I believe you, I must have x-ray vision then
Visions of me in a Benz
With a ten fuckin' right
Gotta risk it, roll the dice
And dog you scared to fail
And nigga you scared of life
Not a stereotype just wanna be heard through your stereo too
And move my mom and dad out of imperial too
And smoke weed and keep making these rap anthems
Times is getting ugly, pockets ain't that handsome
Women see a nigga and be like oh hey handsome
And all black, the clan thinking are they Panthers
Cause we ain't pussy, and we ain't actors
Are we legends, cause we ain't rappers
They ask questions and then bang after
Damn the nigga didn't even wait for an answer
Muthafucka's is sick, but it ain't cancer
Rolling in big wheels, but we ain't hamsters
Young blacks, mad we just tryna get nigga rich
Ass fat, look like it should belong on a bigger bitch
Hospitals ain't never seen a nigga as sick as this
Did I mention the house I gotta say that with emphasis
Can a muthafucka kick it one time 
Like can a muthafucka kick it one time
And baby your gorgeous, the whole world should see ya
Maybe we should fuck in a house with no glasses
One time while I'm posted and getting head
Baby what's your hat size
See Martin would be proud, a white girl to like black guys
These hoes ain't gonna love you until you make it
And the friends that you make after will probably be the fakest
Trill dreams muthafucka
On probation only sippin lean muthafucka
Dirty bitches always want a clean muthafucka
Pull a bitch right up out her seams muthafucka
What it seen muthafucka
Trill dreams muthafucka
On probation only sippin lean muthafucka
Dirty bitches always want a clean muthafucka
Pull a bitch right up out her seams muthafucka
What it seen muthafuckaSaid I'm ridin' in that Porsche, mind on a million

My girlfriend trippin', so fuck how she feelin'
She think I'm worth a million so her panties get to peelin'

Legs up in the back seat, booty in the back seat
The way a nigga ballin' you would think I was an athlete
Mustard in that Benzo, I'm up in that Porsche, though
Youse a bad bitch, why you actin' like a whore, though?
Lean by the quart load - 16 OZs
Mind on a million, bitch, fuck you call me?
All my homies bangers, pistols ain't no strangers
Pistols ain't no strangers, and pistols can't taint us

It’s December and you’re broke and your kid just made a wish list
Packs ain’t moving now you wonder where the lick is
And these girls came to party - they just wan’ know where the liq' is
Dope boy ambitions when you gotta handle business
It’s December and you’re broke and your kid just made a wish list
Packs ain’t moving now you wonder where the lick is
And these girls came to party - they just wan’ know where the liq' is
They act like they’re your friends but they spyin on ya
My pain was never felt like a paralyzed patient
Lay me down in that holy water
Feel those rain drops dropping
Can’t even trust my brother cause my mother say
That he ain’t who he say he is
Keep your eyes open cause them games they will try and play
But a wolf will still howl at the moon in sheeps clothing
Lay me down in that holy water
Shower me with riches, need discernment on these bitches
Cause these girls keep on plottin on us
Stirring up the waters, I’m just tryna catch some fishes
Life’s a bitch tell me how she look, but come to think about I don’t think it even matters
You can follow me down to the brook
But if you strike the shepherd all the sheep are going to scatter
And he drown in that holy water
On my way to heaven with a loaded mac 11
Keeping peace is what they never taught us
The devil keep on lurking, don’t you listen to that serpent
Dope boy ambitions when you gotta handle business
It’s December and you’re broke and your kid just made a wish list
Packs ain’t moving now you wonder where the lick is
And these girls came to party - they just wan’ know where the liq' is

I swear that there ain't no convincing him
Jerry, you his cousin, when you see him talk some sense in him
He did so much wrong I swear that there ain't no convicting him
Folks done picked a picture of a saint, but that shit fake
I swear that I'ma catch a stroke before I trip about a bitch again
My shaw hit my line, she thinks I’m skeezin' on this bitch again
Riding slow with no L's while I'm ducking the law
The police out here catching bodies like a fucking trust fall
They say, "ain't your dad a preacher?
What you doing smoking reefer?
Hanging out with the thugs and G's"
I could've been preacher, but I'm rapping
He said, "Nigga, while you at it
Tell me what could you for a fifteen?"
See, I'm just with my niggas, hangin'
Hangin' out with the thugs and G's
I'll be right here posted hangin'
I'll be right where I'm supposed to be
Smoke weed every day
Get high, get high, get high
(That's alright
Don't worry about what the fuck I be doing)
Get high, get high
All I really got is a dollar and a dream
But I spend that dollar on AriZona tea
If you got the faith from marijuana seeds
Maybe you can achieve bigger things in the league
I'm tryna ball like Kobe and make it out this trap
Ain't tryna take no naps, ain't tryna get no daps
Ain't tryna be no friends that won't buy no Benz
You grow and get your shit together
That's why a nigga had to get his shit together
Now I've been begging on this rap shit
That's why I feel like the shit took forever
I got dreams of loving, but selling Molly ain't the way
You know just a summer ago I had  Porsche for me each day
Damn, what an asshole, but I still got the gas though
Sold my first pack with Lando, we were too much to handle
Keep the Pac-Man like Pac-Man Johnson
Pack my johnson off of your bitch and I do it so slick
And then I change my life
They say, "ain't your dad a preacher?
What you doing smoking reefer?
Hanging out with the thugs and G's"
I could've been preacher, but I'm rapping
He said, "Nigga, while you at it
Tell me what could you for the fifteen?"
See, I'm just with my niggas, hangin'
Hangin' out with the thugs and G's

They supposed to hold you up to their certain standard like you're perfect
Fuck nah! But if you don't know anything else just know I'm about prosperity

Paid this much just for a tat, that means you supposed to brag
Rick Owens if you lookin’ at my tag

So I can show him the bong I just bought
When it comes to bomb weed, I got a lot
My fam’ straight as bitch ass niggas, I got a watch
And nah, man, this shit ain’t rented, it’s off the lot
Charm with tons of rocks, car without the top

Fuckin' mob figga, west coast, who ride?Crackhead sitting on the corner, looking like he might be in need
Wondering if you could give him a little bit of cheese
For another crack rock and a little McDee’s
Oh, he gon’ get it
Remember sitting in my uncle kitchen, I was 8 though
Whippin up a lil something for the pesos
I was making pyramids out of legos
He was making sure his daughter 'n' them was straight though
Screaming mother fuck a cop, carl winslow
Louie colors with the motherfuckin tint, ho
Ran the trap like a gahdamn drive-thru
Slanging crack out the motherfuckin window
And a drive through, nigga gotta get bread
By any means my nigga
Motherfuck Feds, let’s get this cheese my nigga
Until we all fed, he started out with 9 niggas now they all dead
And the choir sings
Da da da daaaaa daaaaaa da
Da da da daaaaa
Young nigga posted on the corner
Posted with a pocket full of trees
See this shit cost a dub it ain't got no sticks or seeds
And I can’t fuck with you if you ain't got the fees
Shit I'ma get it
Nigga lets get lifted
We can get high tonight
And we gone jack that nigga that was flossin' right?
Didn’t have no gun it was hard that night
Tried to jack a motherfucker with a army knife
I gotta lay low
Made a trip up to the borough cause the ends low
I’m on the interstate with 10.5
Damn 
There go Carl Winslow
Niggas ask me how I'm doing
Shit I'm fucked up
But I still found a way to get the bucks up
Me and Rob in the place with our cups up
I’m in ya girlfriend still tryna get a nut up
Sheesh
Da da da daaaaa daaaaaa da
Da da da daaaaa
Crackhead standing on the corner
Night time staring at the trees
Feigning for a rock, she was over 6’3
Sharing dirty needles, arm looks so diseased
Lil kids run to the house in the driveway
Tarnished last game of hide and seek
1-2-3 smell the fumes from the weed
That the old heads lit down the street, got a nose for the seeds
High so good swear it’s all that she need
Should’ve past a week ago - shareek sheesh
Can I get a dolla' from a fiend
Up and down the street
Walking looking at the heaps of the smoke from the porch
Look sexy to its schmit
Tryna reach the pyramid, slave for the queen
Niggas life of queens playing pricks in Corvettes
Fast lining, purple raining hoes make them wreck
Da da da daaaaa daaaaaa da
Da da da daaaaa
And this is to a new life
That shit ain't even worth it my nigga
These fuckin' rappers got y'all sent the fuck out
Yo
And before I begin
It's the mu'fuckin' House my niggaSee it's the rise of the righteous
We take from the wicked
We might as well risk it, we die for a living
We ride for our niggas, and kill for our children
Tell the truth to my brother, telling lies to these piglets
I can't deny I
Been watching you niggas just like a flock of sheep for weeks
I Little-Bo-Peep'd the game y'all running
I know how to play it, no playin'
Shit I'm like David, the heart of a fighter
The rise of a king, the fall of Goliath
Before you let your light pass by
Don't ask how, ask why
I could die tonight, listen to your mothers
That rioters living gon' put you right inside prison
May your sins be forgiven
Niggas here will steal your dough like Kareem's agent
Stocking caps on their heads with the smushed faces
Young goons hit you niggas with the stale faces
A blue pill will probably put these niggas in the matrix
Tell Delilah I can smell the setup
Boy you blinded by that pussy better pick ya head up
Preachers promise lies just to pay your tithes
Cowards cast stones and then go back and hide
I might just turn a stone looking back on it
A pocket full of stones is all I got for my foes
I think I'm like David, the heart of a fighter
The rise of a king, the fall of Goliath
So smart that it's stupid, consistently moving
We feeling immortal, but really we humans
This a work of art put my life on a canvas
I'ma make me some money, put it up for my familyYG which ones you like better
These Frankie B's or theses Gucci's ?
Wait which ones make my booty look bigger ?

Look, big dog status, got it lit, boy
I'm a boy, I blew a M on some toys
V12, hit the gas, better make noise
Ayy, I threw some D's on it like I'm rich, boy 
Ayy, I'm a foreign whip driver, ayy
My bitch is scammer, credit card, slide it, ayy
I like my hoes like my whip with no mileage, ayy 
The feds watchin' so we hidin', ayy
Made it out the block, I could make it to the top
Made it after I got shot, it's still up with the opps
Tryna finesse the plug while duckin' the cops
She know I'm from the bottom, she wanna get on top
I know they watch when I bought the watch, I bought the Glock
Gettin' money harder, I make it easy so I know they hot

Guck, flex' hart, auch wenn mein Papa sagt, es reicht
Viele Dollar, wenig Zeit, California Aufenthalt 
Bis nach Bogota First-Class, trotzdem fühl' ich mich allein
Graue Bilder, will vergessen, doch der Teufel sagt mir, „Nein“
Außer der Musik, um mich alles still
Gläser voller Liquor und sie tropfen auf mein Bild 
Früher Fantasie, heute ist es real
Alles, was du siehst, hab' ich mir erfüllt 
Mieten Haus in den Hills, ball' in Beverly 
Money, Melodien, komm' mit Energie
Um mich rum Dämon'n auf der Street wie an Halloween
Werde weiter groß, komm' ans Ziel für die Family

Y’all don’t even understand what kind of life I’m on
Walking through the valley with my Nikes on
Prophecy - I had to go and get my psyche on
Damn that nigga TUT and K be making songs
I remember making plays inside of vacant homes
Make the wrong turn you might not make it home
I’m trying to make a million dollars, it won’t take me long
I’ve been looking for truth, not sure if I’ll ever find it
Sleep with the enemy and kill her at the top of a climax
Flee to a different climate, I’m shining like freshly polished
Silver ware at the diner, breaking out the good china
I’m as fresh as my line up, working from Monday to Sunday
Feed the team like a coach at CiCi’s pizza on Monday
Swipe your visa Lord Jesus so y’all can pay some attention
I’ve been pimpin' since Pippen these hoes just made it a business
Y’all done made me the villain, call me TUT the Joker
Made your lady my baby, rolled her around in my stroller
Getting neck like a shoulder, I’m bout my paper like folders
Sell that weed like a dominoes, “Hi can I take your order”
Unknown numbers, I do not pick up, that there is a stick up
Pick up yo' bitch with no pick up line, she call and I don’t pick up
Hands in the air this a stick up, bitch we ain’t playin that
We ain’t asking no questions, dog we just making a statement, uh
I’m back on this microphone
Y’all don’t even understand what kind of life I’m on
Walking through the valley with my Nikes on
Prophecy - I had to go and get my psyche on
Damn that nigga TUT and K be making songs
I remember making plays inside of vacant homes
Make the wrong turn you might not make it home
I’m trying to make a million dollars, it won’t take me long
The truth is what you hoping to find
It’s hocus pocus, so instead we try to focus this grind
You start to see the smoke and mirrors when you open your mind
I want them hooked on these bars, I put some dope in these lines
I put some drug in your ear, I hope I’m coming in clear
See it ain’t even hard to tell who sit and running it here
They call me big papi mami, ain’t no bunting in here
You know like y’all want the answer like we talking ‘bout practice
She got that wet pack they say my name John the Baptist
The homies is local, I said that I want the atlas
You know the axis to axis, I put them ashes to ashes
We puff and pass it, putting sound waves in a casket
Like every track could be classic, been gettin' gettin' them buckets
I try to kill them with kindness but they just stay on that fuck shit
I sit and chill at the brunch and keep trying to function
She gets baked and gives them buns up like they fresh out the oven, ah
I’m back on this microphone
Y’all don’t even understand what kind of life I’m on
Walking through the valley with my Nikes on
Prophecy - I had to go and get my psyche on
Damn that nigga TUT and K be making songs
I remember making plays inside of vacant homes
Make the wrong turn you might not make it home

Swear that arm and hammer and water on my apron on and sauté it
Turn that gas stove on me homie I know the recipe I flambé it

Low key condo kilograms on the table looking better than Ferrari keys

When I was a baby, now the baby boy, he done grown up
I own up to mistakes 'til I am an owner of business
Made my own business boy fuck your percentage

Get what you deserve, spoken word is smokin' herb
I don't want sell dope no more, left two kilos at the church
Now, we back to selling birds, oh, I was getting gassed
As if I was doing good, then sold me a fifty bag
He done spent his whole life for the up, for the commas
No more Louie colors with the motherfucking debt
Just a two-toned Impala
You can't sell bricks no more cause the Fed's is on his ass
So I ask, nigga, ain't you tired of the struggle?
It's like saying you tired of the hustle

And them bills gon' keep coming
Might as well find you some dope in the stash
I'm looking for peace of the mind

I get this dough, feed the fam, and put my niggas on
I must look comfy as hell, these hoes keep sleeping on
I thought myself how to work a scale just to sell a zip

Another tale from the corners of where I'm coming from
If I,I bought you a gram, I just might show you love
Yeah, coaching niggas to success like Dennis Kimbro
In the limo, making bitches break they back like a limbo
No way shit go coincidental, best start taking advantage
I'm a man of my talents, you Marcus Garvey
Tell these niggas "sorry"
They should've listened, should've paid some attention
You all focused on image but broke ass for ratchet bitches

Skinny boy with the muscle

It’s 9 PM as I sit here and stare at the sun
Acid dissolves on my tongue
Pray I don’t get strung out on drugs
Living my life to the fullest even though my tank is on empty
Yeah, speeding down the road to riches
Hoping I don’t crash this new Bentley
Better stay in your lane, I ball my fist up and crush all of you
Fall to my death in the afterlife, I just might roll up some stress
Might kill myself cause I’m dressed fresh to death
Talk to God like I know I’m not the best
But these folk hear the tunes and they think I’m the best
Thank you God you got a nigga so blessed
Take me out with a shot before I’m shot by the press
Wind up with 2Pac and Biggie laid back, talking smack
As we counting up royalty checks
Do you even know what the fuck loyalty is?
Ride for your niggas we takin them chance
Selling them packs, we don’t need your advance
We got them jams, might come with the band
Won’t do your show unless you come with the bands
I’m high on a plane, I’ma fly when I land
Kamehameha, I’ma go Super Saiyan
My mind wanders off to a forest with this little black kid
We roll up some smoke
And he knows this good joke about a priest and fat kid
He said “TUT, you the man, please believe it.”
I’ve been the man since I’ve been a fetus
They don’t know me better take it easy
I’m the hot sauce on the Beanie Weenie
Like a genie when I switch it up
Ain’t this the shit you been wishing for?
Me and K laid the bassline
About how I done think these two junkies done sniffed up
This shit ain’t about golds, this shit is about vision
We talking about goals, the shit we be feeling
I don’t like none of the shit I been hearing
These ginger ass flows, there ain’t no soul in your lyrics
Switching up hoes as a change of appearance
You calling them hoes as a term of endearment
I ain’t been caring about what I’ve been wearing
Dog, I done been somewhere in tune with my spirit
Dropping them bombs, this shit is that pyro
I see the future so clear with my eyes closed
Tick tick, it’s a time bomb
When it blows, the time is gon’ be kairos, boomYeah, yeah yeah yeah Trill Jojo on the beat, bitch
Huh, huh, You finna die, baby! Yeah

So you can get a full clip
Anyone can get a full clip
And you know just what I mean
Nigga tell me what you meant
On you I can’t depend
I don’t really want no friends
I don’t really want no friends
Two choppers singing thats a duet
Nigga you playing with your life, Russian roulette
And I leave that pussy too wet
Then I leave and she ask me why I do that
You don’t want no problems
Acting hard, you should go and turn to soap opera
Nigga I’m different I got no job, uh
I eat a pig infront of your Allah
Cause he don’t really want no drama
I’m a rap god
Wrap a nigga in some duct tape
Beat his ass if he go bonkers
We gon’ throw him off a fucking cliff
I don’t really give a fuck no more
Niggas hating won’t show love no more
I’m bout to go and get a fo fo
Niggas hating on a nigga coming up
Instead of joining the team to get some bucks
Niggas rather kill the nigga coming up instead of joining the team
And becoming the one these hoes wanna fuck
That was a long-ass beat, this shit over anyway, you heard?
Gang
Shoutout my nigga Trill Jojo on the beat, you hear?
This beat just got Lil JojoI done seen a lot
Ayy
My Blessings out to Judy, two of her sons died
So I thank the lord that I see the sun rise
Judy don't cry, the pain is hard to hide
I know it's rough mama, but keep hope alive
Pray for better days, to see them better days
I know the world is ugly, like FlavorFlav
But I've seen better, so it'll get better
Do don't even sweat it, like a thick sweater
And tell my nigga Juvvy Rick to keep his head high
I know it's hard to see two of your bros die
Just heard shots by the dust towns
And turn around and see your brother jump outta Fresh towns
Before he fucked the world, 'cause it's a cold bitch
With no panties on, and some wet lips
And she licked her lips and stared at me
And then the music and the lord saved me
You can try to take the boy out the hood, but you can't take the hood out the boy
It won't change, won't change
And they can try to take him out the hood but it ain't gon' do nothin'
It won't change, won't change, ohh
Dayumm, ain't shit changed since I was little
My pops doing the same thing and I wish he wouldn't
My grandmother died way back in '97
But she stayed over my head and she kept blessing
My brother in the pen, I can not stop stressing
85 to life, damn I think he got the message
Ay, but I keep your name floating on
TeeCee4800 and they know I'm on, huh
I got a lot of niggas hating on me
Cause they say a nigga eatin' while they stayin' hungry
I've been on the block forever, nigga, I ain't phony
Bitch I do this shit for real, you can ask my homies
Ha, blue chucks and my blue strings
Blue Dickies, selling crack, bitch I gangbang
And like 2Pac, I don't see a damn change
That's why I pity Jay Kwon, that's a damn shame
You can try to take the boy out the hood, but you can't take the hood out the boy
It won't change, won't change
And they can try to take him out the hood but it ain't gon' do nothin'
It won't change, won't change, ohh
Ugh, living life as a street nigga
Ever since the start like a beginner
Hungry nights when we couldn't even eat dinner
Life's a bitch so I fuck her, yeah I'm deep in her
Then they try to take the streets out of me
Nigga hit licks and cashed out like a lottery
Woke up one morning at gunpoint
How would you feel if the police run up in your joint?
Took my pops away for 'bout 3 years
Every night a nigga cry more than 3 tears
I was good though, nigga start gangbanging 
Hustle every day 'til I started maintaining
Classes got ditched and homies got killed
Hurt is the perfect word a nigga felt
Then, my nigga Ace pops died
Ever since then, we've been smoking like Popeyes
You can try to take the boy out the hood, but you can't take the hood out the boy
It won't change, won't change
And they can try to take him out the hood but it ain't gon' do nothin'
It won't change, won't change, ohhI mix the 4Hunnid with the designer

And I need it in my hand!
 In this corner is
The heavyweight champion
Ask around man
You don't want to step to him
Cash driven with a monstrous grin
Aw snap! Let the killing begin
You got a villain that's in to win
And don't depend on the handouts
Gettin' paid from a blade
While the fans shout
Knock 'em out then your scrilla grows
Knock 'em off and become a pro
As if you didn't know
The fetty is about to gross majorly
And what you hold precious is
Only a game to me
No thing to be top rate global
Staring in your eyes
While I got you in a choke hold
Loco is what I might be
But for the dough I will strike through
You quicker than lightning
It's frightening when you see my face
But, by then it is way too late 
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you 
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you
As I step on the scene
Right, left from a swing
Man down! I'm a king
Gettin' green is a dream
If you know what I mean
Come and step in the ring
Or better yet the arena
The harder the challenge
The larger the greener
No joke when it comes to mines
For the right price step it up, next in line
No money, no honey, no honey
Slim tummy
Next stop, skid row, straight bummy
It's not funny when you can't survive
So, you better get paid
Or you might as well die
And I can help you with that
Turn around let me hit you inna face wit' a bat
Stackin' money is the task at hand
Even if I gotta take it out your mask my man
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you 
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you
It's kinda ill when you think about it
Population control in a game overcrowded
I doubt that's a problem with me
'Cuz I will take 'em all out for just the right fee
Right knee, left hook, head butt
Raw flesh, disposed, ripped up
Knuckle up if you think you can hang
It's nothing personal it's all for the change
And the ladies, and the cars
Nice things anything that I want
For the bling man I'm all on the hunt
I can't front, little punks get done
When it comes to dinero
I don't think that you want to be a hero
One with the zeros, binary
Countin' the cream
It's the American Dream
You know I heavily fiend for the paper
Guess who's next?
Don't trip just cut my check
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you 
Soon enough, I'mma make me a million
Even if the results will be killing
Fast cars, women, gotta be true
Even if I gotta take out you
I told you, I don't play

Ask me why in this Bitch?
I'm tryna die in this Bitch
Like the pussy too nice and I can't lie about the shit
But the kids ain't spitting bars and wanna cry about the shit
Claim it's all about the vibe so guys just let it slide
Can't even hit the beat unless it's 808's inside
Should I decimate? I hesitate
I really can't decide
But nigga fuck the kids and the vibe
Always wonder how these fucking kids gon' survive
Cause they always off the xans like the mans with the lines
But mine coming out of my mind
Them kids come out of they pockets any time that they can find

Most these niggas zombies and the rest is left for dead 
Kids go to bed

Leave a text read and she'll be tweeting bunch of threads
Let the bitch be kid, gon' n' move ahead
Fragile hearted fucks
Say a word, they'll run amuck 
Learn to never give a fuck
I guess they need some angle dust
Want revenge you gotta do it out of spite 
What's done in dark always gotta come to light 
If that's yo girl don't worry bout it bitch I might 
I don't condone this, tend to give out bad advice
Man they screwed anyway
They'll overdose bout any day 
Sitting by a trash can spitting throwaways
Writing bars to me ain't nothing but a child's play

We blowin blunts like candles, when you make a wish
Going back and forth, arguing about whos mistake it is
You know I ain't the type of nigga for relationships
All these problems like a vacation, I'm getting away from them
Like save the problems for your mama, I ain't buying em
Like girl you the only one I'm wit, she know I'm lying
Talking bout bitches I fucked the first night I met em
Like if you ain't gon do nothing about it, bitch shut up
She tired of my shit, she can't do it, she fed up
And if she lookin for tha dough, I'd be glad to help her’
And she know about my other bitch
If I ain't fucking her, she know who I'm fucking wit
And I'm caught up in the mix
Cuz I'm in love with this girl but I love the other bitch
 
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police
And my girlfriend came home, warning
She be searching through my shit like she had a warrant
Tryna find out who my who other bitch
Lying to her saying she a good friend, yeah right bitch
And if you ridin wit me, nigga hop in
My other bitch got me feeling like I'm flyer than a rocket
All that bullshit you talking bout you need to stop it
And not appeal but I'm tryna pop, lock and drop it
And we can keep it low nobody gotta know
But sometimes having two bitches the way to go
And if I can't trust some of the homies, I can't trust a ho
Cuz all she wanna do is argue, I said fashoo
And she searching through my shit like she the police
I know we've been talking for a minute but you don't know me
And I think she know about my other bitch
But she can't do nothing about it but just live with it
 
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the police
I'm telling her how it is, she say stop playing stupid
I'm in the streets, on the grind tryna do me
She asking me questions, where you at? who are you with?
Jumping to conclusions that I'm fucking with a new bitch
So, I bought her flowers on the weekend
Hope she forgives me for cheatin
But if she don't I'mma be cool, cuz I'mma go back to girlfriend number two
 
I think she knows about, my other bitch
She's always searching my shit like the police, searching through my shit like the policeEy,

Ey, You can't catch me!
Ha ha ha!
What you thought that was?
I'm a soldier to the death!
I'm a sovereign mobbing through the city streets
Your little petty rules do not apply to me
I like to ride and see the puppets hanging on the strings
And every now and then, misery is what I'll bring
You scream, I scheme as I take the law
Into my own hands and crush it while I break your jaw
You think I'm faking, all you really got to do is is try
To apprehend a guy, then you'll learn the reason why
Even if you tried, I cannot be caught alive
So what? I break the law
Before I go, I will die
So get your bounty hunters, I'm the one that's most elite
So what? I break the law
In this game, I play for keeps
Ichi, ni, san, shi, tell me when to go
Into a rage while I milk you like some cereal
Sometimes it's critical, at other moments, it is death
My only mission is to be the only person left
And my accomplishments is a result of your demise
You need an iron diet, here it's highly fortified
I'm into torture, I don't have an underhanded thought
What you see is what you get, now go and get your boss
You're about to take a loss, that is highly guaranteed
Somebody has to die, it's either you or me
And I refuse to lose and that's a fact
That's why I choose to bruise and counteract
Which way did he go is the question
I have the masses gasping and stressing
But I'm infected with thoughts of a mad man
So any strategy to capture me is a bad plan
I am what is known as a villain
So any opportunity to strike, I am killing
I'll chill when the hounds take a break, then
Even when the scent is forgotten, I will take them
On another round, it is found, I don't care
I am always down and I'm bound to be anywhere
So take a look over your shoulders, what do you see?
And stay away from the light, trust me
Do you want me to break your face?
Ha, ha!
You better get off my trail
Many tried, but all has failed!Ha Ha Ha... Guess who's back?
Some just chitter chat I ain't really into that
I just like to counteract
On the point of the attack
Check my resume it can happen any day
They're trying to wipe us out but then
Again I got something to say
Who's the enemy is it you or fens to be
The opposition of my position
Taken out relentlessly
They taking chemistry
Released in my vicinity
Mainframe to wipe out humankind
And all its history
Leave it up to me I'm not gonna let it be
I'mma load my arsenal
And take control by any means
Unfold my weaponry a vet
Will see it to the end
You think that I'm a pawn?
Well let the game begin
Okay in time my friend
You'll begin to see my wrath
Smile now but we'll see
Who has the last laugh
You're standing in my path
Well I'm about to smash
Don't worry, it's over in a flash
It doesn't make a difference
Who's gonna end up missing
Or beaten bad in a state of critical condition
Okay the competition is getting
On my nerves
If you can feel the heat
Then you're already burned
Into confetti turned
I'm trying to duck the germ
And if you're in my way, it's an unlucky turn
I'm not a flunkey learn a little data fool
I graduated honors, exterminator school
I'm into hurting dudes
What would you do if you were me
Well it don't really matter
Cause I'm just doing me
I must pursue the key
What's the answer to my quest?
It's either you or me
Now make a choice no regrets
I can't be tamed my friend
I'm a soldier to the death
Look around, it ain't too many left
Watch ya' step first move is a doozy
You thought you had a chance
You could've fooled me
What I need to do is go in a violent rage
Isn't that the code living in the final days?
I'm living in a cage
Look around it's full of crap
The people hanging on
Feasting on the scraps
What's the haps? It's a trap full of madness
Emotions out the window
Is a form of past tense
Ask this, do you wanna maintain
Or get deleted
For mistaking life for just a game?
Ha, Ha, Ha!
You thought it was a game?
Ha, ha
It can be over in a flash!D Dae hear the flame , D Dae with the gang

Nigga, kill off all beef
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I’m a Westside get brackin' in the back like what’s happnin'
That 40 Glock snap like Insta, ain't no need for a caption
I got put on by four niggas, wasn't need for no bandage
I did my stuff like a young nigga, that's how I'm s'posed to handle it
The homie threw a right, duck, hit him with the left, bop-bop!
Two to the chin, bop! One to the chest
One to the ribs, the haymaker didn't connect
Dropped him but didn't stomp him cause that's disrespect
That's how I got put on
Tree Top Bompton, yeah I got put on, nigga
It was hard in the hood
I was rappin', my homies sellin' hard in the hood
I know Game from cedar block, Dot from the West
That was my homie *static* that popped what's his name in his chest
Just got a call, the homies just got bust on
Niggas gotta go, we can't prolong
Hands up, hands up

Nigga, TTP

What? hol' up 400, Spruce Street
Nigga, kill off all beef
Turn up, turn up, turn up
I was in the county with lions, most of these rappers be lyin'
Cause when I seen 'em, they be quiet, the definition of silence
That's a principal of proof, the definition of logic
That this nigga is a bitch, every chance he get he's dodgin'
I brought back this West Coast shit
And this the mothafuckin' thanks I get?
All the licks I split, from the houses I hit
They brought him more cases in jail but a nigga ain't snitch
That's how it's s'posed to go down
Held it down, didn't nobody else go down
Give you a blind date, have my bitch pick you up
Then have one of my Top members stick you up
I know Nipsey from 6-0, C-Hood from 10-4
Tiny Bone from 40 Crip, that’s my kinfolk
My whole family tried to save me but it didn't work
Momma know I've been bangin' lately, niggaDaddy, the police just came and they're knocking on the door, looking for you, and they have a gun in my face, and I don't like that!And she thick, got a bad bitch, get her mouth to lube it

Take it off bitch bend over, let me see it
If you need a trill figure in your life, let me be it
I'm so focused on the come up
Hoe done feel like I just woke up
Smoking on that presidential, the oval office where I roll up
I ain't fucking with no lames, too many of them flip flop
Married to the game, you can call that love and hip hop
You can see it in my eyes I bet I want it
In front of closed doors fuck it we gon' break 'em open
The fuck you mean?
Trill, dreams 
I be like, I be like
Lord I pray to God my later days will be sunny
'Cause all I'm seeing is rain and bitches waiting for money
To follow one of these clouds, bitches is money hungry
But I just want some brain you ain't gotta tell me you love me
Baby you won't get attached to a nigga if I get lucky
It'll go from much as fucking her or just being like fuck me
Trust me I know, I'm such an ass I let my pants sag to let it show
Fuck your feelings and opinions now just leave me alone
I tell me momma "Don't you worry I'm gon' make it better"
I pray God shelter us through bad weather as I get my efforts
Her left leg and right leg I try to keep 'em seperate
I swear I had that pussy running like a fucking leopard
Shit I'm a German Shepard, and my bitch look kinda nice
Call me clean as fuck, and my earrings look like Sonic ice
Vagina be kinda tight, codeine free, some kind of Sprite
I'm good with god, we gon' get so high we just might fly tonight
Sometimes I get paid, sometimes I get dope
Sometimes I get laid, sometimes I get throwed
Sometimes I get blazed, sometimes I get low
They gon' know my name, no matter how it go
And I say, I say, money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser
I say money on the dresser, drive a compressor
Top notch hoes get the most not the lesser

Stay talking that bullshit and I  that tool shit
And I'm 'bout it ain't know raw shit I said it bitch

It's the mind of a nigga on the edge of the bed
With a tool of the side and a head full of liq'
Come pray with a nigga, stay with a nigga

Might spend dollar sign with my bitch
Sometimes niggas start to get lonely, sometimes niggas start to get rich

Sexual feeling, sex and joke, let's get more powder and sniff it

So she gotta go extra' hard, extra' hard
She got 7 niggas's numbers
When she got home she text them all
She like what bitch, get hit nigga get the fuck back

She lives in the ghetto, she always wearin' stilettos
She try to live by the bible but she get chased by the devil
She fuck a nigga, suck a nigga for no less than 3 hunnids
Thinking 'bout her daughter, prolly got her sick to her stomach
And that's when she fuck it, her mind she finna lose it

She out here sellin' sex, trynna pay the rent...You got to love your enemies and pray for them to despitefully use you. And some of us can't make up our mind, one minute you're in the world but the next minute you're in the kingdom. You wanna shout on Sunday but act worldly on Monday, let me preach
Touch your neighbor and ask them, which one are you in? Ask them, you in the world or you in the kingdom?.  Tell 'em we gon' find out when somebody does something to you. See, when you live in torment you got ulcers and you got sleepless nights, see you got all of this stuff and your hair's falling out cause you're worrying about folk and you're trying to get folk back. Can I preach and tell you you don't have to get nobody back cause God said "Vengeance is mine", saidth of the Lord. And how many of you know that God will take care of your enemies? As a matter of fact, God will make your enemies your footstool. Can I preach to somebody?
But do you not know that when you hold bitterness in your heart, it blocks your blessing? Put James 2 and 13 up. And I'm getting ready to close...Big bank, call me Big Poppa
Big daddy to the Lil' Momma's

I'm posted posted with the big ballers
Big rims with the big bodies

But nigga, you a flip flopper
We run it like an offense, and uh..
And we gon' run it til' we out of town
Thanking the Lord for givin' me grace, I caught the  case
Was facing a lot of time, now we tryin' to keep it straight
Scrapin' the chains, count it, we just tryin' to make it shake
I got the Jordan's yellin', now a couple bills late
So much on my mind, so much shit up on my plate
This is precious time, can't afford to make mistakes
They just hit my brodie's crib, just the other day
He just had a daughter, please don't let em take my bro away
That's a lot of time, enough to make you feel afraid
Tryin' to talk to God, but just can't find no words to say
Couple trucks to move the money to another place
Paranoid, so now you sleepin' with a baby k
On the other side, trying to stay up out the way
Workin' on the music, bout to drop another tape
Droppin' records, they like 'Tut, you been MIA'
But how the fuck have I been MIA when that ain't where I stay?
Big bank, call me Big Poppa

Sneakin' bitches on niggas who tried to go against us
Used to try to short us, now they want a picture with us
Bitches curve, done made a U-turn to come and get it
Ain't been the same since 20-17 December
Lookin' around, a lot of people they no longer with us...

Niggas be hating and faking like Ray Bands these fuck niggas see through

My weed stank like the shit got Halitosis
Here's a toast for the plans that we put in motion
Chevy tip-toeing down the street
Like it's RiFF rocking Air Jordans
Damn, I'm at brunch ordering mimosas
About to go and make a play on Amnicola
About to go and school these busters like McCallie
You niggas stupid, y'all done took too many mollys
Too many many books, I done gained too much knowledge
I ain't a prophet bitch I'm all about a profit
Nigga, you a buster, and a buster told the cops where the stash was soon as they pulled you over nigga
I'ma keep a toaster in the holster in case they think a nigga sleepin', please believe I got the Folgers nigga
Wake a nigga up just like J. Cola nigga
Lowkey, I think my aunt still whipping yola, nigga
You ain't seen this, nigga
You ain't seen shit, you a motherfuckin' liar
You ain't see a nigga do it like this
Since Cash Money Big Timers on them Yokohama tires
Put the money in my hand, I make a fist
Rollin' around in the wealth with the tint
A lot of stalling  got a Rollie on a wrist
Ya boy hot, boy I got the city on fire
Got the bitches rubbing on my chest without the Vicks
Nigga it's The House and I'm sitting on the couch
Rolling out the house
A nigga from the South and I came with the bounce
Bica-bica-bounce bitch
Came back like fucking tax refund
Rest in peace Pimp C and Big Pun
Sway, you couldn't give a nigga a song with the big guns
Spottie's back in town, we in the stu smoking big blunts
Shit!
Fuck man, I just burned my finger
Get this shit bruh, it's a roach

Them kids, they ain't working
That weed, they serving
Your seed, they twerking
I been, on them corners
I drink, I'm swerving
They think, they balling
They broke, from splurging
I sit in this room as the aroma of marijuana
Fills the air for hours and niggas is on the same shit
Even fucking on the same bitch
Might need to get up off yo ass nigga
Or either lay up off the grass nigga
Y'all ain't gonna get no bread nigga stop it
Turn all your profit to ashes
Feeling like Cassius Clay, I'm the world's greatest
Let's get R. Kelly on the tape
Young Lando on the celly witcha' main
'Bout to take your girlfriend to a telly for a date
Especially fish, with your bitch, give her plenty of the taste
Strapped with the cup got the Henny on my waist
New Jack City giving everyone the bass
Everybody bow your heads cause we gotta say a grace
Outside, them churches
Them kids, they ain't working
That weed, they serving
Your seed, they twerking
I been, on them corners
I drink, I'm swerving
They think, they balling
They broke, from splurging
One time for the hoochies with the Louis bags
Gone buss' it open for a real nigga
I see you little niggas with ya' Tommy Hilfiger
'Bout to switch your last dub just to get ahead nigga okay
I'm smoking, them cops patrolling
Your shooters is bogus
They fake I know it
And I hope the gun jam too
On this new wave no wave cap too
Shout my nigga Wave son he stay strapped too
Cause a nigga tired of running we done paid them dues
I don't get a nigga who got so many ambitions
And don't go and try and get it dog you ain't go-getter
You bet not owe us paper we gone have to go and get him
We gone have to go beat him till it stomp and make a rhythm
Damn, just like a doctor I deliver
I'm where you wanna be I ain't gotta hide
Niggas on the block still set tripping
One said he want his ones the other one said "I ain't scared you can meet me outside"
Outside, them churches
Them kids, they ain't working
That weed, they serving
Your seed, they twerking
I been, on them corners
I drink, I'm swerving
They think, they balling
They broke, from splurgingThe club is goin' up
Everybody in the party drunk

Cause girl you bad as fuck

I bet that I can have you sprung
With some chicks with my tongue
Make you come up out your pumps

Told her baby loosen up
Take a sip and now we drunk
This my song, DJ turn it up
Treat you like arts and crafts, I'm tryna cut
Baby got back, dunk in her trunk
Baby with a blunt, cause we can light it up
Turnt up in the party, kush and Picardi
Need a girl like Nicki be my size barbie
Order drinks 'til you can't walk no more
And you ain't smoking if you ain't drop on the dro
We can ball and take shots all night 'til I'm broke
Lil' mama hotter than a pot on the stove
This ice on my neck leave all these hoes ...
I'm turnt up, I'm super turnt up
We need drink, mo' weed, and mo' blunts

Hop on the chick, get my dance on
Lap dance feeling like we ain't got no pants on
I turn 20 March 9, I'm damn near grown
So you know I'm in the club, get my grown man on
Girl you bad as fuck, with or without the pumps
I told her back it up and ride it like a passenger
I be in the club swagging girls, I grocery bag
I make it rain baby, this ain't a game baby
Pop them bottles of Patron and champagne baby
Like the sunrise, my chain is like the sunshine
Baby, I'm insane she knows it's Pushaz to the brain baby
Haha, I say let's kick it on the low
She said fa'sho, I called the bro, he brought the drink, I brought the dro
Choking when I hit the purp so you know that I am turnt
And the club is going up like the motherfucking ...
The club is goin' up
Everybody in the party drunk

With some chicks with my tongue
Make you come up out your pumps

Aye
Yeah
Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn
Ik sip codeine, dat is medicijn
Baby kom hier en blaas me net een fluit
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin
Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn
Ik sip codeine, dat is medicijn
Baby kom hier en blaas me net een fluit
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin
Ik zet die Pet scheef
Ze wilt mee naar de backstage
Ik verberg die pijn steeds
En ze praat maar ik ben high
Als ze lacht, ja, ik lach mee
Als ze huilt, ja, ik huil mee
Is ze gebroken, dan maak ik
Wilt ze gaan tikken, dan vraag ik
Ben je wel goed bij je hoofd of
Verberg je die pijn, net een noodstop?
Ik ben een robot
Je loert op O's nog
Je lijkt op een doofpot
Ik heb die saus, toch?
Niggers die weten
Swag is bezeten
Je bent verleden
Ik ben de toekomst, je weet het
Ze zakt met d'r ass naar beneden
Verberg die pijn, net een meester
Me wiet die is te overdreven 
Te overdreven 
Te overdreven 
Te overdreven
Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn

Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin
Ik zet me petje richting het westen
Ik ben een teacher, dus kom me niet testen
Al die drip verzacht die pijn, maar kan het niet helen
Al die bitches die willen me pijpen, maar 't kan me niet schelen
Ik wil een badbitch om de pijn mee te delen
Geen dokter die kan me genezen
Toren van Pisa, m'n pet die is schever
Ik heb een psycho bitch
Maar zij doet verlegen
Of ze speelt het
D'r gevoelige snaren ik speel het
Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn
Ik sip codeine, dat is medicijn
Baby kom hier en blaas me net een fluit
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin

Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin
Ik zet m'n pet schuin dat is voor pijn
Drink medicijn
Strak net een lijn
Pak procenten, net als je wijn
Chickie is schoon, dat komt door azijn
Net als Iglo ik ben de kapitein
Stap in die trein voordat ik verdwijn
Ze kent me achternaam geen Boudewijn
Ben met Phillip, we staan op de plein
Protect je neck net als Wu-Tang
Ik ben Loopey, noem me geen Shabba ranks
Garri op de beat, je weet dat ik ren
Krijg ik me check wordt er gespend
Je roley genakt, je bent geen president
Me assie heeft poten het is zo potent
Ik geef je die champagne het is een geschenk
Je staat op de gang en denkt aan je gang
Ren voor die blocken, net als een damhert
Net als tennis, je krijgt een backhand
Bandana om m'n hoofd, lijk op red man
Ze is een candy dus noem de Redband
Zij houdt van vechten net als Def Jam
Pop in die pussy never dat ik jam
Pop in die pussy never dat ik jam
Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn
Ik sip codeine, dat is medicijn
Baby kom hier en blaas me net een fluit
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin

Ik heb m'n pet schuin, dat is voor pijn
Ik sip codeine, dat is medicijn
Baby kom hier en blaas me net een fluit
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuin 
Voel je die pijn? Zet die pet schuinStrong enough to make it through the terror
You done made me bigger, made me better
I ain't worried 'bout the next nigga climbing up the ladder
Big shot what you looking at, you don't even matter
Can't be playing with these niggas, I know shit is real
So what I drive? It ain't no car, it's an automobile
I know niggas well in the dealing from powder to pills
Went dancing with the devil, why did I make him a deal?
Lil' nephew back up on that sizzurp, he popping the seal
I tell him "Stay up out these streets or be packing a steel"
Them niggas might act like they your homies, they actors for real
Might catch you napping, out here lacking, and run in your shit
I guess a nigga made his bed now it's time to lay in it
Crib big, looking like a maid came with it
Bitches spend the night wishing they could stay in it
I told you you could never make a self-made nigga
Just like you could never break a big bank nigga
Big business like a big timer, win six figures
Big crib, same  up in the fish tank nigga
Stayed the same, always knew it would be this way nigga
I remain, on my mission to keep my head on a swivel
'Cause niggas would spray that lead to see me dead on a pistol
That's why we 'bout it, check that deposit direct
So if you labels wanna talk some numbers, better come correct
You looking at that nigga in the flesh, I'm coming home
 of a I don't need a rapper, on my soul
Nigga having money, conversations on the phone
Money looking right like I can't do no wrong
Built like a big tank, I be solid to the bone
Made it out of situations where you probably would've folded
Momma didn't raise a pussy nigga, I'm the oldest
Fully loaded clip, I'm 'bout to take this shit over
I guess a nigga made his bed now it's time to lay in it
Crib big, looking like a maid came with it
Bitches spend the night wishing they could stay in it
I told you you could never make a self-made nigga
Strong enough to make it through the terror
You done made me bigger, made me better
I ain't worried 'bout the next nigga climbing up the ladder
Big shot what you looking at, you don't even matter
Strong enough to make it through the terror
You done made me bigger, made me better
I ain't worried 'bout the next nigga climbing up the ladder
Big shot what you looking at, you don't even matterYou have one new voice message-
Daddy, when are you coming home? I miss you! And can you hurry up, 'cause the pigs kill people and I'm scared!Het is een vibe
Ik wil d'r niet als m'n meid
Drip, oceaan op m'n lijf
'k Hoef niet te lopen, ben fly
We laten je achter, je bent niet als wij
We kicken je Bruce, Lee of Mike
23jordan clip net als Spizike
Net als een slang, ja, ik bijt
Ik sta niet meer in de rij
Bitches die zijn op me huid
Schatje, is je mama thuis?
Ik fuck die bitch in de tuin
Ze belt, maar ik hoor veel geruis
Je vriendje, hij rookt veel gruis
Beter drip jij nog maar harder, my nigga, want jij ziet, ik ben niet echt blij
Beter ben jij niet met mij
Ik sta niet meer in je krijt
Ben in de stad en ze kijkt
En zij gooit d'r nummer gelijk
Speel met d'r ass, ja, ik wrijf
Ik woon niet in een paleis
Ik woon niet in een paleis, nee
Ik woon niet in een paleis
Het is een vibe
Ik wil d'r niet als m'n meid
Drip, oceaan op m'n lijf
'k Hoef niet te lopen, ben fly
We laten je achter, je bent niet als wij
We kicken je Bruce, Lee of Mike
23jordan clip net als Spizike
Ik zet codeine in m'n Sprite
Die jongens zijn niet net als mij
Ik drip, ik ben net fontein
Ik heb alleen eurotekens in m'n mind
Vandaar dat ik schaats net als die Sven
Ik sla 't, bootycall zonder die string
Geen Mike Tyson, ik ben op die ring
Geen anaconda want ik ben met me slim
Oh nee, bedoel me slime
Me partner in crime
Geen reuzenrad of molen, ik draai
Je zegt je seert maar dat is een lie
Ze was eerst bij jou, maar nu is ze met mij
Ik ben the shit, net als Cry
Me drip is blanco, net als een lijn
Ik pak die kippen, al dress ik in Nike
Zij tikt een Tesla en is in d'r vibe
Het is een vibe
Ik wil d'r niet als m'n meid
Drip, oceaan op m'n lijf
'k Hoef niet te lopen, ben fly
We laten je achter, je bent niet als wij
We kicken je Bruce, Lee of Mike
23jordan clip net als Spizike
Ik wil d'r niet als m'n meid
Maar ik zet m'n dick in je meid
Boxer designer, het is Calvin Klein
Net als een skate,r ik ben op m'n grind
Zij is een spion, geen Totally Spies
Ze zit aan m'n dick, net een schakel, ze drivet
Zonder gebit, m'n saus wordt gebijt
Jij bent een hype, Balmain brakka zit tight
Wil twee wijven, want ik ben super fly
Net als Thugger, ben een thief in the night
Jij wordt uitgespuugd, ik ben met me slimes
Ben met m'n shanker, geen Kimbo Slice
Jij doet het voor effe, wij doen het voor life
Ze suckt aan m'n dick, ik pop net een pijp
Ik heb die echte shit, geen Cola Light
Me nigga's die shinen, we hoeven geen light
Jij wordt geschaafd, want ik heb m'n ice
Jij bent niet slim, volg mij onderwijs
Kan wachten want die tijd heeft een prijs
Ik smoke die gass, wordt stinkend rijk
Je chickie is een cheater, ze is met mij
Ik toon geen liefde, je ziet dat ik shine
Me shooter die komt met die mac geen drive
Me shooter die komt met die mac geen drive
Het is een vibe
Ik wil d'r niet als m'n meid
Drip, oceaan op m'n lijf
'k Hoef niet te lopen, ben fly
We laten je achter, je bent niet als wij
We kicken je Bruce, Lee of Mike
23jordan clip net als SpizikeWhen I step up in the spot I'm making everything stop
We just came in for the knots, don't get knotted up
Too clean, I'm a fool with the juice
Never lose, you done did a whole lot, but just not enough
Ooowee, when I cop my CD, gotta hit the A/C
'Cause you know it's gon' be hot as fuck
But I'm about to make it hot 
Hotter than a motherfucker
When I step up in the spot I'm making everything stop
We just came in for the knots, don't get knotted up
Too clean, I'm a fool with the juice
Never lose, you done did a whole lot, but just not enough
Ooowee, when I cop my CD, gotta hit the A/C
'Cause you know it's gon' be hot as fuck
But I'm about to make it hot 
Hotter than a motherfucker
Still hungry as the day I came in it, looking like I ain't missed a meal
I'm as chill as the windows in December when we ain't have no heat
It was colder in the house than it was in the street
We was scrapping just to pay the rent
Trapping just to make a living, nigga we ain't have no job
But the Lord'll still do it, won't he? I said won't the Lord do it?
Yeah, new shoes, new clothes, new watch
Rolling with the same team that I had from the get-go
Flip flows like home renovators, the city anticipation
They like "When you gonna drop though?"
I always knew I was a leader, even made you a believer
Kept it solid as a rock though
Now I'm the nigga in the front like Rosa Parks on the bus
We about to make it jump
When I step up in the spot I'm making everything stop

Now I got money chilling in my house nigga
Bitches love me they respect my grind
My other bitch tripping though, she ain't worth my time
If you were real bitch you would respect me too
They rather act like a ho and coppa attitude
My kush is kill bill, my swag is so smooth
The paper stack high I can't see the little dudes
And I be on some pimping I put 'em on fig
I bellin' to the set like who got a big
I'm eating her pussy I think I need a bib
Six flat screens all flew out my crib
See shawty be rocking them things that are lame
And I swear, I swear
If you was my bitch I'd have you sittin' chillin' right here
Cause yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this
Yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this x3
It's YG the lady's man and a Mercedes Benz
Kicks fresh, whip sitting on the latest rims
If you was my bitch I'd have you saying, I'm dating him
Put him on date mood and make you start playing him
I be on some fly shit like all the time, shit
And you would too if you was my bitch
Drop the top of the whip and tell you hop in
Push a button watch it take off like a rocket
He a stopsign-type nigga, so stop it
And be my baby in the cradle and the one I rock with
Like the tag on the Gucci bag get it pop it
Like fuck with me, I give you a profit
How you choose you love like you had other options
Like why you lying to this girl nigga stop frontin'
They talk about they balling that's just gossip
No disease, but fuck with me like I got some
See shawty be rocking them things that are lame
And I swear, I swear
If you was my bitch I'd have you sittin' chillin' right here
Cause yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this
Yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this x3
Yo' nigga ain't me he couldn't be me if I taught him
Hold them Gucci bags all them chinchillas I bought them
Splurging in the mall dropping stacks like I have an orange carrot to my chain, attract the bitches like they rabbits
Swag on automatic my whole clique tatter
Walk in chick magnet, the bad bitch bandit
You got the bitch branded, it's all in the game
But I play it like mad, rich like 
To the bank laughing, me and YG and my young nigga Charley H. double-O D
Looking for a barbie, pink car in the garage
Her name Nicki so I just wanna Minaj
Dick sucking her profession she do one hell of a job
Hop on me like a boss see who come and take a ride
Aye, baby how you gon' survive after I eat that pussy I'mma eat yo' ass alive
See shawty be rocking them things that are lame
And I swear, I swear
If you was my bitch I'd have you sittin' chillin' right here
Cause yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this
Yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this x3Y'all know who I am, right?
I go by the name of DJ Mustard AKA 'These Niggas Ain't Got No Money'

I be talking to Jesus telling The Lord to have mercy for ya
Yup, middle finger to the judge
First day out, we in the beamer headed to the club
It's Pushaz Ink baby!Yeah 
Oh 
Yeah, super, incroyable 
Bébé, c'est toi qu'je veux, à mes côtés quand j'me réveille
T'as mis une belle robe ce soir, j'suis fou de toi, mes sens sont en éveil
J'voudrais te voir d'un peu plus près, te sentir mieux, je vois tes yeux
T'as envie d'plus, j'me retourne vers toi comme un crush dans l'fond du bus
Bébé, si t'as mal, met le, rentre pas dans le mauvais, juste pour le karma
Évitons les faciales, primons le sexe et ton plaisir anal
Oh, ta fierté, tu l'avales, l'amour est beau, l'amour est vrai
Complicité dès le réveil, c'est carré mais pour ce privilège, je pourrais caner
Tu peux m'dire tes secrets, j's'rai ta boîte de Pandore
J't'ai d'jà dit : tu me plais, j'vais refermer tes plaies
Des bisous sur ton corps, quand y'a plus, y'a encore
Dis-moi c'que tu veux, dis-moi où t'as mal
J'ferai de mon mieux, j'sais qu'c'est pas génial
Pour toi, j'f'rais du pénal car ton charisme me régale
Y en a pas d'autres, c'est mort, y en a pas d'autres, c'est mort
Fais-moi confiance, je dis dans mon cœur ce que je ressens, c'est fort
Je dis pas ça car j'suis tisé, j'dis la vérité dans l'ivresse
Laissons-les penser ce qu'ils veulent, on est tout seuls et c'est bien mieux
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Ouais, donne-moi tout ce soir 
Laissons faire la vibe ce soir 
Entre nous, ce soir 
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Ouais, donne-moi tout ce soir 
Laissons faire la vibe ce soir 
Juste entre nous, ce soir 
J'ai un peu trop longtemps vu ma vie se taire, voulu changer de fusil d'épaule
Y a quelques proches qui m'ont vu me perdre, derrière mon masque, beaucoup d'alcool
Mais parle pas de c'que tu n'sais pas, tu m'connais pas quand j'suis seul le soir
J'ai développé que des idées noires, j'ai récolté que du vide et toi ?
J'te ramène à la maison, j'suis fier de moi, j'suis fier de toi aussi
T'as peur et t'as raison, et si t'as froid, j'te couvre, y a pas d'souci
Toi et moi, c'est All Stars Team, t'sais qu'on s'en fout des autres
J'ai b'soin que tu sois tranquille, besoin que tu portes mon mot
Y en a pas d'autres, c'est mort, y en a pas d'autres, c'est mort
Fais-moi confiance, je dis dans mon cœur ce que je ressens, c'est fort
Je dis pas ça car j'suis tisé, j'dis la vérité dans l'ivresse
Laissons-les penser ce qu'ils veulent, on est tout seuls et c'est bien mieux
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Ouais, donne-moi tout ce soir 
Laissons faire la vibe ce soir 
Entre nous, ce soir 
Et là, faut qu'tu donnes tout ce soir 
Ouais, donne-moi tout ce soir 
Laissons faire la vibe ce soir

When I get busy with the blade, I'm dangerous
Stick that into your neck, I'm ruthless
Burgle the flat, say hi to your neighbours
Up the back fence all quick 'fore the Tridents

Mum would kill me, not no pagans
I don't wanna do no time for a wasteman
I don't wanna do no time for a punk
Olé, olé
Man are gonna make man jump with the blade
Tings ain't gonna be okay

Fuck the police!
You preach positivity, yet, you live in a way that will only end in misery
What do you truly desire?
My intentions are good!
What do you desire?
I want to save the youth
Incorrect, I will ask you once more
What do you desire?
Death
As you wish
Destined with Lucifer
The sensation was out of this world
I was on Jupiter
Temporary innocent as a pearl
Until you threw it up
Got me reminiscing to when I was a child
With no sins committed
Nigga's selling they fucking souls
To get a fucking pendant
I'm talented
I’m versatile
I get it independent
All my success, I funded
They goin sleep
They watching me from the front row seat
And they won't sleep until they see me on the news deceased
Ten shots to the head
It only took one shot
He was already dead
Hate will flow deep through yo body
And make you black out
Lash out!
Choppa knock you out yo pants
Have you laying on the fucking ground
With yo ass out
They think I'm happy
They just see the black and white
1-0-1 Dalmatians
I'm my own worst enemy
Look in the mirror and break it
Thinking about so far back in life
When I ain't wanna take it
Pay attention
Nothing you see is real
We in the MatrixFeeling like a Chatt Town who done made it out the bottom
Counting sleazy money, residue on every dollar
Yeah yeah, nigga, nigga
Bag it, double wrap it, and Tupperware it
Got a plug in FedEx, we can next day air it
Taking penitentiary-chances, we living careless
Uh oh, where I'm from niggas getting violent
Round up East Lake, projects is do or dire
Niggas masked up just like Michael Myers
Riding through the streets all night like an Uber driver
Make 'em pull up on right beside you
Catch your ass slipping out here on a bad day
Roll the window down, dumping like that shit trash day
Pull off outta blunt, he pull off in the ash tray
Today just might be your last day
I done dodged a few bullets and a few cases
Cops searched my house but they ain't find the pounds in the suitcases
After that I had to make a few changes
Had a couples bizzles hidden in a few places
Couple traffic stops turned into car chases
We was living like a bunch of little Scarfaces
All my niggas hungry, they just want a sack now
My nigga turned his momma crib into a crack house
Counting up the cash, I'm 'bout to re-up with the pack now
 back at it once again with the sack now, nigga
Feeling like a Chatt Town who done made it out the bottom
Counting sleazy money, residue on every dollar
(Wake up in the morning, we just getting to this guala
Rolling through the city, selling weed out up the Impala)
Feeling like a Chatt Town who done made it out the bottom
Counting sleazy money, residue on every dollar

Heard these niggas tryna jugg and finesse me
Heard these niggas tryna jugg and finesse me
Heard these niggas tryna jugg and finesse me
The fresh meat, the freshmen, the best one, come test him 
Give a fuck what gang you rep
If it ain't YG then we can't connect
Niggas think I'm with they shit like they get respect
But then I stop, reflect, on how she gave me neck
It's yo bitch I'm talkin bout, yeah I'm still on that
You already knew the trouble yet you brought her back
Thinkin I'm gon' stop but then the spot got popped
So I just drop that thot to get the whip unlocked
I ain't even get to bust but shit it's cops at the shmop
They yelling "cops at the shmop", nigga it's cops at the shmop
I ain't want no trouble Ima wait in the lot
I see some hoes that need some saving I'm like "shit why not"
They was stumbling in them heels, tryna get to the whip
I said "lil bitch don't you come over if you is not suckin' dick"
Turns out lil bitch wasn't tryna suck the dick
Seen a cop came in the door so then a nigga had to dip
Heard them same hoes yelling "wait I'll put it in my lips!"
But ya too late bitch because ya boy too quick!
Oh shit look to the right one of these girls snuck in
Said that she the real hoe out of all her friends
So then I clap clap clap from the back like that
Fore she leave gotta check all on my cash like that
Make sure she ain't finesse me but the figures all match
So I let the bitch go, headed back to the pad, got damn!
Then I seen YG, yeah I seen YG
Man I thought it was a shmop cause they hid that shit a lot
But at the end of the plot man it's still YG
It's still YG, yeah it's still YG
Bet you thought it was a shmop cause I hid that shit a lot
But at the end of the plot man it's still YG
Let me tell you what I mean
Bass still mean, bells still rattle and the drums so clean
Thought I switched it up, but my cup still lean
And I only fuck with vegas so my blunts still green
Plus I spit like a black dude
Ooh but even better than that cause I'm a natural, Spit pterodactyl
See me in the streets they like "nigga where the mask go?"
Let me answer honestly but really shouldn't ask tho
XanMan out right now and he took the lasso
So he prolly snaggin', hoes bein' a asshole
Keep that thot dizzy for bein' a rascal
And that ass was British and it wasn't a coincidence
He like to keep it tied together when he really into it
Bars are 360, they cover all angles
So when I say I got em man he really got mangled, wrangled
Nigga talkin' like it take two to tango
But I pull up with four, snatch them chains off like he Django
Bars represent how hard that it get just to not go a fuckin' retard in this bitch
Oh I apologize, was that the end of the skit?
Well I'm still throwin' Sailor out the back of the ship
I'm ashin' the spliff, forreal
I got Franki ass tied in the motherfuckin back of the whip and a L to relax for the tripBaby why'd you leave me alone
I thought we was in love until you let me go
Put me on the boat and sent me to the coast
I missed them nights when I used to pipe, yeah, these strokes
And I even used to fucking ball like a freethrow
Every friday our bedroom was like a freak show
Thought I was your nigga for life, your hero
 That's the worst that she spoke
But that's fucked up, the homies told me don't trip
But I'm not gon trip when I lost my bitch
Feeling like R. Kelly, I wish I wish
And no I ain't gon cry but I miss my bitch
I miss my baby girl but I don't know her anymore
You gon do me like this, I guess this a cold world
This a dog eat dog world and the dogs chase the cats
Fuck thought this shit coming back, no
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me, you did it so easy
I tried to tell my mama, but my mama didn't believe me
This shit is off the heezy, a nigga misses breezy
I missed the freaky things she used to do just to please me
Piddy Pablo, I had her frequently
She up and on faster than a GT
Just wish I could make things rewind
Cause I'd rewind when she left me like the spring time
I be fine, everybody knows that's a lie
Rockabye baby, rockabye baby
I think I need to go to rehab, I'm going crazy
I did everything you wanted me to when you played me
And you know what's some fucked up shit
I ain't even with another chick, damn
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3
Baby why you do me wrong
Since the day you left, I can't rest
I been at the house by myself depressed
Riding around the streets by myself
Tryna find somebody cause I really need help
So baby come back, baby come back, baby come back, baby come back
Tell me what's the issue, girl I really miss you
I just wanna, I just wanna, I just wanna kiss you
Baby why you leave me
Baby why you leave me alone
Baby why we don't talk no more
I used to be your neezy
Yo' nigga fa'sho
I used to be but I'm not no more
Baby why you do me wrong
Baby why you leave me x3

Them niggas hate really wanna be me

If my ex-bitch ain't dead she ain't cheat on me
So if a nigga ever said fuck my bitch

Rest in piece to X, X, X
I know just how it feel to go damn hell
He dissin through a Text, Text, Text

Hang op, hang opI'm from Westside Balifornia
My nigga suin'
Paparazzi pull them Canons on ya
It be like fo' five in the mornin'
Yo' bitch gettin' fucked and shit getttin' stolen
We wear Chuck tees and Cortez
Wear designers just to flaunt them
We really don't care
And everybody know somebody with that 
Cali niggas be OT
Why you think we go there?
Everybody got they hustle
Everybody got they uncle
Who got straps and got they back
When homies don't come through
Press the plug taxin', you like Uncle Sam
And ya other plug got a deal but he just got jammed
I told my pops the streets turned me to a man
He told me stay out the streets
The streets where I got my bands
Damn, and on my street I'm the man
Another victim of the culture, damn, damn, damn
Guns spits they M's cause they ain't how it go
Half go to taxes, and expenses ain't low
And after I pay expenses I gotta pay permission
But you don't wanna learn the bin'ess
Cause you don't ever listen
So, you gotta learn the hard way
Don't question my loyalty
You know it, I'll go hard for you all day
Like what, who trippin'? get the biscuit, line it up
Tell 'em we can squabble in a hallway
Nigga fuck this message
He ain't my credit, can't give you my debit
That's why you hate me, huh
You counting pockets and you think I'm flickin', huh
You think If you need me I'mma shake you, huh
Have you ever thought about how much I've been taken from
Like I need this to do that and it never happens nuh
You start speakin' that language and they don't feel niggas
That's they reason to say I ain't a real nigga
I'm gone 
 
I need money and berettas 
I’m, knocking on deaths door
Shotty fully load, ask him can I go?
Tell me that he busy so just go home
That’s the second time the meeting postponed
Like what are you on bro, think you in control?
Ima let him know
I might let it bust if I don’t meet the ghosts
And on my last nerves Ima do the most, yeah
I need money and berettas
Yellow diamonds on a Gucci sweater
One night with Karrueche then do me better
Said she was in love?
Thought she knew me better
Bitch I was geekin you tweakin
Plus parties next door this was just for the weekend
Don’t pop out that razor I know what you thinking
But I ain’t gon stop you, just not in my presence
I’d do the same but for different reasons
Cause I’m insane it’s too many demons
Make time fly, couldn’t catch the seasons
Can’t help the feeling like it’s jeepers creepers peepin waitin on me
Maybe it’s the smoke in my lungs
Maybe it’s the lean in my cup
Maybe it’s the mix in my system
I feel like I’m finna erupt
Get to the cut then she feeling me up
Asked me if I’m okay, bitch just back up
Know you really just a actor
So sit the fuck down and don’t act up
While I figure out this passage
Necronomicon kind of practice
But please don’t touch me
Please don’t touch me
Please don’t touch me, ugh
Rip off yo feet and then I feed it to my fucking wolves
Please don’t touch me
Please don’t touch me
Please don’t touch me, ugh
Rip off yo feet just like its mortal kombat rules
What is the problem?
X bout to solve it, get the revolver
Head out to deaths house
Nigga first let me try to call him
Fuck nigga better answer
Must’ve turned him to a dancer
Nothing kills me give me cancer please!
You got me here I’m on my hands and knees
Pause on that I mean it tragically
Don’t make me have to do this magically
Copping rituals I’m stacking sheets
I’ll meet the devil automatically or radically
Like a thrasher tee
Need the power of a pentagram
If you won’t give a hand well then I’m throwing them
Ain’t had to be this way fam
But I’m kicking down doors that’s no hands
Revolver to spam, six shots from the Xans
Six plots in my head and six competent fans
Talkin' nigga do the hammer dance
None of you niggas ain’t had a chance

I need money and berettas:
YG, like I’m tired of this shit. You think you on now because you poppin', but I was with you before all this money shit, like I need my money. I need my hair done, I need my rent paid, I need all that, like you don’t show me no love. You fuckin' with these raggedy ass bitches, I just don’t get it. Like, so you on now?

Can't go back, you can't press B
How much do you wanna bet me?
You'll get left ten feet under
SP or PS
I don't really tolerate BS
And I can't burn man but the gas can, that's CS
Now you can't see S
If you wanna VS, P
Then you can get touched like a GameBoy DS, I
Ain't got a BM

Je wil niet dat die bitch van me uitkleed
Want je weet na mij word ze thot

Geen nakkoe, ben gevecht met mijn vuist
Met de auto of een vracht door je ruit

Kill a bitch and eat her forreal, I'm Nosferatu
Infrared embedded in my head so imma spot you
Got YG snipers lined up and they all ready to pop you
Then stop and pop a opp too
Snag a dab of that pot goo
Cough it off, recollect my thoughts
Ready for round two but
Woke from my dream Freddy I gotta get bustin
Promise I'll be back in a flash like Grant Gustin
Clothes worn and torn after the storm I just dust em
Look for all my gunmen, nigga it's time to function
"But Xans we just partied like, 6 straight days, in 6 states with 6 inch blades"
Well work has just begun then
Devils never take a break
But you could take the cake and eat it right there by the lake
Take them words straight from the mouth of the snake
And my voice is kinda hoarse so don't make that mistake
Maybe I'm shady but I could get you some ladies
They all be rich and thick like that significant gravy
Dick em down, take they shit
And then dip by the day G
Could make the dough all by myself, I'm really just lazy
If anyone got beef to spit my nigga just save it
Ain't no good to fight ya master boy you stuck on this slave ship
Or really a slave Yacht? I'll tell you my Gangs hot
But they'll explain themselves
These niggas sicker than brain clots
I get up off the pavement
Wavy Hooligan tuning in
Savage Mode: activated
Killed Freddy and Jason, new dilemma you'll be facing
Breaking News: bitches get abused for they nudes?
Nah this ain't a drill, might need some pain pills
Cream, I'm tryna get them dolla dolla bills
Sniffing chlorophyll until I'm feeling woozy
Hangin' with a bunch of groupies watching home movies in a warm jacuzzi
On a spree, bars hot, 3rd degree, ouch!
And nigga fuck yo motherfuckin couch
Lowkey like a no caller ID, you cannot find me
I'm hiding overseas with YG
Got damn, record it for the gram
Got ya bitch giving top in a local traffic jam
Robbing Dan for some Vans, slicing off his hands
Pack and then its off to sell em to his fucking fans
Steal a couple bands from the bank, smellin like dank
It's YG nigga...
What the fuck you think?
Ain't no team better ranked, you niggas bout to sink
Survivors of the yacht nigga come and take your shot
We can't be stopped, swear we got this shit on lock
But over the horizon, lied the new evil
The darkness that hides in the light
The true adversary of the Yacht Gang
He was the one of milk
Slick talking, quick walking
Big shit dropping
Can't forget the day I seen them on that damn corner
If that man on ya, you gon' be a damn goner
Hold up let me tell you what they call em

It's Milk Manson, Milk Manson
Milk Manson, Milk Manson
Nigga diamond dancing in them streets
Cause he be prancing on that beat
So if you catch him what you see, it's Milk Manson
Diamonds and they gold
Diamonds bright as snow
He lurkin on the low
It's what I knowWhat's going on here then, lads?
Why we standing on the corner?

But I would never let these jakes catch me
Cause I move like a fox in the night, I creep
When I see police, I'm off on my feet
They wanna Google man and try to search me
And lock man up like a can of baked beans
'Cause a pagan IB snitched on me
Can't trust anyone these days on the streets
Dem man there will snitch for the Ps
And next ting you know, you'll be in the bully van
And the crown court, but I'm not guilty
So fuck the jury, I just wanna be free
I just wanna make Ps with all my Gs
So when I'm on the road, I know that I'm dece

Even though I'm still an IC3 in the eyes of police
I could be as polite as a neek
Still treat me like I'm hiding a nine milli piece
It's getting doubly peak for a man like me
To survive on these streets of rage and race
But a guy's gotta eat and my life isn't cheap
So fuck feds, you can all die in your sleep
Back up, they call backup for point 1 of green
I'm like "officer, what's the need?
Are you that weak? I'm only six foot three
What happened to your training scheme, you likkle chief?"
These same youts used to sit by the PC
Now think they're bad cause their badge says PC
And these sneaky CID wanna creep on me
And then ask for ID, what cheek

The shooters leave scars
XanMan got the bars
We whip up the beats and Xav Xav get it charged
Frank better pull up in the car
Cause I got so much dope, it gon' take us to mars 
Rolling up blunts with no flaws
Spliff took a hit of that shit
It went straight to his head when the smoke was protruding his jaws
Got a tendency to kill, do you feel?
Take a Asian girl head like the scene in Kill Bill
But she ain’t gon' quit on my quentin, I rampage like Jackson and drill like a dentist
Fuck do you mean ain't no doubt I’m a menace
You can tell by the way that shit is tatted on my penis ay
And she still gon' lick it, she love it
Told me hit it raw but you know I gotta glove of xans
Can't take a chance with a thot, especially if she tryna hold my fucking hand, bitch you thought
I already got a girl, what, you tryna get me caught?
Understand I don’t mean to disrespect alot
But you can take your motherfucking eyes off my guap
I just need you to pop n' lock
I really don’t care what you think you got
Always tryna share like you think you hot
And asking me them questions tryna make a knot
Well it ain’t getting tied hoe, I’m like bye hoe
Gotta kill a motherfucking track like Michael
Got damn I'm a motherfucking psycho
Spit so tight, bitch it sound like lypo
Then I drop her ass off at the light post
Tell her have a good night
Then I’m off just like Bob cause I’m done with the got damn side shows, Xans

Still Hattori Hanzo chopping up people or Hanzo Hasashi my scorpion lethal
Imprint of my sting that's the thing there's no equal
YG on the beat so unique and so regal
Coats and the boats, that's the shit that I need too
Get a couple of, maybe get a couple drugs
Mix them up in the cup then it’s down to my gut
I'm all for the war, so I’m all to the bud
Gotta chill, no pills, just the feel in my lungs
I’m feeling kinda ill
What's the deal? Hurry up
Nigga taking three days just to roll a fucking blunt
Here my boy, past it over cause yo ass is fucking up
Surprised I haven’t hit you with some fucking upper cuts
Cause you acting absurd, bitch better swerve
Can’t you see a nigga talking, girl you getting on my nerves
I apologize, these bitches must be into nerds
But ain’t shit sweet bout the first or the third
Now we onto the fourth
Yes oh of course
Can’t forget the Sailor Man he be riding with the court
I ain't talking court of owls but the talon finna hurt
Based on the way my talents leave ya ass in the dirt
Sorry had to murk, ain't no other way to work
How else you expect me to get these hoes to twerk
I come to my house open that blouse and jerk
Till all my desccendants spillin' out disperse
Or I get reprimanded cause she said it hurts
But ya boy can’t stop once I’m inside of her

Stay rollin' up like a sleeve keep on fallin'
Runnin' pick ups cause we keep on ballin' like
Jordan and Spalding, Johnson and Wallace
Your bitch so slow she tried to put a foodstamp on an envelope
I'm a king if you didn't know
I'm at Grady's house sittin' on the porch eating cantaloupe

Uh, oh yea son everything closer than a muthafucka
Getting ready for tour, Michael Blackson
I'm about to go postal in this muthafucka
I sold my first gram in the park after dark
Right across the riverfront it was on the front
Fuckin' with Rico until he got jammed and the whole operation started closing up

Feel like I can't trust nobody, got me checking my surroundings
I'm just tryna move in silence, play it smooth
A lot of bitches want a nigga I got options
Pussy just be falling out my pocket
Hold up, sipping on some stuff straight from the doctor
Soldier, act like I don't give one fuck about you
Hold up, I hope my weed down here while the cops ride by
I know you like my style, I don't know why I'm so fly
'Bout my cream like Wu-Tang, switching lanes rocking Fubu
Couple chains, I won't his your dank if it's boo boo
Gold fangs in my mouth got my smile so stunted
I can tell by your bank account that you not one hunnid
Niggas love to sit and pout 'cause they still ain't done it
Better shut your fucking mouth 'fore I shut that for you
Boys be acting just like bitches they just want some attention
I can't thank God enough that he made me so different
Tripping on that petty change while we plotting on millions
All about my fucking business let you get my extension
It go four, two, three, four cars deep
Money on the table I know niggas tryna eat
I'm chilling, sipping slow, meditating tryna think
Chilling, sipping slow, meditating tryna think

I know a bunch of bad bitches who ain't ready for me
Bet if you gave their ass a chance they'll fucking blow it
I'm so player with these words I'm a pimping poet
Sipping potion, spitting game, then I let you soak it
I think we 'bout to have the game sold up
Time for young Lucas to have his chain froze up
Niggas thinking we stupid I thought somebody told ya
Can come try to stop us but can't nobody hold us
I'm just playing my position like a power forward
Smoking sour doja, got me feeling like a super nova, super duper potent
What you doing, you ain't doing nothing, you just talk about it
Ask him how come he ain't popping he don't want to talk about it
Niggas talk too much, shut the fuck up
Maybe if you stayed down, grinded, you could double up
Me and the team plotting like a fucking huddle up
I'ma ride for my niggas, guess it's time to buckle up
Yeah we working and we tryna make a move
But you gotta keep it cool, yeah you gotta keep it cool
Tryna shine, lid be busting with the juice

You might've seen me in my Beamer truck
Smashing down Crenshaw
Cause I got a lil money
House on a hill and I ain't even sold a record
Me and Chordz did this beat with no effort
She like the way my chain get to swangin
When I T.I.U. when I get to bangin
And then the bitch got mad
When my girl walked up with the purple Louie bag
Yeah you heard about TY$
But you never seen a YG that's this fly
No lie
I stay high
Hopping off the G4 black suit red tie
Tree deep in the Cadillac
With the T hat
Breaking down a dub sack
With the homies
And we smashing down Pico
That's where the G's go
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask somebody
Bitch you betta ask, if ya ain't heard bout me

Aye, if you didn't know
You betta ask somebody
And the big homies got AK's and big shottys
Red belt hangin
Red rag swangin
West side 400 Spruce Street bangin

Re- all damn, I forgot, I forgot the word nigga
Hold on, go back nigga 
HEY, HEY, HEY!
Brainstorm, I'm about to go airborne
You lookin' at a guy rare form
The shit I'm spittin' I should probably get the chair for
Hold up, hold up, wait
I'm feeling like I'm Master P, I got the master key
I pull up to the master suite, this life was meant for me
 while I'm eatin' mac and cheese
A model snackin' on my dick is zero calories
I was a thieving ass finesser in my past life
Where I'm from that's like my cities favorite past time
Stickin' to the cash flow, now I'm back on them hoes
The way it came back, would think I sold crack to them hoes
You spendin' money like it's going out of style 
I could tell you never had shit, you be actin' like a child
Hear these rappers, I just laugh and crack a smile 
All that ice you rockin' got you watered down 
I swear the game ain't been the same since Pimp C went home
Y'all just some old ass rappers fuckin' young ass hoes
But never mind, I'ma leave that thing alone 
Just keep it real and let the fakers get exposed 
They don't want it, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, hell nah, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, hell nah, they ain't ready for me
You need the real, not the bootleggers
I mean for real, damn, you could do better
You need the real, not the bootleggers
I mean for real, you could do better
Hope you recognize a fraud when you see one
Flexin', tryna put on a facade for the camera
Guess your occupation is perpetuating for a dollar
Must be hard providing for your kids and baby mama
I'm the golden child, I keep it polished never tarnished
Bitch, I got that flavor, J. J. Fad, that Supersonic 
Confident in who I am so I don't fairy tale 
My life in this music, do you see the parallels? 
You look mad suspicious, I know you got bad intentions
Tryna straddle fences, nigga, you gon' split your bridges
Tried to tell 'em keep it solid, niggas never listen
All because we stayed the same when all y'all tried to switch it
Money on the way followed by a train of bitches
Layin' in my bed at night, I'm havin' visions
Went to sleep and had a dream about a Mercedes G-Wagon
Pulled up to a mansion, diamonds shinin' so fluorescent
They don't want it, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, hell nah, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, they ain't ready for me
They don't want it, hell nah, they ain't ready for me
You need the real, not the bootleggers
I mean for real, damn, you could do better
You need the real, not the bootleggers
I mean for real, you could do betterBeat got me feeling like a rockstar
Colder than the ice cream truck
I'm whippin when I drop bars
And they call me transformer cause I swap cars
Quicker than a bitch you probably missed it cause I flipped it aye
I sipped ambition, then mixed it with a vision
Not good at long division
See my job consist addition
That means the funds sufficient
You slackers lackin' business
They need survival fitness when we finish with the mission
Fuck the mission hit this line instead
I just gave yo bitch some average head
And that ain't even braggadocio
Nigga I'm just hungry
Gotta take what I can get before I get to the money
Her nose runny cause her friend my fuck buddy
"Yo it's Lucky!" I'm the man
Made her ex the understudy
Getting money from GoFundMe
Then spend it when it's sunny
Fuck a rainy day I'm cashin' out as if my pockets run me
Like DMC, I'm tripping DMT inside a gold 300z
Probably stole it like my weed
From the plug, from the jump
Nigga should of knew what's up
I introduced him to my uppercut and stabbed him in the nuts
Grabbed the guts, threw his body in the cut
Whip a bitch like double dutch
Now I don' made her run amuck
Don't condone a cluck
It's YG silly fuck
Stash ya raps inside a bag and toss em in a garbage truck
I'm swaggin' like I'm out of this world
Tommy boots and it came with the sword
All Nike from the top
Finessed it straight out the store
Man I'm just tryna get a sponsor so they pay me on tour
Shit, hit ignore I'm busy scoring a whore
Push the door, you'll see her braw on the floor
Dope galore, roll some more
Shooting shots like Roger Moore
Think I got them niggas pissed so now the plot is Yacht Wars
1, 2, 3, bitch come smoke my weed
Bitch I'll take you to the Yacht Wars behind the scenes
But when you get back to the lot it ain't a yacht, It's a train
You ain't know that shit till now so it's bout time to use your brain
Have a seat, you fucking lames can't compete
Yeah your shit was good and all
But was that motherfucka heat?
Me and Xans make the beats

You niggas must be broke cause ya'll ain't got no sense  x2I got a pound of cash, because I raised my stats
You don't need to ask, because I know I'm up
Stock like Bitcoin prime, so I can vacay without fuss
Sad boys not in sight, just green on me, it's time
Hop on the train or get off the tracks right back
I'm climbing higher, because i'm on my passion, I'm sayin
I'm finding as time goes by, I get a lot more in perspective, it's like
The more I focus on what I really want in my vision, I'm seeing
Potential up to the ceiling
It's crazy
Cuz I used to be on food stamps, now I'm first class, planet roaming
Going sky high, so fly, all the baddest gear, it's mine
I don't need to smoke that shit, I've got top dollar to blow
I don't stress over the small stuff, but the details matter the most
They build up on the bigger picture, to make the image show
It's looking pretty fucking epic, my septic bout to explode
I frame that shit so carefully so I can watch it grow
Let's pause
Hold up
I did it all just for the scars
Stand back
See that?
I turned 5 into 500 and flipped that shit
Let's pause
Hold up
I did it all just for the scars
Stand back
See that?
I turned 5 into 500 and flipped that shit
Okay we all got problems I know but let's make it work
Pick a thing that you like, I did, look at me now
And my only one focus was cuz of how music sounds
Can I have this packaged up to go and take it with me?
You damn right I can, that's how I'm going to make history
In anybody's opinion, I might sound like a mystery
But I swerv in my mind to find
Don't get me wrong, I didn't make it clear it about the bread
It's that shit in the middle that nourish my heart n head
The lettuce is just bonus, yeah it helps me to focus
But my focus was my motive to crush the game, erode it
Let's pause
Stand back
Hold up
See that?Drowning my Avondale blues in Kentucky Gold
Broken brain stems / burning flames in a buckie bowl
The sweet smell of mother mary that my mother rolled
While Rubber Soul revolved to soothe a troubled soul
My old man sold his for a bag of beans
Fiends with old showbiz dreams they hadn’t seen
My mother caught us drinking cider on a trampoline
Didn’t understand that that was standard, I was standard three
I spent my best days at school sitting at the dean
Drinking Kristov like Cristal mixed with L&P
They were drinking Bernadino with some girls from Baradene
We were hanging with some girls from Kelston on the kerosene
Used to know a sheila that could scull a whole aquila
And still drive us home sweet in her old Caldina
Scullin’ cheap tequila by the litre like ribena
When all we had to live for was gout and emphysema
Sippin’ Mississippi in my mother’s Mitsubishi
Tipsy off some good home brew and bad whisky
Was me, Mal and Gibby like Ash, Brock and Misty
Sitting in the park pissy-drunk with some pidgies
Flashbacks when Mad Jacks was $10.50
Gassed if I had cash to get a bag of Twistie
Down and out, no one had a half a shit to give me
Thinkin’ ‘bout if I did it, would my missy miss me?
It was me and them
Back of the bus, plastic cup
Full of Seagers gin
Nothin’ in the fridge - just some John West and Mi Goreng
They said I was dope but I was broke
I was BFN
Sitting by myself
Havin’ a D and M
Mask on like nacho while I march on all macho
Drinking Country in a country drunk on bravado
Couldn’t trust my man, my fam far from whanau
Used to burn about a half o up in a arvo
That’s all I had
A pen and a pad up in the lab
Doing a lag like my dad
Scullin the sav out the bag
Tryna scab cash for gas
To gap back to Tat South
Yacked up some cognac I racked
And johnny blacked out
Did all that to come back round
To where I’m at now
Drinkin' steiney out the tap
At the tap house
In AD
Back up in the neighbourhood that raised me
Crazy
Lookin’ back on days, they all grainy
Traded in my VB for green tea
Traded in my CC and Dry for a hot chai and a cream brie
Used to run it straight like Hitro Okesene
Now I’m straight weekend warrior
They say they hardly see me
Charlie got my homies all whackin’ on Charlie Sheenie
I just wanna sip on a cuppa like Auntie Queenie
Maybe get a apple martini in Santorini
Take the money from the man and take my fam to Fiji
I used to hit the hen straight
Now I got my head straight
Used to drink about ten flame
Just on a Wednesday
Used to be about that life
Now I’m ‘bout the pen game
And I’m feelin’ like I’m MJ
Bangin’ on Dikembe
Got to tell my mother no more cancer on the X-ray
I told her I love her took her out to get some penne
Feel like Abercrombie reminiscing on his best game
At Westlake while was working at woolworths at westgate
Look, that’s just how I feel
That’s just how I feel
Picked up the hand that I was dealt
And I learned how to deal
And I was higher than a power bill
Am still
But can’t a man chill with a chill can of Amstel?
Look
I tried to make or break
I hit the white and sunk the eight
Then sunk myself inside my drink
And drunk until I drunk my weight
Any problem that I ever solved? Alcohol
Now I’m tryna dig myself up out the hole
Kentucky GoldGoin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to my safe x2
-Put the gun away, nigga
-Can we have one night where there ain't no fightin'; nobody   gets shot?
-Shut up, bitch!
I'mma fly nigga nigga I take your ho
I'll have to leave her if she did me like Coco
The devil talkin' to me, but I dont hear him
Act like I'm deaf like So-So
Fuck you, fuck him, fuck them
Fuck my ex and her cohorts
Hundred bottles in the club, for no reason
Niggas start trippin boom bow dope fiend
Fendi on my shoes, Fendi on my belt
I'm in the Fendi store I dont need help
All gold everything like Trinidad
I went to high school with you bitch you been a rat
I don't got money problems, I got trust issues
Two things I gotta stay is with the two pistols
Grimy nigga way too groovy for the Grammys
Overseas collecting panties, poppin' Xanies
Young nigga, hundred grand for the gram, hot damn
Hit the curb with the Benz, swerve
Rollie do no ticky do the blingy
I spending hundreds, all the fifties
Word around the city I'm that nigg-y
But this month I made a milli
Another month, another milli, man that shit be gettin' silly
Man, bitch you looking silly
Why you broke, go get a check
And when you fly, who need a jet
She wanna move out to the west
She want them diamonds on her neck
And palm trees in the yard, wanna be's with a star
And get the keys to the car huh
And wanna lick on every scar huh
My money good, shit we buying off the bar right now, right now
Who got the weed right now, right now
Goin' goin' back back to the bank
Rest in peace to my safe x2Trapped inside my mind
These thoughts would probably haunt my ass to death
No where I can hide, sometimes I'm too afraid to ask for help
One day before I die, be sure to tell you how I really felt
Don't look up to me, see I'm just tryna understand myself
Way too many problems, I can blame nobody but myself
Up high in the clouds, I'm just out here running from myself
Liquor on my liver, know this can't be too good for my health
Love when you around 'cause you ain't never scared to be yourself
Trust and believe, seen it all fall down and we still alright
Trust and believe, when it all falls down we gon' be alright, alright

Big shouts to the homie Nipsy hustle
I mean if you can buy it for a hundred why can’t you buy it for a thousand
If you can buy it for a thousand you might as well pay 10 stacks 
That’s how me and Nip gotta do itShort rap 
Repeat x2
Short rap, is everything
It's what I think, it's what I sing
Cause I'm a rapper, who lets you know
When it comes to music, I will grow
Rap more raps than any mc
Your rap ain't rap cause your rap ain't me
Short rap, is what you find
The mastermind, short rap that rhyme
Too short baby, that's the name
When I rap my rap I rap that game
I tell it to you like you always knew
Short rap's not fake, it's always true
It's me, it's you, short rap is life
It's everyday and every night
And I don't just say it's this and that
It's everything, it's what short rap's
Short rap 
Itz what?
Short rap
Fresh
Short rap
Short rap
Short rap
S-h-o-r-t-r-a-p
Short rap is what I call this beat
Cause what you find, when I say rhymes
Is a non-stop rap, right on time
I'm the kind of person you always thought
Couldn't make a record that would be bought
Sir too short, it couldn't be
Short rap, what's that, short rap is me
Short rap
Short rap
So so fresh
I like tenders, young and hot
You never hear short say baby why not?
I'm sir too short, I'm so down
Mc rapper from the oakland town
You better get up, short raps a song
It really ain't short, it's much too long
Cause I don't stop, once I start
Short rap, what's that, short rap is art
Took my rap to the neighborhood
From day one too short was good
True mc's make sucka mc's
In my time they rap like me
A brotha said short, he's good as you
Saw me on stage and learned the truth
I was born, to hit the tops
Short rap, I don't stop
Short rap
Short rap
Short rap
Short rap has now affected you
Short rap won't stop until I get through
Short rap could knock
Sucka mc's stop biting on you and start biting on me
And I won't get mad, cause I'm so bad
The rap you have is the rap I had
Now if you want, my new short rap
You can put it in your shorts and bite on that
Sucka mc, you know I'm fresh
A rap in my trash can top your best
Check it out boy, here and now
How will you rap when you don't know how
I wish I could hear you answer that
It just won't work and that's short rap
Try to make you understand
Don't make more raps, just be a fan
Short rap
Short rap, is it sad or funny
I thought you knew short rap is money
Sucka mc, you don't need help
All you need to do is something else
Cause mc rapper's are all around
And sucka mc's are like bloodhoundsRapper stop, rapper stop, rapper stop

Post Up 
Get Money 
Roll Up 
MurdaStyle The Clique And We All About That Violence 
Sit back Post up I’m getting my bread
All them white folks that’s eighty a head
One ounce, two ounce ship it in glad
Flipping all the money, like I play in the bed
Any nigga want beef, he’s playing with led
I only want money, with the big ass heads
And if you think I’m lying’, you can check my cred
Addicted to the money, like two gay fags
All that chit chat, ain't nuttin’ to me
Say it to my face and quit the fronting’ for free
Fucking with the kid and I’ll see you on tee’s
No questions asked, when it
Comes to me
I’m heavy in the streets, like Bean and the fiends
Plus I keep that raw, so they coming to me
No joke with the smoke I got dope on the rope, reeling in fast cash, like I’m on speed boats
Take it to the club, I’ll show you a scene
Fifty-two weeks straight, bottles on me
And all your bad chicks, choosing the team
Meet us at the spot, after hours up east
I love a bad bitch that gets to the green
Stacking all her cash, ain't no fucking for free
But I ain't the type of nigga that pays for the “p”
Take her out of town and it’s financed by me
Beat her back in, leave her shivering on sheets
Then back to the money, I’m in love with the streets
Fuck the police, tryna take you from me
But all this cash flow that my lawyer just seen
It will be a fucking while
Before I’m leaving the scene
Selling everything and I’m chasing this CREAM
Got White, Got Boy, Slows, Got Tabs, Reg, Got Dro, Everything’s Low
You know me, I do my thing
I ain't worried about it, I’m straight
I’m, living the lime life and my mouth piece is ol’ great
It’s Y-G, Gizzle
Name blowing like whistles
Ho’s all on me tryna stop my ball like officials
But I’m good, super high, excellent, fantastic
Spice got me leaning and my swagger is extravagant
Never hesitant, when it comes to the cash route
‘Cause ill bring the mac out and POW pow your ass out
Goons in the back ready to be let loose
It’s all MurdaStyle here, plus we acting a fool
We getting money by the bundles, so its stack or starve
I got small face money older than Brett Favre
Never tripping about a hater, ‘cause my fight game nice
White gold’s, stooped shinning, we don’t even need lights
I’m addicted to the money, so it’s heavy rotation
Gizzle on top of the game, like standing on PlayStations
Let’s GoYou Finna Die Baby!
Yuh, yuh yuh yuh, woah
Why they shoot that nigga while his hands was up 
You wanna make a deal? Nigga ante up 
She want all of my time and my stamina
Too bad cause she all the way in Canada 
Man your money it ain't adding up 
And I ain't talkin bout no algebra 
Momma told me wrap it up 
Cause she know a nigga glamorous 
I ain't playing bitch I damage ya 
In Compton or Canada 
I don't care where you are I aim them hammers up 
Ain't got shit to lose I'll do that shit on camera 
I know what you thinking but it ain't telepathy
I can sense it in the way you addressing me 
Bitches gon love you the first week 
But I guarantee you they gon be suckin dick by the second week 
Slide on em just like a checkers piece 
Even Wreck it Ralph don't want no damn wreck with me 
If it's a rap competition bitch bet on me 
I ain't do squat, but I got the Tec on me 
Bitch I know your parents home but you better show me more 
And I'm tryna fuck, babygirl, so get up and close that door 
But I ain't gon force you I'ma just leave and not hit you up no more 
So you get on your knees and suck on my dick, or I'm just out the door 
And I can't fuck with you fuck niggas, you gon fall for sure
Bitch I'm evil like Voldemort
No freezer, still blow the torch
Better watch your mouth when you mention me or vanish instantly
They wanna see a young nigga like me in the penitentiary
Man I got this murder shit up on my mind
Beatin my meat like all the fuckin time
These bitches wanna sleep on a nigga like me
Ok, ok, that's fine
When a nigga blow up, don't hit my DMs lil bitch I ain't got the time
Cause you ain't want give me the time
And you ain't think I was gon shine
And I got low self-esteem that's why I want the world to love me nigga

Damn Brody Fambo!
My nigga Brody high rolling like Jody
Roll in the whip then we rolling and smoking
Boxing that bitch like it’s talking that shit
Because Brody got loud by pound and it’s lit
He packing a Vega won’t fuck with a swish
Once he turned the fuck up please don’t fuck with the kid
Cause he strapped the fuck up and he loaded with clips
Leave you looking like soowoo, It’s sad like a crip
I don’t, know what got in yo mind
Or what you was tryna find
Fuck around with a nigga like mine
Cause a nigga like mine don’t play
Fambo go Rambo for days

But he fuck with the Yacht a lot
He’ll tell a hoe like “bitch you thought”
Now get off my arm, go take a walk
I just need the cake, I ain’t tryna talk
Told her ass three times now she tryna stalk
Got shawty straight addicted like she sniffing the chalk
But Fambo can’t leave a hoe hanging even though she kinda crazy
If she really want some dicking then he digging what she thinking
See Brody give no fucks, he get dope for the low bucks
I’m just glad he know us
Cause no discussion, when he erupting
You know he busting, guns
All gold hollows just for all gold fun
And when it all go down he taking all yo funds
He snatching yo chain and picking yo ring

Damn Brody Fambo!
Now this where shit just get complicated
Hadn’t made a move like all day
But Brody Fambo felt obligated
Nigga need to get that pay
So we seen a hoe about 5’4 and she lookin good I won’t lie
Told her come right over, we can take yo order
And she did but she had a surprise
So I pull out the strap, left her flat on her back cause the Bitch was police in disguise
Can’t believe I ain’t seen it, she played on my demons
She knew I was peeping her thighs
Then I turn and said "Brody we dipping out homie"
He start up the whip then we fly
Squad car on a chase, squad all with a K
Fambo said that these niggas gon die
So I started laying down all of these niggas
Ain’t really a killer but shit I just figured
I’d rather dispose, how you suppose he was living?
He not cause them bullets feel hot where he filled em
One down, hella to go
Then I heard the chopper fly over the road
But Fambo just pull out the chopper with scope
My hands on the wheel while he lock it and load
One shot, headshot
Now the heli hittin that bedrock
Cause the pilot feeling that deadlock
Explosion created a dead spot
So we dip to the crib and we camp out
Ain’t no way they gon catch us, we set now
We got food and the bud for some months so we packed up some blunts, chief them hoes and we passed out

You drop out too young, now you just busting caps
Call it blue on red but it's really black on black
Cause the more we drop out, the more we go to jail
Like voluntary slaves, expected to fail
Listen up brother, you need to understand
Being truly educated ain't a part of their plan
We got tricked again and slicked again

If love is the answer why don't it pay the rent?
If patience is a virtue why's it all spent?
If religion is the way then why we all fighting?
If mankind gone survive why we ain't united?
If the truth will set you free then we still lying?
Big criminals get up but the baby's still crying
If karma was real why don't we expect it?
If the earth is our mother then why neglect it?
We got tricked again and slicked again
Held back and not picked again
Short-changed and then chipped again, been slipped again

Then I disappear like wha happened in the shadows wit assassin's yeah i lead my crew im captain bussing out of that cabin wit a bunch of niggas thats sum dragons
Jugging str8 up off that iphone in the jungle like a python do a drill cut the lights off spray a nigga wit the lysol make sure his whole life gone bitch im plugged in wit pipe bombs ive been bussing moves all night long yeah making money all night long Here's a little real talk about the book publishing industry — it adds almost no value, it is going to be wiped off the face of the earth soon, and writers and readers will be better off for it.
The fundamental uselessness of book publishers is why I thought it was dumb of the Department of Justice to even bother prosecuting them for their flagrantly illegal cartel behavior a couple of years back, and it's why I'm deaf to the argument that Amazon's ongoing efforts to crush Hachette are evidence of a public policy problem that needs remedy. Franklin Foer's recent efforts to label Amazon a monopolist are unconvincing, and Paul Krugman's narrower argument that they have some form of monopsony power in the book industry is equally wrongheaded.
What is indisputably true is that Amazon is on track to destroy the businesses of incumbent book publishers. But the many authors and intellectuals who've been convinced that their interests — or the interests of literary culture writ large — are identical with those of the publishers are simply mistaken.
Books are published by giant conglomeratesWisdom on this subject begins with the observation that the book publishing industry is not a cuddly craft affair. It's dominated by a Big Four of publishers, who are themselves subsidiaries of much larger conglomerates. Simon & Schuster is owned by CBS, HarperCollins is owned by NewsCorp, Penguin and RandomHouse are jointly owned by Pearson and Bertelsmann, and Hachette is part of an enormous French company called Lagadère.
These are not tiny, helpless enterprises. Were their owners interested in the future of books and publishing, they could invest the money necessary to make their own e-reading apps and e-book store and render Amazon entirely superfluous. But the managers of these conglomerates don't really care. If they can get famous authors to lobby the government to stop Amazon from killing them for free, then they're happy to take the free labor.
But they don't want to invest actual money and energy in competing with Amazon, they'd rather wring whatever remaining profit there is out of book publishing and dedicate the money to dividends or other industries they're also involved in.
Amazon faces lots of competitionIt is undeniably true that Amazon has a very large share of the market for e-books. What is not true is that Amazon faces a lack of competition in the digital book market. Barnes & Noble — a company that knows something about books — sells e-books, and does so in partnership with a small outfit called Microsoft. Apple sells e-books and so does Google.
These are not obscure companies. It is not inconvenient for customers to access their products. And since these are companies that are actually much bigger and more profitable than Amazon, there is absolutely no way Jeff Bezos can drive them out of business with predatory pricing.
Amazon's e-book product is much more popular than its rivals because Amazon got there first, and the competition has not succeeded in producing anything better. But consumers who prefer to buy a digital book from a non-Amazon outlet have several easy options available, and thus a book publisher who chooses to eschew Amazon will not actually be unable to reach customers.
Publishers are superfluousIn the traditional book purchasing paradigm, when a reader bought a book at the store there were two separate layers of middlemen taking a cut of the cash before money reached the author: a retailer and a publisher. The publisher, in this paradigm, was doing very real work as part of the value-chain. A typed and printed book manuscript looks nothing like a book. Transforming the manuscript into a book and then arranging for it to be shipped in appropriate quantities to physical stores around the country is a non-trivial task. What's more, neither bookstore owners nor authors have any expertise in this field.
Digital publishing is not like that. Transforming a writer's words into a readable e-book product can be done with a combination of software and a minimal amount of training. Book publishers do not have any substantial expertise in software development, but Amazon and its key competitors  do.
Publishers would like writers to believe that the pressure they are feeling from Amazon will trickle down and hurt authors as well. But there is a big difference. Even in the brave new world of e-publishing, authors are still making a crucial contribution to the industry by writing the books. Publishers are getting squeezed out because they don't contribute anything of value.
Book publishers are terrible at marketingWhen I was a kid, my father was a novelist as were both of my grandparents. So I heard a lot of stories about how useless publishers are at marketing books. Then I got to know other people who wrote books and they had the same complaints. Then I wrote a book, and their complaints became my complaints. But it's easy to whine that other people aren't marketing your product effectively. It took the Amazon/Hachette dispute to conclusively prove that the whiners are correct.
After all, imagine a world in which publishers were good at marketing books. Then it would be almost trivial for Hachette to get what it wants out of Amazon. It could just not sell its books on Amazon! Unlike in the old days when it might have been inconvenient for someone who lived in a town with a Borders but no Barnes & Noble to go get a book that Borders didn't sell, it's trivially easy to click on some non-Amazon website to order a book. But you do need a customer who actually wants to buy the book.
In his column, Krugman compares Amazon's large market share to Standard Oil's. But books aren't undifferentiated commodities the way oil is. If you want to buy Paul Krugman's new book, then you can't just substitute some other book. Hachette, however, seems  to have almost no confidence in its own ability to market books.
The real risk for publishers is that major authors might discover that they do have the ability to market books. When George RR Martin's next iteration of the Game of Thrones series is released, I will buy it. If I can buy it as an Amazon Kindle book, I will buy it that way. If he decides that the only way people should be able to read the book is to get Powell's to mail them a copy, then I will buy it that way. And I am not alone. Nor is Martin the only author with the clout to not worry about the terms of distribution.
But for a publisher to team up with a celebrity author in this way to bypass Amazon would merely reveal how easy it would be for a celebrity author to bypass the incumbent publishers. In the old days, even the most famous author would need a publishing partner to actually make the physical books. Today that's not the case. Martin needs a software platform to sell books, but publishers don't have one. He could easily hire one or more editors to work with him on the copy if he wants to.
Advances aren't charitable contributionsThe final role of the modern book publisher is as a payer of advances. The way the money end of books work is that the person who wrote a book gets paid a royalty on each copy sold — a sum that is generally much less than half the retail price of the book, and dramatically lower than the 70% that Amazon is willing to pay to authors who bypass the publishing incumbents. In addition to royalties, a publisher will typically pay you an advance. The advance is a special kind of loan. When your book first starts selling copies, the royalties you would be owed are kept by the publisher to repay the advance. If you sell a lot of books, you'll fully repay your advance and start seeing money. If you sell very few books, you'll never repay your advance and are under no obligation to do so.
To Foer, ultimately, the case against Amazon comes down to advances, which he sees as "the economic pillar on which quality books rest, the great bulwark against dilettantism." At the same time, he believes that "no bank or investor in its right mind would extend that kind of credit to an author, save perhaps Stephen King." Thus "it won't take much for this anomalous ecosystem to collapse" if publishers are pushed too hard by Amazon.
My best guess is that this is too pessimistic about the financial logic behind giving advances. It is not, after all, just a loan that you may or may not pay back. An advance is bundled with a royalty agreement in which a majority of the sales revenue is allocated to someone other than the author of the book. In its role as venture capitalist, the publisher is effectively issuing what's called convertible debt in corporate finance circles — a risky loan that becomes an ownership stake in the project if it succeeds.
But what really matters here is that book publishers are not charities. They are for-profit business enterprises. If advances don't make financial sense, then they will die off regardless of what happens to Amazon. If they do make financial sense, then they will live on as financial products even as the rest of the industry restructures.
A bounty of affordable readingWhen all is said and done, the argument between Amazon and book publishers is over the rather banal question of price. Amazon's view is that since "printing" an extra copy of an e-book is really cheap, e-books should be really cheap. Publishers' view is that since "printing" an extra copy of an e-book is really cheap, e-books should offer enormous profit margins to book publishers. If you care about reading or ideas or literature, the choice between these visions is not a difficult one. The publishing incumbents have managed to get some intellectuals sufficiently tangled-up to believe that it is. But ask yourself this — do you regret the invention of the printing press? Of the paperback? Do you think public libraries devalue books and reading? The idea is absurd.
Of course a world where more people can get more books more conveniently is a better world. It is true that some individual authors may earn less in the new era, while others authors may earn more. But there is no reason to believe that authors as a whole will get less money. Indeed, as Amazon and other digital distributors gobble up some of the publishers' slice of the revenue, it's likely that authors will also get a share and see their total income rise. Beyond money, no book worth writing is undertaken for purely pecuniary motives. In the new regime it will be easier for writers to find readers and reacher larger audiences. They just won't find them through the exact same set of middlemen who currently sit astride the pipeline. Tough on them.Young motherfucking Gods

Et si t’étais ma ride or die comme Bonnie et Clyde
Mais malheureusement j’suis pas un gars très sentimental
Mais malheureusement j’suis pas un gars très sentimental
J’pas un negro en sentimental pour du love moi j’ai pas trop l’time time time time
Pour l’instant moi j’ai pas trop l’time ce que j’dois faire c’est de la maille maille maille maille
J’ai pas trop l’time time time time
Moi j’veux dl’a maille maille maille maille
J’pas un negro en sentimental pour du love moi j’ai pas trop l’time time time time
Pour l’instant moi j’ai pas trop l’time ce que j’dois faire c’est de la maille mailleJeszcze niepełnoletni jestem i wbiję na temat
Jedyne rachunki jakie mam, to rachunki sumienia
Będę tutaj rzucał mięsem i nie obchodzą mnie posty
Jedyne długi jakie mam, to kurwa długi wdzięczności
Złożona choreografia, pomyliłem się w tańcu
Reżyser własnego życia, napisałem chujowy scenariusz
To wszystko jest jak puzzle, nie wiem kiedy będzie koniec układanki
Jedyne co teraz chce, to na bitach narzucać panczy
Mam dobry wzrok, a jednak nie widzę przeszkód by rozjebać
Mam kurwa więcej panczy, niż w nazwie Tupolewa
Czuję się jak Kanye West, no bo tutaj mam styl
W wielu sytuacjach jestem krupierem, bo to ja rozdaje karty
Nie liczę drogi przed sobą, rzygam od panczy #ósma_mila
Mój skill na majku jak zwój, bo widzę jak się rozwija
Niektórzy tu jak Artemida i Midas, bo mają złoty strzał
Niezbyt lubię siedzieć przy książkach, a robię podręcznikowy rap
To headliner
Headliner
Headliner
Wpadają Ci tutaj w łeb pancze
To headliner
Headliner
The One and Only
Drugiego takiego nie znajdziesz
Wiatr wieje w twarz, ale biegnę po swój cel jak Forrest Gump
Mam nadzieję, że mój most nie zawali się jak domek z kart
Obiektywnie mówię tu, że widzę, że mam potencjał
Mów mi rap hazardzista, no bo kurwa nie skończę grać
Możesz mówić, ze jestem chujowy, lecz tu nie masz racji
Jestem jak kelner czy tenisista bo serwuje panczlajny
W małym mieście wielkie ambicję, skminisz jeśli mieszkasz tutaj
Na bitach zawsze jak Sobota, bo mordo wjeżdżam z buta
Czasem błyszczę jak diament, świecę tekstami jak telebim
To co o mnie mówisz po mnie spływa jak stearyna ze świecy
Powiedz mi ziomek, czym byłby tutaj rap bez beki
Choć szczerze niezbyt obchodzą mnie te rap bezbeki
Tymi liniami przebijam słabych MC #wenflon
W sumie pozamiatałem tu już, ale jeszcze wytrę ścierką
Ja i inteligencja to związek doskonały, ona zawsze ze mną
Moja wyższość tu jak kapsułka, na sucho nie możesz jej przełknąć
Gdy wjeżdżam na majka to jest jak Nepal bo aż trzęsie się ziemia
Czuje się tu jak w banku, wszędzie tylko przekaz i przekaz
Chciałbyś to tak logicznie kminić ale brakuje ci IQ
Mój dobry rap jak twój hajs, bo masz to jak w banku
Ja rzucam linie, które rzucają cień na wasz chujowy rap, łaki
Mam ich krew na łapach i szczęce, czuje się jak wampir
Kiedy trzeba no to mordo przyznam, że masz racje
I możesz myśleć, że nie mam serca, bo władowałem całe w pasje
Strzelam tu jak Glock, ty jeszcze nie wiesz z kim tańczysz
W rapie tu jestem wilkiem, gdy inni zeszli na psy
Zwrotki są jak nici bo je tutaj nawinę
Gdy piszę wersy jestem jak dupy z modelingu, bo dbam o linie
W życiu odgrywam różne role jak Christian Bale, raczej
Mimo to zawsze jestem sobą, nie wpierdalam piłki jak Gareth
Niby dzieciak, a jednak mam od niejednego lepsze flow
Rap gra skremowana, właśnie obróciłem ją w prochShe say she like ballers, she say she like dick
She say she like girls, that don't even make sense
She say she like the balls, say shit fucking

Why you worry bout, who hittin this?
I'm a friend of your house hidden in the well
You niggas getting chip, I'm playing chips
You got your mind on me, I got minds on rich
Give it up, give it up, slide like this
Rolex and the chain might blind your bitch

So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know

Ah, better watch how you pussy niggas act

Yeah I'm real flashy, ball like an athlete
Burner to the dob, ah, make it nasty
Don't test me, this ain't college
A bitch get flipped on, I call her knowledge
Make the bitch run, make the bitch come

Ah, hey, they say I like them brand new
They say I wear hollywood, shit is prolly true
Ah, tree tops to the schools
Fucking with the border rules
Never slipping never catch me in the house shoes
Got the jays in my feet, got the jays in the streets
Got the jays at the dough
If I ever gave the bitch money she got it off the floor
I woke up, this morning
Like I'm a grind late night till the morning
Though, being broke was boring
So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know
I gotta get dough, I gotta get dough
The only thing that a nigga need to know

Shit, I'm tryina stay alive bro

Told her we together, fucking told her she my ex
Pocket full of benjes, so nigga I've been g

Popped the homie same night, we gonn pop back
Ah, and I don't rob I stay fast
When I get rich, I promise to stay blat
The only thing I'm giving a stake back
It's puttin my homies on, and giving a state crack
I woke up, this morning
Like I'm a grind late night till the morning
Though, being broke was boring
So I grind late night till the morning
The only thing that a nigga need to know

Up in Sony, sendin' up pictures, she like, "Nigga, I love it"
Phone calls from my sister, she like, "Nigga, we made it"
We gotta celebrate when you gon' take me back to Vegas

How they gon' take my lane when I just keep on makin' changes?
In the night we ride off
Your bitch tryin' to slide off

Kom in de club, ik weet ben peng
Vier, vijf hoes, ze zijn ook blem
Kom geek in de club, dat vindt zij eng
Veel weed-smoking in Amsterdam
Ben een baas, jij bent mijn assistent
Maak geld over voor een etentje
Ben geil, vraag bitches, dat weten ze
Twee keer iets vragen, is bedelen
Drie keer iets vragen, is smekende
Zij doet speed en keta 
En ze voelt etcеtera
Ben op een p- en ik voеl dat het inslaat 
Zij zoekt 4G, ik geef d'r intel
Kom in je huis, maar het is nog geen inbraak 
Ze wilt m'n nummer, m'n Snap en m'n Insta
Ze nekt al m'n vrienden waarmee ik mee omga
Ze is verliefd, ze heeft mij als d'r omslag
Nigga's die praten leugens die ook rondgaan
Zulke nigga's willen graag nummer één zijn
Maar ze weten al dat ik nummer één ben
We gaan rappen, je weet dat ik echt straight ben 
K-K-Kom van de hood, maar ik tour door het land
Ga over de grens, je weet waar ik beland
In de club, ik ben high en dan boss ik m'n tand
En ik zweer ik word rijk, ik heb een meesterplan
Boze ogen, ja, ik weet dat ze kijken
Ik klap ze weg, ik ben gefocust op cijfers 
Kaolo , ik zie die man pleiten
Draai me om als ik naar binnen ga 
Ren naar binnen voor die dikke pap
Maar pap, ik ben je baby zat
Kom van de Bijlmer, ben vaak in de stad
Ben niet van de trap, ze denkt ik maak grap
Was even daar, maar ik ben d'r al af
Ben vaak op m'n fiets, want ik heb nog geen cab
Ik richt op m'n doelen, jij richt op het lat
Hoe pass jij die Cali? Jij hebt niet ge-asst
Lean in m'n beker, ik val van het dak
Ben veelste high en die lean maakt me suf
Ben op m'n bikey, want ik haat de bus
Ben op m'n bikey, want ik haat de bus
Ben met je zus
Ga naar een show, ja, ze weet dat ik plus
En ik wou niet naat scorro, ik zweer, ik was blut
In de gym, ik ben beastmode, ik neem geen rust
Nigga's die breken, ik zweer, ze gaan stuk 
M'n nigga's die komen van put 
Kom me niet testen, ik zie dat je bluft 
Al m'n mannen blijven positief 
Ookal ben ik van de hood, van de riev 
Ookal was ik vroeger stout en een dief 
Sip zoveel lean, maar ik heb walou griep 
, maar ik ben nieteens ziek
Ze geeft medicijn en ze zegt, "Het is wiet" 
Dus al m'n nigga's wouben stie
We zijn veelste high, nee, we nekken je niet
We dragen nog Nikey's, soon double C
Praat over naggoe, maar ben je een G?
Je wifey deed vies en ze is nu verliefd
Kom d'r hier halen, want ik hoef d'r niet
Heb d'r gelezen, ja, voel me een bib
Nigga's die smeken, vragen, "Alsjeblieft?"
Mannen haten, willen mij op de streets
(Nigga's die smeken, vragen, "Alsjeblieft?"
Mannen haten, willen mij op de streets)

Y a des drames, je n'apparais pas , baby, j'suis fou de toi, yeah

Devil in my face, I pray that god won't let him touch me
No not me demons, I'm reaching for the ceiling
To get far from that as possible, pussy is my obstacle
To make it through this course, shit is damn near impossible
Father help my father, then help me
He thinks I'm suppose to preach, but that's just something I don't see
I'm still busy learning, how the hell am I gon' teach?
I focus on this fable tryna make an award speech
I make niggas 
I don't know what you have heard, I said
I don't know what you have heard
But that was that house shit
That trill shit
My nigga Kevin just ripped that shit
You know he apart of The House like a window pane
I hear you tryna get lost up in here, I'm sorry
I said that shit mane, but we up in this in the game
We gone come back with another hit
Another hit after hit
We gone hold our head up, and we gone make it
Stand up, round of applause, motherfuckerIt's lit, ha ha
Nigga I'm in Europe
Purple skies
Uh, uh, nigga, uh, nigga, uh, uh
I sip that lean till I fall asleep
Trill dreams, I'm at my peak
With a little pretty yellow bone
Styrofoam cup, with a straw in it
Now we all sinning
I feel at home, and that pussy shit beat, with some hoes in it
Now I walk silly
Have you ever seen a nigga like me?
Probably not into too many niggas like me
Probably why you like me
This rap shit got me fascinated
And I got the fuck niggas aggravated
And now I got a mixtape, you know that the shit great
But I know a lot of niggas agitated
Feelin' myself, I'm so mass debated
So far ahead, I'm so far past the bases
So pass the blunt, pass the drank and
Soul plane, that stanky panky
Old schools, that's candy painted
Gold grills with some 
Bending corners, got bitches starin'
Jordan 4's and my pants hangin'
Fuck you mean, I'm from the 423
Bad bitch, she from the 615
Playa shit, I'll take a trip
We ain't in the whip but I'll let her ride
I ain't ever been a motherfucker to tell a motherfucker what he can and he can't do
But he can't do it like me,  but he can't do it like me
Ya'll niggas don't wanna know about these
These what? These nuts
In ya mouth, I put em' in your spouse
I put a blunt in her and now she rep the house, nigga
Like so what, we move slow
We get high, when we low
And we chill, and we smoke
It's The House, shut the door
Like so what, we move slow
We get high, when we low
We just chill, and we smoke
It's The House, close the door
And it go like
[House bitch, that trill shit
Hearse verse, I kill shit
South bitch, I still sip, that purp purp
That purp purp]
Like like, what the fuck do you mean? Like
Like, what the fuck you even implying?
The House be the team bitch
You ol' hoe know that, but we don't even pay her no mind
When she come around with her little dirty ass nigga
Bitch I'm YGTUTHey McFly, hey McFly, hey McFly, hey McFly

        Nigga
Black Metaphor
I don't see nuthin' but the fuckin' money
I keep my circle small and my holster with minimum
Basic hoes turn up they noses 'cause I done fucked
Three out of the four makin' poses 
A certain talent, prince in my palace, call me Aladdin
My hunger bought me a sandwich and a couple of napkins
And we don't fuck we just watch movies and be playin' Madden
S'watch as she nice on the sticks lets make a interception
Wallabes on my feet I left the J's at home
Sittin' in the Range watchin' Home Alone
Real niggas treat a playa like he Al Capone
Rappers pretend too much out on these microphone
I don't talk about shit that I don't know about
I'm so chill, so ease
AK-47 when I sleep 'cause I'm shooting for my dreams so I gotta have that infrared beams
Me and my niggas posted lookin' like a dream team
Spittin' so clean like I'm sippin' Listerine
I told my nigga Tiggi once we drop it's gon' be over
One of the coldest out without a pen and gettin' colder
Still, for real I do this for my niggas that want more than what they got it
Bitches is never gonna stop for a nigga
Whether you like it or not I'm on point like a red dot
Zay, the photographer, need a headshot
This one is for Nicky dem at her hair salon
My man Boomer Wilcox at his barber shop
My nigga Greg makin' cheese at his car wash
And any girl who like me when I hear a drill
Like students away from homes who's families really miss 'em
Man I pray to God nobody's hittin' my sister
She's into lumbajacks so don't be chasin' that wood
And if you chasin' that wood be on the look out for splintas
This for my niggas who don't takeout but cook dinner
And all the bad bitches in clubs drinkin' the liquor
And all the dope boys you'll probably see in there wit' 'em
And every pair of retros out I gotta get 'em
This one for my nigga Zay and my nigga Rob
And my nigga Forty we goin' to the top
You don't believe me lil' silly muhfucka stop
The look of thangs is gon' change like a photoshop
This for my nigga Ant and my nigga Josh
And for them bitches surrounded us in that parking lot
I got  where can I hide a gun at
You worried about me but where the fuck is yo' son at
This for every muhfucka that I'm cool with
And anybody that I ever went to school with
Fuck is you doin', I'm bet I'm doin' it betta
Collage of fuckin' greatness you niggas can say whateva
2AMBitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks 
Aye...uh
Got this bitch named Tar, she let me fuck her in the car
Like Kim Kardashian, she wanna be a Star
Got this bitch named Brittany with big ass titties
But bitches ain't shit cause bitches act Mickey
Got a main bitch but I don't need her
Every time we fuck, I gotta pop a bean first
Hit the purp, then eat that pussy for dessert
It gets worse, just watch when she squirt
I got this bitch who act Sadity
She live in the cities
Every time she hear I got a new bitch, she says she miss me
I'm a thug, got this thug bitch, she stay up in the jungles
Every time we go to Crenshaw Mall, she have a rumble
Got this bitch in the Hoovas, I don't wanna lose her
Ass so fat to measure it, I need a rulaaa
Got this bad bitch that go to North-ridge
She always wear Gucci but she can't afford it
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks 
Take a bitch life, Now it's my life
Need a bitch that can fuck, cook, clean, right
Turn a bitch out, make her lick twice
Yeah, she eat pussy but she don't fuck dikes
Laid in the middle, two Miller Lites
Straight kill a bitch, pop rocks little Sprite
Bam bam, little chubby ass, gooey car
Tell the bitch twinkle, twinkle, come meet a star
I don't Odom, no Lamar
Kind of money make her come out her Leotard
I'm in this bitch like my dick hard
And I shuffle money like playing cards
Uuuuuh
YG tell them bitches wassup, they ready to cut
No, links in my suit, we don't cuff 'em
Straight duck 'em, like Donald
Quack Qwock
I don't even know the sound them bitches make
Cause...
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks 
Old car, new broad
No penis, no broad
Your mans burnt out like a white owl 
White girl we the same color when the lights out!
Mean while, gut the plug on speak out
You might ear your girl voice if you hit redial
Fuck her last night now I'm 
I can't ear what you saying cause my weed loud
Rubber band 'round my money
I got a rubber band 'round my money
Bitch shit, like a horse did it
Got a Porsche just to go with it
Everything gon' go, Imma go get her
One thing that I hate is a broke nigga
Second thing that I hate is a broke hoe
And the motherfucker snitching to the popo
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks 
Look, I like bitches, that's light-skinned
With ah whole a lot of ass, and get right with it
Off a pill, I can probably make her like bitches
Lick, lick it, like a lolli till it's like liquid
These hoochies always talking 'bout, where my dick is
But if it's not in your mouth then get out my business
A nigga real ratchet, I ain't wifing shit
Known to fuck and cut her off, light switches
Uh, now what I get? Money bitch
You look good, but to me you just a bummy bitch
And the funny shit is, you know my other bitch
Met me through her on some under cover lover shit
Goddamn, ain't that your homegirl?
Scandalous bitches, we living in a cold world
That's why I flip 'em, flip 'em like ah zone, girl
And every week I change my number to my phone
Cause...
Bitches ain't shit, but hoes and tricks Poursuivi par tant de filles
Mais celle qu'il me faut me fuit
Et je ne vis que la nuit
J’suis un vampire mon coeur est plus creux que n'importe quel puits
Les autres rappeurs n'ont pas l’niveau c'est fou comme être tout seul sur le trône au sommet m'ennuie
Et je me fais qu'peu d'amis
J'm'enferme et j'endure tout seul ma mélancolie
Mélancolie
Me rend alcoolique
Les yeux estiment le poids
Bras réalisent exploits
Le pauvre crois en l’espoir
J’y arriverai faut y croire, anh !
Elle m'aimait mais elle m’a laissé
J'ai la crainte d'un enfant délaissé
Sous le Jack je suis en train d'm’envoler
Au final partie serait renoncée
Mon pouls est au ralentis
Chassé des miens, on dit qu'j'suis maudit
Cherche la connexion avec Gandhi
Changé par la S dev'nu bandit
"Rester positif" le thème d'ma vie
Acharné pour ce putain d'biff
Je me recueille la nuit sur mon lit
Devant ces batards toujours rester vif, anh !
La vie est un cercle viscieux
Chez moi point d'pitié pour le paresseux
Combien de gens j'ai connu ambitieux
Une pensée pour ces âmes aux cieux
De mes péchés je serai pardonné
De ma vie, j'en serai privé
Poursuivi par tant de filles
Mais celle qu'il me faut me fuit
Et je ne vis que la nuit
J'suis un vampire mon coeur est plus creux que n'importe quel puits
Les autres rappeurs n'ont pas l'niveau c'est fou comme être tout seul sur le trône au sommet m'ennuie
Et je me fais qu'peu d'amis
J'm'enferme et j'endure tout seul ma mélancolie
Je fume mon beudo dans l'benks en attendant que sonne mon heure
La loi de la street est stricte donc pas de place pour la peur
Mes congénaires vivent dans la merde en espérant l'av'nir meilleur
Le sale qu'ils commettent ev'ryday c'est pour faire vivre les leurs
Solo dans mon trou, j'me bats pour faire changer le cour d'mon heure
Faire sortir ma famille qui vit à chaque fois dans la terreur
Ma vie est étrange j'ai l'impression que tout fond comme du beurre
Mais maman me réconforte en disant que je s'rai l'meilleur
Ma mélancolie m'met dans un état
Où l'on peut dire que je ne vis pas
J'existe sans plus, c'est triste en plus
Je pense que j'commence à perdre la foie
Ma foie en l'humain, ma foie en moi même
Foie en les miens, foie en ceux qui m'aiment
Trop d'pensées noires hantent ma mémoire
Et j'sombre, j'me noie dans ces pensées sombres
Mélancolie plus envie de rien
Doutant de tout et même du doute
Meilleur dans l'mal que dans le bien
J'deviens le méchant que l'on redoute
Pourtant j'aime aimer, je hais hair
Mais l'mal qu'j'ai semé viens m'assaillir
L'homme prétend aimer, va te trahir
J'reste le meilleur même dans le pire
J'dois esquiver ceux qui veulent salir
J'tue pour survivre, un vrai vampire
Le mal pour le bien, une mort pour une vie
Méchant pour rien, le sale arrive
Ya !
French kiss entre réel et cauchemar
Face aux faux culs, j'tiens à rester rare
La nuit porte conseil, j'l'écoute jusqu'à tard
La vie c'est triste, Jack me consolera
Ma vie se résume à prendre des antibiotiques
À force d'avoir le biff je soulève des briques 
Mes frères et moi n'approuvont pas leur politique 
Rose est leur vie, sombre est ma vie
Autrement dit, ma vie est mélancolique, bae !
Je fume mon beudo dans l'benks en attendant que sonne mon heure
La loi de la street est stricte donc pas de place pour la peur
Mes congénaires vivent dans la merde en espérant l'av'nir meilleur
Le sale qu'ils commettent ev'ryday c'est pour faire vivre les leurs
Solo dans mon trou, j'me bats pour faire changer le cour d'mon heure
Faire sortir ma famille qui vit à chaque fois dans la terreur
Ma vie est étrange j'ai l'impression que tout fond comme du beurre
Mais maman me réconforte en disant que je s'rai l'meilleur
Poursuivi par tant de filles
Mais celle qu'il me faut me fuit
Et je ne vis que la nuit
J'suis un vampire mon coeur est plus creux que n'importe quel puits
Les autres rappeurs n'ont pas l'niveau c'est fou comme être tout seul sur le trône au sommet m'ennuie
Et je me fais qu'peu d'amis
J'm'enferme et j'endure tout seul ma mélancolie
Ouuhhh ! 
Ma mélancolie
Ma vie est mélancolique
Sombre est ma vie

No it ain't safe out here
Nigga mo' try me, might catch me a case out here
And I'm so southside
We crank that bass 'round here, hoes thirsty they might dehydrate
But we don't save 'round here
They know my name out here, ain't no such thing as fame out here
I end a foul play a nigga got robbed for his watch and a chain out here
But yo' bitch wanna lick me, that's why she came out here
Showing me all of her no-no parts but I never heard her-her say no-no stop
These hoes so strange out here
Fuck in a second I don't think they know that niggas got AIDS out here
But she feel safe 'round here and she still slide on it like its a playground round here
Shit I gotta stay down' round here niggas get laid down 'round here
Sendin muhfuckas to the clock 'round here
And I'm tryna live long when life's short
See I won't stop and ya'll don't start
Ya'll just talkin' I don't bark I'm a animal
If there was another me we would've made it on Noah's ark
And I could still swim in a pool of sharks
No we no play 'round here 
No we no play 'round here 
Keep it pimpin' hoe
Nigga 
Fuck we gon' play with you niggas fo'
Fuck you niggas, nigga 
Pimpin' ass niggas, fuck you mean nigga
Fuck you nigga, fuck you mean nigga 
Right
Bitch, bitchass
Camerino, hoe!
Now we don't play round here
Ya life ain't a thang 'round here
Mama told me if you bold enough to show what you holdin' boy you better bang right here
Stay in ya lane  in my wrist
Pain to ya mane to a stretcher I fear
But I'ma stay grounded I'm mellow my fella
I'm still writin' my raps with loose change
I swear couple friends now dead to these tears I shred
But that don't mean I'm a pussy hoe
If I care at all the loss you got in yo' heart then maybe I would be hoe
It's hard to see me now, would my nigga be proud if I'm turnin' out livin' like I told him when I was younger
I wanna tell my cousin Jammy that I love him dearly
But you live-by or die-by a corner
But I still dream of days, when he was safe
To keep legit yo' bullshit at bay
And keep on tryin' you should be grindin'
Like you wanted yo' tomorrow, yesterday
And Lord knows I want that shit bad 
Time flies and 
And my mind's growin' tired of you 
My gosh that's fire but disguised as a tomb
And Lord knows I'm a wayward sinner
Remember back in the days pops worked like a slave pushed wages to pay our dinners in a world full of lions and thieves
Cryin' to the sky Lord, God why me
Asking why  and I look at my cousin layin' in that casket remind us that niggas ain't playin' round here 
Nah, niggas ain't safe 'round here
And watch your statements niggas the concrete and payments and the graves 'round here
Rap niggas never change 'round here
Glock clouds put us rain out here
Could have your raincoat on  still get sprayed 'round here
Nigga
Bitches

Ze is freaky
Zij wilt naaien maar kinky
Ze zegt kom we maken hoodbabies
Kijk naar me haar ik ben wavey
Pet is schuin en dats voor de pijn
Sip die lean dat is medicijn
Ze zegt me waarom kan je niet met mij zijn
Ik ben toch je type maar i got no type
Ze kan niet geloven het was voor one night
Ik maak der freaky en dat voor one time
Fosa 
Draai een dikke kali kan niet fronten
Vele van die niggas moet ik bonne
Kijk naar me swag is verzonnen
Kijk naar me drip is van Bonne
Ben op je huid net Nivea
Ik facetime die bitch latenight
Ze komt naar me crib voor de speeltuin
Ze zegt dat ik drip dat is no lie
Kijk naar me blik het is noncha
En ik tel af wanneer de bom afgaat
En ik draai wat wanneer me hoofd koef-kaf
Shout out naar me niggers in kraaie
Shout out naar me niggers in G block
Kom op de block maak de block hot
Wayback droeg ik nog G-schock 
Loopey 
Ze is freaky
Zij wilt naaien maar kinky

Ik maak der freaky en dat voor one time
Loopey 
Ze is freaky
Ze sock me dick ik voel tifies
Blind voor die liefde net Stevie
Jeugd van tegenwoordig geen Willie
Klap der ass en ze denkt aan Billy
Jij bent geen slime nigger je bent silly
Alles wat je zegt is cap geen Disney
Ik ben te high
Voel me net een sidney
Ik heb white ja we mening met Brittney
Net als kikkerdril ben met whitney
Zij wilt naaien maar kinky
Twerk op dick doe druk net wintie
Ze zegt kom we maken hoodbaby
Maar ik zet me baby op der tong
Ze zuigt met tifies dus geef haar een stomp
Assie is blond net de wieri van trump
Al me niggers rennen geen forrest gump

Pijp aan me zij en het blaft net een hond
Geef die beat ik eet het laat bot
Verdwijn in flits met me dawgs geen bolt

Ik maak der freaky en dat voor one timeUh
More champagne, more bright lights
I'm addicted to fast cars, shoes, and bad dykes
I'm getting faded while trying to remember last night
Man how can I slow down, when I live such a fast life
I'm sitting in V.I.P, trying to get my mind right
While your bitch rubbin' my back, feeding me 100 lies
But I ain't even trippin' I'mma get me 25"s
That's probably why it's hard for her to look you in the eyes
My circle don't expand, these is my niggas for life
And we be on that House shit, that's what them hoes like
And that's real, young niggas with plans and intentions
Grown man descions, you gon' need a petition to stop us
Matter fact, just watch us
And do the same, never duplicated just replicated
And that's the word
Silly niggas be bout as fake as they chains be
We real niggas you can check us in HD
And I ain't sayin' I'm Biggie, Pac, or Jay-Z
But you fuckin' with a dog, and now you got rabies
I don't see you, my eyes be like Ray's be
I won't be fucked by this music, no rats B
Pause
Laughin' with my niggas in the studio
Chillin' with my niggas and some moody hoes
Chillin' with my niggas and some groupie hoes
And they all smokin', and they all chokin'
We live life but we don't forget the main focus
5 o'clock in the morning, my eyes wide open
Cause life's a party and I still ain't got my piece of cake
So I keep grindin' and nigga that's the main focus
Lemme thank god cause he the reason I'm alive
I gotta get this money, you can see it in my eyes
Yea I just gotta get it, I gotta get paid
Ain't tryna go broke, I done came a long way
So my heater to the sky, I'm still motivated
That may be the reason why these motherfuckers hatin'
But I still gotta get it
Now tell me how you wit it
Shout-out to the women with lipstick and nail polish
Who could care less about what you promised
They could buy they own diamonds
That's understoodJestem czarny jak Zetsu, wszystko czarne jak Zetsu
Ludzie sztuczni jak Zetsu, ja nie zatrzymam się w miejscu
Nie chce być czarny jak Zetsu, muszę to w sobie zmienić
Złagodzić cały ból, znowu umieć się cieszyć
Nikt nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym miał Mangekyou Sharingan
Z problemami tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Nie czuję nic odkąd brata znalazłem na sznurku 
Byłeś moim przyjacielem, dziś się topie w smutku
Odszedłeś ty a przyszły łzy, noszę w sercu blizne 
To co kiedyś mnie cieszyło nie jest już tak bliskie 
Ciągle błądzę i nie tylko w myślach
Chce znowu poczuć szczęście i by to nie była wizja
By to nie była fikcja, muszę ogarnąć ten syf
Sam słyszałeś "Naruto", dalej chce być tutaj kimś
Jak mam kurwa być szczęśliwy jak kolorów już nie widzę
Nie, nie jestem daltonistą, mówię jakie jest to życie
Psychika to zombie, umysłowo jestem dzieckiem
Czemu to co dobre odrzucam jak Shinra Tensei?
Chce odnaleźć szczęście i swoje w życiu miejsce
A jak coś się nie uda to muszę dać z siebie więcej
Nie, nic tu nie jest pustym tekstem 
Bo każdy z tych kawałków napisało za mnie serce
Nikt nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym miał Mangekyou Sharingan
Z problemami tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Odwraca się ode mnie karta ale nigdy kartka 
Mów mi Konan, bo też nimi się otaczam 
Nie myśl, że odpuściłem, dziś na twój głośnik wracam
Mam urwanie głowy, kurwa, jakbym przyjął Lariat
Nie mam już dziewczyny, którą tak mocno kocham 
Częściej niż szczęście bywał niezły wkurw po nocach 
Może jeszcze nam się uda to wszystko naprawić 
W głębi mam rany, których nie uleczy nawet Karin
 Moje serce spowite przez ciemność
Gdzie Ci wszyscy ludzie którzy mieli być tu ze mną?
Ej, a idę samotnie przez piekło
Sam nawet nie wiem kurwa, typie, co się dzieje ze mną
Tak jak Czarny Zetsu chce mieć bliskich znów przy sobie
Lecz nie będę jak on, nie chce zgubić się po drodze 
Nie chce więcej już w lustrze widzieć własnego cienia 
Wiara w siebie podstawą, bo bez tego nic nie ma
Nikt nie chce patrzeć w oczy jakbym miał Mangekyou Sharingan
Z problemami tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja
Tylko ja i ja i ja

Trip to another town 
Tokyo grind 
All in designer's
Others they minors 
Felt like I'm frozen 
Bitch I am the chosen
Pure emotions had the mixed feelings of lovers
And this world's mine and it’s so fine
Let me teach you all the sounds of love
Your emotions and focus I ain't?
Just feelin how you felt when you came
Emotions are beating down on me like rain
Everything's changed, emotions elevated
When I was 11 got the toolie thick
My emotions came out expressly, she’s so fly
Pure emotions had the mixed feelings of lovers
And this world's mine and It’s so fine
Let me teach you all the sounds of love
Your emotions and focus I ain't?
Just feelin how you felt when you came
Emotions are beating down on me like rain
Everything's changed, emotions elevated
When i was 11 got the toolie thick
My emotions came out expressly, she’s so fly
What yo name is girl let me tell you mine
The world is mine so I'ma take my time
Soft white the art I twine
The championship is still mine Is it these keys of mine?
Oh, I was raised by the stop sign
Outstanding clout, what up greg street
Your flow is wack ye mine is concrete
 YGA John
Yeah I'm broken
Not alive
Spittin' fire
I'm a dead star, I'm a dead star, dead star
Listening to lies

Hating on the time
That's why
Feelin' like I am alone
Got nobody by my side

So fly, not alive

Projects youve made so far. WHich one is your favorite?

Aned: Is taht a joke?
YGOD: I dont joke
Aned: that record is straight trash. can't even listen to that shit
YGOD: ill have you fucking know that Fruitloops is the most infulential
Mixtape ever released in rap. you understand me? everybody biting
My style. they can't be y dizzle
Aned: I dont agree with that
YGOD: I dont agree with your life
*gun shots*
Passionate, i rap with the galaxy up above my head
Waiting on my tape like clay jensen, but no ones dead
Yet, at least, im just making bread
Kendrick got me saying damn, carti make the figures flex
Trump dropping bombs like mother fucking funk flex
World gone to shit, world war 3 thats whats next
So i undress my conscious, spilling out into citadels
Now every city well is filled I wish em well
Who is better than me, not many that ive seen
This all american badass living his dream
Album sales start to rocket once cover becomes a meme
What about the lyrics, is it too much to sit and read
Is it a lost art, us talking about our miseries
Almost like a minister the way i deliver these scenes
So divine, in time for the downfall of the deputy
Ain't nobody messing with my recipe
I, been resting in peace, so you should let me be
Kinda like a canary, yellow as melodies
I see color in music, colorful beats
One for the city, one for the streets
You motherfuckers salty, so i keep it sweet
You should all just keep it clean
Dj khaled with the coconut dove, snapchatting
Wrapping the competition, i black out the opposition
Everytime i drop i swear i started a new religion
Bumping that new edition, probably am addicited
I could rap for years, and never appear to be in bad condition
I believe in magic, your majesty, who be asking me
There whole existence is but a tragedy, i ain't having it
I happened to relapse in the nastiest, look like last of us
Zombies, you know what i mean
But back to the bars, a recovering alcoholic
I shouldn't be here, but it feels so good
I couldn't stop it
Running through cities, im ducking police
And i try to believe that i might just receive
The answers to everything that i would need
This music just happens to be why i breathe
I did this shit for the sqad on h h h
Reevaluate everything i say
This is for andy, thug, ike, k l j
Slamming and mingus, we on plug d j
I happened to release fruitloops and cocaine
On a sunny day, i was bored out my brain
Typed in bass boosted beats on youtube
Freestyled and just made a tape
Then i made ps2, that shit was great
Soulfish was born, i slept tight in my grave
Then i made castle and that was insane
Poured my heart out but they couldn't relate
To edgy, im sipping on henny, like every day, but you know that im straight
Then i dropped cole sprouse, thought i was gay
Well bitch i am, what did i say
I am the greatest to do this okay
Spitting im flicking these writtens, yeah i am a dog, no i am not kitten
I am a villain, built to be killing
I am not vicous no i am delicious, just need a bitch that gon tell me i did it
I came from the bottom, i dug out the ditches, like shia labeouf, before he
Was on even
Thats steven, got eagle eyes looking at people, im always alert
Ever since birth, was destined to hurt, destined to flirt
I came from the dirt, i came from the church
Cause i am a god, i ascended off earth
Theres love in the skies, the ground is a curse
Probably soon ill be driving a hearse
Or in the back so you know that its worse
So you know that i know that i dont even know, woah
This is the shit that i live, for
I did this shit as a joke too
Thinking ygod is a hoax too
Im just doing what im supposed to
Gotta deliver my rhetoric, telling the people, that i will be shredding it
Master of puppets, yeah i am beheading the government, everyone
Running for president
So i am running, thats y god for president, i will be winning whenever
Election is
This is for everyone that ever doubted me, i am the best to ever step a foot
In it
I got my eyes on the target, thats drizzy thats k dot, that j cole, thats bobby
Thats jigga, thats kanye, thats nas and thats frankie, thats all the above
Imma kill everyone
Passion, in my bones
I can see it clearly
I CAN FEEL IT
I CAN FEEL IT
LOST IN THE WORLD, IM LOST IN THE WORLD
SCREAMING WHY GOD
WHY AM I HERECashMoneyAP
Devil keep tryna take my soul but nigga I ain't going

Comin' for all y'all necks, I'm puttin' you pussy boys on notice
Yeah, nigga, yeah
'Bout to run it up, let's get the bucks my nigga, we on it
Counted a couple G's this morning
Next to a chick with double D's on her
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, nigga, yeah
She say it's way too hot in Follies and it's still snowing
Fuck out my face, talkin' that ra-ra shit, nigga
Giving these niggas grace, you better thank God lil nigga
Who you think you playin' wit'? You better think hard lil nigga
Think this shit a game? We got a all-star team with us
People gon' know my name like it's a name tag on nigga
Flyer than a plane in this off-white cream linen
You ain't seen a thing, shit I'm 'bout to get more ignant
Niggas love to hate, they got so pissed when I shitted
Yeah, baby don't know my name, she know my face and yeah she wit' it
I might hit it then I ditch it, send that bitch into the abyss
She think I'm a hubby and I think that we ain't nothin'
Baby, we just buddies, tell me why the fuck you buggin'?
Pulled up in a coupe, we was just riding in a bucket
Made it from the bottom, shit was not sunny on ducat
Got a lot of problems that cannot be solved with money
Rockin' yellow gold chains on, lookin' like 
Devil keep tryna take my soul but nigga I ain't going
Nigga just way too solid, that's why I can't be broke
Comin' for all y'all necks, I'm puttin' you pussy boys on notice
Yeah, nigga, yeah
'Bout to run it up, let's get the bucks my nigga, we on it
Counted a couple G's this morning
Next to a chick with double D's on her
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, nigga, yeah
She say it's way too hot in Follies and it's still snowing
Fuck out my face, I do what I want and nigga you no one
Keep the pace, I can't slow up, just wait we gon' blow up
I'm changing the game, remaining the same, on the way in and out
I gotta make it count, they tryna break me down
Still undefeated, I make it look easy, I'm winnin' in all that
Niggas offended, and all that
Y'all ain't contenders, so fall back
Thought we got rid of 'em,  and look at 'em, they all back
New bitch is white but her car black, call me but I never call
I gotta shake somethin', gotta keep the cake comin'
Bake somethin', smoke all in your face, buddy
Always got it, I ain't gotta take nothin'
Cash on the beat, tell him keep the bass thumpin'
Spazz on the beat, leave a nigga face scrunchy
Beat the case like a dad with a bad temper
Tried to tell her I ain't nothin' like her last nigga
Out here lookin' for the bag like it's lost luggage
Devil keep tryna take my soul but nigga I ain't going
Nigga just way too solid, that's why I can't be broke
Comin' for all y'all necks, I'm puttin' you pussy boys on notice
Yeah, nigga, yeah
'Bout to run it up, let's get the bucks my nigga, we on it
Counted a couple G's this morning
Next to a chick with double D's on her
Ayy-ayy, ayy-ayy, nigga, yeah
She say it's way too hot in Follies and it's still snowingOhh nigga, I like this shit
And yo bitch got
Moist ass armpits
I'm amazing, nigga I'm amazing
Shit, ya'll just been sleepin' on me like a Days Inn
Shit I be hotter than some Cajun on occasions
Catch me ridin' through yo city, sittin' on them Daytons
Ya'll can't see me, but I'm beefin' it up right now
I'm Clark Kent, witta big dick, and I still refuse to save a hoe
Just thought I'd let you know, paper like an envelope
Ridin' through your city, hear me beatin' like a stethoscope
Tint so dark, can't even see me through your telescope
Yea I know, ya'll be full of shit, I smell it on your breath
Get some scope, or some listerine, that'll probably help
Yea I'm wrong, I just fuck her right, then after that I left
Walkin' puttin' on my pants, shit I just fell down the steps
Fuck it though, playas fuck up too, lets just keep it movin
Niggas cops, out investigating, but these niggas clueless
Spittin' mucus, that's how sick I'm is, bitches extra stupid
Ashy dick, gotta bad bitch, get em' out the movie
Get her wet, and I'm skinny dippin' where a swimmin' pool is
In conclusion, I'm the coolest nigga, higher than your roof is
Stop playin' hoe, you know I'm that nigga pourin' E&J, bumpin' UGK
Yea niggaNigga, nigga
Yeah, what
Yeah
Okay, I talk it, I lived it, I did it, I got it, and spent it
I blew it, finessed it, and flipped it
They gon' feel this from the North, South, East, West
Get it, get it, get it
Hoe, don't try to question, I'm a legend, this ain't for debate
All these bitches want the BAPE, love the way I serenade
Carhartt jacket with my Carhartt T-shirt, gotta coordinate
Go hard, I got no heart for these bitches and I ain't ashamed
Had to get the game in order, I was tryna reach a quota
Riding, tryna hide the odor, cops is just around the corner
Had to talk about the phony, wise man was talkin' to me
Said, "Niggas fold like some bitches"
And that's what the preacher told me
Aw shit, aw shit, y'all niggas makin' me nauseous
Countin' my money, you watchin'
Nigga, tell me why you all in my pocket?
Real life, ain't no more fantasizin', I gotta tell it like it is
'Cause the realest niggas do the most fuck shit
Better never forget, true shit to the fake real
Okay, I talk it, I lived it, I did it, I got it, and spent it
I blew it, finessed it, and flipped it
They gon' feel this from the North, South, East, West
Get it, get it, get it
Okay, I talk it, I lived it, I did it, I got it, and spent it
I blew it, finessed it, and flipped it
They gon' feel this from the North, South, East, West
Get it, get it, get it
Okay, I'm talkin' on a hands free, got a bottle of that bubbly
Blunt between my hands, I'm slidin' if you lookin' for me
Your bitch want a chance, she wanna suck me like a Slushie
Damn, that girl is nasty, if she fuck me then she lucky
Leave her in the past-y
Tryna bump it up and we went from ashy to classy
Middle fingers up, I know you niggas thought you had me
We ain't givin' up, the coupe I'm in ain't got a backseat
Now we movin' up, I'm proud of us, they doubted us
They tried dividin' us, we had to fight, that was a must
No coward in my blood, I'll be a'ight, you know I'm tough
Lil' bitch you know I'm TUT, I dig a diamond out the mud
This shit ain't over until we won
Okay, I talk it, I lived it, I did it, I got it, and spent it
I blew it, finessed it, and flipped it
They gon' feel this from the North, South, East, West
Get it, get it, get it
Okay, I talk it, I lived it, I did it, I got it, and spent it

What a week
All I really want is some muhfuckin' cheese
All I really want is
 by popular demand, demandin' whatever I want with a gun in my hand
It's seems as if niggas is losin' they souls, havin' a hard time controlling they hoes
Know when to stay when there's traffic at night
Young niggas bringin' they guns to the fight
Not even drivin' they still ridin' on bikes
Wantin' some ice, that shit warp your life
Bro you for pieces, I pray for my foes
We all got hopes and they all got jokes
We look like money and they look like hoes
I got so high that I can't-My mind is such a mess
Can't seen to get this aching pain off my chest
From the amount of medications that i injest you can say im no different from the rest
Diagnose me and say that im obsessed
But its not my fault that im depressed
You can say im a pest, you can say that i infest
Digest
Need rest
Not getting better i confess
And the pills i take just make me dizzy
Can't take blame when the room is spinning
Always wanna let all the pain sting freely
Until then... Im just dreaming

У-у-у-у-уDont lie, girl
Show me love

In this big town that we come from
Everybody want some off that rush
That only you provide
Girl let's go for a ride
So I can make you just forget about your mother, guss
Hold up I'm back again
Fell in love like an accident
Pulling up, parked three cribs down
Cause you ain't tell your mom dad I'm in town
Front door you be sneaking out
Got me feeling like I need you now
That's your mom looking out the window
Too late we leaving now
Up in my four door
You know
Your love made me go loco
And they know your sirip go so small like it's the halo
She from the block like JLO
She made me think I gotta lay low
She's so bad, should be illegal
Made me think I gotta lay low
She my bae tho
Hollywood dreaming in LA tho
That's where I'ma take her
I'ma do it 'cause I say so
Dont lie, girl

Girl let's go for a ride
So I can make you just forget about your mother, guss
I can't find the time
You can't find the time
Maybe we should quit joking
I can't stay the same
I can't play your game
I am fresh out of tokens
I would follow you to hell and back
But lately, I don't know where you're going
It's a different direction
I don't understand it
Giving my emotions or take it for granted 
Looking at life through some window bars
Looking at life like you won't get far Yo, 2017, yeah? To the world and back
Sididididaint-d-daint-d-daint
Sididididaint-d-daint-d-daint-daint-daint
Oh, oh, Sidi or Saint
2017 and it's still about cake
Tryna really get paid, had my belly on red
So I was north of the west frontline dishing out Hayes
Difficult days, tryna make my name spread
Doing features, giving out eighths
Oh yeah, Sidi got game
Gyal are like "Saint? That's a brilliant name"
I just give her willy in face
And I ghostwrite off like MIK
See what I mean? I paint pics like William Blake
Ride for mine like Lily and James
Flow wiz like Sirius Black
Back from my mission, Samurai Sididaint Jack on the case
This time round, no delays
Gyal want me round theirs, I figured about eight
Now I've got gyal on my case 'cause I hit her back late
Gyal want me for their man, I told them "behave"
Take gyal from their man and led kittens astray
Pepper on tunes like the bit on my steak
Chef, I need to eat, come fill up my plate
I'm in and out safely, blue or dark navy
Wavy like navy, money like JAY Z
J-A wealthy, Jah keep me healthy
You ain't got the same sheet, tryna be cakey
OK, know man are out for the cake
YGG, we graft for them papers
Bring money in daily, sunny or rain
Man are gonna stunt on all a man's haters
And we want the full cream made
Skim off the top like milk or shavers
We're tryna get Ps so we can do this
On a regular ting, blud, I wanna be caking
It's a birthday ting and I wanna be caking
Belly all fat, never sick of that icing
Touch the mic and I get to rhyming
Way too cold, icy like frosting
Come against me? Then you must've lost it
King Yosho on the mic, I'll murk him
I've been training hard in the mountain
You would've thought that I do Shaolin
You man are shit, I don't understand it
X man out real quick like Gambit
Us man are chasing Ps and chasing dreams while
You man chat bare shit and gossip
Man wanna ask me, "what's the topic?"
YGG to the world, can't stop it
Flows are out of the world like rocket
Dead MCs get sent into orbit
Man wanna take my flow and use it
What a wasteman, you should wear that corset
You don't wanna see Strally in the night
And you don't wanna see PK in the morning
Open your eyes, it's hard to recognise
Got a mask on my face, I am the Hobgoblin
Here for your cake so you best stop snoring
Bad Ombré when I enter your kitchen
OK, know man are out for the cake
YGG, we graft for them papers
Bring money in daily, sunny or rain
Man are gonna stunt on all a man's haters
And we want the full cream made
Skim off the top like milk or shavers
We're tryna get Ps so we can do this
On a regular ting, blud, I wanna be caking
I said I'm tryna be caking
Even though I'm lazy like Shikamaru
It's just cuh I'm always baking
I'm Gordon in the kitchen, it's flaming
 Tryna get a slice like pizza
 Give me the cheese, I'll grate it
Save my money like I'm Swiss or Asian
Tryna get hard dough like I'm Jamaican
Mmm
I ain't a flour man but you know I'm self-raising
Always in the box like raisins
Strally in the mix like batter in a basin
You don't wanna get battered, I'll chase him
Mek a man run like Asics trainers
Babycakes, her cake is amazing
Girl give me cake, I don't chase it
Tryna get a babycakes
But I won't chase them like lazy jakes
I'm tryna be caked in cake
So I played my cards right like Crazy Eight
I'm tryna get cake and bread

And we ain't taking cheques
We're three of a kind, no baby steps
OK, know man are out for the cake
YGG, we graft for them papers
Bring money in daily, sunny or rain
Man are gonna stunt on all a man's haters

Ey Chris, roll up another blunt
I'm a shine on these niggas, drug dealers in the pen drop a dime on these niggas
Totin' 9 on these niggas don't make 'em have to get outta line on a nigga
I look in the mirror, I figure, a nigga just gotta get paid
She out there sellin' that pussy she tryna get made
My uncle back home every time he drive a car, that nigga break the law
My bitch at the crib she just wanted me to come and get up in them drawers
I say take it easy baby I ain't in love
I guess it's paranoia of commitment, I resist it by fillin' her with drugs
My ego too big and her titties too little
She say she love me, I just sit back and giggle
Like why you blame me, because I'm tryna ball and if I take you to the mall that's gon' be a double dribble
That's when she sat back and started thinkin' about it
Then I told her I'll probably scribble a rap about it
And then I sat back and I started thinkin' about it and I say you know what though I don't even write doe
Nigga at the house say we all gettin' paid doe, nigga jack flows they should call yo ass jay flow
I done started gettin' calls from these labels
Funny out here, LA, in the shade doe
I can go in a bear cave with a switchblade and come back out with a muthafuckin' fur coat

Big Box. Wal-Mart, when you're in it, is total - a closed system, a world unto itself. I get
a chill when I'm watching TV in the break room one afternoon and see ... a commercial
for Wal-Mart. When a Wal-Mart shows up within a television within a Wal-Mart, you
have to question the existence of an outer world. Sure, you can drive for five minutes and
get somewhere else-to Kmart, that is, or Home Depot, or Target, or Burger King, or
Wendy's, or KFC. Wherever you look, there is no alternative to the megascale corporate
order, from which every form of local creativity and initiative has been abolished by
distant home offices. Even the woods and the meadows have been stripped of disorderly
life forms and forced into a uniform made of concrete. What you see-highways, parking
lots, stores-is all there is, or all that's left to us here in the reign of globalized, totalized,
paved-over, corporatized everything. I like to read the labels to find out where the
clothing we sell is made-Indonesia, Mexico, Turkey, the Philippines, South Korea, Sri
Lanka, Brazil-but the labels serve only to remind me that none of these places is "exotic"
anymore, that they've all been eaten by the great blind profit-making global machine.
The only thing to do is ask: Why do you - why do we - work here? Why do you stay? So
when Isabelle praises my work a second time , I take the opportunity to say I really
appreciate her encouragement, but I can't afford to live on $7 an hour, and how does she
do it? The answer is that she lives with her grown daughter, who also works, plus the fact
that she's worked here two years, during which her pay has shot up to $7.75 an hour. She
counsels patience: it could happen to me. Melissa, who has the advantage of a working
husband, says, "Well, it's a job." Yes, she made twice as much when she was a waitress
but that place closed down and at her age she's never going to be hired at a high-tip place.
I recognize the inertia, the unwillingness to start up with the apps and the interviews and
the drug tests again. She thinks she should give it a year. A year? I tell her I'm wondering
whether I should give it another week.Super

Send for us? You must be on dizzle 
Or you must want lava
In Vauxhall, they can hold fire 
Can't grab the mic, you're too marga 
Likkle man shoulda tried harder 
Dem man that you stole bars from
Should send an invoice and charge ya
John Wayne flow, manna let off the la la 
Someone died
Gunshots right outside
Your father, he's dead
I see him in my head
You're just an imposter
Wanna be my son, you're a foster
G-checked you last when I saw you
Now I gotta send you to the doctor
That's lead and copper
If not then I'm gonna bore ya
Don't bother call Logan Sama
Now man's callin' jakes like his manager 
Now I'll have to expose ya
When you got rejected by Tia
Likkle man thought he was gonna "hmm hmm"
She told me you're cheesy like pizza 
You don't write your own bars
Kill you, then kill your ghostwriter
When the fans look back on the YouTube
They will see that you have no future
Stealing bars, you have no future
Smash your head on the computer
Acting up like Bradley Cooper
Your head-top's gonna get hung over
Stealing bars, you have no future
Smash your head on the computer
Acting up like Bradley Cooper
Your head-top's gonna get hung over
Someone died
Gunshots right outside
Your father, he's dead
I see him in my head
Yo, I was like, 'Okay boomer'
Keep up the talk on computer
Call him a him but he looks like a cat
Is that why you smell like tuna? 
Ya little liar
Who wrote that, what, Syer?
Got the cold shoulder by Eskimo
Did you cry then when I walked by ya?
Wet youts get smoked like vapour
And your manager, the likkle side-eyer
Why do you talk facing the exit?
Lookin' back like your runnin' from fire 
Send for the sire
End up in the flowers, not a flyer 
You're a biter
Not a rider or a writer
Someone died
Gunshots right outside
Your father, he's dead
I see him in my head
Can't try send for the top crew
Movin' loose, fam, your head's not screwed
I slew wastemen 'cause I got to
Don't wanna see me get rough on my rider
I got bark like DMX dogs do 
We might let the dogs out
I don't know how these kittens got through
Call man Felix, everyone mocks you
Get him some IAMS
Can't try eat the big dog food
Sayin' stuff they won't back up
I recommend your manager stops you 
All of your nine lives done
You'll be on the edge of tomorrow like Tom Cruise 
Probably swears at his mum
Father's dead, that's why you're a lost youtCause I'm a baller that show no shame!
"Young G, about to set the fuckin record straight"
Once upon a time, in the place to be
On the darkside of the C-P-T
There lived a Young G, rollin weed and smog
To make the story interesting it's me, the Top Dogg
 I lived in a shack with my O.G. dad
And two big homies, who treated me bad
I cooked, and cleaned, and scrubbed the floors
And I was like an errand boy runnin to the liquor store
The homies, they used to boast and brag:
"We got Chucks, and khakis that sag!"
Even worse than that, to make me feel low
They used to have me smoke stress, while they had indo
The girls used to say, "D, you're so cute
But you gets no rap with them bell bottom suits"
Well, one day, on the Avenue
There was a man, surrounded by the Compton crew
He said, "Hear ye! Hear ye! Come one, come all!
The princess is having a royal ball
If you can rap, also dress fresh
You might win a date with the ghetto princess"
Well I, ran home when I heard the whole speech
Bust through the door, straight to my O.G
And I said, "O.G., may I?"
And before I could finish, "Hell no!", he replied 
I got so mad, mad enough to blast
Even Pops was aimin for a piece of that ass 
They haunted, they flaunted, they knew what I wanted
"We gon' get some hoochies," that's what they taunted
They laughed and joked; they hated on me
They didn't wanna see me fuckin up the M-I-C
So they left the crib, with a smile on they face
And as they stepped out they said, "Clean up this place!"
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Now I'm standin all alone, I just got dissed
I'd smoke them all if I had one wish
But before I make my thought a phrase
There appeared the G in a puff of haze
He said, "What's up, Dogg? My name is Suge
I'm your gangsta Godfather, it's all to the good
Now I came here with the main purpose
Of grantin you your fondest wish"
I said, "Suge, what's poppin dogg?  Just put me down with the Row
And I know that I can handle these hoes fo' sho'"
He waved a Cuban cigar, and before you know
My sacks of stress was an ounce of indo
My clothes transformed from rags to silk suits
And he transformed my hoopt' into a Lex Coupe
"But you must rock the mic by stroke of twelve
Or you'll turn back into your old self"
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Well I hit the hoochie ball at eleven o'clock
Too flossy for the princess so she started to jock
I got to the party 'bout ten, I'd say
Hit the stage enraged and I started to rock
By eleven thirty-five, I was all in the cock 
All my homies was amazed that the bitch was mines
So I swooped to the Coupe at eleven fifty-nine
This story doesn't end with no fuckin glass shoes
All was left on the step was the rubber that I used
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
 Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Cindafella! .. Cindafella! ..
.. .. Cause I'm a baller that show no shame!
Cindafella! .. Cindafella! ..
.. .. Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella! .. show no shame!
Cindafella plays the game!
Cindafella! Cindafella plays the game!Hey McFly, hey McFly, hey McFly, hey McFly
Uh, better recognize when you see me
You lookin' at an explosive, blowin' up like I told you
I'ma wreck the game its totaled
Seen a lot of snakes straight cobras
They won't hesitate to switch on ya
I don't ever sleep like insomnia 
Hol' up roadside not the engine
I'ma wreck the game its totaled
You lookin' at a explosive, blowin' up like I told you
Seen a lot of snakes straight cobras
I don't ever sleep like insomnia
It's like 3 or 4 in the mornin'
Bitches shakin' asses like sodas
Damn I heard a nigga died the other day 
Robbed a man then he tried to run away 
Shot his ass he hopped up in a getaway 
Finally passed and crashed about a block away 
I can't believe another victim to these streets 
This world is cold they leave these niggas full of heat
Sunday mornin' I'm at church with all the cheese 
Pistols on em 'case a nigga try to creep 
Livin' life just tryna duck and dodge police 
I can't fake the floss with nothin' on my life 
Get it right while you just out here live and try 
Gotta check my pockets wanna dap you up
I don't trust you 'cause you too shiesty
See me shinin' light lightning
Bend the corner and I turn right
Stuff the backwood 'till the bird right
About a check just like Phil Knight
Beat the beat until it feel right
Stick and move on 'em
Stick and move on 'em
Stick and move on 'em
We just tryna make it happen, stuffin' money in the mattress
Bouncin' back just like elastic
Always ready for the static
Stick and move on 'em
Stick and move on 'em
Stick and move on 'em
It's niggas ridin' through the city they just lookin' for a come up
You look like a pretty penny guaranteed them niggas run up
Wanna go and see some titties at the strip club with my brothers
Just might sip a 'lil Henny just might spend a couple hunnids
Uh, stretch yo' fist you fantastic
Comin' through the do' blastin'
Spittin' fire like a dragon
Niggas on the block gamble
Man hit 'em with a 7
Take yo' money or what's left of it
Then flip it like a pop shove it
Hella money big knots of it
Niggas plottin' damn I think these niggas plottin'
Make K go out like a bitch that ain't no option 
Up on niggas so they mad they tried to rob him 
He brought his pistol at the crib that Waka Flocka 
We just tryna make it happen, stuffin' money in the mattress

God knows I've been hella patient 
Striving for love and the greatness 
Many downs, but moved up 
Hadn't baptized, messed up
Life ain't good but it seems dope
Strive for love, guess I got hope
Climbing ladders like a steep slope
Life ain't dope but I can cope
Always clean never dropping soap
Never catch me out selling dope
Falling out of line, got rope
Heading forward got a good role
God always showers me with hope 
Lowkey rapper but I never gloat 
On a rise from a kid bro 
Till I reach the fucking title goat 
Backyard with 'em Palm trees
On a Sunday night with the cool breeze
Ice on my sleeve, I never freeze 
Camera shy I don't say cheese
Stay woke boy I never sleep 
Stay woke boy I never sleep 
Stay woke boy I never sleep 
Lil kid on the come up
God knows I've been hella patient 
Striving for love and the greatness 
Passion hungry as I wake up 
At the bottom though I'm aiming up
Craft blowing in stu'
Indigenous, check my roots
People leave you when you grinding
Then they show up when you shinning
'Member when my friends doubted me
Got the same numbers, now calling me
Lamborghini with that golden bull
Tryna make my life affordable
Never lie
Facts ain't questionable 
Never high fuck 'em edibles
Future in this game, I'm capable 
I murdered the beat, responsible
Star gazing in a wraith
Never sinning all I do is pray 
Thank my God everyday I pray 
I Hunt my goals like they seasoned prey 
I'm on the rise watch me come and play 
I'm on the rise watch me come and play 
I'm on the rise watch me come and play 
Lil kid on the come up
God knows I've been hella patient 
Striving for love and the greatness 
Black skin am I full of sin? 
Always faded I don't a gin
Money dormant, fuck a male purse
Making moves, while they plot a curse
Untouchable as I read a verse
Body niggas I brought through a hearse
She digging me with no spade and shovel
On a level with 'em new devils Stay woke please don't press snooze
Always lit I don't booze
Always lit I don't booze
Give me the spot, I won't refuse 
Passion's my drug, I overuse
I'm the plug can you see the fuse
Chase this dream like a marathon 
Heard you lost yourself, check the Amazon 
Pop no Xannies, I don't need none 
Upper echelon, I'm the chosen one

I hate when you niggas keep asking me questions like I don't know you what the fuck is you rapping?
How 'bout the cap like a fuck when I'm buzzin'
Right before that they gon' think they start coming
You wanna kill, you just shoot in the air
Everyone scramble the blood on this earth
That nigga wanna be gangsta so bad
'till you get caught with a strap and a perc
You wanna kill me, I'd like you to try
Whatever happens to me on this earth
These niggas talk they belong in the circus
They act humble, when she give rack they get nervous
She need some dick then I could be a service
She need some guala I could be of service

If I hear you snapping, cracking a poppin'  pot 
Sorry lil' bitch boys getting insta-kill cuz I brag a lot!

Mackin' your honey, I know that she yearnin'
Might give it to her, I think she deserve it

Meant every word if I said that, shooting 2 birds at these rap cats
These niggas magicians, it's all an illusion
If you really got it then prove it
I hope you don't do nothing stupid
Like blow all your money on jewelry
This game really funny, it's kinda amusing
But I just stick to this music
And I'ma just stick to this money
I wonder how niggas broke rocking Gucci

Young niggas tryna get rich, on a road, taking these trips
On a road making these hits, nigga this the life I live
Nigga this the life I chose, gamble with the dice I roll
A nigga used to live with roaches
They scramble when the lights come on
I'm the man when I come back home
Like a dad in his own household
I'ma rep The House fo'sho, stickin' to the code fo'sho
Uh, back and I'm flossing, you wondering what did it cost me

Falaram da tropa mas nós estamos a living
Convívio na Lisa já sabem we did it
Com a baby é problema levamos a Minnie
Vês que eu sou bué chato meu nome é Nirvana
Com essas vagabas estou a cortar confiança
Se tu rires comigo parto para arrogância
Pudera sou um jovem clean com elegância
Babys estão a cola e um gajo dá o go
Fuck para essa baby só que fazer blow
Não ando em bolão só me vês on the low
Cristais no meu pulso refletem com sol
Nigga I got the drip, estou com sinusite
Barra mas ela implora para ser kit
5 minutos depois faço o switch
Meu tempo tá еscasso sem tempo pra ti, ok
Olha para o Pablo a viver tipo Pablo
Mеus niggas nas calmas
Teus niggas a hating
Niggas só falam
E eu estou relaxado
Por isso vos cago conforto nos ténis
Não falo muito só me vês calado
Não estou preocupado
E eu estou Lukeny
De tanto ser calmo
Pensam que sou armado
Se queres a minha voz
Não há cash então esquece
Estou com o Sandão então manda vir mais baes
Para além de faca também tem talheres
Bolsos pesados tropa making rain
Se não percebeste fazemos chover
Aqui está muito seco
Make it rain 
Foca na minha drip
Mas larga o chain 
Não quero problemas
Quero a bag 
Meus wis são bue caros
Isso não é cap 
Sem tempo de gay 
Já tenho a minha bae 
Dia não mata dia
Então levo damas alheias
Mesmo assim estou a gastar recks 
Nigga sempre a flex 
Não curto de nike
Mas na baby dele dou o check 
Preto e branco designer tipo sou um panda
O que tenho é gelo  mas se quiseres algo chama
Muitos mandam halla mas eu já não dou confiança
Falo com os vosso cotas não beefo com essas crianças
Nigga tamos a making rain
Bolsos pesados
Off white no peito
Tou farto da banda
Vais me encontrar em Spain
CP na lisa
Nirvana em Paris
Não tenta com a tropa
Fica na tua lane
Seu bitch 
Só me viu na party ficou kit 
Mesmo sem corona tu sabes meu mano
Que a tropa aqui nós somos sick 
Nigga estou a rolling com o Tigas num carro alemão
Esses niggas são bolos mas só querem pão
Eu sou do tipo que pega a tua bae depois
Te mando foto chamam brincalhão
Mano não esquece nós estamos a chover 
Muito drip a cair do jacket da Moncler 
Polo é da gucci tou a brincar com a coochie
Depois estou com o Pablo são kems de LV
Chuva de money, money no meu bolso, gasto novos shoes, nem me faz diferença
I got ur honey, honey bebeu leite no final de tudo curtiu da cabeça
Tipo arrogância está bem no meu máximo, cara trancada, fala só com o wrist
Call for the priest, roll com sace numa faca fast, não confunde Range espeta drift
Make it rain, na minha conta é javardo
Larga o chain,o meu drip é exagerado
Feel the pain, damo dela está chateado
Meti a baga na bih, agora está andar tipo pato
Arrogância a 300, emoji está tipo num caga
We’re living good, sempre a moving de casa
Minha vida de pablo sempre a getting paca
Nigga make it rain, niguém aqui canta farsa mother* hum
Aqui está muito seco
Make it rain 
Foca na minha drip
Mas larga o chain 
Não quero problemas
Quero a bag 
Meus wis são bue caros
Isso não é cap 
Sem tempo de gay 
Já tenho a minha bae 
Dia não mata dia
Então levo damas alheias
Mesmo assim estou a gastar recks 
Nigga sempre a flex 
Não curto de nike
Mas na baby dele dou o check I've been feeling high tonight

The sky be the limit, I'm grinding off henny
YGF niggas stay silent, you mimic
Why you still trying when we see you don't fit in
Mami want me to be zaddy
A freak in the sheets yes she still call me asking
Big tyme niggas I'm laughing
You wanna play the fence
I just wanna see a mansion
Cold heart, niggas don't chance him
When I step in the place
Niggas screaming out the man here
Paid in full, look I manage
F**k ya'll thought I've been chancing
Ive been on road since my niggas got locked
Dealt with a whole lotta pain, difference is I bounce back
She wanted the most only down fall was her talking
I had to cut her off just as soon as the bitch walked inDrummin' on niggas, I come with the sticks
And if you talkin' shit, then you gonna get hit
I don't trust a bitch 'cause they swear that they loyal
But fuck for the money and think that they slick
Baby, I got me a check like I'm Nike
But if you don't like me, then you can come fight me
Bitch, I'm an animal, came out the zoo
And you niggas be wipin' your nose, but ain't slimy
Feel like I'm hard or somethin'
Bro, I ain't talkin' 'bout no drummers, uh
Drummin' on niggas, I come with the sticks
And if you talkin' shit, then you gonna get hit
I don't trust a bitch 'cause they swear that they loyal
But fuck for the money and think that they slick
Baby, I got me a check like I'm Nike
But if you don't like me, then you can come fight me
Bitch, I'm an animal, came out the zoo
And you niggas be wipin' your nose, but ain't slimy
Back in my hood, if you pussy
You gonna get your back door hit, then robbin' your shit
Say she a keep it and love you to death
But she stay in my house just to suck on my dick
How in the hell you be neighborhood rollin'
But you never ever hung out with a Crip?
Raised in the 8, bet I came to the roll
Man, this shit is too late, I might fuck 'round and dip
Draggin' these bodies inside of the hall
I swear, my nigga, I'd probably say that all
All of my niggas on go
So if you act funny, then I just gotta make a call
M17 with a dick on my lap
I just might catch a body, that's just how I'm feelin'
Why for the youngins? The G 'cause I'm G
And the beat 'cause we bashin', my niggas be killin' it
My niggas stay packed like we all on a stroller
I swear that I'm hot, but my flow gettin' colder
She suck on my meat, it get hard like a boulder
Fuck 'round, hit a woah while I'm doing the shoulder
These niggas play gang, so I guess the game over
Yeah, I lay low 'cause I never be lackin'
Dracos and Dracos and Glocks and the Glocks
Yeah, we stay on the road and we stay pencil packin'
Niggas false claimin', he say he a Crip
Y'all should be Hollywood how y'all niggas be actin'
Come from the dirt, had to get me some money
Don't play by the rules, so they call me a captain
Leave him too dirty, he cry for his mama
If you see that nigga, you wonder what happened
Casey had money, he turned to a sucker
For bitches that claim that they came from Manhattan
I don't get caught when I'm drippin' a nigga
So that's why these niggas don't call me a savage
Ma had a stack, my dad had a stack
So you knew I was fresh when I came out the package
Don't trust a soul, I do it alone
'Cause these niggas act goofy to get a reaction
Lame 'cause you know that my partner was setup
He didn't say shit, so my nigga was crackin'
Druggin' these bitches, I feel like Ben 
Baby, come over and give me that sloppy
Give me a minute, I swear I'll be poppin'
With my boy Kobe, we Batman and Robin
Fuck all these niggas, these niggas too cocky
Dick ridin' niggas, all they do is copy
She a Latina, so she call me Papi
She gave me head while a nigga was drivin'
Niggas be hatin', but I ain't do nothin'
I come with the stroller, won't know it was comin'
Hope y'all enjoy while y'all see me progressin'
I probably won't die until I see a hundred
Stackin' up bricks, it's a flex on my ex
And I know that she hatin', she say I'm up next
She flexed on that nigga and say that she curved
He bust, she gon' throw that shit straight out the TEC
Drippin' on hoes, so they call me Lil' Fire
Saniyah, your bitch told my nigga, "Just drive"
And if I see Gucci, then I'ma gonna cop it
Swear that he hard, bro, you better stop it
Creep 'round the block, then I show you what's up
I don't talk to shawty, she just wanna fuck
She gave me some head in the back of the truck
The bitch then just said that you doin' too muchJe povodeň
V dešti je pohroma, v tobě jsem utopen
Jak pod stolem, poslepu ohledám tvé tělo jako koroner
Jsem potopen, pokořen, ponořen
Můj cíl je pokořen
Poslepu nacházím múzy a dokořán otvírám tebe
A zavírám srdce a nechci už sám sebe vidět
V zrcadle vypadám jak stvůra
A kladu ten důraz na hrůzu a půvab
Co zároveň stříkám jak holkám do klína
Na stole pilule, zabije, vykonej
Výčitky, debile, nemůžu, nemůžem
O co jde, proboha, jenom to spolykej
Potom to zapijem, horší to nebude
A raději než happy, seženu deep hoe co dá deepthroat
Polkne to a pak můžeme spolu oba chcípnout
Nestojím o slávu, nejsem ten typ
A pro tvůj xicht, dávno není tu místo
Sedíme vysoko ale nehulím nic bro
A často se cítím jako nabitá pistol
Stačí to odjistit a přiložit, víš to. 
A pak už je tma
Zmizí ty časy, kdy byli jsme dva
Zápas je u konce, skončila hra
Tak odlož ten ovladač a ukonči match
Jen čas ukáže, kdo tu byl hráč
A kdo zase faker co na to má
Ten správný cheat, kterým se dá
Oklamat life a prodrat se dál 
Za hranice, doběhnout k cíli a zastavit se
Alespoň na chvíli, než do márnice
Zavřou tvé tělo, které nevážil sis
Jsem sick ale neléčím se 
Life chladný jako polednice
Jsme ztraceni, lost jako pohlednice
Co se jenom válí ve špíně a prachu bez příjemce
Zažil jsem už tolik věcí
O ty špatné jsem silnější
Ty bys chtěl mít všechno jen lehčí
To je ten rozdíl, proto jsi menší
Tenhle svět už nebude lepší
O to víc se snažím být lepší
Ve snech hledáme štěstí
Život je prázdný jak vesmír
Žiju hectic life a zdraví mi ničí ty hectic nights
Pijem další šajz a doufáme že chuť tomu spraví ta Cola light
Noc má svůj vibe, noční můry a blikající lights
Za ty roky jsme si navykli že život s náma vyjebává a není to right
Vypadnout za město, očistit duši a vyčistit hlavu
Přeju si vyplnit tolik věcí ale nemám už manu
Dobré pocity nepřijdou ani když si napustím vanu
Přemýšlím co mě zaručeně dostane z toho stavu
Neony svítí v dešti 
Neony svítí v dešti 
Je mi to líto že pocity končí
Ztratili duši, nechaly tě zemřít
Sedím tu v dešti a chybí mi deštník
Vidím tě ve snech, nejsi tu se mnou
Tak proč hoe ?
Dávno mi není tak smutno
Sedíme nad městem, foť světla
Vypínám data a dávám si restart
Lidi co byli tu s tebou ty neznáš
Zapomeň na to že budeme spát
Zapomeň na to, my píšeme bars
Slova tě zabolí na chatu, vím to
Je ti to po roce jedno
Volám ti na phone, vem to
Zapamatuj si to jméno
Slova tě zabolí, jsem tak sám
Všechno co napíšu, tak má plán
Nikdy jsem na beatu fakt nelhal
Nikdy jsem na beatu fakt nelhalGang

Goin' now
Whatchu mean I’m lookin clean in the field
Whatchu mean my niggas clean in the field
Fuck lean I’m smoking green on the real
Look at me I fucked ya bitch cuz I’m ill
Shorty geeked tryna reach for a feel
Whole scene gettin' t’d in the field
Uh, yeah whippin’ the wheel
Pump fake and I’m not passin, no chill
Hangin low cause I can’t fuck wit no ops
Ooh, it’s hot on the block
Walking lick, that’s why she all on my dick
Fuck a Rollie, Apple Watch on my wrist
Uh, yeah, shorty know I’m the shit
But she in love with the dick
I can’t have it like this
That’s why I’m on my own shit

Ain’t no tellin' 
Where we goin' now
Gotcho bitch 
We rollin' round
Fucked his bitch 
She goin' now
Got another bitch 
Goin' nowMy home is a shelter for God's people 
I know I can never be God's equal 
The more that I live, I see what is real 
I look like I'm low but I'm stacking a mil 
Heard people saying they don't remember 
Came for me, never yelling timber 
Plotting summers in December
Gotta stay low, never leak your info 
My hood real, seen plenty shit
Homies all in jail, hit plenty licks
I don't rob no more, I'm at the top
I don't slide no more, I'm off the block
Took the fame to the head like a forty
It don't matter where I go, niggas know me
Humble like I grew up from Humboldt County
With a bounty
Here we go, far from lyrical
More like spiritual
Niggas know, still gon' get it though
LB said get it bro 
Really though
OT blowing indigo
Still prince of the city though
Get your ho, beggin' me to hit it slow
I'm a real individual
Plotting summers in December 
Mob shit, I'm still a member
My money be fly
Like I'm in Dubai
I run through the money like I was Usain
Or I was insane
Not here to get by
Left brain, right brain
I'm a threat, numb the pain, Novocain
Overcame my block, hundred shots
Left the block, then the soldier came
I never could tell you I'm innocent
The difference with me is I meant this shit
Since a youngin, I've been militant
My penmanship is allegory
You can learn from my story
Pressure come, I'm never worried
Whatever come, I'm better for it
Whatever come, I'm ready for it
Fake shit, I'm never for it
Learn something everyday
Love the game but never play
My home is a shelter for God's people 
I know I can never be God's equal Ba petit ba tiki musala

Voglio farne si di più

Non fare il Sosa che finisci male
Mio fratello Frank è pronto a sparare
Proiettili volano in mezzo alle strade
Sparisci prima che ti faccian male
Non mi conosci non chiamarmi J
In zona mia manco sanno chi sei
Ti impiccano frate come con Hussein

Dis is Tunes 4 Da Ages 2, bitch!There deference in black artists and wack artist
Kendrick said that
People think 16 is easy like cat to hat
Gotta be complex with metaphors
My wordplay have stunned like Stone cold Stunner
I told y’all I’m born sinner
I seen all circles of hell ask Dante
I think i am ready join 27 club
I am 24 so I’m getting close
Shit most my shit just bounce
You don’t hear my lyrics
Just fire beat I picked
This just all in yo head
When you smoking on that blunt
Catch me smoking UFO joints with lil Mayo
My words creeping in like sleep paralysis demon
Won’t feel waves till to late
I’ll make this hit
Don’t know how I wrote to it 4 years later
Shoutout to fans that support me overseas
Eternal peace is something I need
But haven’t fully achieved
I bet when I smoke some weed resight this sounds odd
To you because I made it sober
Sober me and high me can’t coherent exist
Without Mary Jane
Shit mane I like intro bring it again because I don’t think heard me
Not all roses are red some are black
I’m the rose arose from concert said that 3 years ago
Y’all still ain’t listening
Don’t need diamonds or gold
My bars already glowing
I ain’t talking glow sticks nigga!
Life a divine comedy
And death is the punchline x2
Batista bomb these 16 6 feet deep
As some deep dish pizza
Always hungry but never been to Hungary
Speaking in metaphors y’all still stuck on my last bar
I ain’t no czar so don’t need be recall of ides of march
Shoot fade-away at buzzer as Kobe
This just been black rose I hope this land at yo feet!
Not all roses are red some are black...You finna die baby!
Hit em up! 
Ayy, uhh
Ball so hard like Trump
Run up in my house imma get the Glock
I'll leave my mutt like a dog sharpie
Nigga you a groupie get the fuck up off me
Nigga wanna talk but he walk hardly
Dem motherfucker wanna talk down me
You don't really like me get the fuck around me
Before I bust yo ass like Ronda Rousey
You getting mad bout shit as in general you must be guilty
Nigga I'm sick in the head the therapist could never heal me
You don't know the real me but despise me and wanna kill me
If you really bout it then I send the address so you can feel free to come and kill me
I remember sixth grade I was walking with a limp
Teacher asked me what I wanna be when I grow up
I said a pimp
I go ape-shit every time a motherfucker gimme bit
I got caught, boy you Diddy you a motherfucking chimp, bitch
Woahh
Is it really worth it in the end motherfucker I don't really know
The only thing sweeter than my friends is the pussy that kidding me out
Ramarama free loud 
For the smoke in the ground
Shorty move but wouldn't smile
We about to get wild 
We about to get wild 
We about to get wild Mind racing, time escaping
Bitches clout chasing
I called my plug up for a dub cause shit my temper blatant
Danky fragrance, fly on pavement
I’m that guy debasing
Whatchu blazing?
Got the fiends surrounding in the making
Where the plug?
I need some bud
Bitches bug bro
She need a hug doe
Disrespect, I’ll wipe the dirt off on the rug hoe
Better yet, I’ll get revenge on every scrub yo
]
I called up my plug up for the pack, he got the dope
We rolling fats, we smoking back to back ya knowYea this song is about love
In the beginning there was love
Way before Noah and the dove
But there was no showin of the love
You was only noticed for your stuff
Imma freeze time imma press rewind
In the meantime pull up to a domus
Atrium cool from the water it holdin
People come through buying food maybe clothin
No hand holdin
No kissin in the open
Unless you gotta boy that you chosen
Around age 12s cool for the romans
And if he got virtue then he's golden
For ascetics no sex
The don't have time they don't got no Rolex
Tell you abstain yea they think they know best
Yea they must be stressed
In the beginning there was love
Way before Noah and the dove
But there was no showin of the love
You was only noticed for your stuff
Even when it was a Israelite
Prolly lacked a little feeling when you kissed the bride
I mean
I'd be happy with a different guy
But my brother and my lover it ain't feelin right
And they say no man couldn’t lay with no man
But romans let it slide if you wasn’t in the back
Got some bad bad news it gets tougher after that
The christians and the Jews procreate and thats a wrap
In the beginning there was love
Way before Noah and the dove
But there was no showin of the love
You was only noticed for your stuff
Imma freeze time imma press rewind
In the meantime pull up to a domus
Atrium cool from the water it holdin
People come through buying food maybe clothin
No hand holdin
No kissin in the openThat Action

        Sună telefonul
Lasă-mă fă în pace
Mă tot stresezi întruna
Nu vezi că nu îmi place
Nu am planuri cu tine
Tu ești prea proastă
Mă bag în carapace
Lasă-mă fă în pace
Ți-am dat block peste tot
Mă abordezi pe stradă
Lasă-mă fă dracu
Că ești terminată
Te uiți urât la mine
Zici că îți fac ceva
Mă vorbești pe la spate
Fă dă-te-n pula mea
Nu-mi bat capul cu tine
Știi, nu îmi stă în fire
Nu îmi stă în caracter
Degeaba tu încerci
Nu o să reușești
Îmi sună telefonul
Lasă-mă fă în pace
Mă tot stresezi întruna
Nu vezi că nu îmi place
Nu am planuri cu tine
Tu ești prea proastă
Mă bag în carapace
Lasă-mă fă în paceMajor league hitters, this was out the park
Representin' for niggas who never got they start
Who dreams of hittin' the league, makin' the team and start it
We remained focused, devoted, just workin' on our art
The dealer gave the cards, I just played it smart
Stayed myself while you niggas just tried to play a part
I'ma take it back to the beginning
Was kids wishin' tryna be what we saw on television like
That's gon' be us I promise, one day just wait, I promise
We gon'  to heroes just like the Marvel comics
Just some young ass niggas thinkin' 'bout ho's and watches
Fast cars, riding through town, how you like me now?
Held it down now we gettin' this shit up off the ground
Stayed consistent, now they listenin', I think we made a sound
Remember ho's I couldn't get, they used to turn me down
Now she see me blowing kisses, I think she like me now
Yeah, nigga, nigga, what?
Keep up with the pace, nigga, you know what it is
You tryna keep up in the race, I gotta handle my biz
I just bought me a brand new coupe and yeah lou got him a Benz, nigga
Yeah, whole team shining, huh, yeah
On the paper chase, you see me 
Fake friends they gonna flake but they ain't nothin' but kids
I ain't got time to imitate so it just is what it is
Okay, I know you like it raw like shimmy, shimmy, ya
Hold up, bustin' out the clip until it's empty oh, sucky, sucky
Y'all done fucked up and let niggas come up, gettin' swole now
Money getting bigger like it's been hitting the gym, nigga
Money somersault, money somersault
Yeah, gator on my belt but it's not Lacoste
Yeah, I done paid the cost, I became a boss
Got niggas still sellin' soft, tryna make it out
The type shit we don't talk about but we pray about
Like stashing fifty thousand dollars at your mama house
I spent like fifty thousand hours workin' on my craft
I'm 'bout to show you how to put your city on the map
War ready, aim steady, keep your soul and never fold
Shining like diamonds all on my neck
Shining like rhinestones on her toes
Keeping my promise, do what I say that I'm gonna
Now we doing what we wanna
Thinking 'bout taking your mama house to the Bahamas
 check my pajamas 
Keep up with the pace, nigga, you know what it is
You tryna keep up in the race, I gotta handle my biz
I just bought me a brand new coupe and yeah lou got him a Benz, nigga
Yeah, nigga, nigga, yeah
All up in your face, I know it's hard not to see it
We comin' to a cross-road so if we part then so be it

He thought that sex was disgustin
Said the passions undisturbed
Told em god said thats the word
Adam eve in the garden
They was chillin with the birds
God told me no apple
They like facts yea we heard
Thats when the sin was original
Thats when they knew what they didnt know
They thought what eve did was typical
“Women could never be critical”
Let's take it back we in Rome
They thought their bodies was cold
They thought our bodies was hot
Heat made the genitals pop
Sexism never did stop
Men could be virtuous women could not
Women were something the wealthy could cop
Long as it benefit you and your crops
Or don't mess up your status
Lucretia did suicide cuz she embarrassed
And she was raped it was tragic
She thought that killin herself after sex would prove that she didn't wanna have it
They believed her
But after the loss of a life it ain't much you could do
And when they got periods women could never be clean according to the Jews
Or according to the christians
Who reported to the mishnah
More more logic missin
So they brought it with religion
Augustine
He thought that sex was disgustin
Said the passions undisturbed
Told em god said thats the word
Adam eve in the garden
They was chillin with the birds
God told me no apple
They like facts yea we heard

        I tried to tell 'em you can't be too cautious
So many snakes out here in this grass, man
Can't be too careful, one slip and it's over with
Better watch who you rollin' with 'fore they roll on you, nigga
Really thought that they was silent then they told on you, nigga
A sad story but it's all so true
My big cousin used to wanna bang blue like Snoop
Had a sick ass jumper, could've hoop for the loot
Riding 'round town in that hoopty
Twelve had us jumpin' we was stompin' through the city
Me and my big cousin
Justin tried to play me for a sucker but ain't shit sweet
I swear I'm woke, I never doze, I never get sleep
Was a little nigga but I'll fight you like I'm 6 feet
Win or lose, if you ain't with me you against me
Thinkin' way back to your mama pad
We would fight in the living room and then Jerry would beat your ass
Because I was younger than y'all, life of a underdog
And then auntie would break it up and say "What the fuck wrong with y'all"
Both of them my big cousins, I'ma love 'em to death
Lately I feel like I ain't been lovin' myself
I been deep inside a pussy tryna find some affection
Out here in these streets and I got some protection
'Cause niggas getting hard to trust, bitches too
I promise you ain't slick, I'm already knowing how you move
You movin' crooked, look
Niggas wicked, better guard your energy
Word to Mikey D., been my nigga before this industry
I tell my bro you gotta watch the company you keep
Niggas tryna get us knocked, too fly to be in a box
I rather see us laced up while we countin' knots
Can't let none of you niggas come and take nothin' I got
A lot of niggas turn phony on me
But I know the fam won't switch up, my mans 
Loyalty to the fam 'cause everybody ain't with ya
Hoping you get the picture 'fore it's too late my nigga
Can't be too careful, one slip and it's over with
Better watch who you rollin' with 'fore they roll on you, nigga
Could've sworn that they was silent then they told on you, nigga
A sad story but it's all so true, yeah
A sad story but it's all so true, Lando what up?
I wanna say free , free lil David, free all the homies, nigga
Lil Gary what up? I see you, my niggas still out here bruh
Know I'm sayin' them niggas tried to take you out
But you ain't going bruh, you hard to kill nigga
Real resilient and I know you gon' bounce back..Yeah, if I could open up my heart for you
Would you jump right in? make it jumpstart from torn through
And start a new life with champagne taking over me and you
Call back and give you the moon real soon, yeah
Since I've stood right here in front of you
You don't see it like I do though, every late night at the studio
We play fight, let the music flow maybe get stupid though!?
The people don't know the way I feel when I'm around you!
I just want to be well known but not alone too
Gold fuckin' headstone with you on there too!
Cos' you're my drug habit but I love that shit
Overdose on you daily but I love that shit
I want you to know that belong right here...however

Glad you didn't hear it, or maybe you did?
But this year is it make these so-called stupid nights count because I truly love it
Let's make our business public to the whole wide world
Let these fucker's know that, you're my girl!

Talk game but I betcha new girl do me better
No shame, spent my last and made a goofy fresher
Played blame, told the bitch she shoulda knew me better
Switched lanes, won’t finesse me or get to my cheddar
Look at the task
Look at cho ass, in shit
Holding a flask
Thinkin too past
Foot on the gas
I’m out this bitch
I hit the shift
Blowing a bag
Solving the math, you’ll see
And what’s ya name?
Way you act I think it changed
Got a new thang
Plus she give me better brain
But it’s no pain, bet, I’m glad you felt the same
So it’s no gain, feelings lost and flavors plainYeah

Maniga não vou te mentir
Falaram que Ygrego está melhor que antes
Confesso que não é mentira
Já curto uma vibe que repleta de paz
Não me apanhas com a mão numa birra
Já não to no círculo underground
Nunca fui sequer um charlatão
Ando busy em ser patrão
Conheço senhores de dillz
And riches, dessa town
Pego sonhos, e transformo os em factos
Dos becos pra toda cidade
Cuspo a uns anos suficientes
Pra ser experiente eu repo pra todas idades
Digo e afirmo categoricamente
Que esses rappers querem nossa amizade
Mas onde ficamos nem em sonhos
Um dia pode se tornar em vosso habitat
Andamos com full de planos
Até já nos chamam de loucos
Sueezy já disse que é pra poucos
Muito menos pra os que já estão mortos
Talent pra dar e vender
Não é mentira meu nigga
Nascido só para entreter
Daqui ninguém tira esse nigga

I work on thing I belive
What I was living I relive hoe
Não me preocupo com o que nunca tive
Rappers de mim são demos
Talkin, talkin, outros fazem fazem
Hoje uns batem isso vai em fases
Descutam lugares no terreno
Se bifem se matem while I am up
Música é doença crónica
Por isso sou rapper fenominal
Olha onde esse nigga hoje está
Do bottom pra o topo não é normal
Hoje eu falo orgulhoso
I get it I get it I get it
Perguntam com que está o game
Que tenho em mãos
I'm with it I'm with it I'm whit
Me perseguem por gangsters
Mas sempre ha caminhos de escape
É que eu sou uma bênção
E esse facto ta lhes erritar
I'm always be rolling in tha city
Always controling tha city
Mo nigga não posso mentir
A vida pra mim ta sorrir
Não não é mentira
Não é mentira não é mentira

Eu não posso te mentir

When we could say goodnight and—
Be the mothafuckin' best
I'm blessed
Get the gold, fuck the rest
Women undressed
Yeah, I'm up next
Haters really be depressed
Not Achilles—no weakness
Feeling like a milli, maybe more
Never fucking less true
Can't do the shit that I do
This to remind you
I killed this times two
My mind is fireproof
My crew at the top
Don't know where to find you
Got your minds blew
When I slide through
Never just a rapper on the track like Spook
'Bout to take flight soon
Make the right moves with the right dudes
Rap game hot, like the smoke from where our pipes blew
Killa too fly, but a nigga fly too
We spitting order on the mic like a drive thru
Caesar new cut lookin' like Caillou
And Metropolis be spreading like the Swine Flu
You ain't getting lied to
Supe is in the sky too
Tryna get a milli and kill 'em when we decide to
Niggas 'bout to eat
Like, "No nigga that's my food"
But chya'll could bob too
When you hearing us on iTunes
Baby then, there wouldn't be a single thing we couldn't do
Mom, your boy got more than girls and money on his mind
A little breed and time machines
That shit is redefined
The first time I was here
These niggas couldn't stand my shine
And now they're all standing up to give your boy applause
I smell a little blood and now I'm on my shit like Jaws
To tell the truth, me and you?
We could be married
We could be married
Yeah, she likes that new Ferrari
But she's never drove a car
These niggas wanna love me more
They know that I'm a star
But fake love only gets you so farMy bitch go loco

        Fuck it I’ll do it myself
Need to get through to myself
I’ve been disillusioned
That’s why I’m so cold
That’s why I’m so raw
Had to go off 
I remember happy days when I was innocent
Then I started killing these beats
Ain’t nobody fucking with me
Pray that it never changes
Was it Rococo, maybe Baroque?
Why I gotta be so extra for?
They’d rather me dead jailed or broke
Was it Rococo, maybe Baroque?
Why I gotta be so extra for?
Had to go to hell just to glow
Was it Rococo, maybe Baroque?
Why I gotta be so extra for?
They’d rather me dead jailed or broke
Was it Rococo? Maybe baroque
Why I gotta be so extra for?
Had to go to hell just to glowFourteen thirty two
From monarchs to democracies
Dead presidents stuck in aristocracies
Tweet this
Peep quick
Victims to brand recognition
Blind to the vision
No keys to free these birds from their cage
World set ablaze
War is being waged, bloodstains of the slain on the pavement 
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
All about the green
Drowning in my greed
Out for dead presidents to represent me
Made this beat in a minute
Don't tell me you can't hear this
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
All about the green
Drowning in my greed
Out for dead presidents to represent me
Made this beat in a minute
Don't tell me you can't hear this
Witness this instant transmission
Hit ‘em with subliminals
Homing missiles on the instrumental
Feel like Pablo when I’m working on my flows
Frida Kahlo
Night at the museo
Symphony of motifs
Hit ‘em like an OG lyricist
“New ordinance has corporate making corpses of the less fortunate as they get more corrupt”
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
All about the green
Drowning in my greed
Out for dead presidents to represent me
Made this beat in a minute
Don't tell me you can't hear this
I'm out for dead presidents to represent me
All about the green
Drowning in my greed
Out for dead presidents to represent me
Made this beat in a minute
Don't tell me you can't hear thisThey copy my swagger, that's just on the real 
Codeine in my bladder, mix it with the pills 
My girl gettin' fatter, she not missin' meals
She got her a trapper, she don't pay no bills
When you getting money, yeah, that's when shit get real
Money cannot change me 'cause I'm just so real 
Money do not make me, I just love the feel
This money do not make me, I just love the feel 
Ain't a nigga in the city fuck more bitches than me 
Ain't a rapper in the city got more money than me
And my jewelry always has people starin' at me 
I do right for my bitches, keep 'em in double C 
Bet your girl friend on me, Presidential Rollie
See a bad bitch, gotta shoot my shot like I'm Kobe
Everybody know me, I bet your boyfriend owe me
He was ballin', now he not, his pockets got a slow leak
I want my niggas to ball forever, move as a team and ball together
Price in the winter to dodge the weather
Can't leave it once, we all together
To get what I want gotta grind
Put in work ain't wastin' no time
You looking for me? Ain't hard to find
YGG we shine, yeah
They copy my swagger, that's just on the real 
Codeine in my bladder, mix it with the pills 
My girl gettin' fatter, she not missin' meals
She got her a trapper, she don't pay no bills
When you getting money, yeah, that's when shit get real
Money cannot change me 'cause I'm just so real 
Money do not make me, I just love the feel
This money do not make me, I just love the feel 
I don't chase no females, only chase them racks
I trap in some Louis shoes that cost me bout a stack 
Same clothes for a week when I'm focused in the trap
My outfit cost five bands, got my lil' girl selling crack
I'm not a friendly person, you know where I'm from
Have goons for that mouthy shit, you better watch your tongue
She seen me blowing a bag now she wanna give me some
I fucked her off a Perky, I was way too hard to cum 
He was disloyal, so I put him out the gang
That disloyal shit can't be nowhere near my name
I asked her on the real if she ready for the change
Cause once you fuck a rich nigga you won't be the same
They copy my swagger, that's just on the real 
Codeine in my bladder, mix it with the pills 
My girl gettin' fatter, she not missin' meals
She got her a trapper, she don't pay no bills
When you getting money, yeah, that's when shit get real
Money cannot change me 'cause I'm just so real 
Money do not make me, I just love the feel
This money do not make me, I just love the feel Uh, this YGB—yeah
Snap back to reality
Posted at the cove with the cavalry
Most raps would blow past your dome
Don't battle me, dope savagery
Paint a picture like I'm Salvador
I'm out the door
Gas pedal floored
Glass meant for Coors
Smashed to the core
Stole a flask from the store
Shit's degenerate
Gave no fucks like I'm celibate
Ain't no better kid
Teachers reach the flow and stop bitchin' bout the penmanship
Poems I'm holdin' and storin' inside the touch screen are unseen
Each case hit replay to hear just what the son mean
I make every beat a martyr
Start a Coup
Hear the Carter 2 from car to roof
Straight bumpin', the bass thumpin'
I stay stuntin' at RJ's beat huntin'
I see cousins at barbecues buzzin like:
"Uh, ain't nobody hard as you, you a charmin' dude"
Watching more jaws drop than apartment doors
I target more achievements to see next
The frees hard as cement
I raise ceilings at every event
On YGB the team depends
One more tab and that's the deep end
I'm off it, Tabasco, I'm saucin
I stay hot often, opposite to Boston
See what transportations costin' when I'm exhaustin'
Hoodie off, cops make a nigga stay cautious
Cops make a nigga stay cautious
See what transportations costin' when I'm exhaustedYea

Time to go put on a show
An asshole, been told that before
Whoa, bitch I had to grow
Sorry excuse my ego
One or another you know
Go solo or give what I owe
Lacking the steps with my sole
Love was just closer to mold
Chest out cause nigga I’m bold
Survivin’ the coldest of cold
Fuck what they sayin bout me
Laying low when I move while I’m stacking them G’s
I speak what I know and believe
Boy I’m heat if they roast plus I boast off of grief
Slashing the gash, drew a three
I’d be mad if I can’t live the path made for me
Sit the fuck down bitch you weak
Niggas gassed everyday don’t know why they shit geeked
From the south
Got hella, browse
Riding round
Breaking ground
Fucking a bitch and it was ya spouse
Moving silent... like a mouse
Shit that was trash like ya bank account
Got the check, made it bounce
Niggas ain’t there when it ain’t a ounce
Paid in full, what amount?
Left the bitch back in the drought
All she wanted from me was a boost in her clout
Pulling a deuce with a crown, they all clowns
Seeing frowns cause a nigga been stuntin around
Switched the scene, different town
Different bitch, nother noun
Smoking that loud toked through hella pounds
Want some more? Hella rounds

I got the key to that pussy you kan Kall me a  mayorFrom " Adventures From My Past to Future " :
The first story is about an Indian boy who lives in India and decides to travel to America to watch " Yeezus Tour " but while he's in his way their, he lost his money  and his adventures started.....So, I'm at a mansion party chilling with some dymes
When I open up the door I see the gang, just in time
I'm in the room controlling aux and bitches tempt to grind
And I see this freaky couple getting dirty in the blinds
Well thats a way to start
You ain't peep? It's after dark
All the druggies huddle up
Roll one, who tryna spark?
Like a twisted sick addiction, enhance my latest vision
Welcome to my fiction where the weed is ammunition
Blast off, fuck it, rip the cast off
I rather have her know it's me, I'll yank the mask off
Was quite the late bloomer, slowly growing like a tumor
I can bet a couple dollars that the glo is coming sooner
The flow mellow, groovy young fellow
I'm rocking with the bass while these niggas play the cello
Yo, the players mad cause I'm banking like Carmelo
They see the pressure on, for you the chance is looking narrow
But let me strip and dump the leftover ego
Shipped to Puerto Rico next to Xans at the depot
I'm so evil with my stunts like Knievel
I'm quite deceitful scamming folks with mindsets medieval
But, what would you do if you were stuck inside the zoo?
I'm searching out for more to find the rest of missing clues
So, I took a tab to find the bolts for all the screws
But this could take a toll or maybe this the breakthrough
I'm hanging low inside a salvaged grey coupe
Cops don' pop the spot, man these folks some party poops
Though, still got some dope, a nigga waiting for the crew
Told the bitch in front to move I'm tryna get a better view
Shit, took a minute so I sparked without em too
Seconds later saw them niggas strolling down the avenue
Look, you're never me including miles in my shoes
You can check behind the steps, left a little residue
Tell me if your vision looking focused
Tell me what's your mothafuckin motive
I stamp it's coded, have you motherfuckers noticed?
You sitting back inside a mind you think is really open
Listen, stay alert, matter fact stay assert
Ya value going down, know yourself and know your worth
Yo, I smoked some purp, lost in touch and left the earth
They trapped inside the box, I'm chilling on the outskirtsWho the fuck said I can't come in the game, bitch I’m gamed, I just came with the gang
Flow is the strangest with gains from the bass that I made from the dell grandma paid
Bet my whole shit they be talking, they watching, I stepped up the progress, on me
No lackin, they thought I was cappin'
A solo debut, let em know man what's crackin
Bars wicked like dungeons and dragons
Got passion for this shit, the goal bound to happen
Get with it yo ya status looking static
Getting drastic with the shit you see the graphics look fantastic
On a budget yet I’m ballin like a maverick
In the back of the seat bumpin 90 hits in traffic
Not crazy nor I'm psychopathic
Sarcastic when I say I'll kill em with tactics
I don't know these niggas
But these niggas heard of me
Catch me rollin through ya city with my niggas smoking green
No I'm not with all that drama bitch I'm cooling like the sea
Pull up lookin mean and clean but I don't rock designer tee's
Think I’m lost
Could you help find my destination?
I just need the nearest boat location
Fuck my presentation, bitch don’t tweak
Hop yo ass into the back seat
Imma be on the gas till we crashing
Thought by now she'd be relaxing
That’s all I'm really asking
If she don't stop the screaming imma grab the fuckin axe g
Then off with ya head
Evil, dead, dirty, kids
Roll revenge smoking dread
Fuck a judge, fuck a fed
Execution bloody red, but I just be coolin instead...
I just be coolin insteadI like to keep my problems under water, under wonder
You a goner, all my heat exalted, out the sauna
Marijuana be the fragrance, chilling next to Donna
I just wanna couple thousand, tryna reach nirvana
On and off my passion like a light switch
Slight ditch, shit I tripped, think I hit what might glitch
Right click, they credit all the work that I did
Nice kicks, where you cop ya shit?
It look like my fit
Get the picture, talkin perfect
I’ll win if it’s a versus
Leave a crowd inside some hearses
The fear reside in churches
Welcome to the circus
Where the clowns now have a purpose
Start comparing, end up nervous
I’m wavy like I’m cursive
Writing where’d the time go?
It seems not long ago
Remember days we all would rap and cap and past the days with jokes
Now I’m feeling bored with hope
Nostalgic days and shit to quote
Best believe I’m taking notes
I’m well aware incase I blow, so
I like to keep my problems under water, under wonder
You a goner, all my heat exalted, out the sauna
Marijuana be the fragrance, chilling next to Donna
I just wanna couple thousand, tryna reach nirvana, aye
Sick of the wonders and how abouts
Figured out how to get out the drought
They merchin’ on gangs, what they not about
A curse to the fame, I don’t need the clout
Too critical, Luck leave em miserable
It’s visible, bitch you predicable
Damage reflected, reciprocal
I see through it all it’s invisible
Chilling off the pack high mane
Ease ya brain bruh we toking on a strain, Mary Jane
Don’t give a beat free, hand made
Like my plate but I get that shit for free anyway
Rapping’s gon get me my money
Rapping for you kinda funny
Tap in ya mind lil dummy
Bitch I ain’t come here to study
OG gang
You can’t hang
You a lame
Ay
You got played
Here to stay
Switch ya place

U cannot take all my sanity
Being humble is my strategy
Life is just moving soo rapidly
To me its just moving naturally
Across the sky to the galaxy
They call me they highness they majesty
Lighting bolt filled with alchemy
Im just tryna make my legacy
Figured out there ain't no end to me
Stay neutral and dont have enemies
Thinking to balance our energies
Mix it up home made remedy
When i make it bring my family

Seeking for powerful  tendencies
Air closing in check the density
Im on my own independency
U cannot find out my recipe
My type of rap give you empathy
The greatest between 2 parenthesis

Slow gon bounce back
Going to the final u gonna 
Blood walk
Independent braggin bitches fascinated how the bloods talk

On the Henny getting faded
Gang related
Shot the party up and skated
Throw the gang up
Gang sign on your gang drugs
Gang Gang all the homies brackin

Finger on the trigger, it ain't no lackin
Real life, this ain't no challenge
These 223s will cause damage
Long red belt
Red strings
Blood walkin on stage

In the families

Blood walkI don't really watch my 6  I scope the view 
Haters always watch my 6  and they just think I'm cool 
I don't get high as much  no need for parachute 
Literally down to Earth  when I got my daddy shoes 
Only sip on that cruz  I ain't craving Syracuse 
Give me 5 more years  they won't ask who are you 
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who your goons
They won't ask how you moved
With every release I drop in the game, they question my artistry 
All I'm tryna do is cop me a rollie and fuck with the ministry 
Ma bad I meant wizardy
Money Scheme or Money Heist, tryna cut the check like a Lottery
With my family 'coz they shaped me up no Pottery
Tryna drop some notes on jewelry  I'm just tryna look all glittery 
Separation leads to elevation so I cut it off with ma ol' foes 
Tribulations what I went thru  I don't think I need reparation 
Been so quiet but I'm back, middle to those who hated 
From the East str8 to the South, guess back now with a new location 
Best believe I got mob ties, overseas and with no relation 
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who your goons
They won't ask who your goons
They won't ask how you moved
They won't ask how you moved
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who are you
I don't really watch my 6  I scope the view 
Haters always watch my 6  and they just think I'm cool 
I don't get high as much  no need for parachute 
Literally down to Earth  when I got my daddy shoes 
Only sip on that cruz  I ain't craving Syracuse 
Give me 5 more years  they won't ask who are you 
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who are you
They won't ask who your goons

        He was a young boy from the street with only dreams
Tryna get it but life ain't what it seems
Mama bugging about the life the boy living
Working hard always praying he don't give in
He started hanging always scheming with 'em street boys
But steady calculating tryna make a good choice
Dodging cops always hitting the road
But he was caught and he never fold
He roll with 'em kinda niggas that will snatch your phone
Make you run off on your plug and never leave you alone
Shoot you for no reason men their heart is really cold
He knew that life ain't for him so he had to switch up yeah yeah
He started working slow steady chasing paper
He lost a brother felt pain he got better
He made a promise to mama that he will grow bigger
And now I'm tryna fulfill it and go for more Cheddar
Gotta stay woke
Men I cannot sleep
Got voices in my head angels and demons
Ma heart cold the pain so deep
They tryna take my soul but I cannot give in
Good die young while 'em fake niggas keep living
Troubled by my demons got me wondering why
I've been searching for long cannot find my way
I'm so lost in the search I can't find my way
24 7 steady working men I cannot sleep
I've been grinding on a low key tryna get more sleep
Steady vibing on the beat tryna ease the pain
I've been praying to oluwa make he show me way
042 blood and I'm heading to the top
Ain't gon' stop till I put my niggas up
This for my blood I swear we gon ball
Ain't gon stop till I put my niggas up
No switching side always keep it real with ma nigga
I came a long way from the trenches with ma nigga
We Made it out the ghetto I'm still with ma nigga
And in my smoking section always with ma nigga
Gotta stay woke
Men I cannot sleep
Got voices in my head angels and demons
Ma heart cold the pain so deep
They tryna take my soul but I cannot give in

        À toutes les femmes qui ont eu, auront ou ont la folie de m'aimer, je veux qu'elles sachent que je suis dangereux. Bien loin d'être un ange heureux, je suis en veine et haineux, oui je suis vénéneux.  Deviens mon héroïne, je serai ta drogue. Plus puissant qu'MDMA, des fois tu m'aimes, des fois tu m'as. J'écris car ça m'évite de crier. En moi l'enfer rayonne, il n'a jamais cessé de briller et moi je tourbillonne entre audace, cieux, feux et flow audacieux
Je te veux en sextape, le reste on s'en tape ! Ne me dis jamais next, retiens tous mes pas, reste  ! Ou redeviens mon ex. Next step,  je prends des vestes mais pas les restes. Je ferai tout pour que tu testes puis me détestes
Toi qui disais de puce à pute il n'y a qu'une lettre à changer, ya ceux qui te tendent la main et ceux qui te la coupent, voudraient te changer. Ya ceux qui s'killent au sky, font les pervers sur Skype, s'en branle sur Sky, au secours ! Elles font toutes des books sur Facebook, tueraient leur meilleure pote pour un meilleur look. Faire l'amour sans capote, la confiance dans la poche, je trie et pioche, j'éternue, riposte. Au fond je n'suis vrai que dans mes songes et ne suivrai que mon propre mensonge
Je te veux en sextape, le reste on s'en tape ! Ne me dis jamais next, retiens tous mes pas, reste  ! Ou redeviens mon ex. Next step,  je prends des vestes mais pas les restes. Je ferai tout pour que tu testes puis me détestesI never used to make money

Leven een film ik doe spike leeUsed to serve grams for the $10
Riding top down in my benz
Used to make money off the fiends
Now i’m in my coupe sippin' lean
Funny how this time shit works
I used to be broke
Living off a dollar and some hope
Homies spark me up
Now i’m capping zips and some O’s
Now i’m flexed up and you know
Now we switching lanes with the top down
Making moves need to pipe down
Kinda funny you got time now
Couple rings and they bust down
Couple friends and we all gang
Shooters and we all bang
I ain’t scared to let my flag hang
Throw it up when it’s gang round
Throw it up when it’s bang time
I got .40 with some love
I let it bang now
Used to serve grams for the $10
Riding top down in my benz
Used to make money off the fiends
Now i’m in my beam sippin lean
Funny how this time shit works
I used to be broke
Living off a dollar and some hope
Homies spark me up
Now i’m capping zips and some O’s
Now i’m flexed up and you know
Funny how they all came back, how they all do
Claiming they still know me like they ever did
Claims get you shot
Spill like an oil drill
Waters and they ain’t clear
Sweetwater but it ain’t sweet
Smoking on this Q blowing O’s and it’s all clear
And i’m 12 deep
12 shooters knock you down leave you 6 deep
Hard waters walking like im gods child but im 6 deep
Couple friends came and went like meet and greet
Funny how this time shit works
I used to be broke
Living off a dollar and some hope
Homies spark me up
Now i’m capping zips and some O’s
Now i’m flexed up and you knowYeah, uh, turn me up fool

Сижу за столом,курю Honey Berry
Парни заносят кровавую Мэри
Но я не хочу сейчас алкоголя
Ведь наконец я один - всё довольно!
PHABEIN:
Хоть я не сильно богат, Levi держит мой зад
Курю только Marlboro,пью только виски 
Тут нет вообще сучек, на нашей вписке
Если придёшь к нам,то тут и зависнешь!
Приходи скорее,а то скоро прокиснешь
И вот я взрываю один в тишине
На дворе ночь,я сижу при луне
Очень красиво и тихо,спокойно
Ну нет уж сука,не делай мне больно
Ты не посмеешь придти ко мне тварь
А если зашёл,то считай что покойник!
РРРРАААА!!!!
YGRUM:
Сижу и смотрю,как BEIN заряжает.
Довольно истерик грязная сука.
Кури и вдыхай Marlboro red
Ты в нашей тусовке никто и ничто
Проваливай сука!Никчёмная мразь
Отдавшись кумару лежу и мечтаю
Что б наша тусовка, не имела финала
И всё как сначала.

Se vuoi ti ricambio il favor
Non ho paura di darti il mio cuor
Fuoco infernale, lo senti il fervor
Riparto con andamento adagio
Piano piano, poi mi sento malvagio
Sta canzone fa schifo, ma non che non è un plagio
Ad alcuni dovrebbero togliere il suffragio

Give no power to a Bitch, "Oh Payo self-centered!"
Even if she won’t fuck me I'm a still get it
And even if he won’t buck me, I'm a still get him
Cause I can rap, I can sing, I can fight
So anything a nigga want he gon get it
Mumma stay calling me a hot head

Si a me bajan tu prende un blunt
No te olvides quien soy yo
No te olvides quien te cuidó
Encuentrame afuera

El mundo cada vez mas frio
Pero no llores mami
Yo creo que tu eres bacana y solo tienes que ser feliz
Tengo pecados que he hecho por ti
Con pikette pega'o y a ti verte pal lao' trabajando callao' 
Si no te pude ver tanto viento apagao'

Misbehaving
That’s my main itch
Let me scratch that
Itchy, itchy, mini, miney, moe
Tags on their toes, when they catch ‘em
Flags on the poles, better rep ‘em
Crabs in a bucket
Flashing a musket
Promised y’all lunchmeat
Figured y’all hungry
I'll just eat clams tonight
Seems that I can't do right
Left ‘em wide open
Keep your mind focused
Wax poetic
Never forget
The electrifying
Mesmerizing
Death defying
Multiple dimension
Message in a bottle
Filled with dandelions and hope
Spit that voodoo on the train tracks
Dropping jewels in this ocean
What’s a river to a puddle?
Itchy, itchy, mini, miney, moe

Flags on the poles, better rep ‘em

С телевизера в метро-вагоне
Я вышел под дождь
С недопитой банкой Оболони
Мои рваные шавкони веган
Мокрые насквозь
Вместе с ливнем их залили
Килолитры моих слез
Лучше б сейчас несла меня Мама
В переноске в новую школу
Где я стану затюканным гиком
А не рузке кэжуал пиздоболом
Лучше б сейчас материл меня папа
И учил по блатному базарить
Я умел бы работать паяльником
И может быть даже фофаны ставить
Что же останется после меня
Кроме этих ворованных матерных строчек
Горло полощет рифмами дочка
Перед тем как с бандитом бессонною ночью
Себе заработать на грязную жизнь
Я в ответе, но денюжек нету, держитесь
Сынок остаётся на волю района
Сделать торчком, опустить как гандона
Денюжек нету, пиздуй заработай
В наследство стишки и мои рваные боты
Что же останется после меня
Перегаром Россию всю завонял
Что же останется, что вы найдёте
Диагноз вскрытия: был идиотом
Впрок ни рубля не успел заработать
Повешусь от боли зубной до субботы
Священно клянусь, только вы не дождётесь
Мне страшно, и я пиздабол словно Yota
Что же достанется всем моим внукам
Жилплощади хватит лишь если вы гуки
Ройте землянки, Сибирь необъятная
Рожа небритая, жизнь неприятная
Что же останется после меня
В интернете немножко, в рублях нихуя
На бумаге красиво на деле хуйня
Что же останется после меня
Лучше до капли свой высосать член
Чтобы не бегать по койкам сайгаком
Отказаться от женщин, лишить себя секса
И скиснуть в обнимку со своим вялым перцем
Чем наплодить нищету и несчастья
Сделаться самым обычным Егоркой
Заработать наручники на запястья
И на пятаке вологодском подохнуть
Что же останется после меня?
Что же останется после меня?
Что же останется после меня?
Что же останется после меня?
Кроме этих ворованных матерных строчек?
Что же останется после меня?
Что же останется после меня?
Что же останется после меня?
Кроме этих ворованых матерных строчек?I'm so drunk in the club, don't get me started
Driving people crazy, they asking me the 
Tryna eat a model out, like I was starving
She only date ballers, well bitch I'm balling
Spilling drink all over the carpet
But they can't speak on it because I'm 
I'm tryna get her  like she a target
Tryna spit game but she ain't buying no 
So I'm on to the next like a fast-forward
If you ain't getting naughty, what you looking bad for?
I'm tryna make a ho Chris Brown, transform
Well I got that fire girl, I can keep your pants warm
We hit the dance floor, I do my Duggy
Tryna take a model down likе rugby
Vampire pussy, tryna kill that like Buffy
But it's kinda hard, cause shе came with her hubby
Walk up in this bitch, started sippin' on something fucking up my liver
What? What? What? I don't give a fuck
All these models on my head, I'm tryna get one in the bed
And then I ask her if she with it? She said I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna fuck, I don't wanna fuck
She said her boyfriend is here, but I don't give a fuck
She said her boyfriend is here, but I don't give a fuck
I don't I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't give a fuck
Black on black pockets fat, hoppin' out the 7 strap
Walk up to the club, don't pat me down, they just pat my back
All my niggas got chains on, yeah, we thick as fuck
Out of dress code, we rush the door, cause we don't give a fuck
Standing on the couches, poppin' bottles smoking weed
You see them hoes flocking, that's how you know it's me
I got power in these streets, big boss boxer briefs
I got dead P-R-E-Z's, and these expensive ass jeans
Yeah, and I'm a beast off in them sheets
So if I pull, then I'm gon squeeze
As soon as I cum, then I'm gon leave
Soon as I'm done, I'm gon beat
Back on my grind, back on these beats
Cause I could never be a nigga that had it, lost it
Ending up back in these streets, Nuh-Uh
So its all money until I'm R.I.P
And in my city, nigga,    I am he
And we are V, O-N-E's
One five, two zeros YG
 going like drums on the beat
Walk up in this bitch, started sippin' on something fucking up my liver
What? What? What? I don't give a fuck
All these models on my head, I'm tryna get one in the bed
And then I ask her if she with it? She said I don't give a fuck
I don't wanna fuck, I don't wanna fuck
She said her boyfriend is here, but I don't give a fuck
She said her boyfriend is here, but I don't give a fuck
I don't I don't give a fuck, I don't I don't give a fuckVai peitar a minha gangue
Eu picoto a sua cara
Vou brota la no divisa
E chupar essa safada
Fala mais emocionado
Vocês adoram o meu flow
Passei na rua vocês porsa
Mais a fita não cobrou
Vou lança os cravejado e que se foda essa quebrada
No cap no cafe da manhã
E a noite com a Eduarda
Nike, Oakley ta no kit
Amanhã lanço Balmain
Brota pra chupa minha pika e vê se a amiga quer também
Luke pega essa visão
Nessas linha é só verdade
Vou dropa uns coprimido e volta pra realidade
Nessa cena é só comedia
ABC na minha mão
Ainda bem q faço trap nem tudo ta sendo em vão
Na encruzilhada
Garganta afinada
Tô pela estrada
Deixando elas molhada
Lanço mais um som
Ela nude na DM
Fodo a céu aberto
Que se foda os PM
Ta de brutal kill
Me ouvindo no fone
Bitch dropa pill
Geme falando meu nome
27 anos eu quero viver
O suficiente pra mil bitchs eu foder
Sem flow sem show
Quando comecei
Esse pussy zoou
Bati 1k ele ja se calou
Quando estourei pro feat chamou
Insônia transformada
Transformada Em tape
Fui pra arábia
Voltei como um Sheik
Noite de neurose
Produto injetado
Buscando overdose
Olhos revirados
Colo em Pernambuco

My flow hot, got the world up in my hands
Talk shit but Ima still be counting bands
Twenty eighteen
You could catch me coolin wit my clique or
Whipping up a track for the fiends
Cookin in the lab, where’s the beaker?
It’s not a lot of niggas like me
Baby you could hear the swag through the speakers
Zoomin swerving past in the Z
Oh hello it’s YG, nice to meet ya
I was in the cold
Cooling living, laying low if I say so
Tabi add the stealth to my toes
You could never catch the flow off the speedboat
It’s not a lot of things I know
But I know you see me fucking up this paper
Never spent a dime on a hoe
Less my gang was gonna go then I say woah!
What’s cracking?

You’ve never seen a nigga like that in a minute
Girl what's happening?

Gotta get back and help the city, ballin' like Shaq and Patrick Ewing, yeah 
Better back, back, you not familiar
Niggas act like they been there with ya
Never did dirt, just checked they fingers
Niggas gon' lurk and try to touch you
But it ain't never been no pressure
Niggas get murked, sent to 
Tryna finesse incoming pressure in my hometown
I prolly won't answer the phone now
In the zone rolling with a big blunt and a big bud with a big cup
And I'm on my way back to the city, remember me?
Used to put you on good weed and Hennessy
Had you calling my phone on repeatedly
Damn I miss when you thought that you needed me
But when I come around I'ma scoop you up
I'ma come through your hood, I'ma say whats up
I'ma always look out, I'ma show you love
Even though this shit ain't what we thought it was
I ain't gon' lie, I know it was tough
Baby got braids but she from the slums
I'ma come to your hood, I'ma scoop you up
Hand you my weed, let you roll it up
Long as we ridin' just remember I'm the pilot
Don't ask me where we ridin', just chill girl we just vibin'
You know that we be ridin' from the night to early morning
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off
What you talking 'bout if it ain't tryna get rich
I can't fuck around, these niggas never gon' listen
Want a old school Chevy just to put it on switches
Had to lighten up the load on this road to riches
Finna be stuntin', finna be shinin'
Finna keep bustin', finna keep grindin'
Nigga it's nothing, gotta keep climbing
Finna get money, finna just pile it 
Finna go shoppin', look at this rollie
Look at these diamonds, finna just cop it, finna just rock it
Look at these niggas over there tryna clock in
And I'm back in my hometown
I still be thinking 'bout the old days
I still got a thing for my old things
It's maybe for the best but we both changed
You know but I'm back in the city, remember me?
Used to put you on good weed and Hennessy
How you gon' act like you don't remember me?
Damn I miss when you thought that you needed me
Long as we ridin' just remember I'm the pilot
Don't ask me where we ridin', just chill girl we just vibin'

You know that we be ridin' from the night to early morning
Till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall off, till the wheels fall offI've been dealing with this for quite some time
Now I'm feeling myself
I be doing just fine
I be stressing none
I ain't give a fuck
I be stressing none
I jus' roll it up
I know it's sad, but it's necessary
And I know hurts but it's temporary
Spending time steady on the grind
Man I've been doing just fucking fine
And I've been doing great actually
Running shit like an athlete
But don't you try to come back to me
See right through, transparency
Pour my soul into this so I don't give a fuck
About shit in the past man it's already done
How'd it get so stale 
Crash, burn and derail 
Now I need some new bread
Some new bitches with some new head
And I'm just livin' life
I'm just livin' life
I'm just livin'....
I've been dealing with this for quite some time
Now I'm feeling myself

We be trapping inside, we never need to go mobile
Album of the year, y god is the rap mogul
My bitches are bad and boujee, got me singing like quavo
Me and all my amigos, grubbing down on some huevos
Throwing all of these c notes, saying fuck the dinero
Double time, on a dime, i dont lie, who am i
Wanna die, on the side, go and find, peace of mind
Get in line, overtime, roll the dice, suicide
Do or die, euthanized, you decide, true divine
Harmonize, sip n slide, what a time, real design
This is mine, its a sign, from the sky, is it time
Need a line, did a line, then i shine, kinda fine
Gonna die, twenty five, thats alright, lived a life
Woo woo woo woo woo
I be stacking the paper, green like an alligator
Spyro to make the time go, sucking on now and laters
Chugging some jim bean, why the fuck would i need a chaser
Ay man, got a caper, give me a little distance bitch
Drop to the floor make you turn colors like a litmus test
How y god drop a classic just like that
Little white kid raps better than the rest

Standing ovations got me asking where the tears fit
Careless: Super, Caesar, YGB the fiercest
Got the team behind my back
Niggas I'm tryna climb the stairs with
Young So4p even made the tears sip
Brothers to list in rap, he's growing up
My nigga's bearded
Follow the rise or lie delirious
We got the crowd jumping
Going crazy—Jim Carrey shit
There's no stepping to a nigga—period
Blind spirited, killa got the experience
Eating niggas like we in the cafeteria
If your flows stupid, mine's a mothafuckin' idiot
Drinking pretty shit, gone like arigato
Young Greg Bayne's always a hard act to follow
"Fuck mediocrity" forever stay the motto
These shit's already faded
Why the fuck you wanna cop for?
Paint a picture with this shit while reminiscing to Basquiat
Never missed a beat
Reminder, I cannot be stopped
Nigga, fuck a drop top
I'm tryna focus on getting this shit to pop
Before I think about the top
Wait—yo—don't get it twisted
I'mma make it soon
I'mma make it boom
Fuck the sky, I want the moon
To all the rappers talking shit
Man ya'll can pick a tune
The flows lethal man
It's murder when I fuck with DOOM
Tape dropping soon, get ready for the funerals
Niggas listen to my shit and really need a uniblow
Lyrically too cold
And you should know that Supermån is dope
But ain't the only one that breath froze
So keep dreaming while I keep working
Mercin' beats, niggas hurtin' while my shit perfect
Releasing fire, I'll die before it stops burning
So start learning nigga
Realest and I'm just rehearsing
It's YGB yo

Залетели мы на хату,словно падали с небес
Hooney все давно взрывают,у меня уже абсцесс
Лучше я возьму как раньше наш любимый свежий Horse
Чтобы было всё по кайфу лягу на пол и в откос
Мои парни без туссина чиллият на своей волне
И не вздумай с нами чиллить,ведь ты рак в этом дерьме!
Просто сука не выдумай,с нами рядом не в откос
Твоя сука слышит звук,что вещают мои псы
:PHABEIN x YGRUM
Horse'ом горло полоскаю
BackWoods бронхи продувает
Мы тут чилим,отвисаем
Всё по кайфу,нас вставляет!
:PHABEIN
Сижу,тупо залипаю я в открытое окно
Там вдали уже сияют души моих верных псов
Я их ждал,скучал и чиллил один в мёртвой тишине
Но теперь мы снова вместе отвисаем - вот Goddamn!
YGRUM вновь заносит BackWoods
Чтобы было что взорвать
К нам пристали эти дамы,хотят с нами зависать
Но у нас тут Killa-party,так что ты иди гуляй
А мы тут пока с парнями будем чиллить и взрывать
:PHABEIN x YGRUM
Horse'ом горло полоскаю
BackWoods бронхи продувает
Мы тут чилим,отвисаем
Всё по кайфу,нас вставляет!Bylo to tesne,myšlení systému nechceš
Padaj mi do hlavy pyry a feláci utekli, byli to kurvy
Stojím tu sledujte tupci, sekám to, kopu to
Nechci, nebudu patřit na friendlist
Stačí mi jeden a nepiš
Byla tu se mnou,roky mi utíkaj,stárnou
Tělo se kéruje s hudbou
Bolest je slovo,který má pocitu mnoho
Už je to pomalu dlouho, nebo dlouho pomalu
Nemá to význam jdu dolu
Jednou se seberu ze tmy,chodící legenda Kevin
Nechci pochopit svý chyby,chyby mě dělaj tim jiným
Chápala mě jenom jedna, nebo to byla jen hudba
To už fakt nevím, už je dávno pryč
Nic nezměním
Chtěla by pochopit karmu,padáme společně dolu
A hledáme roky jen pravdu, která už dopadla ke dnu
Chtěla by pochopit karmu,padáme společně dolu
A hledáme roky jen pravdu, která už dopadla ke dnu
Viděli hovno, bylo to ve mně tak dlouho
Dopadli na drogy,hledali prostor
Kde jsi to píchnou
Hledaj na netu mé jméno, nechápu kde byli roky
Stratili deti i prachy,stratili sebe jsou trosky
Bylo jich 100-vky, kámoši blázni, a kámoši mizí
A láska je pruhledná, peníze první
Pocity mrtvý
Sleduju životy,sleduju ženy
Kterí jse bojí tu přežít
Vidím ti deti jsou prázdní
Vidím ti ksichty nešťastní
A prášky na prášky,do lidí voraj návyk
A nebude to námi, budeme to stále trávit
A dávno plány zabili ti lidi v dáli
A nemusím tě milovat když nevidíš mí rany
Co byli tady se mnou a nemužu je vrátiť
Odpust mi chyby, odpust mi že musím pít
Hledat ty činy
Chtěla by pochopit karmu,padáme společně dolu
Hledáme roky jen pravdu, která už dopadla ke dnu
Chtěla by pochopit karmu,padáme společně dolu
Hledáme roky jen pravdu, která už dopadla ke dnuSee shawty be rocking them things that are lame
And I swear, I swear
If you was my bitch I'd have you sittin' chillin' right here
Cause yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this
Yo' nigga ain't me he can't do it like this x3
Now I used to look fly but I really was a broke nigga
Now I got money chilling in my house nigga
Bitches love me they respect my grind
My other bitch tripping though, she ain't worth my time
If you were real bitch you would respect me too
They rather act like a ho and coppa attitude
My kush is kill bill, my swag is so smooth
The paper stack high I can't see the little dudes
And I be on some pimping I put 'em on fig
I bellin' to the set like who got a big
I'm eating her pussy I think I need a bib
Six flat screens all flew out my crib
It's YG the lady's man and a Mercedes Benz
Kicks fresh, whip sitting on the latest rims
If you was my bitch I'd have you saying, I'm dating him
Put him on date mood and make you start playing him
I be on some fly shit like all the time, shit
And you would too if you was my bitch
Drop the top of the whip and tell you hop in
Push a button watch it take off like a rocket
He a stopsign-type nigga, so stop it
And be my baby in the cradle and the one I rock with
Like the tag on the Gucci bag get it pop it
Like fuck with me, I give you a profit
How you choose you love like you had other options
Like why you lying to this girl nigga stop frontin'
They talk about they balling that's just gossip
No disease, but fuck with me like I got some
Yo' nigga ain't me he couldn't be me if I taught him
Hold them Gucci bags all them chinchillas I bought them
Splurging in the mall dropping stacks like I have an orange carrot to my chain, attract the bitches like they rabbits
Swag on automatic my whole clique tatter
Walk in chick magnet, the bad bitch bandit
You got the bitch branded, it's all in the game
But I play it like mad, rich like 
To the bank laughing, me and YG and my young nigga Charley H. double-O D
Looking for a barbie, pink car in the garage
Her name Nicki so I just wanna Minaj
Dick sucking her profession she do one hell of a job
Hop on me like a boss see who come and take a ride

She ask me when I'm gon be faithful, I say someday
So I guess today be that someday
Every Sunday we go and eat ice cream sundaes

Keep a gap between my haters, I need distance
They be unemployed, tryna get in my business
Fresh out the oven, I'm baking biscuits
On some two-ten shit, can't you tell the difference?
And motherfuck the police
They pull us over every time we ride 4 deep
Then the homies turn phony
They try to play me like a disk, but I ain't no Sony
Uh, I just wanna ride to the westside
I just wanna ride
Take a little joyride
Blow a little tree
Me and my homies
We do a 'lil mad, just bickin it

How the pigs wanna separate me from all my homies
Then put me on probation

I'm facing, a cold situation
Ain't this a son of a bitch?
But you know imma twist a new route for this paper
Homie, hear me out
They ban me in the UK, but I'm still gon turn it up

I just wanna ride
Take a little joyride
Blow a little tree
Me and my homies
We can  just bickin it

Just kickin itPozytywne myśli raczej nie pogardze dziś nimi
Choć wiem, że i tak nie pamiętasz nic
Słyszałem dosyć wiele i usłysze jeszcze więcej
Zacząłem żyć trackami troche jakbym miał incepcje
Budowałem napięcie a to chyba nie najlepsze
No bo nawet jak jest ogień to przecież nic nie trwa wiecznie
I znowu mi nie poszło x6
135 pomysłów ale chyba nic nie wyjdzie
Za takie duże staranie sam se wyrządziłem krzywdę
Wychodzę na miasto żeby tańczyć ale znów zamilkłem
Gonią mnie znów własne myśli no więc chowam się za winklem
Ciągle gdzieś się chowam no i ciągle nie mam siły wyjść
Tak ciężkie powieki no i poorobiony styl
Taki porobiony styl
Ja zostane jeszcze dziś
Złapałem takie emocje, że sie dziwię ze mam siłe żyć
Patrz na mnie, gdy nie chce sie żyć żyć
Pomyśl o tym że mogę przy tobie ciągle być
Wiem, że to nieważne, ten cały ten ogromny syf
Ale nic nie powstrzyma mnie by do przodu ciągle iść 
135 pomysłów ale chyba nic nie wyjdzie

Intro: Dji, a momentos e coisas na nossa vida que se repetem, cabeça na lua e pés assentes no chão
Eu não sei muito sobre isso mas o que eu sei que, i have dream like Lhuter agito music record
Refrão: 
Hoje eu tive um dejavú são visões isso não são só lembranças
Tive um dejavú na minha life hoje eu tenho mais esperaça
Tive um dejavú são visões isso não são só lembranças
Tive um dejavú na minha life e hoje eu tenho mais esperaça
Estrofe: 
Mais verde nos olhos mais açucar mais molho
O apressado come crú o lento come corrolo
Mais esperança mais vida cabeça sempre erguida
Mais foco e fé na corrida família sempre unida
Com os mesmos na mesma estrada Juntinhos lá na quebrada
Um pouco as vezes sem nada mas tipo não se passa nada
Me da saúde o resto eu vou a busca eu acho que isso é uma troca justa
Já fiz de tudo isso não me assusta eu sei o quanto essa fama custa
Não assusta ela ofusca as vezes mesmo até frustra
Não ilustra regula, ela te frustra não assusta
Eu tive um dejavú why
Refrão: 
Abri os olhos e estava tudo certo olhei de lado e não havia ninguém perto
Me bilisquei pensei que fosse um sonho minha realidade na qual eu me envergonho mas
Estrofe: 
Mas agora estou numa boa
Tive uma noite de insônia visões nocturnas
E eu me arrependo de tudo que fiz
Na verdade eu só quis ser feliz
E eu só estava a pensar em mim
Quando eu estava lá no meu crib
Com os meus bros sempre a arranjar confusões mas ontem
Estava sentado no quarto focado a escrever mais um som
E eu tive um dejavú olhei para o presente e senti vergonha do que eu fui
Mas, eu fiz o que pude para mudar e dar-te orgulho mama
Eu sei que já falhei contigo várias vezes mama
Acredita que eu mudei eu estou mais maduro penso no futuro
Eu eu sei que um dia tu terás orgulho do teu filho mamaYeah, Friend Zoned
Yeah, girl you’ve got me friend zoned
I was trapping hard, but I still had to try to use the payphone
To call you
But, girl you were always crying like you were fucking dying
So, I always had to pull up to your crib
So, I could try to comfort you
But, girl I have to admit
That girl you better quit it
Because, girl you were never ever with it
But, girl I’ll always be your best friend
Seven hours of us up all night texting
Lead to seven more hours of us fucking sexting
Yeah, Friend ZonedTurn me up fool
One thou wow since the age o Bow Wow
Just a wild child bout to fall out
Till I found out
The chosen one, go through some
On the round with them guns out
Transformation and the information
That was processing no more thigh ‘gressing
I fous now, man talk
I done put all the hocus pocus down
Expo’s in all seriousness
You have near death experiences
When you can score without any assist
They gon send the squad at you
Choppa flip yo squad backwards
Most these rappers are actors
It’s just dot, it’s just me, sentiments o CPC
The president
Land o the free, I’m a resident
To tell you the truth I’m not hesitant
My dawg on a Major, I’m just major
I’m just relevant
Streets back and I’m the president

If i have visuals, i will be visiting
I am the reaper, dont fear me, youre limited
Living with limits the system of gimmicks
I give to the children, this shit is delicious
They still dont have water in fucking flint michigan
Women still protest and it is ridiculous
Fuck donald trump, hes a shitty ass business man
Now he is president, i ain't accepting it
The time of reckoning is here and then again
I will continue to rap and just ether themToast to the Hot Boyz, nigga
Hot Boyz did it, nigga

'Cause I had nothin' else left to believe in

Make it happen then, nigga – the Hot Boyz way

        Fighting marauders
Bit by a snake
Found an oasis
I’ve been away
For too long
Looking at the sky
Seeing nothing but a supernova
Bursting in the atmosphere
What do I know?
Hidden galaxy
Way beyond the stars
Hidden galaxy
So far away
Hidden galaxy
Way beyond the stars
Hidden galaxy
So far away
We bending corner’s, bae
We twisting, bae
We different, bae
This system rigged but
We innovating
We winning, bae
Been missing lately
Been thinking maybe
I’m misbehaving
Hidden galaxy
Way beyond the stars
Hidden galaxy
So far away
Hidden galaxy
Way beyond the stars
Hidden galaxy
So far awayI gave you my heart and you threw it away
Yeah I really hate how I feel this way
I swear all my life that I felt such pain
Its been many years since I felt the same
Yeah I really swear that I hate the fucking change
Yeah I swear these days that I really feel insane
They dont know me they just know my fucking name
Man its a shame how your fam can really change
I haven't been myself in such a long time
Ive wanted to die watch the years pass by
Only feel myself when im fucking high
Wanna overdose maybe go and touch the sky
I dont wanna do this tomorrow
Can you feel my pain and all my sorrows?
Told the Devil my soul he can borrow
I dont wanna wake up tomorrow
Verse 3:
I hate these emotions, ya I feel so stuck
Does she really love me ya will she ever cuff?
Crying in my room while im rolling blunts up
I dont give a fuck, Yeah I swear this life sucks
You just broke my heart and it turned straight to dust
Tried to give my all but its really hard to trust
She said that she loved me but it turned out that its lust
But im not surprised yeah this life really sucks
