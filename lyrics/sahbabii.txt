Can't trust these niggas, that's just the rules
And I keep a small circle, that's just the rules
Keep a couple bad bitches on the sideline, that's just the rules
Blick with the Ruger, that's just the rules
Ain't lovin' these hoes, that's just the rules
Cuffin' these hoes, that ain't the move
That ain't the move 
Poppin' a Molly, she actin' a fool
30 in the clip, bitch, that's just the rules
That's just the rules, that's just the rules
That's just the rules
Trustin' these bitches'll get me so murked
Lovin' these bitches, it get me so hurt
I'm fuckin' these bitches, not cuffin' 'em first
She suckin' my dick while I'm blowin' the purp'
Huggin' and kissin', bitch, you can forget it, I'm all about digits
So muhfuckin' high, sittin' on the clouds smokin' with the pigeons
Catch it, had to cut off some niggas
Talk behind your back like some bitches
They just missin' the lipstick 
Pass her the Molly, she twerkin' her body
The bitch is a squally, she fuckin' the party up
V in Versace, my blood is retarded, yeah
If you ain't suckin' dick, just close yo' mouth 
Ain't talkin' no money, just close yo' mouth 
You ain't a real nigga so close yo' mouth 
Cuffin' these bitches, nigga, close yo' mouth
Whole circle shining 
Lookin' like the sun or a diamond 
Everybody eatin', no whining 
Steak on a plate, we dining 
Lose and you lose, that's just the rules
Can't trust these niggas, that's just the rules
And I keep a small circle, that's just the rules
Keep a couple bad bitches on the sideline, that's just the rules

30 in the clip, bitch, that's just the rules
That's just the rules, that's just the rules
That's just the rules
I slept with a bear, I slept with the tool
All black hoodie so you know I'm 
In your bitch mouth and I'm fuckin' her tooth
Never had one bitch, just two
Lovin' these hoes, the shit is so old
Trustin' these hoes, that shit is a joke
Pass her to my bros
And I bet she gon' choke, oh
I don't want your heart, want the head or the shoulders
Head in a Rover, 
Her boyfriend know it and I ain't gon' fold
Get his ass smoked like a 'Rillo, choppers go "Blow"
AKs make a nigga get low, all on the floor 
Blessing that  so superstitious
Poppin' that pussy so scandalous
I'm smokin' this dope and I'm reminiscing
Came from the bottom with Nicholas
Blowing this loud, is you listening?
The way they be hatin' ridiculous
Fake niggas so conspicuous
Gettin' this money, keep continuing
Lose and you lose, that's just the rules
Can't trust these niggas, that's just the rules
And I keep a small circle, that's just the rules
Keep a couple bad bitches on the sideline, that's just the rules
Blick with the Ruger, that's just the rules
Ain't lovin' these hoes, that's just the rules
Cuffin' these hoes, that ain't the move
That ain't the move 
Poppin' a Molly, she actin' a fool

        Lyrics from snippet
They like, "Why you wear your dreads in your face, cuz?"
I don't wanna see these pussy niggas hate, cuz
These niggas heart plastic, showin' fake love
I don't give a fuck, I'ma live it up 
Fuck work, we ain't goin' tomorrow 
I'd rather fuck a bitch and have her suck my balls 
Callin' in sick while I'm in her jaws 
I'ma fuck her quick, then put on my drawers 
These bitches know that I'ma quick pumper 
Quick fucker AKA quick humper
Told the bitch that I'm hungry than a motherfucker
As I swing the nunchucks, I hear the gun bust
I done fuckin' blocked the bullet on some matrix shit
Used to grab the house phone on some  shit
But the cord wasn't long, I used to hate that shit

Hood bitches in the trap, that's a lab rat
You got bands in your pocket, I'ma grab that
I'ma ball hog yo' bitch, I can't pass that
Every time I throw that dick, she go catch that
Stackin' money like some muhfuckin' flapjacks
I want head, move that muhfuckin' track back
Who the fuck told these lil' niggas they bosses?
Who the fuck told these lil' niggas they shootin'? 
Who the fuck told these lil' bitches they special?
Who the fuck told these lil' hoes they be coolin'?
All these niggas wanna be in my way
All these bitches wanna be in my face
Got they hand out like a muhfuckin' J
Ain't shit free with 'em Ms that you gotta pay
Feel a lil' hard, I want a fat cat 
Boss big ho, that mean I got a fat sack
Left her hangin' like a muhfuckin' trash bag
Bitch, I'm flyer than a  with a jetpack 
 had to set a couple rat traps 
I got buns on buns like a Big Mac
Put it in her mouth, she eat it like a Tic-Tac 
She a freak and she know that I can sense that 
Why the fuck is these lil' niggas up in they feelings like some bitches? 
Every time I throw the bone, she gon' get it 
Who the fuck told these lil' niggas they bosses?
Who the fuck told these lil' niggas they shootin'? 
Who the fuck told these lil' bitches they special?
Who the fuck told these lil' hoes they be coolin'?
