Ah, ayy, ah, ayy, ah
Can you rap like me? Huh
Ah, ayy, ah, ayy, ah
I gotta get my fresh paper, boy optimistic, inflicted the premonition
My vision a place I visit while lifted
Moolah, I get it, get it, the life I live my decision
They told me to go and get it, I got it so now I'm winning 
Revolution of fury, the lean got my vision blurry
Balling' like Stephen Curry, gold fangs in my mouth so purty
Trippie bring demolition and I ain't talking no derbies
Absorb your flow like I'm Kirby, the lies you tell will not hurt me
Try to reach for the stars, yet people don't get too far
They want all of the money, all the expensive cars
It's few people that ever make it but yet I still gotta go hard
A lot of artists that made it are evil, hearts black as tar, yeah
Okay, and this is for every rapper that had a shot at sendin' me
Your efforts ain't getting you anywhere in this industry
Lyrically, demonically, dominate your flow endlessly
My venomous rhymes wine and dine on you mentally
Motivated the motivations, say I got too much chemistry
Fatality, like Liu Kang told me to finish 'eem
Even the Hulk couldn't take this much intensity
I'm the bullet in the barrel in the gun that shot Kennedy
Mind is racin' 'bout hating, contemplation with Haitians
Jamaicans sitting on 5G5 pacing, back and forth waiting in Dayton
You get the picture, don't take this
Boy, this life is real, you couldn't fake this 
Throw it up, regurgitation
Can't shit on me, you constipated
Is you mad 'cause we do this on a daily basis?

Random thoughts to you, bitch
On a love letter to you, bitchGood to now be here
It was love at first sight and misery after two months
Always‚ÄÖfeeling‚ÄÖfucked up either‚ÄÖby love or no love
"I thought‚ÄÖyou was married to the single life", she said
I wasn't necessarily looking for happiness, just less pain
I should've said somethin'
You said the only thing wrong with money is you ain't have enough of it
You said you deserve better, and now so do I
Anyways, the best part of us was me
When you got with me, you were a genius
Now without me, you have to live life as an idiot
I don't write songs, I write life, I told you that
And you were only fuckin' with my feelings because you didn't know your own
I do miss who I thought you were
And sometimes I'm miserable without you
So it's just like you're still here, shit
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely
Love me like you own me and my heart
I need you to show me
Love me, love me closely

Balling like Victor Oladipo 
Yeah, steady, yeah, yeah
Uh, feel like Steve-O

Bugatti with all the speed, though
Bet they won't find me like Nemo
Yeah, takin' that bitch straight to Mickey D's

They want to steal all my energy

Made me just feel like my enemy 
I might just turn into my inner beast

You niggas got fucked up energy

You left me in the cold
I was waitin' to see what you said again
You bring me above
Straight mischief in my head again, oh
Sometimes I realize I really need to get away
Somethings I regret, I wish I could've stayed away
Life's full of lies, and then you damn die
I thought we were in sync, but I misread the signs
I was such a fool to think I could make you mine
You left me in the cold...
Sometimes I realize I really need to get away
Somethings I regret, I wish I could'v–µ stayed away
Sometimes I r–µalize I really need to get away
Somethings I regret, I wish I could've stayed awayAha, good one Richard

Why you so confused?

I grab this choppa lil' bitch, and I like to rock out, hop out 
They don't like that I pop out 
I grab my chopper lil' bitch and you better drop down

They gon' say this heart is just a teaser
Hey, bunch of killers, murders, shootouts, the wild west
'Round here be safe, get you a vest
And when you speak to me it better be about a check
And when I come through, step fresh to impress
Murder scenes, killers, the wild west
Niggas still hating so I'm walking with clips
Killers with me, few Bloods, few Crips
Don't get caught in the mix, don't get caught in the mix
And it can always get bad in the summer, but it can get worse in the summer
Look we all living bad but somebody living worse this summer
So be thankful you can eat and quench your thirst this summer
And thank the lord you breathe, 'cause you can get put in the dirt this summer

He also wrote 1400 on the other side of this orange Aston Martin Before going on to a second Ferrari at the back of the lot

Maison Margiela my clothing 
Baguettes on the Cuban link choker 
I put the thotties on the Perkies and the road 
Hit the gear shift in the Lambo' 
Get you wet then I lie on the oath 
Diamonds hit, blow a kiss at your ho 
Sippin' codeine, it took out my soul 
I'm throwing the Patek on because it's a pussy magnet 
Wait, you don't want static, Holmes?
Them choppers start singin' like Gladys 
Fuck the thots, they trashy 
When I whip up a block, I'm nasty 
And the cops shootin' cops, dirty bastard
Give her dick and don't get it, she fastin'

Yeah
I'm the enimigo and I know it now
Even when‚ÄÖI'm‚ÄÖnot around, you‚ÄÖ'posed to hold it down
I tried‚ÄÖto leave you in the past when I was touchin' down
Fuckin' 'round, baby, I ain't worried' bout no ups and downs
Armageddon in the sky, I'm seein' purple clouds
I'm from a different planet, but I'll be on the earth a while
Feelin' pain, feelings change, but I'ma work it out
Blow a brain and I'm insane and it's the murder house
Where the loyalty? Where the love go?
I only trust my F&N and my snubnosed
I only trust my secrets with the above folks
And I let unknowns be unknown
Politicin' with the other side, the shit that I don't condone
Type of shit, I gotta let it go
Keep a .45 and a four Glock...
Don't act delusional, or we'll be shootin' up your funeral
We keep them clips out...Mally Mall
You could cut me off and I won't never blame you
Won't ever ask for help 'cause I won't ever save you
I wanna run away but you won't let me make moves
Stuck inside the same room,  I can change you
Don't ask me why I got no time to start you, it's not the time to argue
I watched you turn to someone else and never asked who are you
Don't you get stuck inside your head? 'Cause shit, I wish I did
The more we get to this I start telling mys–µlf to quit this shit
Now don't you wonder why I wanna run away now?
When you can't ev–µn look me even my fucking face now
When you stepped outside and found another change
The thing that never changed is the fact that I stayed down
I support myself, I can tell you how the bands felt
Life fought me, ain't a story that I can't tell
Popstar yelling so I gotta be the man
Well, my mama raised me and then I went and raised my damn self
Break me down, blind my eyes
Won't suffocate me
And I don't ever wanna stay
I wish you would let me run away
Break me down, blind my eyes
Won't suffocate me
And I don't ever wanna stay
I wish you would let me run away
I wish you would let me run away
'Cause sometimes I wanna run away
Somewhere hiding in a fucking cave
Out my mind, I blow my fucking brain
I don't even feel so sane anymore
I'm dealing with so much
Dawn to dusk in the rain
Just bought a Cullinan, might get me a Range
Please use every means while picking my brain
Watch me run away
I support myself, I can tell you how the bands felt
Life fought me, ain't a story that I can't tell
Popstar yelling so I gotta be the man
Well, my mama raised me and then I went and raised my damn self
Break me down, blind my eyes
Won't suffocate me
And I don't ever wanna stay
I wish you would let me run away
Break me down, blind my eyes
Won't suffocate me

Where that ice at? 'Cause I need to chill
You ain't like that, lil' bitch, you ain't real

Fell in love with that 
You fell in love with that 
Pussy nigga a simp, woah

Rockin' Saint Laurent, she like the aroma
Baby got a attitude, told her lighten up like a toner
Yeah, it's our anniversary like Tony Tony Tone
Hit the block, it's been a minute
You say you gon' kill me, lil' bitch, don't be timid
I stay in the streets, lil' bitch, gettin' chicken
No GTA, but I stay on a mission
Pussy nigga better keep a distance
In the hood eatin' momma's briskets
Told 'em we relate, I stay in the kitchen

I could end the game, end it 
I could end the game, end it 
I could end the game, end it

Uh, this for them times I was broke and I was sleepin' on the couch 
Homie got a lick, I'm tryna see what it's about 
Mama on my ass, I just hope I made her proud
'Cause her son came far from distributing pounds 
Pack came in, check the shipping right now
Before it lands or touch my hands, I'll have it dished out
Mami think she slick and I got it figured out
She ain't really for the boys, she just comin' for the clout
Smoking Cali with my nigga, thanking God we made it out
'Cause with the options on the board we ain't had no other route
We ain't had no other way, so make something out of nothing
Put M on the map, Atlanta straight to Bompton
I been on a mission, tryna get my bread up
Mama always told me, keep my focus, my head up
I'm so impatient, yeah, bitch, I'm fed up 
All my life I've been home

Drug addiction give you vengeance
Gotta control the narrative, I gotta

When there's a will, there's a way, with this Smith & Wesson get jiggy
Dreads longer than 
 nigga eatin'
Belly button was a target, I gave that nigga a zipper
Impartial to the product, my fiends say it's a nose stinger
In the game  no meter
'Bout my dough like empanada, gotta rap like tortilla
Whip the work so good, I stand back like, "Mama mia," hold up
I been on a mission, tryna get my bread up
Mama always told me, keep my focus, my head up
I'm so impatient, yeah, bitch, I'm fed up

Fuckin' that bitch, then I kick her out
Then I go hit her some more
Shawty a big body
 biggest room
And some bitches in a Rarri
Don't got shit for nobody
Keep some racks beside me
Flyin' and I'm gone, and I'm somewhere you can't find me
We in the stars and we in it like we wishin'
Too many cars in my driveway, I be whippin'
Too many clothes in my closet, shit go missin'
Niggas used to talkin' 'bout me and we get to trippin', oh
In the front of trenches, get them chicks and send them shells
Hand 'em all my shit, holler tipsy, countin' mill' 
Draco got a kick, I let it rip, I give 'em hell 
And I'm triple six, you talkin' shit, I leave pale 
She go to the crib, I make her mom scream and yell 
She 'bout suck a dick and hit it, split in different pairs 
You too worried 'bout a bitch, you need to worry 'bout yourself
Light it up, woahYeah
Raised in the flames with the fire
I seen everything like a motherfuckin' spider
I was placed‚ÄÖon‚ÄÖthis planet to‚ÄÖinspire
I'm up like a spire
You can‚ÄÖhave what you desire
Bring that gas, pass me that lighter
'Cause‚ÅüI'm‚Åütryna‚Åüget higher
Yeah, blowin'‚Åütrees in a‚Åüdrop-top
Diamonds dancin', hop-scotch
Bad bitch, a thot-thot
Gotta have my Glock box
'Cause you know that the block hot
A hundred bands, chop-chop
I'm somethin' like a juggernaut
I fuck but I don't love the thot
I'm heat like super nova hot
Fiendin' for a soda pop
Pourin' up, you know it drop
Codeine in my soda, yeah

*I don‚Äôt think there‚Äôs a word for what that is. Actually, there is a word for that. It‚Äôs love. I‚Äôm in love with her, okay? If you‚Äôre looking for the word that means caring about someone beyond all rationality and wanting them to have everything they want no matter how much it destroys you, it‚Äôs love. And when you love someone you just, you‚Ä¶you don‚Äôt stop, ever. Even when people roll their eyes, and call you crazy. Even then. Especially then. You just‚Äì you don‚Äôt give up. Because if I could just give up‚Ä¶if I could just, you know, take the whole world‚Äôs advice and‚Äì and move on and find someone else, that wouldn‚Äôt be love. That would be‚Ä¶ that would be some other disposable thing that is not worth fighting for. But I‚Äì that is not what this is*Lyrics from Snippets

        Lyrics from Snippets
Big 14, know what the fuck going on
Huh, yeah
It's so sad
To say your life over 
Hello from the other side, how you doing this evening?
Tinted windows, I slide by, they can't see me
Sever niggas heads empty if they deceive me
Lost a couple brothers, they was envious, greedy
When I see you pressure nigga, won't sign no treaty 
Ain't no peace for pussy niggas who wanna be me
Won't deserve the future, I can't let 'em go leave me
Old school thugging until a nigga D-I-E
I got problems, I can't stop counting the deceased
Fours in the cup got me feeling so slithery
Heard they talking gangster, them niggas gon' be six feet
Do a lot of running, niggas is natural athletes
Track star nigga, you should have your own damn cleats
Threw a yacht party, it ain't one if you ain't got a fleet
Six boats for eight hours, they five bands each
I ain't tripping, pimping because my pockets is elite
Water, water, water, I got more water than a beach
Water on my wrist, water my neck and on my feet
Off the radar, leave a message after the beep
With a bad bitch, she unique, I like her physique
Blood on the wall, blood everywhere, blood in the street
Blood in the water, in the river, blood in the creek
Blood in and out, nigga, this shit run deep
Blood in the hills, in the meadows, blood in the sea
Blood on the wall, blood everywhere, blood in the street
Blood in the water, in the river, blood in the creek
Blood in and out, nigga, this shit run deep
Blood in the hills, in the meadows, blood in the seaHow the fuck you ever try to play me
I thought you was my love man
I even called you baby
You played me
Went from my love to slim shady
Now demonic thoughts in my head
This shits crazy
Thanking God for everything I got
Told him to save me
Do whatever for my OG's nigga
That's who raised me
You made me blind to reality
That shits is from fugazi
Yeah, said that shit is all fugazi
Now I'm swerving 'round in this Mercedes
Yeah, you can love me or you hate me
You just mad that this pussy nigga ain't me
I'm getting money I ain't 'gon let that shit faze me-cloudy
It rains every day
Baby, what's the hold up?
Baby, what's the hold up?
Baby, what's the hold‚ÄÖup?
Baby,‚ÄÖwhat's the hold‚ÄÖup?
Baby, what's the hold up?
Baby, what's‚ÄÖthe hold up?
Baby, show me the truth
I ain't never lie, girl, I wanna be with you
I don't really know what else to do
They said that our love would fly, baby, they ain't never lie
'Cause when I touch down, we flew
When I touch down, we flew
When I touch down, we flew
Baby, I just wanna be with you
In love from the start, baby girl, I thought you knew
What's the hold up?
Baby, what's the hold up?
Baby, what's the hold up?
Baby, what's the hold up?
