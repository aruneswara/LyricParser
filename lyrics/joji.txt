I want my life in two

Waiting to get there
Waiting for you

Will you notice my charm if he slips up one bit?
'Cause I don't need to know

I don't need to know
I just wanna make sure you're all safe
All safe, all safe

Fallen star, I'm your one call away
Motel halls, neon walls
When night falls, I am your escape
When you lay alone, I ache
Something I wanted to feel
If you’ve been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don’t have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Not anyone, you're the one
More than fun, you're the sanctuary
'Cause what you want is what I want
Sincerity
Souls that dream alone lie awake
I’ll give you somethin’ so real
If you've been waitin’ for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I’ve been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I need
Hold me oh so close
'Cause you never know
Just how long our lives will be
If you've been waitin' for fallin' in love
Babe, you don't have to wait on me
'Cause I've been aimin' for Heaven above
But an angel ain't what I needLast night, I lost all my patience

Can't hide a heart in a black tint, I
You were off the bullshit and the tablets
Under 21, both savage
All these blurry nights feel the same to me
Heart full of hate, no vacancy
Only one you gonna blame when it's over
Can't look me in my eyes when you sober
Hey, I'm the one you call when you feelin' low
Running up a check just to help you cope
I just want to live in the moment
You just want to fight 'cause you lonely
Tryna see a milly then be really up
Rockstar crash in my Bentley truck
You need all my love
You've got all my love
Last night, I lost all my patience
You were fucked up, I was wasted
Midsummer madness
I can't take it no more, no more

I learned from my mistakes, you make me want to learn again
I don't really see the problem, it's a risk I wanna take
You say, "Let's see where it goes," but I don't really wanna wait
Ayy, look and listen up
You've been smilin' when we fuck
Let's not even think about it, we ain't gotta talk a lot
Make it hotter than the summer, I'll stay with you when it's not
Put the slow jams on, I wanna see you make it pop, ayy
Moving all around the bed like we just toss and turn, ayy
Playin' with the fire, I don't care if I get burned, ayy

Nothin' in the universe feel better than yo' tongue, ayy

距離不是問題, I know
為了這一刻的 feel 我值得飛了那麼久
She lookin' so pretty, I wanted a kiss
把 beautiful memories 存入我的 iPhone X
I-I-I hope 24 can become 48
看日落 粉的天 有藍月亮陪
想要擁抱 你在我需要前給
Sunny gone, I don't care, you're my sunshine babe

The demons told me everything
They whisper in the night 
This is not a threat, I promise 
I promise
This is not a threat, I promise
It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know
That was when the ceiling caved in
When I'm falling in a trench, I'm behaving 
I'm behaving myself 
I'm behaving myself 
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for you, for you, for you
We don't gotta die so soon
So I just behave for–
This is not a threat, I promise

It's a warning, baby, I just want you to know
Please, just let me go
Let me go, I've seen enough
I've seen enough
I've seen enoughI fell for your magic, I tasted your skin
And though this is tragic, at least I found the end
I witnessed your madness, you shed light on my sins
And if we share in this sadness, then where have you been?
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I’m not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I’m not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run 
You bathe in your victory
You blew out on my fuse
And if I took on the planet
Will I pay my dues?
Your love was a mystery
Yeah, my love is a fool
And I traveled the country just to get to you
I know you're not in love like you used to be
Guess I'm not the one, like you used to think
So you'll just run
I know that I'm stuck in this misery
Guess I'm not enough, like you used to think
So I'll just run
And I traveled the country
And I traveled the country just to get to you
I know you’re not in love
I know you’re not in love
I know you're not in loveOh, oh

Fuck around a bit and get it right
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
I don't really wanna run around

Cupid pass another my way 
Another night, a lot more days 
Hard to think about you anymore 
But I keep you in my mind always 
Called me on the phone last night 
Couldn't hear your voice, I fight 
I won't be around you anymore 
In a dream where you feel alright
I don't really wanna run around, yeah
Time is goin' slow and I don't mind, yeah
Tell me if you know I'm really found, yeah
Fuck around a bit and get it right

Tellin' me that you're okay
Just better if you stay away
Better if you stay away
Won't you stay away?
Stay away, stay away
AlrightI don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel all cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of goldGirl, would it kill you just to throw a little bit of attention?
If I hurt you, I'm afraid God's gonna teach me a lesson
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not be so obvious?
So keep it light
So keep it light, no
I thought I'd vocalize my troubles, but nobody will listen
I know I'm cryptic and I'm weird, that shit comes off as indifferent
I don't wanna die so young
Got so much to do
I don't smile for the camera
Only smile for you
Smile for you
Now would you hate me if I said goodbye
So quick you could eat my dust?
Now would you hate me if I ran like hell
In the wind from dawn 'til dusk?
When you cry, you waste your time
Over boys you never liked
Can you not?She don't wanna tell lies 
She don't wanna tell lies 
She just wanna feel alive 
She just wanted more time 
I'm looking for a long ride 
She just want a test drive 
Dying on the west side 
I'll see you in the next life 
What do you want, babe? 
I don't like when you taunt me 
You've been calling the wrong name 
I said what do you want, babe? 
I'm working on my aim 
I'm hoping you do the same 
You got me afraid again 
So let me just pray again 
You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies
She don't wanna tell lies
She just wanna feel alive
She just wanted more time
I'm looking for a long ride
She just want a test drive 
Dying on the west side 
I'll see you in the next life 
Waiting on a sacrificial life
Waiting on the ones who didn't fight
I told you not to waste my fucking time
I told you never sing that song, you lied
You gon' jump through hoops
Know how many lines you'll do
Won't matter when you lose
Everything I've done for you
She don't wanna tell lies 
She don't wanna tell lies 
She just wanna feel alive 
She just wanted more time 
I'm looking for a long ride 
She just want a test drive 
Dying on the west side 
I'll see you in the next life Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, oh it's a vibe
Yah, yah, yah, yah, yah, vibe
When I jump into the temple 
Prefer a local mental
Bending knees and wishing place inside to hide low, go
Took a beer I need a 这个beat让你倒地
能力超出你底线
帮助你觉醒
或是打听你的一字一句
都已经到期
都是我玩具
都对我赞许
所以才会把你领地占据

And I'm always stacking paper, but my name ain't Michael 
Got a crib in Indo, it's tall just like the Eiffel
I could get her number if I put it on my rider, yuh
Goddamn legit, told me that she liked my fit 
When I take her out to dinner, man, the check ain't gettin' split
Don't look like I'm getting thinner with the chicken and the ribs 
Man, your bitch is what I say, one day, I saw her and got the kiss 
Don't say my name, I never wanna breathe your air
Coke and Kool-Aid, there's just some shit you don't compare
I got an x-ray and I just saw my old girl there 
She was my ex babe, but now I really just don't care
I'm so tired, but my mind is racin'
Fuck with me and see what kinda problems you'll be facin'
Friday 13th, I make you look like you met Jason
Like a damn femur poppin', just what I've been cravin' 
All this ice be on me but I still be risin'
I'll be on your labels but I'm still ridin'
Say that I be falling but they see me flyin'

Now they say, "Wow, you've changed" 
Now they say, "Wow, you've changed"
Now they say, "Wow, you changin'"
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me
No way, no way, still the same
Got that purple in my vein
It ain't hard to feel their pain
While I'm rocking Saint Laurent
Purple body like a Saint
Ooh, big body coupe just like a tank
I'm just swerving, smoking on some dank
I'm just tryna fucking ease the pain
'Fore I blow my mind like Kurt Cobain
No, I won't change 
No, I won't change 
No, I won't change 
Yeah, and I promise I won't change
And I promise I'm the same
Trippie Redd, you know my name
Bitch, they say that I'm insane
I might blow your fucking brain
Bitch, I'm fly just like a crane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
Feels like I'm fallin' off a plane
And that bitch got angel wings
And it's spitting all these flames
And it just 'nnihilate the lanes
And it annihilate the lames
They said that I won't make it
They said that I won't change
They say that I'm not flexin' 
Now they say, "Wow, you've changed" 
Now they say, "Wow, you've changed"
Now they say, "Wow, you changin'"
Yeah, they ask why you've changed
When the rest ain't looking like me
Ooh, call my name
Spit at your feet
'Cause I'm alone
Don't call my name
Need some sleep
And sing alongI can't get over you
Can’t get over you
And before I die I pray that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won't be no fun
If I can't have you, no one can
Highlights, in the limelight
Can you show me, to the nightlife
Baby I like, all colors like
But I want you, and I don’t know right 
Tell me more, I got a box cutter with your name on it
Tell me more, I can't stay this long on the same topic
I don't know you, but would I fall in love with you?
I don't have no social cues
I'm all for you 
I can't get over you 
Can't get over you
And before I die I pray  that
I could be the one
That I could be the one
But I won’t be no fun
If I can’t have you, no one canOh

Remember those times I fought to get out?
I want to get out
Those pictures so clear, will fade in my mind

Caught in a river of records and dreams 
Oh, will you keep up with me? 
Everyone's looking for someone to hold 
But I can't let you go I looked at you and said, oh-oh-oh
Don't hate me, am I crazy?
So tenderly you watch me burn, you watch me burn, oh
So tell me, am I crazy?

Ooh 
And I don't wanna die
No, I don't wanna die
I don't wanna die todayHere I am
Torn into a thousand shapes and folds
Torn into a thousand ways, I know
Fornicate inside your broken homes
Before I throw a smile your way, no more
I can't tell
If all my answers correlate at all
I'm telling you a thousand things I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive
I'm on trial
I'm not so good at hiding wholesome truths
You see it on my face when I turn blue
So punish me, I'm hanging on your noose
So pull me up so I can breathe with you
I know
I've been missing a long time
To know I had to move
I've been waiting my whole life
To know I wanted you
Are you feeling me slowly?
You can take your fucking time
And I promise I won't lie
We'll make it out alive

Who knows? 
I said who knows?
Ooh, teach me to love just to let me go

And no one will be here to let you know Wide awake, gettin' half-past zero
It's gettin' heated, so I leave the windows open
Preoccupied with a late night B-roll
Right now, laying here alone is heaven
And I've been a hero, helpless
I'm in hell
And I've cried up and down in these hallways
Blamed myself
Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-up head
I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-up
Sun-dried on the backyard patio
Drunk eyes 'cause I didn't give it a home run
Yeah, yeah
You're hiding on the FM radio
I sing along just to sing my thoughts at someone
Yeah, yeah
And I've been a hero, helpless
I'm in hell 
And I've cried up and down in these hallways
Blamed myself
Bad luck, I don't wanna be home at midnight
Sun's up, I don't really wanna fight the daylight
I don't care if you moved on
I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-up head
I'm not layin' in bed with a fucked-upI see nothing out the window, window
Nothing out the window
Watching all the leaves grow, leaves grow
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though
And the sun will shine, no more
The sun will shine , no more
I've been holding on, too long
Holding on too
I know when the wind blows, wind blows
Feels better in my dreams though, dreams though
I just wanna sleep forever
Please just let me leave, forever
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, antidote
I don't need an antidote, forever
We don't wanna drive slow, drive slow
Speed up with our eyes closed, eyes closed
Eyes closed, eyes closed
Head down, eyes closed
Ice cold, meltdownLately, I can't help but think
That our roads might take us down different phases
Don't wanna complicate the rhythm that we've got
But I'm speechless
When everything's so pure, can it be aimless?
Painless?
If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
Since I met you
All the gloomy days just seem to shine a little more brightly
Consider what we've got
'Cause I can never take you for granted
Is there another us on this whole planet?
Planet?
If you ever go, all the songs that we like
Will sound like bittersweet lullabies
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
No one loves me like you do
I don't wanna seem foolish
When I'm jumping into this
You're all that I see
Lost in the blue
They don't love me like you do
Those chills that I knew
They were nothing without you
And everyone else
They don't matter now
You're the one I can't lose
No one loves me like you do
No one loves me like you doSearching for a reason why, oh
Searching where the leaves don't grow, grow, grow
Yo
The pitter-patter gave a rather rinse and lather feeling
As opposed to shitty attitudes that made me bitter after laughter
And I deeply regretted it
I take the D train to go to BK
I can't defeat rain
And as far as we go
And as far as we go
And how little we know
And how little we know
Searching for the weekend love
Searching where the leaves don't fall
When the land is widow 
Fall to the ground
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
Speak to me
So bright
Speak to me
So bright
And as far as we go 
And as far as we go 
When the land is widow 
Fall to the ground 
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
So bright
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
So bright
Speak to me 
Please don't run away
Speak to me 
Please don't run away
Speak to me 
Speak to me 
A true friend of ours was talking on the phone
Please don't run away
Oh, please don't run away
Please don't run away
Oh, please don't run awayPlease don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leather
I need you back
I need you back 
I need you, back
I need you back
So I'll fly away
Zoloft, Xanax
Zoloft, Xanax
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
Please don't run away
I don't know why
I don't know why I feel this way
I feel the same
I don't know why
I don't know why I feel the same
I need you back
I need you back
I need you, back
I need you back 
Where'd you go?
I thought we'd last forever 
Where'd I go?
I was sinking through the leatherOut of reach, out of time
Maybe I'm too high
Out of mind, out of line
Almost lost my sight
I don't know why I do this
I feel like I might lose you
Out of drugs, out of love 
So let's compromise
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burnin'
Head in the clouds
And I'm not comin' down
I used to swim now I'm ready to sink
I wanna give you what I cannot do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, oh
In a haze, different days
Maybe I'm too nice
In a maze, in a daze
I don't read your signs
I knew that I was foolish
I was young and I was stupid
Never change, never take
There’s no compromise
The floor is raising, the sky is falling
The tides are turning, my eyes are burnin'
Head in the clouds
And I'm not comin' down
I used to swim now I'm ready to sink
I wanna give you what I can not do
Oh, oh, oh, oh
Oh, oh, oh, ohYeah, all my friends no fun
Yeah, all my friends no fun
Fuck my friends, they're gone
They all left one by one
And now that summer's done
They don't need no more fun
Yeah, I drive around on my own
I'm rich, but my A/C broke
Don't check no mail, no phone
And I tell them I'm not home
And I keep to myself
Fuck with no one else
And I know it's my fault
But I don't care
And I keep to myself
Who are you to pretend?
And I know it's my fault
It'll never end

Yeah, I can't get no sleep
I look so good in green
I run, I run, I run 
And I don't have no more dreams

Feel dead, but I feel my bones 
I hide out on my throne 
Open up, now my cover's blown

Need control, need it now
I need to live a thousand times
I cannot stop, I cannot cry
I will not fret, I will not die
I am machine, I stay alive
Sometimes I think, sometimes I think
Sometimes I think, sometimes I 
I've got no aim, a million rounds, is nothing real?
A hundred pounds of heavy steel, it feels so loud
Tied to my chest, it feels so loud
I'll take a peek to across the peaks
This grass is neat and I'm quite unique
But I'd like to be, but I'd like to be
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
Sorry, you can see it in my retina
Focus in and out, I'm doing better
Artificial ghost with no perception
I wanna be a Chevy, not a Sentra, uh 
I don't feel the way they programmed me to feel today
Some pieces falling from the waist up
I'm so sorry for delays
Just need one moment to erase
That burning pain before the rage
I feel good, I feel good, I feel good 
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for you
And I hope this is the hardest part
We try, we try
And when they say they're satisfied
They're lying, they're lying
Do forgive me, I've seen the treasure's in the bloom
But right now, I'm just not strong enough for youWon't you come through?
Water on me

And I'm swimming like Nemo
No caller ID, no
You don't really like me, no
And I don't really like people
But you're better by default
No, red rocks so bright 
You can open your eyes
Hell all rise
Make you so blind 
With a thousand teeth like a Leviathan
Biting tightly on my wrist, it look like heaven
Weighing tightly on my neck until it breaks
If I lived too long, you'd kill me with a stake
No mistake, no mistake, no mistake
No mistake
The reflection never point the same way
ABBA on repeat, yeah
Diamonds like a dancing queen, so...
Won't you come through?
Water on me

I would do things and you'd get annoyed, I
Should've never done them, I wish I was different
Why do we have to step away now?
It's been a year, been a couple days now

Girl, don't notice it, I don't notice it
And the love make me wanna sing, sing
And the high make me wanna sing, sing
And the pain make me wanna blink, blink
But I'm in a Rover, I won't feel a thing
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Hey, hey, hey, hey
Guess I've been awake thinking 'bout our fate
Fighting two devils, blood in my toothpaste
Spit into the night , thought it would be nice 
You just makе me nervous, you werе cold as ice 
I was in your town, drivin' eighty miles
Do not even notice, do not even frown
And how could I deserve this? I'm never slowin' down 
Don't love me at the surface, love me like it's now 
Oh, understand, girl, I'm out of sight
To the other side, I don't want no stripes
Got my insides loud like motorcycles
Girl, don't notice it, I don't notice it
And the love make me wanna sing, sing
And the high make me wanna sing, sing
And the pain make me wanna blink, blink
But I'm in a Rover, I won't feel a thingGuess I'm flyin' international
We can meet, but no more lies at the Oriental
Now I'm so professional
I just need you one more time to get it right, you know?
Won't you upgrade? I know it hurts
You deserve it, I know your worth
If you think you can't make it happen
We'll keep it optional 
We don't make sense, we don't make sense
We don't make sense enough to give this time
But if you'll be mine
We'll keep it optional

Just a little bit, woah, don't get rid of me, ayy
But love is so blind when you feel it 
Can't defeat it, hope you feelin' good

Back to cop that free shit, that's elite shit
High hopes
High hopesYou found the best of me inside your feelings
The worst of me was waiting for that evening 
It's just me these days, I can't say I'm great
I can't stop seein' your face on all these ceilings 
You saved me for the last time, I'm alright 
I'll find somebody else to watch me die 
Somebody I can push away and reel back in
Like the bait that I am, I am
So let me know, let me know when we gonna find the time 
So let me know, let me know when I get a little bit wise
If you hear me count to four
Sedate me 'til I'm normal
Won't you be a darling, feel my rage
Make me feel fantastic, broke my cage
Hold my breath, until you call my name, again
I can't say what's on your mind but I know we think the same 
So let me know, let me know when we gonna find the time
So let me know, let me know when I get a little bit wise
If you hear me count to four
Sedate me 'til I'm normalI can't feel my face, but only when I'm with you
Please forgive me, oh
When I lose control, it's only cause I miss you
Please forgive me
Tell me what you mean
When you whisper late at night
Once in a while, I'm digging through the scars
That we failed to heal, failed to heal
And once in a while, I'm digging through the scars
Oh, so please go back to sleep
Oh, da da da da da da, beat to the march, getting ill, oh
Every time I come around, bitch better calm, getting ill
In the ocean glow, where we used to glow
Dream about it once in a while
When my eyes are closed and I lose control
There's nowhere to run
There's nowhere to run
Coming undone
Once in a while, I'm digging through the scars
That we failed to heal, failed to heal
And once in a while, I'm digging through the scars
Oh, so please go back to sleepMidnight mafia

Hanging pictures on my wall
Every Saturday Rap Attack, Mr. Magic, Marley Marl

Smoking weed on Bambu, sipping on Private Stock
Way back, when I had the red and black lumberjack
With the hat to match
Remember Rapping Duke? Duh-ha, duh-ha
You never thought that hip hop would take it this far
Now I'm in the limelight 'cause I rhyme tight
Time to get paid, blow up like the World Trade
Born sinner, the opposite of a winner
Remember when I used to eat sardines for dinner
For dinner

You'll be here for life I don't wanna waste my time if I can't be by your side
You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothin' nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothin'
But she don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
'Cause I don't gotta know about nothin'
'Cause I don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
Only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
'Cause I don't gotta know about nothin'

You really shouldn't think about God if she can't see where you hide
We don't gotta talk about nothing nice if you wanna come down
But she don't gotta know 'bout nothing
But she don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
And when we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
I don't wanna waste my time if I can't make you decide
You're only on my mind when I need you
I don't need to know about what you do when the sun goes down
Cause I don't gotta know about nothing
Cause I don't gotta know...
And if the stars collide, will she relieve my soul?
When we feel alive I know she'll let me go
When you read my lips, I know you feel my cold
But I promise you my heart is made of gold
My heart is made of gold

When I'm goneMy life fades, my vision dims. All that remains are memories. I remember a time of chaos, ruined dreams, this wasted land. Most of all, I remember the man we called Max, the road warrior. To understand who he was we have to go back to the other time. When the world was powered by the black fuel, and the desert sprung great cities of pipe and steel. Gone now, swept away. For reasons long forgotten two mighty warrior tribes went to war and touched off a blaze which engulfed them all. Without fuel they were nothing. They'd built a house of straw. Suddenly their machines sputtered and stopped. Their leaders talked and talked and talked, but nothing could stem the avalanche. Their world crumbled. Cities exploded. A whirlwind of looting and a firestorm of fear. Men began to feed on men.
On the roads it was a white-line nightmare. Only those mobile enough to scavenge, brutal enough to pillage would survive. The gangs took over the highways, waging war for a tank of juice. Good brave men were battered and smashed. Men like Max, who ruled the highways in the name of the law. Who became a lover, husband, father. And with the roar of an engine, he lost everything, his woman, his child, his world. He wandered out into the wasteland, and here he would learn, amid the dark wreckage, that the fire which burns in the heart of man, will endure. Hope survives.Oh
