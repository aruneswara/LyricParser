Wet-ass pussy, make that pullout game weak, woo 
Yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy
Beat it up, nigga, catch a charge
Extra large and extra hard
Put this pussy right in your face
Swipe your nose like a credit card
Hop on top, I wanna ride
I do a kegel while it's inside
Spit in my mouth, look in my eyes
This pussy is wet, come take a dive
Tie me up like I'm surprised
Let's roleplay, I'll wear a disguise
I want you to park that big Mack truck right in this little garage
Make it cream, make me scream
Out in public, make a scene
I don't cook, I don't clean
But let me tell you how I got this ring 
Gobble me, swallow me, drip down the side of me 
Quick, jump out 'fore you let it get inside of me 
I tell him where to put it, never tell him where I'm 'bout to be 
I'll run down on him 'fore I have a nigga runnin' me 
Talk your shit, bite your lip 
Ask for a car while you ride that dick 
You really ain't never gotta fuck him for a thang 
He already made his mind up 'fore he came 
Now get your boots and your coat for this wet-ass pussy 
He bought a phone just for pictures of this wet-ass pussy 
Paid my tuition just to kiss me on this wet-ass pussy 
Now make it rain if you wanna see some wet-ass pussy 
Look, I need a hard hitter, need a deep stroker
Need a Henny drinker, need a weed smoker
Not a garter snake, I need a king cobra
With a hook in it, hope it lean over
He got some money, then that's where I'm headed
Pussy A1 just like his credit
He got a beard, well, I'm tryna wet it
I let him taste it, now he diabetic
I don't wanna spit, I wanna gulp
I wanna gag, I wanna choke
I want you to touch that lil' dangly thing that swing in the back of my throat
My head game is fire, punani Dasani
It's goin' in dry and it's comin' out soggy
I ride on that thing like the cops is behind me 
I spit on his mic and now he tryna sign me, woo
Your honor, I'm a freak bitch, handcuffs, leashes
Switch my wig, make him feel like he cheatin'
Put him on his knees, give him somethin' to believe in
Never lost a fight, but I'm lookin' for a beatin' 
In the food chain, I'm the one that eat ya
If he ate my ass, he's a bottom-feeder
Big D stand for big demeanor
I could make ya bust before I ever meet ya
If it don't hang, then he can't bang
You can't hurt my feelings, but I like pain
If he fuck me and ask "Whose is it?"
When I ride the dick, I'ma spell my name, ah
Yeah, yeah, yeah
Yeah, you fuckin' with some wet-ass pussy
Bring a bucket and a mop for this wet-ass pussy
Give me everything you got for this wet-ass pussy

MAC to your face like contour 
This chopper come straight from Dior
Done with the talkin', I'm open to violence
Ask anybody, they know I'm about it
Hashtag whip that ho ass
Fuck around, we gon' start a new challenge 
I come in this bitch and I'm strapped up and ready
Ridin' that dick like I'm Cardi Andretti
Fuck at your crib, we don't go to no 'telly
I sit on his face whenever I'm ready 
Bitch I'm a freak like Greek 
Got the biggest house on my street 
All you little hoes look cheap 
They suckin' on my dick with no teeth
Press, press, press, press, press
Cardi don't need more press
Kill 'em all, put them hoes to rest
Walk in, bulletproof vest
Please tell me who she gon' check
Murder scene, Cardi made a mess
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Press, press, press, press
Pop up, guess who, bitch?
Pop up, guess who, bitch?M-M-M-Murda
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I think us, bad bitches, is a gift from God 
I think you broke hoes need to get a job 
Now I'm a boss, I write my own name on the checks 
Pussy so good, I say my own name during sex
I might smack a bitch 'cause I felt like it
Gucci shoes and a belt like it
Said that Cardi is his favorite fragrance
I'm a rich bitch and I smell like it
I'm in a boss bitch mood, ayy, these heels are Givenchy, ho
These are some boss bitch shoes
If you ain't no boss bitch, move, ayy
For the record, I set record record sales
I like niggas that been in and outta jail
They said by now that I'll be finished, hard to tell 
My little fifteen minutes lasting long as hell, huh?
Left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
Look, broke hoes do what they can 
Good girls do what they told 
Bad bitches do what they want 
That's why a bitch is so cold
I'm a gangsta in a dress, I'm a bully in the bed
Only time that I'm a lady's when I lay these hoes to rest
The coupe is roofless, but I get top in it
I'm provocative, it's my prerogative
80K just to know what time is it
Cardi rockin' it, go buy stock in it
Spend what I want, ain't no limit
I say what I want, I ain't never been timid
Only real shit comes out my mouth and only real niggas go in it
Leave his texts on read, leave his balls on blue
Put it on airplane mode so none of those calls come through
Here's a word to my ladies, don't you give these niggas none 
If they can't make you richer, they can't make you cum 
I left a nigga on read 'cause I felt like it
Dress me down in that Raf, Saint Laurent jacket
Dapper, dapper, I look fine, and my checks divine
No wonder, wonder why I do whatever I like
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I do
I do what I like, I do, I doThat boy Cassius!

Beyoncé on my stereo, "Resentment" on repeat
I'ma make your bowl of cereal with a teaspoon of bleach
Serve it to you like, "Here you go, nigga, bon appétit"

You risk your whole home for a ho from the bar?
You really want them hoes? You can have them bitches

Please Look, they gave a bitch two options: strippin' or lose
Used to dance in a club right across from my school
I said "dance" not "fuck", don't get it confused
Had to set the record straight 'cause bitches love to assume
Mama couldn't give it to me, had to get it at Sue's
Lord only knows how I got in those shoes
I was covered in dollars, now I'm drippin' in jewels
A bitch play with my money? Might as well spit in my food
Bitches hated my guts, now they swear we was cool
Went from makin' tuna sandwiches to makin' the news
I started speakin' my mind and tripled my views
Real bitch, only thing fake is the boobs
Get money, go hard, you're mothafuckin' right
Never been a fraud in my mothafuckin' life
Get money, go hard, damn fuckin' right
Stunting on these bitches out of mothafuckin' spite
Ain't no runnin' up on me, went from nothin' to glory
I ain't tellin' y'all to do it, I'm just tellin' my story
I don't hang with these bitches 'cause these bitches be corny
And I got enough bras, y'all ain't gotta support me
I went from rag to riches, went from WIC to lit, nigga
Only person in my fam to see six figures
The pressure on your shoulders feel like boulders
When you gotta make sure that everybody straight
Bitches stab you in your back while they smilin' in your face
Talking crazy on your name, trying not to catch a case
I waited my whole life just to shit on niggas
Climbed to the top floor so I can spit on niggas
Said "I was just tryna chill and make bangers" 
Tell all these old bitches they in danger 
The thing on my hip whip bitches into shape 
That's what I call a fuckin' waist trainer
You gon' run up on who and do what? 
I think y'all got your story screwed up 
I came here to ball, is you nuts?
I don't want your punk-ass man, I'm too tough 
I'm the one that's killin' shit, hands down 
If you got a problem with me, say it now 
'Cause I don't wanna hear no sneak dissin' 
'Specially not from one you weak bitches
I'm on go like I don't see no stop lights 
I'm steppin' out every day, prom night 
So if it's all love, show me love then 
'Cause you hatin' on a bitch, that's what it sounds like
Beast mode, that's how I give it up, nigga
Hoodie, low, that's how I'm pullin' up
Just 'cause I been on the road don't mean I been on the run
And you gon' have to learn to hold your tongue or hold the gun 
And we all know you ain't that type 
I smack you and the bitch that you act like 
I started gettin' money, bitches upset 
They remind me of my pussy, bitches mad tight
Nails done, hair laid, keep 'em both laced 
Co-come through shinin' with a Rollie bust face 
He-headshot, headshot, tell 'em closed case
Ain't no bitch spittin' like this since '08
I don't trust no nigga, I don't fear no bitch 
Whole life been through some fucked up shit 
They say I'm too that, oh, I'm too this
When you see what I've seen, you end up like this 
I walked into the label, "Where the check at?" 
Cardi B on the charts, ain't expect that
Where that bitch that was claimin' she a threat? 
I'ma put a Louboutin where her neck at
They say I'm too ratchet, they say I act wild 
I'm tryna whip the foreign like a bad ass child 
They caught me slippin' once, tell 'em try that now 
Cardi B, know it's me, hear that "blap" sound 
Man, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Look myself in the mirror, I say we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten
Yeah, but I get up ten
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch 
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me 
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy 
I'ma make a fuck nigga feel me 
Said I'ma do a broke bitch filthy 
We gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten 
Yeah, I said we gon' win
Knock me down nine times but I get up ten, bitch I'm livin' my best life, yeah, yeah
I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's, you know 
Said I'm livin' my best life
Said I'm livin' my best life
Made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt"
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt"
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I'm like Big Pop' mixed with 2Pac, I'm like Makaveli 
You need some, Little Caesar's pizza, I be hot and ready 
Nigga, you a pussy and a rat, you like Tom and Jerry
Nigga, you ain't ballin', you just talkin', that's that commentary 
I was in the field, man, I slaved for this 
Had to talk to God, dropped down, and prayed for this
To my surprise, He replied, said, "You made for this"
I seen the car I wanted, then I went and paid for it, cash cash
Hit the Tay-K, I hit the race, hit the dash dash
That's when they came for me on Twitter with the backlash
"#CardiBIsSoProblematic" is the hashtag
I can't believe they wanna see me lose that bad
They talkin' junk and they stink, these hoes mad trash
I'm gigglin', can't let the devil have the last laugh
Ain't no more beefin', I'm just keepin' to myself
I'm my own competition, I'm competin' with myself 
I told y'all, I'm livin' my best life 
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends

Dreams pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like 
You don't like money, I can see it your eye
You don't like winnin', I can see it in your tie
Better be careful with these women when you trickin', send it fly 
She count money in her sleep and she don't ever spend the night
But she trappin' and she had to make it happen for her life
Don't be mad because she havin', shit, you had it your whole life
We had baggage on our flight, we had badges on our asses
You got passes in your life, you had gadgets on your bike
God work magic, God work magic, God work magic in my life 
And that guala like Iyanla 'cause that bag just fixed my life 
And y'all know good and damn well I don't want no champagne 
But can we please get some more champagne? 
Please, no Andre, G like 'Venchy
Reach like 'Bron James, pep talk from Yoncé
'Member my hands had ash like Pompeii
Now they hold cash, won't peak like Dante
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends

You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
Dreams fillin' up, I'm like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like
I said I never had a problem showin' y'all the real me
Hair when it's fucked up, crib when it's filthy
Way-before-the-deal me, strip-to-pay-the-bills me
'Fore I fixed my teeth, man, those comments used to kill me
But never did I change, never been ashamed
Never did I switch, story stayed the same
I did this on my own, I made this a lane
Y'all gotta bear with me, I been through some things
Went from small-ass apartments to walkin' red carpets
Pissy elevators, now every dress is tailored
This some real-life fairy tale Binderella shit
I got further than them hoes said I will ever get
And that only goes to show that only God knows
I took pictures with Beyoncé, I met Mama Knowles
I'm the rose that came from the concrete and arose
I'm like gold, I'm life goals, man, I'm chosen, I'm floatin', ayy
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life
I told y'all, I said I'm livin' my best life 
I made a couple M's with my best friends
Turned all my L's into lessons 
You see the whip pullin' up, it's like "skrrt" 
Dreams pullin' up, I'm like "skrrt" 
I'm livin' my best life
It's my birthday, at least that's what I'm dressed like

Pop that pussy like poppin' pussy is goin' out of style
Pop that pussy while you work, pop that pussy up at church
Pop that pussy on the pole, pop that pussy on the stove
Make that pussy slip and slide, like you from the 305
Put your tongue out in the mirror, pop that pussy while you drive
Spread them asscheeks open, make that pussy crack a smile
Lock your legs 'round that nigga, make him give your ass a child 
Gimme some neck, gimme a check

Oh, 'fore you go, don't leave me in the cold
If I took you everywhere, then well, you wouldn't know how to walk
If I spoke on your behalf, then well, you wouldn't know how to talk
If I gave you everything and everything is what I bought
I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought
I didn't mean to make you mad, I don't like when you upset
I'ma call you later on, baby girl, don't you forget

I can take it all back, I never cared 'bout what you thought 
Look, gunshot, gunshot
Thought you heard about me, must not, must not
Last nigga did me dirty, dirty
Like a bathroom in a truck stop, truck stop
Now my heart, it feels like Brillo, I'm hard like armadillo
Can't be no nigga ex, I could only be his widow 
That's a fact, dressed in black, my heart break, bones will crack
I be chilling, watching Oxygen, my favorite show is Snapped

Rather see you in a hearse
Than see you with some other bitch, huh

Don't do much, he get hard when I bust wines
No straws for this juice box, gulp one time
Last nigga I was with went insane
'Cause my head game over hills like I'm lookin' for the sunshine
I'm a Bronx bitch birthed from the hip-hop
From the block to the tick tock in the Patek watch
Quick drop with the cash, couldn't fit the Ziploc
Grips locked, get your shit popped in my flip flops
Wealthy now, but every dollar, I still want it all
Now he wanna nail me, I could give your man a cure
You gotta mail me, but I don't check my spam at all
Never feel what you're sayin' like I'm usin' Anbesol
Travel all around the states getting nice checks
I was tourin' off a tape, I had a hype set
Is that the reason all these niggas wanna pipe next?
I'm a creep, bitch, see his dick through his Nike Tech
Got 'em all scared, I ain't even strike yet
Wire up jaws when I swing if the mic stretch

KSR 
Hah, it's Cardi, ayy
Said, "I'm the shit, they can't fuck with me if they wanted to"
Umm...
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar 
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo a'lante y tú atrás 
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cuero', ¡wuh! 
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amiga' 
Si tú no hace' dinero tú no eres de las mías
¿Di'que que tú puedes contra mi? Vamo' a averiguar
Vamo' allá, soy rapera y también yo sé pelear
You in the club, tú chapeando, yo llegando y cobrando
Siempre estoy depositando, 'tán cansao' de mí en el banco 
En verdad, no me importa a quien yo le caiga mal
Llevo dos mixtapes en seis meses, nadie me puede parar
I don't bother with these hoes, don't let these hoes bother me
All these bitches son mis hijas, to'as se copian de mí
Mira, yo me robo a tu novio , hago coro con tu esposo
Tu jevo 'tá aficia'o, sé que lo tengo sabroso
Yo se lo pongo en el poso, I'm like, "Okay" 
Yo le pido lo que quiera, él me compra mi cartera y una jeepeta
Lo tengo tan aficia'o que hasta me paga mi renta
Soy la más dura en la calle, know you prolly heard of me
Me busca, me arreglé los dientes, hope you hoes know it ain't cheap
Pago la renta de mi madre y no dependo de nadie
Si no hablas de dinero es mejor que ni me hables
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo a'lante y tú atrás
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cuero' 
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero
Si me ves no me saludes, tú y yo no somos amiga' 
Si tú no hace' dinero tú no eres de las mías
¿Dique que tú puedes contra mi? Suelta eso, bi
Nigga, please, to mis show son pago, ninguno gratis
Créeme a mí, no hagas que yo coja aquí un felony
I'm the big beef for well, these niggas know my pedigree
Honestly, I got bad bitches that wanna fuck with me
Suck on me, ride me crazy y dejarme seco a mí
Que yo no 'taba sonando, que no 'taba haciendo bulla
Dique que estaba apagao y pegao con la jeva tuya
Ando con mi primo Lucas, un corito sano y con par de putas
Lo que tu gasta' una noche en botellas, eso yo lo gasto en refilles de hookah
Los cueros dicen: "Messiah 'ta de pinga, porque nos da y después se embala"
A lo mejor ella pensaba que yo iba a darle y después mudarla
Andamo' en la calle, o sea en la lleca 
Andamo' fumando peyote, purple haze en mi yerba
Hablan mierda a tu espalda y cuando te ven ellos no dicen na'
Ando con mi hermano DJ Hova and tonight we gonna shake the block
Said, "Lil bitch, you can't fuck with me ni aunque tú quieras"
That's a fact, Cardi B y de el trap soy la mamá
Hit the store y compro todo lo que quiera comprar
I'm a boss, you a worker, yo alante y tú atrás
Esta canción es pa' mis goonies y mis cueros
Un show mío lo que tú haces en un año entero

Hahaha
Now how much times do I gotta prove these niggas wrong?
And how much times I gotta show these bitches I ain't soft?
How many shows I gotta sell out 'fore you get the cost?
Why they really tryna front like I ain't hit the charts?
All these labels, throwin' deals from left to right
But I ain't givin' in until they get them numbers right
All these people think that this shit happen overnight
All that flexin' they be doin', shit is all a hype
No tolerance for a hatin' bitch talkin' shit
Only time I hold my tongue is when I'm suckin' dick
So when I see you in the streets, yeah, it's fuckin' lit
And don't be talkin' all that sorry shit, don't flip the script
I see the lights, I hear the hype, I hit the mic
I kill the show, I get my dough, I catch a flight
I see a hater, I'm runnin' down, it's on sight
I throw my hands, I hit em' left, I hit em' right
They sleepin' on me just because I used to strip
But it's all good 'cause now they wanna get up in my VIP
Blowin' up my phone, sayin' everythin' I touch is lit
Actin' corn and wanna fuck me like they wasn't talkin' shit, woah
I let 'em live, let the shady motherfuckers live
Get them the price then it's time to show them what it is
Don't got the bat? Well then what you really tryna pitch?
Don't waste my time, I ain't never been no average bitch
Not to mention, I did my tour and that shit was winnin'
Independent, the headline, award of feelin'
I thank the Lord for all the blessings that he is given
I love the fans, they fill me up with their ammunition
I don't really talk shit but now I gotta off this
I don't know why bitches think we work in the same office
Corny bitches tryna keep up? Look exhausted
Wave the white flag, girl, you might as well just forfeit
My ex told me I was never gon' be shit
Lookie, lookie now, lookie now, nigga I'm that bitch
What you thought? Yeah, you really lost, now you kinda sick
But I ain't never need a nigga, I was always on my shit, yeah
I used to stare at magazines on the train
Lookin' at these models like, "I gotta be this one day"
Fuck around, got myself a name, now I'm gettin' paid
Left the corny bitches in the grave, so they throwin' shadeI'm your...
Yo, I'm Cardi B with the wicked flow
Ask them, I keep them niggas on their tippy toes
Nick-nack-paddy-wack, give a dog a bone

Pussy got him fucked up, I think he overdosed
But I ain't Travis Scott, I ain't got no antidote
Antidote, antidote
I think I like that
I think I like that
I think I like that

Yo, some people know me as a stripper hoe
But stripper hoes get the money and blow digits though
A lot of bitches talkin' down on me like I'm a joke
Talk shit, I'll fuck your man, send him back hella broke
I'm laughin', but I really mean it though
I'm on another level like I'm playin' Mario
These bitches can't see me, even with a telescope
Every day I'm shittin' on 'em, I don't flush the toilet bowl
Ew! Cause I be workin' and workin'
All these heads I be turnin', they on my body like surgeons
I think they see my conversion
That's why they be lurkin', but their feelings be hurtin'
Or remember when I wanna dance at certain clubs
And they told me, "No, no, that's a dub"
Now they the same niggas blowin' up my phone
Wantin' me to host, oh word? That's a dub
Bands
I think I like that
I think I like that

I think I like that
When I come up in the building I initiate
I'm the reason why the fuckers gotta renovate

Never thought we'd be gettin' booked in different states
Before the century they didn't even look this way
Now they wanna eat my ass like a skirt steak
Got 'em sending gifts, it's not even my birthday
You niggas soft and I meant that in the worst way
Oh you bitches suckin' dick just to get a bag

Soon as I land on the Lear 
Piguets, they wet, tears 
488, hit the gears 
Suicide doors, Britney Spears 
I'm boujee, so, bitch, don't get near 
Criss Angel, make dope disappear 
Hit the gas, it got flames out the rears 
It's a race to the bag, get the mills 
Ride the dick like a BMX

I love when he go on tour
'Cause he cums more, when I see him less
I get up set off, I turn Offset on
I told him the other day
Man, we should sell that porn
Yeah, Cardi B, I'm back, bitches

Same lips that be talkin' 'bout me

If Cardi the QB, I'm Nick Lombardi
Pull up in the space coupe, I done linked with Marty
I can actually afford to get a pink Bugatti
"Ayo, Nick, didn't you just do a hit with Gotti?"
That too, but my niggas send hits like Gotti
It's a wrap, like them things on the head of a Saudi
Bitch, you my son, go and sit on the potty 
Brand new Chanels 
I scuffed 'em runnin' from 12 
Ain't make no commitment with none of you bitches
'Cause money is treatin' me well 
If Nicki should show me her titty
Right hand on the Bible, I swear I won't tell 
If I get to play with that kitty
I wonder how many platinums we gon' sell 
Pop a Perc and catch a feel 
Now I cannot feel the wheel 
My chest bad, give me chills
And the left hand on Richard Mille 
Not the watch, but the price on the ice
If you don't know what that is 
Motorsport, motorville

I like those Balenciagas , the ones that look like socks
I like going to the jeweler, I put rocks all in my watch 
I like texts from my exes when they want a second chance 
I like proving niggas wrong, I do what they say I can't 
They call me Cardi Bardi, banging body, spicy mami, hot tamale
Hotter than a Somali, fur coat, Ferrari 
Hop out the stu', jump in the coupe 
Big Dipper on top of the roof
Flexing on bitches as hard as I can
Eating halal, driving the Lam'
Told that bitch I'm sorry though 
'Bout my coins like Mario 
Yeah, they call me Cardi B
I run this shit like cardio
Woo, Facts
Diamond district in the jag 
Certified, you know I'm gang, gang, gang, gang 
Drop the top and blow the brains, woo 
Oh, he's so handsome, what's his name? Yeah 
Oh, I need the dollars, cha-ching 
Beat it up like piñatas 
Tell the driver, close the curtains 
Bad bitch make you nervous 
Ich mag die Liebe, mag die Stille, mag den Hustle, den wir leben 
Hass' die Falschheit vieler Blender, aber lieb' Ganovenehre 
Ich mag Leute, die nicht quatschen, sondern lieber stille Wasser
Und statt Gold sammeln wie Inkas lieber 'ne Finca für meinen Vater 
Meine Gang regiert den Plaza, alle meine Jungs sind on fuego
Was für Hahn im Korb? Ich seh' maximal nur Calimeros
Gangster schweigen und genießen, also quatsch mir nicht, Pendejo
Denn ein Rückgrat ist mehr wert als die Taschen voll Dinero
Geld kommt, Geld geht, aber Familie bleibt
Der innere Kreis elitär und klein
Auch wenn der Teufel viele Gesichter zeigt
Gott sei Dank nicht meins 
Jeder testet, jeder redet, jeder schneidet sich ins Fleisch
Ich halt' meine Leute, halt' meine Ziele, meine Versprechen immer ein 
Courage über Fame 
Und lieber Wölfe, die noch beißen, als die Köter, die nur bell'n
Klasse über Geld
Und lieber Loyalität für meine Gang als den Erfolg nur für mich selbst

Pull up like huh?

Heads turn left and right, they wonder who's her?
Cardi B, duh
Bitch don't front
You on my Gram all day, don't play dumb
Came up from the slums
The dirty, dirty Bronx
Where niggas quick to clip your shit, no fair ones
You gotta keep a gun, but beef to me is fun
I never back down, been this way since day one
They shit on me before, thought I was just a stupid hoe
They tight now, they realize they was sleeping on gold
Took me one year man, and now I'm doin' shows
Now they wanna take pics with me, hold on let me pose
Believe me, I easily can do a bitch greasy
I'll give it to you just how you like it girlll
Cardi B in full effect, couple bitches upset
Couple niggas wanna hit it and they can't so they stressed
This is how I do
I make a fool out these bitches
They be thinking they tough
This is how I do
I make these niggas spend their money
Then I show them no love
This is how I do
If the bag not involved
Then you know it's a dub
This is how I do
They ain't fuck with me before now I gotta stunt
Cardi in tune, bitches make room
Test me? The gat goes CLICK, CLACK, BOOM
Gangsta Bitch, oooh, Volume 2

Had me fucked up when you was fucking with that bitch
Making power moves
Goin' 50 on 'em
Same ones that played me

Back to back with it, goin' Drizzy on 'em
Now they tight, they gotta watch me make a milli on 'em
Ha-Ha !
Yo, yo, Remember, remember nigga when you told me that I was gonna work in that strip club Divas on 177th in the Bronx for the rest of my life? Well guess what nigga? Now i'm the fucking diva

GANGSTA!Them motherfuckers be like, "But what type of niggas will wife you?"
My type of niggas will wife me! The type of niggas that like bitches that pop off and suck dick all day motherfuckin' long, bitch
Thanks to all my followers that always defended me, y'all like my god brothers and god sisters. I would dead jump in your fight, I would dead jump in your fight. Now what's poppin?

Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off
Weaves, off
Rings, off
Everythin', off
I'm startin' to lose my patience, weak bitches hatin'
Bitches throwing subs like I won't kick your face in
Baby mama's mad 'cause I'm in first place, and
When it comes to you bitch, there's no conversation
I been to give it up grimy, I'm the Bronx bitch, I'm feisty
"Cardi why you feisty?" Shut up bitch, fight me
NY raised and so you know it's very likely
That when I hear some shit that I don't like, I get hype B
Who would wanna wife me? Your nigga wanna wife me
You think 'cause I'm a stripper hoe, that nigga won't think twice B?
Put this pussy on his face, rde that shit nicely
Set his ass up, then you really ain't gon' like me
So what you tryna do? You and you and you
I feel some type a way, a bitch finna get loose
Tell me what's the deal? I'm 'bout to start the hill
The wig is comin' off, shit 'bout to get real
Who wanna pop off?
Who wanna start war?
They talkin' shit?
I'm takin' tops off
Jeans, off
Weaves, off
Rings, off
Everythin', off

Got beef with Cardi B? I'm poppin' off
Shit get hectic? I'ma drop it off
Oh you shinin'? Your chain and your watch is off
You was never with this shit, nigga, knock it off
Youse a pussy, and your whole block is soft
You caught feelings, could she ain't even drop you off
You thought that bag was gettin' you pussy, not at all
You was gettin' lied, you ain't know she made that call
To the dog's dinner, and they starvin'
I gotta feed all 'em
I'maget that nigga, you gon' get that bitch
What they thought switched 'cause we both got rich?
Nah, we on the same time
You got yours, I got mine
You got a problem, get in line
It's Cardi B, and 2 times

Shit, that bitch six three and she bodied
Superman calves, and her shoulder somethin' retarded
I ain't backin' down, Cardi got the heart regardless
You gon' have to knock me out if you think I'ma forfeit
Gang gang, squad up, and have my niggas all on it
Pay a couple niggas and they had you out in a coffin
And I put that on my life, I really don't do this often
But the way I'm feelin' now, like whatever, I'm on it
Have you laid out on the stretcher with your socks off
Had the pastor prayin', like, "Sorry for your, loss"
Throw dirt on my name, you better pop off
My name ring bells like Mayweather, box off
I'm Cardi B, east coast newest contender
5'3" lookin' good with the nails bananas
Freddy Kruger on these bitches, I cut their lights off
Should have read the memo, Cardi B pops offYou know, people underestimated me
And making me feel like I'm never gonna amount to shit because I used to be a stripper
It feels like I'm getting whipped in the back, with words
But you know what?
They don't see the bigger picture
I had to feed myself, I had to feed my family
But you know what?
Just here me out
Lord forgive me for my sins
Forgive me for the crazy shit I wish I never did
I'm simply just a young hood girl tryna win
I just want it all, and I gon' pretend
Like I ain't never had to suck a dick to pay my rent
I'm tryna get my family out the hood and new cribs
I wanna finish paying my mothers new whip
I do it for a cause, so understand the kid
I want my little girl to go to school in Fort Lee
Schools in the hood, got him crazy, man he three
And it's fucked that it ain't how it's supposed to be
He should be counting 123's and ABC's
And momma used to beat my ass like every week
That's because she can't have nothing but love for me
I wanna spoil her so much, oh lord please
That's my everything
My everything, my family
You know what?
Even when I was stripping, like bitches was worried 'bout the wrong things
Oh they want red bottoms, they want the biggest cars
Like I'm worried 'bout my father stop cab driving
Before he turn sixty, and my mom stop being a cashier before she fifty like
That's why I'm working so hard out here
That's why I go so hard
Not for me, but for them though
You feel me?
Note to self, for my sister Hennessy
Try and go to school, finish up and get degrees
Don't be fucking trick niggas, just so you can eat
That's the shit I did and it really makes me weak
I would close my eyes, dying for it to be over
The thought of a stranger inside, I just can't be sober
Dirty ass breath, breathing all over my shoulders
Ain't no bitch gon' tell you that, just respect the soldier
And I wanna tell my dad, you don't gotta cab
Drive for two whole weeks just to make a stack
You don't gotta drive no more, I'm gon' change all that
I put that on my everything, I'm gon' pray for that
You know when I was a little girl I used to tell my mom
"Hey mom, when I grow up, I'm gonna buy you a house, I'm gonna buy you a car"
Until I turned eighteen, it's like damn, I can't even get me my own apartment
So, it's just like, now that I'm in this position I'm gonna
I'm gonna take full advantage of it
Like oh my gosh, I can't wait till I get to surprise my mom
Like, "Hey, I didn't went to college, but look, look at me mom, look at me now, look, look mom, look, look at your house, This is your house! Not mines, but yours, and I bough it for you!"Lyrics from Snippet
Bardi! 
Booty so stupid it's a motherfucking retard
I'm from the Bronx, but my booty from the DR
Booty so big I don't need to have titties 
Booty prolly get a job at Magic City 
Booty so poppin' have your girl doin' research
I'm the white stain on the bottom of his t-shirt
Booty so big have you calling outta work, nigga
Drop it down, fuck around, I might hurt niggas
Booty so big that it swallow up panties
Same with these hoes, swallow up the Xanny

Booty on the track, fuck around and win a Grammy
They call me Cardi, code red, lightskinned, bone legged
Tell him throw more bread, I put it on his forehead
I remember when I used to pay bills with it
Now I just 
Booty so big have to question a nigga dick game
Booty so big that it got its own nickname
Booty so big that it got its own ZIP code
Booty so big Rollin', rollin', all my bitches rollin'

Pussy worth like a million dollars
I think your nigga got expensive taste
I'm not a bum bitch, I'm a boss bitch
You sideline, I'm center stage

If it don't make me cum or it don't get me paid
If it's not the money then it's "poof, be gone"
Steal your man with my Doobie on
Whole team full of bad bitches
And that Louis Vuitton our uniform

I hope all of your homies got money, nigga
'Cause all of my bitches got bread
Look, got a home girl out the west coast
Swear to God, I love that bitch
Ask about us, any club
They gon' tell you we run that shit
I'm like the strip club, Mariah Carey
Dominican, Halle Berry
Hair be laid, bills be paid
Still put bread on my nigga commissary
If I want somethin', it's, "Whatever, cop it"
Balenciaga, tell 'em check the closet

When I got bitches that's coming for me like we on the same level, that's a no
These bitches is nowhere near my level

Yeah your girl is overbooked
You really think my attention's gonna catch you
Mixtape been out for 3 weeks
And already charting on Billboards

All of a sudden they proud of me
And wanna be hopping on my dick

But stop on learning how to suck and fuck and live free a little
And bitch know your worth, don't show it all, let em see a little
And if he ain't bout the money, hit the brakes, but do speed a little
I remember having no money, sleeping at my ex house
My mom couldn't take me at the time, so she had to kick me out
But I'm not mad at her one bit, cause I don't think I would've took this route
I had to go get it on my own
Im just glad I figured it out
Like I been through a lot
And it wasn't easy to escape
That's why it really bothers me when motherfuckers got something to say
And just to set the record straight
 to stop a J
If they ain't SwiftOnDemand, then they ain't help me in no way
I swear they be wanting so much credit
But don't wanna give none when it's due
Slept on ya girl for so long
Now wanna come hopping out the blue
Nah bruh shit don't work like that
Well at least it don't in my book
Cause if you fuck with me hard, and I fuck with you, then there's no other way to look
Imma hit em again and again
Get so much music, it go to ya friend
Hitting a tour and the shade gon end
Hmm that's why they looking for revengeCardi

Mis tenis Balenciaga me reciben en la entrada

Josh X
I see the pain in your eyes
And truth is, only the strong survive
And you still here, so from here you only gon' rise
Spread them wings so they can tell you how far you gonna fly
You don't gotta pop them pills
I know just how you feel
I know there's a lot of fake love
But there's love that's actually real
But that can't stop you now
You're already on the battle field
Took everythin' that came your way
Almost at the top of the hill, fly, baby, fly
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That I will never give up
Don't be so quick to just give in
If you give up now, how you gon' win?
I know them stressful nights made you and the pills best friends
I know it feels good, but this shit just got to end
I'm countin' on you, boo
Put this peer pressure on you
If I overcame that shit
I know you can make it too
I don't want to see you lose
There's other ways to heal that bruise
I know you can make it to see
What's at the end of the solution, shine, baby, shine
Never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now
It took a long time to heal now
And you know that I know, and you know, and they know
That we'll never give up
We're almost at the top of the hill now

Now what about your career as an artist
And what was your inspiration
Well you know I've been writing rhymes and I've been into music ever since I was in high school. But you know when you young you have these dreams of becoming this big star or being an artist. But your dreams start getting crushed by priorities and bills you know. After I got kicked out of my house when I was 18, its like I didn't have 200 dollars to invest in a studio session like I had to pay bills I had to pay my rent. Now that I'm making that shmoney, its like, why not invest on my dreams that I always dreamt of. You know what I'm saying. You got to follow your dreams, like fuck you meanHaitian V: Wha— come one man!
Cardi B: Yo, what is your problem? Why you knocking on the door like that? You know my uncle on the run. You— I thought you was the police
Haitian V: Cardi! Why you keep me waiting like that all the time? I've wait for a long time. The garbage man— They, they asked me if I live here, I say no. Why you leave me outside like that?
Cardi B: You see that’s why I told you I’m only available before 8PM. Before the stores closing. When you gonna take me shopping again? Like I keep wearing the same outfit over and over again, look at my nails, look at my toes like—
Haitian V: You need your nails done—I give you the money. You want your toes done—I give you the money. You want your hair—I go to Malaysia to get it for you. No problem. The diamonds in your fingers. You don’t know who help me get that. Leonardo DiCaprio from Blood Diamond help me to get that for you. You don't know that doll. They tell Beyonce and Kim Kardashian—they say listen it’s only one and it has to go to Haitian for him to give it to his girlfriend
Cardi B: Nobody tell you to do all that. You coulda— You coulda went to Fordham. You coulda went to Fordham and get a goddamn ring
Haitian V: Let’s stop this— This garbage foolishness. Okay baby?
Cardi B: What I told you about calling me baby? Like don’t call me baby. I don’t like when you call me baby like you just make us look crazy in public, like stop calling me that. Stop calling me that
Haitian V: Cardi
Cardi B: Don’t call me baby
Haitian V: Cardi, why you talking about I can’t call you baby? What I’m supposed to call you? Homie? A Nigga?
Cardi B: Fucking
Haitian V: Nigga? I don’t know what I’m supposed to call you—
Cardi B: I’m a fucking punch him. This is why I need another one
Haitian V: Baby, what you grumbling to yourself like that? I buy you  I pay the rent. I pay your cell phone, not even my cell phone
Cardi B: Alright, alright!

I was hopin' that we can have this moment alone
But ain't no secret that the internet is safe with
And with these blogs, it seems that nothing is sacred
I ain't even need to and I love you to death
Performed live on TV, I hid you under my dress
We did the ruffles, the fur coats a hundred different ways
But seems like you getting larger every day
I'm overwhelmed, the pressure startin' to swell
The time to turn in my album is winding down
So I locked in, started workin', I was driven
Hearing public opinions about my private decisions
And that right there, see, love to drive you crazy
Complete strangers talkin' 'bout my baby
Comin' from people that never used to check for me
They wrote opinions but nothin' off the registry
Cardi, you so stupid, you gon' ruin your career
I know I won't, but if I did, I wouldn't care
I started winnin' when the whole world was doubtin' on me
Think I'ma lose when my lil' baby countin' on me?Bardi in a 'Rari, diamonds all over my body
