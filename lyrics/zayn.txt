All of the windows
Inside this room?

It's just a cruel existence like it's no point hoping at all
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
Give me something, oh, but you say nothing
What is happening to me?
I don't wanna live forever, 'cause I know I'll be living in vain
And I don't wanna fit wherever
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I just wanna keep calling your name until you come back home
I'm sitting eyes wide open and I got one thing stuck in my mind
Wondering if I dodged a bullet or just lost the love of my life
Baby, baby, I feel crazy
Up all night, all night and every day
I gave you something, but you gave me nothing
What is happening to me?

Give me something, oh, but you say nothing

And she don't, she don't, she don't give a fuck about what I need
And I can't tell you why because my brain can't equate it
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it
It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's you
I won't, I won't, I won't cover the scars, I'll let 'em bleed
So my silence, so my silence won't be mistaken for peace
Am I wrong for wanting us to make it?
Tell me your lies because I just can't face it
It's you, it's you, it's you
It's you, it's you it's you
Could it be that it's a lesson that I never had to learn?
I looked at it like a blessing and now it's just a curse
I don't know why, I don't know why
It's you, it's you
It's you, it's you, it's youHope I only leave good vibes on your living room floor
It hurts so bad that I didn't when you asked for more
Your dad probably loves me more than he ever did now
'Cause I finally got out
Yeah, we finally knocked down
'Cause sometimes it's better that way
Gotta let it go so your heart don't break
'Cause I love you
Yeah, baby, I love you
Just this one time, hear what I'm tryna say
Know you might not feel quite the same way
But I love you
I tell you, I love you
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm making you cry
Why wait to hate, can we save love?
I fell in, I'm falling, I'm for you
I can't let you fall through the floor too
It's a gamble to take any more of you
Still in my mind sometimes, I must admit it
Like it's a crime on trial, I got acquitted
Me and you wasn't meant, we wasn't fitted
Like it's a glove, I hated to admit it
'Cause obviously, we go back
So why would we ruin that?
In too deep, we're rearranged
Now you wanna ask for names
We can't let this fruit go bad
Sayin' things we can't take back
In too deep, we're rearranged
Say you feel the same
Why? Why wait to fight?
Give it a try
Or I'll say goodbye while it's right
Can we save tears in your eyes?
I'm watching you cry
Why wait to hate, can we save love?Fucked and I want ya
Looked and I loved ya
Stuck, now I need ya
Hopin' I'd see ya
Touch, wanna feel her
Much can't conceal her, no
Hiding all your features
Sliding on the filters
Should be you that's in the middle
Don't be hiding what you thinkin'
I been fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya
'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is
If you wanna, let me know where you are, then
I can come and love 
I can come and love 
I can come and love ya 
I can come and love ya 
What did I tell ya? Typo said I loved ya
Didn't mean what I was sayin'
No, I wasn't playin', just confused
Was tryna play it smooth
Stood spinnin' in this room
In this state I been consumed
State I been consumed
'Cause I'm fucked and I want ya, I can't even text ya
'Cause my fingers ain't working, but my heart is
If you wanna, let me know where you are, then
I can come and love

Show me in the same light
Feels right when we take flight
Clothes off 'cause she's so soft
This ain't a fair fight
I wanna shed light on the subject
I'll get her wetter than ever
Four letters are never the question
She likes when I'm messy
And I like when she's undressing
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it
Here with you 'cause you got the right vibe
Seems like you probably got a dope mind
But it's gotta be the right time
We're only good for the night time
I see through your demeanor, baby, I'm a pleaser
I go out my way to treat you, but I can't be a teacher
'Cause I’m a problem with problems, I know who I am and I'm not no good
You can have me tonight or never, I thought you understood
Baby, some people are meant to be loved and others just make it
So take what I'm willing to give and love it or hate it
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it
Don't stop what you're doing
Don't stop what you're 
I don't, I don't really know 
I don't, I don't really care 
Maybe keep it on the low 
Stories that I don't wanna share 
You're looking in the wrong place for my love 
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love 
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing it
You're looking in the wrong place for my love
Don't think because you're with me, this is real
You're looking in the wrong place for my love 
Don't stop what you're doing 'cause I like how you're doing itI've done this before
Not like this
I don't drink to get drunk
I feel all the right funk
If there's something I want
I'll take all the right wrongs
Now, I'm gonna stay in my zone
I'm tired of picking that bone
And I can't be bothered
To fight it no more, no
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm living on a wire
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm living on a wire
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
Time for me to move on
So many hours have gone
Heart beats the pump of my blood
No strings for you to pull on
You've got your tongue in your cheek
So pardon if I don't speak
Can't tune my chords
Into your songs, no
Numb on a roof, set it on fire
Just to give me proof, I'm living on a wire
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now 
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
Flashing lights, so say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
So say what you wanna say, what you wanna
So say what you wanna say, what you gotta say, now
So say what you wanna say, what you want
Shame is you won't say that to my face
I've done this before
Not like this, not like this
I've done this before
Not like this, not like thisI'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
The voices screaming loud as hell
We don't care 'bout no one else
Nothing in the world could bring us down
Now we're so high among the stars without a worry
And neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
Too much drugs and alcohol
What the hell were we fighting for?
'Cause now the whole damn world will know
That we're too numb and just too dumb to change the story
Neither one, one of us wants to say we're sorry
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
Need a chance just to breathe, feel alive
And when the day meets the night, show me the light
Feel the wind and the fire, hold the pain deep inside
It's in my eyes, in my eyes
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I'd rather be anywhere, anywhere but here
I close my eyes and see a crowd of a thousand tears
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good years
I pray to God I didn't waste all my good years
All my good years
All my good yearsOnly you know me
The way you know me
Only you forgive me
When I'm sorry
Need you when I'm broken
When I'm fixed
Need you when I'm well
And when I'm sick
Friends that I rely on
Don't come through
They run like the river
But not you
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Whispers in the background
Behind closed doors
I got myself in a mess and without you, I'm in more
Oh, I'm a little drunk now
That's why I went to war
Oh yeah, you are my sober
When I'm on the floor
Can't see when I'm falling
Losing myself
But then I hear you calling
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
Need you when I'm hot and when I'm cold
Need you when I'm young
When I'm old
You won't be far
There you are
There you are
You're there with open arms
There you are
There you are
And I run
Only you know me the way you know me
Only you forgive me when I'm sorry
Even when I messed it up
There you are
(Need you when I'm, need you when I'm
Need you when I'm, need you when I'm)
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
When you're caught in the crowds
When you're up in the clouds
There you areThis love is tainted, I need you and I hate it
You're caught between a dream and a movie scene
In a way, you know what I mean
When the dark turns to mist, I just can't resist it
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
The things you do, the things you do
When you're looking like this, I just can't resist it
I know sometimes I hide it
But I can't this time cause it's gonna defeat me
But you won't believe me, believe me
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
I know, I know given the chance, I'd do it again
'Cause I can't help myself, 'cause I can't stop myself
I just love being a fool for you
'Cause I'm a fool for you and the things you do
I'm a fool for you and the things, the things you do
This love is taintedHey what's up? It's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late, but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
It's okay to want me, 'cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He can't love you like I would
He can't love you like I could
He don't know your body
He don't know your body
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would

He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I wouldI think we met and the time flies
I took your digits a while back
I think we fucked in the flashback
Won't leave my mind, kinda sidetracked
Felt good but now I feel bad
I think I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say
Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keepin' me up night and day
Keepin' me up night and day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothin' I can say but
I guess I want too much 
I just want love and lust 
You just can't love enough 
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
I never meant to, but I did though
I gotta keep it on the d-low
Then again, what the fuck do I know?
You're always on my mind so
Felt good but now I feel bad
I think I know I can't take it back
No, there's nothin' I can say
Must be an addiction
I wanted it all, didn't expect it to fall
Must be an affliction
I wanted to call, but I didn't call
Now it's keepin' me up night and day
Keepin' me up night and day
Must be an addiction
Now there's nothin' I can say but
I guess I want too much 
I just want love and lust 
You just can't love enough 
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
When the room becomes a game we play
White lines, they seem to turn to snakes
I guess I'll turn you 'way
Say white lies to your face
You know I know my place
Nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can say
Nothin' I can say
I guess I want too much 
I just want love and lust 
You just can't love enough 
That's why I need a touch
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch 
That's why I need a touch I'm sipping pink Lucozade
We're blazing on that new found haze
I'm seeing in the blacks and grays
I'm hoping that the basket sways
Left to right, sit and talk shit all night
Does that make it right for smoke?
Maybe, or am I just seeing shit?
Seeing the pain inside in this house of fear
You don't even wanna know about the things I hear
Quick fix, headlines shine bright, you're the fuckin' deer
I'm just wishing it's ambition that got you your position
You'll be fishing for far too long
You're the bad guy in this movie
And I ain't wrong, I don't breathe the pollution
And the only solution is making shit confusing
Ain't about who's winnin' or losin'
It's 'bout the path you're choosin'
Time heals pain and promotes self-soothing
When the scars are gone, you can't see bruising
Wanna take these watches, chains and gold rings
I'm getting caught up in the feelings that they bring
A lack of sanity, losing touch with reality
Smoking too much, it's starting to fog up my clarity
Traveling in the day but you're still looking far to me
Bulls eye, you the dot to me
Emotions splattered, same pattern, can't even begin to spot 'em
I'm sad about shit that never happened
No lies in my eyes, nothing but truth will leave my mouth
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
I'm tryna fuckin' scream but the words won't come out
She's older, I told her we ain't meant to be
It takes two not three, but I'm here anyway, I hope he's leaving soon
Started not to see the elephant in this room, disguise is your perfume
But the smell of it consumes, it takes all my mind
You can search the world but you will never find
I see everything you've done to me, be there, you run to me
I don't need to pace, I don't need the stamina
If this shit was it, girl, I probably woulda ran from ya
Kept runnin', outwit, cause you cunnin'
That outfit cause you stunnin', begging cause I'm losing mage
Got me feeling some type of way I can't explain
The fuck is going on? I think I got it wrong
When I told you I was over you, or were you under me?We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya
Right now, I can't see straight
Intoxicated, it's true, when I'm with you
I'm buzzing and I feel laced
I'm coming from a different phase when I'm with you
Another way now, like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancing all night long
Drunk all summer, drunk all summer
We've been drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down
We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, I need ya
Right now, I'm emotional
I lose control when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you
Another way now, like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancing all night long
Drunk all summer, drunk all summer
We've been drunk all summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down
We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, on ice
Late nights, red eyes
Amnesia, I need ya
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk 
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk, drunk, drunk, drunk
Drunk all summer
Drunk all summer
It's goin' around, yeahShe puts her spirit in a nightcap
She always knows where the crowd's at
She puts her mouth round the cigarette
I put it out 'cause she likes that
She always dance when it's raining
Hey, when's it startin', baby?
She looks at me like she's waiting
Making time go slow when they show her the table
Bright lights, but she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
She wants somebody to love, to hold her
She wants somebody to love in the right way
She wants somebody to love, to kiss her

Holding my hands so I won't leave
'Cause baby, don't wanna be lonely
She says, "I just want you to hold me"
Bright lights, but she's fading
Feels right, she's crazy
Bright lights, but she's fading

دل دے  ہے مجھے,  دل دے  ہے مجھے,  دل دے  ہے مجھے
Jab tak is mohabbat ka phool na khilay
Tab tak is dill ko sukoon na miley
Dil day mujhe, Dil day mujhe, Dil day mujhe
Until the flower of this love has blossomed
This heart won’t be at peace
Give me your heart
Give me your heart
Give me your heartCan your heart be mine in search?
'Cause I have no time to help you find all the words
Melodies and memories, stories that sound absurd
I will tell no lies
As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
Please don't wait, I'm not coming home tonight
I wanna love you but I can't
As long as you look me in the eyes
I'll go wherever you are, I'll follow behind
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friend
I never doubted myself, but I doubted you
I'm tired of looking at myself in my rear view
Heard about all the things you've done
And all the wars that you've been in
Heard about all the love you lost
It was over before it began
Heard about all the miles you've gone
Just to start again
Heard about all the that you've been through
And it sounds like you need a friend, a friendRainberry, please
You think I'm on my knees, but don't you worry
I know what you don't know-oh-oh
Don't even start, the truth won't break my heart
No, don't you worry
I already know-oh-oh
Too many bones inside your closet
You thought you buried deep
But they never let me get a minute of peace
How do you sleep? Ooh
Rainberry
Falling down your blood-red lips
Why are your eyes heavy?
Is there somebody else you missed?
Tell me what's going on before I go too far
Said, Rainberry
Is there somebody else, somebody else now?
Dry your eyes 'cause it won't work this time
I already dried mine, and I won't drown in yours
Go wash your hands, but you can't change your past
Those stories ain't shit now
You don't mean it, I'm sure
Too many bones inside your closet
You thought you buried deep
But they never let me get a minute of peace
How do you sleep? Ooh

Falling down your blood-red lips
Why are your eyes heavy?
Is there somebody else you missed?
Tell me what's going on before I go too far

Chest on your chest

You know my love ain't free
Why do you make believe?
Why do you sell me dreams?

I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land just float there
As I'm looking up 
Suddenly the sky erupts 
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin'
I never feel so loved
I've been havin' dreams 
Splashin' in a summer stream 
Trip and I fall in 
I wanted it to happen 
My body turns to ice 
Crushin' weight of paradise 
Solid block of gold 
Lying in the cold 
I feel right at home 
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love? 
When I dream of dyin' 
I never feel so loved 
Wait, if I'm on fire 
How am I so deep in love? 
When I dream of dyin'  
I never feel so loved
Ah, ah
I never feel so loved 
So loved, so loved 
La, la-la, la-la
I've been having dreams
La, la-la, la-la, la-la
Jumping on a trampoline
La, la-la, la-la
Flipping in the air
La, la-la, la-la, la
I never land, just float there
Wait, if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dyin' 
I never feel so loved 
Wait, if I'm on fire 
How am I so deep in love? 
When I dream of dyin' 
I never feel so loved Always lookin' out behind my fences
Always felt isolated, oh-oh-oh
I don't know why I was so defensive
I'll find a way to let you in
I will die if I don't try, damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real, this is somethin' right
Never been in love, never felt it all until now
As I lay here in your bed, I need you on my chest
To warm me all the time, to take away your breath
It's written on your lips, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
I see all your flaws and imperfections
But that's what makes me love you more, oh-oh-oh
We got such a spiritual connection
Don't you know you're fuckin' beautiful
I will die if I don't try, damned if I ask why
This is somethin' real, this is somethin' right
Never been in love, never felt it all until now
As I lay here in your bed, I need you on my chest
To warm me all the time, to take away your breath
It's written on your lips, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
I wanna feel your love
Just give me all your trust
Common ain't us
'Cause common ain't enough
In this ordinary world where nothin' is enough
Everything is gray, mistakin' love for lust
When I hold you in my arms, there ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout us
There ain't nothin' common 'bout usWell, well, you better run from me
You better hit the road
You better up and leave
Don't get too close
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
And I keep rolling on
You better run from me
Before I take your soul
If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it
Light me up in flames
Light me up, ayy
 Light me up
 Light me up
 Light me up
You better run from me
You better say goodbye
And even if I plead
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm a broken home
You're better off alone
You better run from me
Before I take your soul
If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it

So I still followI've been roaming and strolling
All in the streets
Burning my eyes red
Not slept for weeks
Testing your torment
My future is bleak
Lost in the moment
With no words to speak
I can't find no peace
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
My sleep was stolen
I'm searching for thieves
These memories in my head
So vivid to see
I can't find no peace
But when I close my eyes I feel it all again
I can't find no peace
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamers
Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
Insomnia
And when I close my eyes I feel it all again
Am I a fool
Waiting for you?
What if you never come back?
What if you never come back?
There's nothing new
I made another hit, I made another tune
What if we never know why hearts deceive us?
The night calls to dreamersDon't look around 'cause love is blind
And darlin', right now I can't see you
I’m feelin' proud so without a doubt
I can feel you
'Cause we are who we are when no one’s watchin'
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah, you know I got you
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine
We messed around until we found the one thing we said we could never ever live without
I’m not allowed to talk about it
But I gotta tell you
'Cause we are who we are when no one’s watchin'
And right from the start, you know I got you
Yeah, you know I got you
I won’t mind
Even though I know you’ll never be mine

Even though I know you’ll never be mineIn the clouds where the angels sing
In her eyes, where I wanna be and her smile is all I see
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gives thoughts and a notion
I need her body, it needs me too
I need somebody to love me blue
I've been doing it wrong for too long
I said I've been at it wrong for too long
I've been doing it wrong for too long
In the clouds where the angels sing
It's her smile, yeah, it's all I see
In her eyes where I wanna be
She knows I need her loving
She knows I need her touching
She plays with my heart and emotion
I give her my love and devotion
She gave me her thought and a notion

If it means I get to fly again
I put my all in

When I'm with, when I'm with, when I'm with
When I'm with you
The sun never comes up
When I'm with, when I’m with, when I’m with

If you need some time to love again
I don't want nothing
Just a little something for the pain
I don't mind wishing
We're just dancing in the dark again
The light blows
Don't wanna spend time on the issue
We'll never grow old when I'm with you
When I'm with, when I'm with, when I'm with

Don't know how many times I had to say this to you
This ain't my scene, this wasn't my dream
It was all yours, of course
I got caught up in this game and you know I won't say names of who's to blame
I won’t point any fingers, I won’t say it was you
I'll let life take its time, and in time, you'll see the truth
I won't ask any questions, I won't say it was you
I'll let life take its time, and in time, you'll see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
See the truth, see the truth
My own mind was in the way, front seat, new view
Don't know how many times I've had to talk you through
My dreams, new scenes with enemies
I got caught up in this game, a game
I won’t point any fingers, I won’t say it was you
I'll let life take it's time, and in time, you'll see the truth
See the truth, see the truth

Nobody said this would be hard
Nobody gave me a rulebook to follow
And my soul's not hollow
You see, we gotta find our place
And we'll go there now
I can't get no satisfaction alone
'Cause I can't, you can't, we can't get no
Satisfaction
All in my zone, all in my space
Life is always in the way
All in my zone, all in my space
Life is always in the way
Nobody said that you would leave me
Nobody says that in this dark
Somebody told me about tomorrow
And my soul's not hollow
You see, we gotta find our place
And we'll go there now
We can't get no satisfaction alone
'Cause I can't, you can't, we can't get no
Satisfaction
All in my zone, all in my space
Life is always in the way
All in my zone, all in my space
Life is always in the way
As you try your best to pull away
Something surges, urges you to stay

Satisfaction

All in my zone, all in my space

Alright, I got Bonnie Rotten on my left, Dot Cotton on my right
You ain't gotta tell me which one I should fuck
I know what's wrong, I know what's right
Pick a politician, hang him from his tie
Throw a party after, we'll all watch him die
The police can arrive, I will not comply
Wild beast for life and I'm legally blind
Blind to the laws, the rules
Society pulls the wool over our eyes
I am not confined to the floors and walls
I am not normal, I do not ball
But I got a female who replies to my emails, so I ain't got a type
Not with these nails, have you seen 'em? Tell 'em don't waste my time, I'm the cleanest
I don't need a Snapchat to prove I have a life
Who gives a fuck about a dress when there's death in Palestine?
No pretty gold or blue, it's just black and it's white
And it proves dependent on reflection of light
Your perception becomes deception for the mind
That's why I judge no colour, creed or size 
I'll fuck any girl 'cause I ain't got a type
Fuck every girl 'cause I ain't got a type
You just on the hype, you shit on the mic
When I'm on the mic, I still pedal by on a pedal bike

The cage I was in fell away when she asked me to dance again, yeah
I found my life in between a first kiss and a last goodbye
The dust settled down, now I can see through the crowd
I'm loving the colour white
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you
For the love in my mind, love for the bass
She likes getting high just for the day
She's different in night, she knows what I say
Free of the flash, dirt on your shoes, I don't know you
I'm loving the colour white
Surrounding your colored eyes
Though she is the kryptonite
She stays in my crib tonight
I light her like dynamite
Load her like gigabyte
Turn out the fucking lights
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright
I wanna see you bright

Flowers growing just to bloom
A million chances of our glances
Catching eyes across the room
If time stands still
Move I will to you
This world's filled
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you
Rain could pour upon your face now
And yet your beauty would still shine
I would live a thousand lifetimes
If it's you I'm sent to find
If time stands still
Move I will to you
This world's filled
Somehow I see you
Move I will to you
Move all the water, babe
Lift the rocks up, tide getting stuck
Nothing can stop us

I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece seems to be incomplete
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
It goes and it's golden like sands of time
I hope and I hope you'll still be fine
I know that it's bright
Look through the light and see, it's meant to be
Every single jigsaw piece
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it grows
'Cause it grows and it grows
And I hope that you know
'Cause it grows and it grows
I know that it's bright, look through the light and see
The choices we make change the path that we take
But I know
That somewhere out there there's a path that we chose
There's a life that we share, there's a love and it growsBlurry TV screens

From purpose
Present and future
Hi, Mr. President, a pleasure to meet you
Hope you feel my presence 'cause it's making a feature

Street lamps lit like they're trying to teach us

We ain't got all day, don't really care what they say
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
It don't matter to me, it don't matter to me
Nah, it don't matter to me, nah, nahWhen I woke up this morning
The sun had just dawned in
My bed, or your bed
Was the first or the last time
I don't care, it feels right
I'm not, not stopping all night
Things fall apart and in a part you feel distant
Reactions are instant if emotions are constant
Let's say for instance that you had a conscience
Would you take the time then to weigh out the options
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Lay here, if you want to
You can give me
All that, all that, all that
Never cross my mind
Have I crossed the lines
Or is there more to find, more to find?
I think inside immortalized
Mortalized, more to life
Coming from both sides
An attack of the mind
Like Optimus Prime in his prime
Kick it, don't skip it, to the finish line
This minute's mine
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Lay here, if you want to
You can give me
All that, all that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
All that, all that
You can give me all that
All that, all that
Stay here in the morning
You can take it all back
All back, all back
Lay here, if you want to
You can give me
All that, all that, all thatI smoke two joints before I play video games
Then I get 10,000 points
I flew around this planet only yesterday
Because I am an alien
I seen this galaxy and Milky Way
I even watched the sun
I got a J givin' me my light away
Because I don't get drunk
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late
Three more joints and I'm still playing video games
Can't even count the points
Play it 'til my fingers bleed
Who said that tomorrow will be guaranteed?
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late
And then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you
And then we fly away and then we fly away and we ain't running out of fuel
I'm running off of you, I'm running off of you and then we fly
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Let's do something good today, before it's too late, this is our day
Let's do something good today, before it's too late
Said let's do something good today, before it's too late, before it's too late"]
I can show you the world: shining, shimmering, splendid
Tell me, princess, now when did you last let your heart decide?
I can open your eyes, take you wonder by wonder
Over, sideways, and under on a magic carpet ride
A whole new world, a new fantastic point of view
No one to tell us "no," or where to go
Or say we're only dreaming
Un mundo ideal
Tan deslumbrante y nuevo hoy
Donde ya vi al subir, con claridad
Que ahora en un mundo ideal estoy
Now I'm in a whole new world with you
Fabulosa visión
Sentimiento divino
Baja y sube
Y vuela hacia celestial region
Un mundo ideal 
Allí mil cosas voy a ver 
Soy como azul estrella... que se va
Y nunca será igual ya otra vez
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Let me share this whole new world with you
Un mundo ideal 
A new fantastic point of view
Nadie que diga "No"
O a donde ir
A aquellos que se aman
A whole new world 
With new horizons to pursue 
I'll chase them anywhere, there's time to spare
Anywhere, ooh, ooh 
Let me share this whole new world with you
Un mundo ideal 
Que compartir 
Que alcanzar 
For you and meWhen you're standing in the dark
And you struggle to find the light
When you just try to find your way
But you just can't find the time

You could make the doves cry if you wanted
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
Tell me that you want that, but you don't
I say I'm sorry, but you're never sober
I start drinking, it's too much thinking, oh
It's the same every time that you're with me
I think I need some fresh air 
Feeling under pressure 
Don't wanna talk about it 
Don't even get me started over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
You and me got differences, differences
You and me got differences
Why you on some different shit?
We're caught in a cycle, so pardon my psycho
We could've been right, though, guess that's how life go
There's nothing that I can do for you
I think I need some fresh air 
Feeling under pressure 
Don't wanna talk about it 
Don't even get me started over you
You know I ain't tryna go pressure you
I think I need some fresh air 
Feeling under pressure

Tell me that you want that, but you don't
Tell me that you want that, but you don'tWise men say
Only fools rush in
But I can't help falling...
Shall I stay?
Would it be a sin?
For I can't help falling...
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Like a river flows
Surely to the sea
Darling, so it goes
Some things are meant to be
Take my hand
Take my whole life, too
For I can't help falling in love with you
Falling in love with you
I've been falling for you, baby
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I, I can' help falling
I just can't help falling in love
I just can't help falling in loveAll the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
I can't believe I believed
Everything we had would last
So young and naive for me
To think he was from your past
Silly of me to dream
Of one day having your kids
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
I can't believe I fell for your schemes
I'm smarter than that
So dumb and naive to believe
That with you I'm a changed man
Foolish of you to compete
When I cheat with loose women
It took me some time
But now I moved on
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
So controlling, you said
That you love me but you don't
Your family told me
One day I would see it on my own
Next thing I know, I'm dealing
With some problems of my own
Love is so blind
It feels right when it's wrong
Now that it's over
Stop calling me
Come pick up your clothes
Ain't no need to front
Like you're still with me
All your girlfriends know
Even your very best friend
Tried to warn me on the low
It took me some time
But now I am strong
Because I realized I got
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
I know that I will never disappoint myself
All the ladies, if you feel me
Help me sing it out
Yeah, you hurt me
But I learned a lot along the way
After all the rain
You'll see the sun come out again
Yea-ea
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Oh-oh oh-oh
Whoo-ooh
Whoo-ooh-ooh!
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friend
Me, myself, and I
That's all I got in the end
That's what I found out
And it ain't no need to cry
I took a vow that from now on
I'm gonna be my own best friendWake up, wake up
Gotta get this paper, get this cake up
Gotta do her hair, gotta put on makeup
Gotta act like I care about that fake stuff
Straight up what a waste of my day
If I had it my way I'd roll out of bed
Say 'bout 2:30 mid-day
Hit the blunt then, hit you up to come over to my place
You show up right away
We make love and then we fuck
And then you'd give me my space
What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait 
The time is ours to take so we should take it
Wake up, wake up, bake up
Gotta heat the vape up
Let's get faded
Gotta call your job tell 'em you won't make it
Ain't nobody here baby lets get wasted
We should just get naked
'Cause I be working hard and I know you be on that same shit
Every other day's a different game that you just can't win
I just want to ease your mind and make you feel all right
So you gin' be my baby mama, you gon' be with me tonight
What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait 
The time is ours to take so we should take it
It's not love, but it's pretty close
Hot fudge and a little smoke
I didn't mean it means nothing to you
Hands locked on my black couch with nothing to do
Can't stop on cloud 20
Buried in the drugs, but the feels keeps coming
Finally, stop crying, but your nose is still running
Wipe it on my shirt, on my sleeve
You tell me that you wanna do it big
I love it when you say "guess what?"
Doin' all your fucked up shit
And I wonder why I'm all messed up
'Cause we gotta be responsible sometimes
Being a class act nevermind my alumni
I don't wanna be around a baby so dumb high
That I don't see the beauty of a momma on insides
Curled up with my head on your chest
It's the best remedy for the pain and the stress
If the world doesn't change then we'll never get dressed
It will be like this to the kiss of the death
Of my soul, bowl of the blue dream, no
Not a good team, once soul, two halves
No joke, who laughs? Just us
Okay, got this OJ and Jose
Mixed it up with that Rose
We gon' do this our own way
Alright, okay
What is it that you're smoking?
Piece it up with this peace and love
And this peace and love like the old days
What I am trying to say is
That love is ours to make so we should make it
Everything else can wait
The time is ours to take so we should take it
Stay right here with ya
Lay right here with ya
'Cause everything is okay right here
You should stay right here
We should lay right here, oh
'Cause everything is okay right hereI close my blinds so the sun won't come in
Block out the noise but the voices within
I ain't talkin' to my friends
Sometimes they try to fool me
I know what I want
I prefer to just leave me lonely
Think I'm doin' alright
Even though they try to doubt me
Keep yourself up all night
I feel myself, I don't feel it
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide from yourself
That's all I'm sayin' baby
Go, go, go, go, go
You can't hide
Well I just got to tell you that I
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
The truth is a light, a light shining within
When you look in the mirror do you see a foe or a friend?
And  now
But one day you go now
Gon' break down, break down and let it all out
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
I just got to say that
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
Make peace with yourself before you can love another
Understand who and what you are before you can go any further
You can lie all you want now
But one got to go now
It's gon' break down, break down and let it all out
You see that
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
I just got to tell you
You can't hide from yourself
Everywhere you go there you are
You can't hide, you can't hide
No matter where you go you can't hide
Might as well face the truth now
You gon' have to do it one day
I don't care
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't hide, you can't hide
You gon' find out that's the truth some day
You can't hide, you can't hide
You can't run, you can't run
You can't go no whereClimb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears

A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
Pillow talk

But when I’m way up here, it's crystal clear
That now I'm in a whole new world with you
Now I’m in a whole new world with you
Unbelievable sights, indescribable feeling
Soaring, tumbling, freewheeling
Through an endless diamond sky
A whole new world 
A hundred thousand things to see 
I'm like a shooting star, I've come so far
I can't go back to where I used to be
A whole new world, with new horizons to pursue

Another way now, like we're supposed to do
Take you to the back now, I'd take a shot for you
Wasted every night, gone for every song
Faded every night, dancing all night long
Drunk all Summer, drunk all Summer
We've been drunk all Summer
Drinking and flowing and rolling
We're falling down
We're so late nights
Red eyes, amnesia, I need ya

I lose control, when I'm with you
I hope I haven't said too much
Guess I always push my luck when I'm with you

I was yours, I was yours every time
I've fallen for you, don't ruin me now
There is the fire in love
Only when you fall badly for me as well
Fake love is what you need
You tease me with your coquetry
Your addiction…
Your addiction is intoxicating
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your love
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your love
How could I believe what your heart says
May God save from your seductive eyes
There is secret hidden in your innocent face
Race of my breaths will bring devastation
You are relaxation
You are addiction
You too are my passion
Your obsession is on my head
You are relaxation
You are addiction
You too are my passion
Your obsession is on my head
Your addiction
Your addiction is intoxicating
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your love
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your love
Oh God…
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your love
Oh God why this injustice
It's infidelity again
It's difficult to get a release
From your loveMy life with One Direction has been more than I could ever have imagined. But, after five years, I feel like it is now the right time for me to leave the band. I'd like to apologise to the fans if I've let anyone down, but I have to do what feels right in my heart. I am leaving because I want to be a normal 22-year-old who is able to relax and have some private time out of the spotlight. I know I have four friends for life in Louis, Liam, Harry and Niall. I know they will continue to be the best band in the world.But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Not tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise
On your sins just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We would roll down the rapids
To find a wave that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel it too
I wanna see the sunrise
On your sins just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right hereNot tryna be indie
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, are you too?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise
On your sins just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

So, only you that can stop it
Go, give love to your body

Go, give love to your body
Go, give love to your body

Thoughts on Mind of Mine and its releaseHey what's up? It's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
Talkin' don't want me cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I would
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
Like I wouldJust stop lookin' for love

I know I'm working my magic
And I know you diggin' my fabric

You said it yourself, you digging me
And I'd be lying if I said it wasn't equally
A feeling that we both feel
Something that is so real
But I got to let you know slowly
Well, it may be truthfully
But you just gotta stop looking for it
Come give it to me, yea, ah, yeah

Boy, whatchu lookin' for?
Is it a cutie at five for four?
A girl with an attitude?
Real smile mouth and a big black door?
Don't make this complicated
Roll something up, let's get wasted
We ain't getting any younger
Came our time now, don't you waste it
Hit my line come, getcha whine
We don't need to wine and dine
Just a fling, so keep the ring
To find love, we got our lives
Hmm, don't waste the last days
Of walking our own way
While we still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still got
Just stop lookin' for love
You still got time
Girl, you're young you still got time
Girl, you're young you still gotYour lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
Probably you're bad for me
When I take it in
It's like air to me, can't stop breathing
Keep it burning, it's your turn
I want you, I want you right now
You're my dream, my nicotine, I want you
I need you just like
Cigarettes
Oh baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
In my bloodstream, one more hit
Clouded in your loving
But I follow it
Keep it burning, it's your turn
I want you, I want you right now
You're my dream, my nicotine, I want you
I need you just like
Cigarettes
Oh baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes 
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor it
Searching  my love, that's all I need
Searching  my love
Searching  my love, that's all I need
Searching  my love
But you don't respond to me like
Cigarettes
Oh baby, like cigarettes
We'll all be forgetting, quit your regret like cigarettes
Cigarettes
Disappear like cigarettes
We'll be so short of breath
Our hearts still on edge like cigarettes
Your lips, my lips, our lips
Take a hit
Your lips, my lips, our lips
You savor itI've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up 
Suddenly the sky erupts 
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I've been having dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream 
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never feel so loved
I never feel so loved
My body turns to ice 
Crushin' weight of paradise 
Solid block of gold 
Lying in the cold 
I feel right at home 
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never feel so loved
I never feel so loved
I never feel so lovedLike a shameless flower cries at every wedding
You don't have feelings, you just have petals
There is no meaning, it's just aesthetics
Then to ask me, I'd say pathetic is the only one that fits
And wins inside a world of acronyms
Twisted shapes of acrobats
Inside a mesh of flesh and bone
Is an underlying desperate tone
To the world of real authentic
The iPhone likes preventing
This place of role play, I think we like pretending
As if our fun is never ending
No one speaks, just message sending
It's a silent planet - Wait. It's pending

Light me up, ayyChanging the meaning of what it means to be seen
A jar full of honey just waiting for bees
Quietness waits, suspenseful speaks
List of life goals, pencil for each
Sharpen the nib while losing the lead
Wrinkles on face, we have wisdom instead
Feel the rough of each cloud and the air of each breath
The parting of tide, the move of your chest
Like a wick once lit, forever blackened
Inside the very tick of every living second
Lies a spark of magic no magician can imagine
No feeble form can fathom
Just love within our hearts forever longing to be answered
Let our spirit gyrate free like the pelvis of late Elvis
May we toast a drink to sir Hendrix
See through the eyes of Steve Wonder
Feel each note like rolling thunder, precisely placed melody
Compiled with ease for the love of music we can not see
It might just cause our mind to freeze
We should let past move back like breeze
Art decayed within our dreams
Sat for fact some centuries
Why make presumptions of decency
When stories told just say one piece
Don't ignite war, just fight for peaceNo yetJust stop lookin' for love

Will cover the ghettos
And brighten up their dreams
When they're feeling hollow
We'll give them us to see
When they're walking in the dark
And teach them how to breathe
When they're living underwater
We'll show them where to go
When their minds are lost
And teach them how to smile
When they cry with sorrow
We will plant a seed
For the gold generation
Oh, this is how we'll be
Oh, in the gold generation
Plastic in the sea
Gases in the sky
Babies with disease
Elders without a dime
Nations keep on falling
From the hands of greed
Holding back the truth
Of what we're meant to be
Change is gonna come
And truth is gonna sew up
This is how we'll be
In the gold generation
Change is gonna come
Change is gonna come
Rainbows in the sky
Will cover the ghettos
And brighten up their dreams
When they're feeling hollowI think its evident I can't go out my way
This girl irrelevent , she can't go and up up my game
But whats the settlement , can't be cool with no lames
These n****'s counterfeit, they be roll playing
I think its evident I can't go out my way
This girl irrelevent , she can't go and up up my game
But whats the settlement , can't be cool with no lames
These n****'s counterfeit, actors they be roll playing

Pretty face nice waist , but I was in love with your smile
And shawty had good taste but bitches was coppin' the style

This girl irrelevent , she can't go and up up my game
But whats the settlement , can't be cool with no lames

These n****'s counterfeit, actors they be roll playingI went down to the river and lost my mind
I said, Lord, will you save me just one last time
Thought I told ya
I was looking for a sign
I did once wonder if I would get it twice
Peace of mind only comes in the afterlife
Thought I told ya
I was looking for a sign
One, two, three
I need something to believe in
Throw my hands up to the ceiling
Oh, sky, won't you give me a sign?
Tell me will the world one day ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Tell me will the world one day ever be mine
I was down on my knees, I was living a lie
I was king of the rubble, just wasting time
Thought I told ya
I was looking for a sign
Sick and tired of running circles for miles and miles
Being lost ain't never really been my style
Thought I told ya
I was looking for a sign
One, two, three
I need something to believe in
Throw my hands up to the ceiling
Oh, sky, won't you give me a sign?
Tell me will the world one day ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Tell me will the world one day ever be mine
I didn't want to have to sell my soul
So I took the hard road
Please won't you show me
A sign
One, two, three
I need something to believe in 
Throw my hands up to the ceiling
Oh, sky, won't you give me a sign?
Tell me will the world one day ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Will it ever be mine
Will you ever be mine
Tell me will the world one day ever be mineمارى

You better hit the road
You better up and leave
Don't get too close
'Cause I'm a rolling stone
And I keep rolling on
You better run from me
Before I take your soul
If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it
Light me up in flames
Light me up, ayy, ayy
You better run from me
You better say goodbye
And even if I plead
Don't waste your time
'Cause I'm a broken home
You're better off alone
You better run from me
Before I take your soul
If I go, let me go
Don't you follow me, let me go
I will let you down, let me go
Even if your heart can't take it
Light me up in flamesI forgot to call you on your birthday
You swear you're the last thing on my mind, yeah
There is nothing I could do to fix it
When the lights don't glow the same way that they used to
And I finally get a moment to myself
I will realize you were everything I'm missing
And you tell me you're in love with someone else
So can you do me a favor? If I pull it together
Make it sooner than later, we won't be here forever
And I realized I waited too long but please don't move on
You don't need no one else, you don't need no one else
You don't need no one else, you don't need no one else
You don't need no one elseChorus:
I'm in a Mulsanne

Verse:
She told me bring her home

Ima do it if she let me
Ima pull up with a stick fuck that nigga bitch kill him if he test me
Ima shoot him in his hip shoot him in his leg blood all on the bed sheets
Ima shoot him in his hip shoot him in his leg blood all on the bed sheets
But Im in your city so pull up don't tell me you busy cause I'm up
Don't really need love need commas Im staying away from the drama
Staying Away From The Drama
Keeping Away From The Karma

Has been building in my chest
But I can't find a way to escape
What's inside my head
The love we shared was broken down
I needed to grow
Away from all the torture that I felt
Now I know
In time we'll see the distance
That we've made between us
The separation takes a toll
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
When there's nothing of us left
It becomes hard to forget
The person that I used to be
Before the time we met
The love we shared was broken down
I needed to grow
Away from all the torture that I felt
Now I know
In time we'll see the distance
That we've made between us
The separation takes a toll
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
'Cause now we are strangers
Now we are strangers
Now we are strangersChorus :
Pull up with a 40 got a beam
I feel like a killer it might be a murda spree
Heard she wanna fuck down on the team
And i keep on playing her like pc
Playing all these games uhh
I'm not the same
Young nigga balling
I make it rain
I done iced out a brand new lane chain
Spin the block hit the curve just to hit his brain
Verse :
Pull up with a spalding
Shooting just like jordan
Got these bitches falling
Woke up today felt important
Touch my money nigga we gon’ split yo Noggin
Henny in my cup remy in my cup
Uuhhh oouu
Body on wassup
I might hit her up
Song on poltergeist
So this might wake em up
Set back yesterday
But today up
Niggas like to bark but they just little pups
They just keep on wondering  how come they shit ain't adding up
Ima Keep on stacking shit cause I don't think they mad enough
And I think I might fuck his bitch just to prove I’m savage son
Chorus :
Pull up with a 40 got a beam

Outro:
Me and my niggas on go
Diamonds on me dancing yea
Its a Light-show didn't think it'll happen
Now you Know
Never going back thats for sure
Nanana NananaYou caught me with those lemon eyes
In the land of the lost
Surely took my by surprise a diamond in the rough
Ride me like a hurricane
And leave me like a mess
You’re urgent like an accident
I’m way over my head
I wanna get lost in your fire
Wanna make you feel my fever
I wanna get lost in your fire
We can get so high
Can we make love tonight
You know what you do to me
So baby take your time
Let me be your fantasy
Explore the reaches of your mind
I wanna get lost in your fire
Wanna make you feel my fever
I wanna get lost in your fire
We can get so high
Can we make love tonight
I’ll be taking my time
She gon’ get hers before mine
We’ll be here for a while
In bed until the sun rise
And you know I won’t stop
Until I can see her smile
Can we make love tonight?Well, well, you better run from me
You better hit the road
You better up and leave

Yeah, yeah, yeah
I'm sitting in this bed
Crying why am I not dead
Nigga you heard what I said
You called my problems infrared
Why don't you ever listen
Man I shouldn't have to beg
It's hard for me to function
With the lies that I've been fed
Now my heart is made of lead
You wanna lock me up
Even though you aided and abetted
Some things I said
Even though I'm right, I still regret it
They say I'm too lit
I can't see where I'm headed
Eyes blocked up
Can't see past the tears
I feel like I'm sliding
I can't change the gears
This ain’t the life I want to live
I got nothing left to give
I try and face my demons
But I’m paralyzed in fear
I had all this opportunity
I still took the pills
I don't want no cheap thrills
Man I'd rather just kill myself
Put my life on the shelf
Let me tell you I'm tired
My pain it is dire
Why can’t I go
And just burn in this fire
Why can’t my body
Just let me expire
I been wrote the letter
It made me a liar
Can't work on myself
Guess I'm not for hire
Believe me, I've tried
It's a strain on my mental
I need me a rental
I try and keep up
They keep changing the tempo
I just wanna see a mirror
And have somebody smiling back
Last time I seen that
Nigga I ain’t even keeping track
I speak straight facts
I'm off the hinge no casket
You know I'm going up
Quit asking
I woulda multiplied with you
Bread basket
Then you started to oppress
No savage
Bet on me, just call me Zac
Bitch don't ever call me back
Last time I opened up
My heart froze like Dak
I'm tired of feeling
All the wrong things
I'm tired of your
Broken apologies
Your tears they are empty
Still wish I was 6ft deep
The thought comes
Five times a week
Your smiles don’t erase the past
The pain you caused, yea that’s gon last
The remedy is not so fast
But is it even worth it
I just know it better
Cuz God won’t let me forfeit
I gotta leave this pit
Just call me Tony Dorsett
Is life even worth it
Why won't God let me forfeitOh lord I’ve been reckless
Tryin’na find my way but I’ve been headless
I’ve been spinning around
Running out of time
Am I helpless
Oh oh oh I’ve been reckless
I’ve been running around with thieves and hounds
Not preacher here to bless me
Hollywood Hills pills and thrills
This church will never save me
Don’t you too me my mother nothing
Mama don't need to know
I’m king of the lights
Flying too high
I dance with all these monsters
Playing with time ignoring the signs
Lord I need a savior
Don’t you tell my father nothing
Papa don't need to know
Oh lord I’ve been reckless
Tryin’na find my way but I’ve been headless
I’ve been spinning around
Running out of time

Sins atoned
I’m lord I am legend
40 days and 40 nights
And now I’m in confession
Don’t you tell my girl no nothing
She don't need to know
I’ve been running so fast my shadows don't catch me
But always leave trails for the devil come find me
And these dreams are a blessing and a curse now
All these voices in my head screaming so loud now
Oh lord I’ve been reckless
Tryin’na find my way but I’ve been headless
I’ve been spinning around
Running out of time
Am I helpless
Oh oh oh I’ve been reckless
Been running so fast my shadows don't catch me
But always leave trails for the devil come find me
And these dreams are a blessing a curse now
Is it too late for me?
Oh lord I’ve been reckless

I’ve been spinning around
Running out of time
Am I helpless?

But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
I don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You helped me just to stab my back
Wiped my name right off your map
Ran your mouth to relay all my secrets
I’m not keeping track
Of all the things you did to me
Or should I say the things you lacked
To do, it’s true, I’m no fool
I see the things you do
Your inaction is your action
Hope you get your satisfaction
I don’t need you, check the caption
Say you love me know you cappin
My good opinion once lost
Is lost forever
I don’t come back around
Cuz I cut my tether
Don’t wanna see you
When I’m in fair weather
Don’t wanna see you
When I’m with my bank teller
Let me tell ya
I’m done with all your fake attitudes
I’m done caring bout
All the things that you do
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life

It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
I don’t hate you
I just hate myself
For choosing people
Who let me collect dust in a shelf
I say I’m okay
That I don’t feel nothin
But if you see the scars on my back
Then you know I’m frontin
I don’t need you
I need who I thought you was
When you said you would stand by me
I guess I misunderstood
Our bond broke down
It’s my fault cuz I ain’t check under the hood
Lie to me again
I wish you would
Riding in a Benz
With engine of a Yugo
Weaving all your stories
Like your first name Hugo
Kicked me out your system
You would think I was Pluto
Willingly blind
Like the big yellow 2-4
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary JaneOnce I was a fool
Living selfishly
Always running from love
And everything good for me, yeah
But then you appeared
Like a light in the sky
Lifted me from these grounds
Now I never want to come down
When people ask I tell them that you
You stole me away
Like a thief in the night
You showed me your constellation
And the love that spins it around
I think I found a star
That leads me back baby baby
A star that takes me back home
You're my star
My true north lady
You take me so far
But with you I'm home
Staying out late
'till the sun came up
Chasing emptiness
Always testing my luck
Heard the stories of love
But they were not for me
Until you struck me down
Like lightning on my knees
Yeah you should know that you
Took a hole out my heart
Like a beautiful song
You lifted me from gravity
And showed me where I belonged
I think I found a star
That leads me back baby baby
A star that takes me back home
You're my star my true north lady
Think that I'm crazy for you
You take me so far
But with you I'm home
If someone sees my mother
Tell her I'm doing just fine
'Cause I was just a shadow
Now I see the light
Never knew it could happen to me
Feels like I'm living someone else's dream
Since you took me out of this world and into your heart
Think I found a star that shines over me
You're my star my true north lady
Think that I'm crazy for you
A star
Let's leave this place I want to go with you
Take me on your planet
Beam me on your ship
Show me the ways of love I never knew could exist
Oh show me the truth
Cause I belong to you
This is our love song our love song
Our intergalactic love songYeah!

It’s my fault cuz I’m nervous

Or has mine just run out
If love is a stream
Then mines had a bad drought
My hearts locked in a cage
The one on my sleeve yea it's fake
An artificial blood vessel
To try and keep me sane
I've done some things in my past
I ain’t to proud to admit
Girl you broke my heart
And I couldn’t get over it
I know I don’t deserve love
At least not yours, not now
I'm pleading for help
I gotta turn my life around
Crying in my sleep
Man I'm tired of the sound
Looking in the mirror
Man I'm tired of the frown
Been living like a dog
Please put me down
Do I deserve love
Tell me am I worth it
I got my faults yea
I know I ain’t perfect
I’ve been through trials
Tell me the verdict
Do I deserve love
Tell me am I worth it

I know I ain’t perfect
I’ve been through trials

Not a simple friend but a special friend at that I wanna spend my whole life with you now that factsWisdom, guidance, in order of things you need
Realms insides the palms lies a story of the thieves
Aristocratic cryptic's waving wands just to decive
And ever-blowing sheet leave no visual to conceive
Problems always probably and things will just repeat
Unless we change the way we think, poignant when we speak
Our minds internal still search and wish to seek
For hidden answers that no human mouth can teach
Melody in music form to bring the world together to a place of peace
Not every man is one nor the other
Each and every one of us connected to our lover
Connected to the earth, life is giving birth
Feeling music before we're even speaking
Our hearts pumping, beating
Drums, they bang aloud, the piano is the suspense
You reel at your first fall down, the microphone for the tone
You slowly groaned, the guitar for the first time
You're with your someone making love in a car
The stars are what we look at because that is what we areI don't know what love is
Maybe it's not for me
Been chasing it so long
I'm just feeding my insanity
Feeling like I'm nothing
Man this ain't how it gotta be
Maybe I'm cursed
Maybe that's the key
Maybe there's a price
That I can't see
Gotta figure it out
Before time flies away from me
When I care too much
I just fall down
Heavy is the head
I ain't even got a crown
I see your mouth moving
Baby what's that sound
I ain't listening to you
You can't make me a clown
I'm broken inside
Man I can't even cry
When I'm feeling pain
I just laugh like I'm high
I'm on the edge
God just take me right now
They say keep on pushing
I just don't know how
Don't know what I'm doing
Don't know what I'm saying
If love is a game
I don't know why I'm playing
What can I give
When I'm empty
Someone explain
To me simply
They say with love you give and you take
Nothing's free you gotta pay
I've been giving all my life
There ain't nothing on my tray
Walk a mile in my shoes
And tell me would you live another day
I don't know what love is
Maybe it's not for me
Been chasing it so long
I'm just feeding my insanity
Feeling like I'm nothing
Man this ain't how it gotta be
Maybe I'm cursed
Maybe that's the key
Maybe there's a price
That I can't see
Gotta figure it out
Before time flies away from me
Is it really love
Or is it just fear
Do I want you
Or do I want you near
I'm all in confusion
Is love an illusion
It's running away
Or am I just delusional
My state of unrest
Is my usual
Why does my life
Feel immovable
My pain is intense
God just make it make sense
I cry out to you
And I just hear silence
Pretty soon
Ima pick up with the violence
Not to other people
Cuz you know I'm not wilin
It's just me vs myself
Pass me a gun
Ima point at myself
It's just me vs myself
Pass me a gun
Ima point at myself
I don't know what love is
Maybe it's not for me
Been chasing it so long
I'm just feeding my insanity
Feeling like I'm nothing
Man this ain't how it gotta be
Maybe I'm cursed
Maybe that's the key
Maybe there's a price
That I can't see
Gotta figure it out
Before time flies away from meBehind the wood washed sandal of sandalwood
Lies a scent, without a handle
Pictures framed and placed on mantles
Who are we?
We do not see our fragile mantra
Ignorant bliss we hold like axes
We do not feel the piece that matches
We must be one place exactly
We are ever free and sometimes reckless
Who are we?
If not souls beyond the reckoning
We try our best, our voices beckoning
Somehow still it ends trajectory
Curving lines and missing objective goals
Obscene holes is a system's cause
Divide the lanes and call one yoursHey what's up? It's been a while
Talking 'bout it's not my style
Thought I'd see what's up, while I'm lighting up
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Know it's late, but I'm so wired
Saw your face and got inspired
Guess you let it go, now you're good to go
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would
It's okay to want me, 'cause I want you
Been thinkin' it over, but I'm through
So stop wasting all my time, messing with my mind
It's cold-hearted, cold-hearted
Oh, oh, it's probably gonna sound wrong
Promise it won't last long
Oh, oh, if we can never go back
Thought you'd like to know that
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I would
He, won't touch you like I do
He, won't love you like I would
He don't know your body
He don't do you right
He won't love you like I would
Love you like I would, like I wouldI'm gonna be somebody someday, you don't know it yet
Gonna soar throughout the whole world in my own private jet
Gonna have a house or two to rest when I'm feeling weary
Find myself all over the news 'cause I'm extraordinary
Gonna drive a fancy car just so you'll know who I am
Making sure when I swing by 'cause you'll wanna shimmy again
Won't take no shit from a suit who thinks he owns it all
Because I'm a million feet tall
So tonight I'll spin the world around me
Find a flipside of reality
Why must good things only happen in dreams?
I can't wait for the tables to turn
So I'm gonna spin the world 
I'm gonna spin the world 
I'm gonna start a revolution, fight with all that I've got
Print my face on a million t-shirts, and you'll wear it a lot
Massive statues will be made of me proudly standing tall
And I'll raise my middle finger to those who make me feel small
So tonight I'll spin the world around me
Find a flipside of reality
Why must good things only happen in dreams?
I can't wait for the tables to turn
So I'm gonna spin the world 
I'm gonna spin the world 
I'm tired of playing it safe
I wanna set the ground shaking, shaking, yeah
I just gotta be free
And to be just the way that I am
Zayne, Zayne
I want you to say my name yeah, yeah, yeah, yeah
Tonight I'll spin the world around me
Find a flipside of reality
Why must good things only happen in dreams?
I can't wait for the tables to turn

YeahJust one more dance
Give me one more chance
Just to feel your hands
Wouldn't that be grand
Don't even know your name
Just the way you made me feel
Haven't been the same since
This wasn't part of the deal
Just one more dance
Give me one more chance
We don't need no plans
Let's go off to Japan
Don't know how you
Made me feel this way
I still think about you
Each and everyday
You stood by the wall
And our eyes met
With you in the room
There was no еlse
Grabbed your hand
And I took you for a spin
You looked so finе
I couldn't stop staring
We danced all day
And we danced all night
When we were together
Everything seemed right
Girl you
Made me lose all direction
All I could think
Was to show my affection
The times we were together
It was never overcomplicated
Everything we did was
Unpremeditated
Then you left my heart in a shock
Defibrillated
Left me wanting more
I was infatuated
Just one more dance
Give me one more chance
Just to feel your hands
Wouldn't that be grand
Don't even know your name
Just the way you made me feel
Haven't been the same since
This wasn't part of the deal
Just one more dance
Give me one more chance
We don't need no plans
Let's go off to Japan
Don't know how you
Made me feel this way
I still think about you
Each and everyday
To me you were a princess
Eyes of an empress
Smile of a queen
Heart of a tempest
Such innocence, beneficence
With no beauty equivalent
Held captive by your eyes
I didn't want deliverance
We danced for the last time
We didn't even know
Your eyes held mine
I didn't want to go
Thought this was forever
Thought you would be mine
What I would give
For just one more time
Just one more dance
Give me one more chance
Just to feel your hands
Wouldn't that be grand
Don't even know your name
Just the way you made me feel
Haven't been the same since
This wasn't part of the deal
Just one more dance
Give me one more chance
We don't need no plans
Let's go off to Japan
Don't know how you
Made me feel this way
I still think about you
Each and everyday
Each and everyday
Give me one more chance
Give me one more chance

Say goodbye to the feels I used to play
Snakes in the grass, caught with my own hands
Color of the dirt, smell of the land
From my windows did I watch it all become past
Fly away from the fire into the eyes
A concrete jungle I've never known
Well, kid, now it's time to grow
Sharp leaves, majestic trees
You always find a way to make me believe
In the magic of the heart, whistle freedom in the breeze
You were there like any mother would be
Bullets tore the sky, the warnings have changed
Suddenly breaking the fabric of the land
Scream one loud, and the mind was quick
Trying to understand what I didn't know could exist

We the product of the Motherland
Pure air , no cover, man
A bible in one, AK in the other hand
Seek refuge, slay blood what I'm covered in
Young children turned into teen martyrs
You can't buy the dream of being water
In the depths, and I'm gone, and my dad, so slaughtered
Man better, kings, and queens, we team harder
Clash, or 5, we fight through a part-time
I threw a pride, listen to a far cry
Hope will guide us through, now the time is due
It's only right I pay homage to

Shit became real when I kissed her
You can't be mad 'cause she looks like you
Tell me what the hell d'you expect me to do?
She asked me to dance while you was in the bathroom

Yo It’s got me paralyzed
This some real shit
I ain’t faking, I’m demoralized
What’s the point of being alive
If I ain’t got nothing to live for
I’m only here
Cuz I got nothing to kill for
I’m lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost in my thoughts
My heart still beating
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no life jacket to borrow
Why does there have to be a
Tomorrow
I’m lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost in my thoughts
My heart still beating
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no life jacket to borrow
Why does there have to be a
Tomorrow
You said you had my back
But where the fuck your at
Always worried bout a bitch
Never worried bout the facts
Say you feel bad
What the fuck I’m sposed to do with that
Don’t even say nothin
I can already see the cap
Left me here with nothing
After all the shit you said
Then you go and run your mouth
Boy you got a nigga fed up
And I’m crying for help
How can I love
When I don’t love myself
I’m lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost in my thoughts
My heart still beating
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no life jacket to borrow
Why does there have to be a
Tomorrow
I’m lost in this maze
Yea I’m lost in my thoughts
My heart still beating
I just want to cut it off
I’m drowning in my sorrow
With no life jacket to borrow
Why does there have to be a
Tomorrow
Why does there have to be a tomorrow[Intro}
Yeah
Had to get something of my chest real quick
You think I'm dumb, think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
I don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You helped me just to stab my back
Wiped my name right off your map
Ran your mouth to relay all my secrets
I’m not keeping track
Of all the things you did to mе
Or should I say the things you lacked
To do, it’s true, I’m no fool
I see thе things you do
Your inaction is your action
Hope you get your satisfaction
I don’t need you, check the caption
Say you love me know you cappin
My good opinion once lost
Is lost forever
I don’t come back around
Cuz I cut my tether
Don’t wanna see you
When I’m in fair weather
Don’t wanna see you
When I’m with my bank teller
Let me tell ya
I’m done with all your fake attitudes
I’m done caring bout
All the things that you do
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
I don’t hate you
I just hate myself
For choosing people
Who let me collect dust in a shelf
I say I’m okay
That I don’t feel nothin
But if you see the scars on my back
Then you know I’m frontin
I don’t need you
I need who I thought you was
When you said you would stand by me
I guess I misunderstood
Our bond broke down
It’s my fault cuz I ain’t check under the hood
Lie to me again
I wish you would
Riding in a Benz
With engine of a Yugo
Weaving all your stories
Like your first name Hugo
Kicked me out your system
You would think I was Pluto
Willingly blind
Like the big yellow 2-4
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary Jane
You think I'm dumb, you think I'm blind
But I see everything
Don't need you in my life
That's on everything
You left scar, you left a stain
It's hard for me to hide the pain
From jumping off I did refrain
My best friend is Mary JaneUh, uh
Yeah
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Giving you my trust
I should've knew it was a trap
How you speak on my name
When the truth is what you lack
Nothing will heal
All the scars on my back
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Everything you say a lie
And you know that's a fact
Never should've got attached
Like a demon you attacked
Nothing will heal
All the scars on my back
You think that I'm blind but I got me a scope
Your argument fishy I got you some scope
You don't listen to reason, you think you the pope
If you running for lies, you got my vote
No faith in humanity I plead insanity
Gotta keep working til I'm in a fantasy
Tired of sleep and I'm tired of living
Can't fuck with me cuz I am my own villain
I'm losing all hope at the end of my rope
If my right hand a bitch then that's murder she wrote
There ain't nothing realer than words that I spoke
To be real or be liked it's a slippery slope
I'm crying for help and I'm all by lonely
You ain't my friend you a fan, only
Losing my power, I think that I'm Tobey
Can't take no more shots I am not Kobe
Mamba mentality ain't my reality
I'm tryna change but he wouldn't be proud of me
I'm losing my will and I'm losing my way
I did not want to wake up today
It is what it is and it ain't what it ain't
I cry everyday and don't make a complaint
If you see a smile, it's the picture I paint
You think that I'm happy, I lie like a saint
I stay in my feelings I cannot get out
I try and stay up but I drown in my doubt
My pain it is real, I'm not looking for clout
My pain it is real, I'm not looking for clout
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Giving you my trust
I should've knew it was a trap
How you speak on my name
When the truth is what you lack
Nothing will heal
All the scars on my back
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Everything you say a lie
And you know that's a fact
Never should've got attached
Like a demon you attacked
Nothing will heal
All the scars on my back
Gotta figure out who I am
I'm tired of trying
If you say you know me
I know that you lyin'
Niggas they swear
That they reading my mind
The chance that you right
Is a ten minus nine
It’s the moon or I bust I got no one to trust
You said that you loved me, I knew it was lust
Gotta leave you right now girl I must
You will not miss me, don’t make a fuss
The pillars they fall I got no one to call
Take a look at myself am I worth it at all
Blinded by pain you would think that I'm Saul
I gotta keep pushing I'm starting to crawl
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Giving you my trust
I should've knew it was a trap
How you speak on my name
When the truth is what you lack
Nothing will heal
All the scars in my back
No cap no rap
I ain't never going back
Everything you say a lie
And you know that's a fact
Never should've got attached
Like a demon you attacked
Nothing will heal

I won't say goodbye
I won't say goodbye
I won't say goodbye
This might be my final goodbye
My final sigh
I’m going to a place
Where I won’t have to cry
They say the dead are peace
But the living gotta struggle
Maybe I can finally rest
I’m tired of the trouble
I can’t see the light no more
I’m blinded by the pain
Stuck in my emotions
I can’t get rid of these chains
You say you want to help me
But you threw away the key
Standing there smiling
Like you don’t know how to help me
You took me for grantеd
I can’t even under stand it
I gavе all I could give
And you still left me stranded
Gave you all my love
Now empty
Should I take these pills
You know it’s tempting
I won’t say goodbye
I won’t say goodbye
No I won’t say goodbye
I won’t make my mama cry
Even though I’m tired
And I don’t know why I’m still alive
No I won’t say goodbye
I gotta another chance to live a good life
Since I’m still here
I know at the least I gotta try
Tried to use the pills to bring me down
But they couldn’t get me in the hearse
Yea I’m still alive
Is it a blessing or is it a curse
It’s the same song, different verse
Little bit louder, little bit worse
I can’t let these problems beat me
Gotta try and beat them first
I won't say goodbye
I won't say goodbye
I won't say goodbye
I won't say goodbyeYou say you love me
But you ain't acting like it
I see the way you look at him
You ain't gotta hide it
I ain't playing no games
You shouldn't have to choose
I'm not taking this shit
I ain't no number two
If you gotta think about him
Then don't think about me
If you gotta make a choice
Let me make it easy
Ima just leave
Let you do what you want
I know it's gonna hurt me
But I'm better off
A lot of my love
Is wasted on the wrong people
They all flip flop
Like a vane on a steeple
Took me for a token
Like a laptop decal
Fooled me once
There ain't finna be a sеquel
And I feel all alone
I'm telling you
Ain't nothing
Driеr than my phone
Where did it
All go wrong
I feel left out
Like my name is Wong
Thought I wouldn't see through you
But I peeped though
Couldn't spend time with me
Cuz you a cheapo
Say you sorry, but I know you not
You ain't fecal
Say you care, but I know you don't
Hope you sleep though
I hope you sleep
Don't think about me
You say you love me
But you ain't acting like it
I see the way you look at him
You ain't gotta hide it
I ain't playing no games
You shouldn't have to choose
I'm not taking this shit
I ain't no number two
If you gotta think about him
Then don't think about me
If you gotta make a choice
Let me make it easy
Ima just leave
Let you do what you want
I know it's gonna hurt me
But I'm better off
Baby what do you see in him
That you don't see in me
I don't understand
Baby please give me some clarity
He drowns himself in liquor and
I drown myself in silence
You didn't want to feel my pain
You wanted someone who could hide it
Thought you were the one
I could confide in
I love you
Even though I caught you lyin
If I saw you drowning
You know I would still dive in
Put my life on the line
If it meant you surviving
Ima be honest girl
I think about you every day
Thinking that maybe
There was something I forgot to say
I can't change anything
It's all in the past
But I gotta say
I hope that you two last
I hope you two last
Cuz we're all in the past
You say you love me
But you ain't acting like it
I see the way you look at him
You ain't gotta hide it
I ain't playing no games
You shouldn't have to choose
I'm not taking this shit
I ain't no number two
If you gotta think about him
Then don't think about me
If you gotta make a choice
Let me make it easy
Ima just leave
Let you do what you want
I know it's gonna hurt me
But I'm better off
I know it's gonna hurt me
But I'm better offIntro

        I've been havin' dreams
Jumpin' on a trampoline
Flippin' in the air
I never land, just float there
As I'm looking up 
Suddenly the sky erupts 
Flames alight the trees
Spread to fallin' leaves
Now they're right upon me
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
I've been having dreams
Splashin' in a summer stream 
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never feel so loved
I never feel so loved
My body turns to ice 
Crushin' weight of paradise 
Solid block of gold 
Lying in the cold 
I feel right at home 
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
Wait if I'm on fire
How am I so deep in love?
When I dream of dying
I never feel so loved
, SHAED & ZAYN]
I never feel so loved
I never feel so loved
I never feel so lovedVocalizing
Climb on board
We'll go slow and high tempo
Light and dark
Hold me hard and mellow
I'm seeing the pain, seeing the pleasure
Nobody but you, 'body but me
'Body but us, bodies together
I love to hold you close, tonight and always
I love to wake up next to you
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
It's our paradise and it's our war zone
Paradise, war zone
Paradise, war zone
So we'll piss off the neighbours
In the place that feels the tears
The place to lose your fears
Yeah, reckless behavior
A place that is so pure, so dirty and raw
In the bed all day, bed all day, bed all day
Fucking and fighting on
It's our paradise and it's our war zone

        Support your cause, don't envy mine
Preserve the time, you can control
A stone bridge with no room for trolls
Italic font or WRITE IN BOLD
It fulfills your needs, your story told
In an instant, you made a mold
To case annoyed, preserve the noise
Your mind thought sold to a hundred soulless phones
A lion's bed deprived of food
Know your facts, the numbers do
I seen the plaques, they speak the truth
I'm looking 'round to see the proof of competition
No contender is even living
When legends die, we hold them high
We do not try to recreate
We know our lane, we see our vision
The creative life, the one I'm living
Distinct, instinct within my rhythm
I'm cutting villains with great precision
The box is wrapped, complete with ribbonHello
I'm back again
All the girls at the front
Let the show begin
It's pandemonium
When I hit the stage
Lemme grab a mic
And crawl under your skin
Shining lights
A show of hands
Drums are thumping, and the guitar loud
Don't let it end
It's alright
'Cause I'll be back one more time
When they ask for more, encore
Stage lights
Don't wanna live a normal live
Just keep the switch on, stage lights
And we can share it together
It's hot in the stage lights
L.A
Been good to me
I'm living large, yeah, I'm living the dream
It gets wild
It gets out of control
There's always loud ups at my shows
'Cause I've got fire
Yeah, I got smoke
Don't sit in the front row, no, I ain't no joke
So love me
Yeah, love me, baby
Let me take you back to the hotel, and show what I'm made of
Stage lights
Don't wanna live a normal live
Just keep the switch on, stage lights
And we can share it together
It's hot in the stage lights
Stage lights
Don't wanna live a normal live
Just keep the switch on, stage lights
And we can share it together
It's hot, hot in the stage lights
Don't wanna live a normal live
Just keep the switch on, stage lights
And we can share it together
It's hot in the stage lights
I wanna be like Gaga
I wanna be like Prince, and Madonna
Lit by clicks of the camera
Gotta race out like Indiana
I wanna be the most
The one you line up for a show
And I give it all back
'Cause I do it all for youThis is my mixtape
This is my mixtape
Won't you enjoy it with me?
Listen with care
It's all in here
My autobiograme
This is my mixtape
This is my mixtape
Won't you enjoy it with me?
Listen with care
It's all in here
My autobiograme
This is my mixtape
This is my mixtape
Won't you enjoy it with me?

        Don't need no fireworks
For us to make it work
When our flame outshines the sun
It's more than chemistry
We're dancing in the deep
Where the music only plays for us
Like glimmers in the dark
I will bring the spark
And you can make it last
'Cause, baby, we're a slow, burning fire
We're dancing in the smoke rising higher
Through the ashes of time
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
The heat we make won't ever die
'Cause we're a slow, burning fire
My vice, my sacrifice
Could never count the price
The only air I need is you
My beautiful escape
My heart, my sacred place
Even time could not undo, oh, oh, oh
Like glimmers in the dark
I will bring the spark
And you can make it last
'Cause, baby, we're a slow, burning fire
We're dancing in the smoke rising higher
Through the ashes of time
I'll be yours, you'll be mine
The heat we make won't ever die
'Cause we're a slow, burning fire
So, baby, hold on
So, baby, hold on
The best is yet to come
The best is yet to come
So, baby, hold on
Even when times are hard
It's worth the while
I just need you to hear my heart beating, baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause you're all I need, oh
Baby, won't you hear me when I tell you that I need ya, I need yaI can't help myself when I am with you
Something takes me over like a drug
Losing all my senses when I'm with you
Morning, day and night, can't get enough
I can't help myself, no
Want nobody else, no
You know that you make me lose control
You make me go crazy
Everything goes hazy
You know that you make me lose control
Don't mind being a fool when I am with you
This fire in my skin, it needs your touch
I get a burning fever when I see you
We don't need to talk, let's just make love
I can't help myself, no
Want nobody else, no
You know that you make me lose control
You make me go crazy
Everything goes hazy
You know that you make me lose control
I can't help myself, no
Want nobody else, no
You know that you make me lose control
You make me go crazy
Everything goes hazy
You know that you make me lose control
I can't help myself, no
Want nobody else, no
You know that you make me lose control
You make me go crazy
Everything goes hazy
You know that you make me lose controlGot that good loving
Giving me everything I need
That special something
There ain't nowhere I'd rather be
You got that fire
You got that ice, you got that queen
My one desire
You know ain't never gonna leave
Every day with you is something beautiful
Every moment spent is unbelievable
I just wanna play house
For the rest of my life
Loving you every day
I've never felt this way before, no
And now I just want more
We'll be so happy together
With nothing holding us back 
And it don't matter the weather, yeah
You'll always be in my heart
My hallelujah
My destiny, my chemistry
My favorite human
The only thing my eyes see
You got that sugar
You got that spice, you got that sweet
My California
My shining star on silver screen
Every day with you is something beautiful
Every moment spent is unbelievable
I just wanna play house
For the rest of my life
Loving you every day
I've never felt this way before, no
And now I just want more
We'll be so happy together
With nothing holding us back 
And it don't matter the weather, yeah
You'll always be in my heart

When you look at me girl you make me nervous
Ain't nobody perfect but I know you worth it
You just keep on flexin & it ain't on purpose
Fuck these haters they just mad they pockets hurtin
Fuck these haters they just mad they pockets hurtin
They going out sad
They in they bag
They in they birkin
You just keep on flexin & it ain't on purpose
Ain't nobody perfect but I know you worth it
Verse:
All them hours you put in from working
Girl what you doing, should be twerking
Private club only me observing
Shorty you can't even bring your bestfriend
Next question, shorty cause im selfish you know this
And I still get jealous don't show it
Want you all to myself cause you worth it
Two door droptop we swerivin
Girl we look so good like we just picture perfect
When you see us in three years we still flirting
No rap cap but girl you deserve it
Bridge:
Do the dash speeding
Fast cars and nascar we leaving
I can't take all this beauty you diva
You a beauty from heaven who sent you
Got damn you!
Chorus:
When you look at me girl you make me nervous
Ain't nobody perfect but I know you worth it
You just keep on flexin & it ain't on purpose
Fuck these haters they just mad they pockets hurtin
Fuck these haters they just mad they pockets hurtin
They going out sad
They in they bag
They in they birkin
You just keep on flexin & it ain't on purpose
Ain't nobody perfect but I know you worth itOne day when we are old
We'll laugh at the fools that we were once
All those tears we cried
Broken hearts, and wild days in the sun
I've always been by your side since we were younger
We'd smoke up until the sunrise to take the world over
But somewhere you lost your way
It's been years since I saw your face
I'll always be your lighthouse
When you are drowning in the wave
Just remember when mountains around you go crumble
It's just dust on your shoulders
When the earth starting to shaking, you tremble
It's just dust on your shoulders
Mom calls me everyday
And asks me to check if you're okay
And you know dad, he's a proud man
Loves you, but won't say it to your face
I know how you like to hide when you're heavy with sorrow
I'll take all the weight from your heart, and light up your shadows
Oceans between us have pushed us so far away
But distance can never fade the bond that we've made
When mountains around you go crumble
It's just dust on your shoulders
When your world breaks, and you're in trouble
It's just dust on your shoulders
When mountains around you go crumble
Just call me, and I will be over
I will lift all the weight from your shoulder
In my dreams, you're by my side
We are flying high in the sky
Weigh less with freedom
Gravity can never bring us down
Just remember when mountains around you go crumble
It's just dust on your shoulders
And everything passes over
Like winter to summer
Tonight, let the wind blow, and take you higher, and higher
When it all seems to big to take
It's just dust on your shoulders
Dust on your shouldersI got a heart and I got a soul
Believe me I will use them both
We made a start
Be it a false one, I know
Baby, I don't want to feel alone
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18
Long before we both thought the same thing
To be loved, to be in love
All I can do is say that these arms were made for holding you
I wanna love like you made me feel
When we were 18
We took a chance
God knows we tried
Yet all along, I knew we'd be fine
So pour me a drink oh love
Let's split the night wide open and we'll see everything
We can live in love in slow motion, motion, motion
So kiss me where I lay down
My hands press to your cheeks
A long way from the playground
I have loved you since we were 18…Not tryna be in there
Not tryna be cool
Just tryna be in this
Tell me, how you choose?
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I am right here
We were shut like a jacket
So do your zip
We will roll down the rapids
To find a way that fits
Can you feel where the wind is?
Can you feel it through?
All of the windows
Inside this room?
'Cause I wanna touch you baby
And I wanna feel you too
I wanna see the sunrise and your sins
Just me and you
Light it up, on the run
Let's make love tonight
Make it up, fall in love, try
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here
I'll hold you when things go wrong
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Gon, give love to your body

Gon, give love to your body

Gon, give love to your body
Gon, give love to your body~
But you'll never be alone
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
Baby, I'm right here

I'll be with you from dusk till dawn
I'll be with you from dusk till dawn

Two door got a bad bitch wilding
She gonna sweat me while she swallow
She off a molly She off a molly
Fuck her than pass her to johnny
My brothers indulge in the violence
But we ain't the ones too start shit
Open it up like a mosh pit
Get put out this world like martian
Wet that boy up like a faucet
Light that shit up like a arson
Now that boy the trending topic
Light that shit up like a arson
Now that boy the trending topic
What you need

My nigga pockets is on freeze
I pray they ain't plotting on me
My niggas becoming some demons
So I gotta feed them
Hoping my niggas got be something
Still tucking that nina

Verse 2 :
Girl I gave you everything
But a wedding ring
Now you wanna leave me huh
Could've hooked up with your friends
But I put you in a Benz
And I switched up everything you know
Had you switch up had you switching all your vibes
Girl you know was sup when I walked up in your life
I could put you on yeah I can change your life
Yeah I can change your life
If you knew better girl you would do better
I just had on Gucci shoes matched it with a Gucci sweater
I just met the Gucci crew
Promise that I wore it better
I was gonna bring you but I guess you doing better
Rolling round acting out now I can't hear what you saying
I just put one and two together got me praying
Hands like emoji
Don't act like you know me
Then turn around and ode
Been fucking around with my homie

When all the freaks come out to play
Late in the night I'm catching fee-elings
But with the sun, they go away
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, got neon eyes
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, I got neon eyes
Down goes the moon, and then I'm cree-eping
'Cause all my shadows stay up late
I'm so addicted to them pretty things
I wanna know just how they're made
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, I got neon eyes
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, I got neon eyes

I don't ever want go to bed
I'm a creature of the night with monsters in my head
I got monsters in my head
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, neon eyes
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself
Neon eyes, neon eyes
I been dancing with monsters in my head
I don't ever want go to bed
I'm a creature of the night with monsters in my head
I got monsters in my head
I can't help myself
I wanna lose myself

I fucked that day. like a bitch that night
I fucked that day. like a bitch that night
I fucked ,I i fucked
I fucked мне не надо подниматься
Уже на плаву ,между плантаций
Уже без проблем могу издаться
Нет не сдаться дядь
Хватить издеваться
Каждый день одно и тоже
Все теже рожи ,тот же дым в прихожей
Твоя мама мне дает сдачу
Пока пишешь ,коментарий ничтожен 
Я видел облака,они меня убили
Потом я ожил , начал менять стили
Демоны в нутри, нет они наруже
Знают что ты сейчас безоружен
Мой флоу загружен, а значит нужен vibe
Если есть vibe то нужен и хайп
Это мой гайд ,на который мне похуй
Это твой байт ,на который мне похуй
Я не твой друг тут просто порадист
Пара дисов на тебя но хватит одного
Лучшее проникновения все в одно окно
Хотел бы разобраться но не буду издеваться
I fucked that day. like a bitch that night
I fucked that day. like a bitch that night
I fucked that day. like a bitch that night
I fucked ,I i fuckedصندوق الدنيا في ايااام
حدوتت قبل النوم
وكان ياما كان كان ياما كان
قال كان ياما كان
حلم حلم مش حلمه
طار علي البساط
ونسي في الدنيا نفسه
راح مع الدخان
ولف في سجارته همه
نفسه يطلع فوق
بس شطانه قعدله
بتلف بيك والدور عليك
وانت الخسران
هتروح لفين مفيش طريق
ولا باب وراك
مش هشتريك با فلوس هبيع
وده الى دار
كله بيعبي ومش فارق الحرام
تتحاكه عنا ايام
اتبهدل فيها جدعان
عشنا فيها فرسان
منهبش غير لله
في الشارع حريفه
واخد الحق صنعه
عشنا نستنا نور
يكسر فينا الضلمة
بنادى الحظوظ
بافلوس نفوز
نعله وندوس
سكران في خيالي
مش بفوق
مقامي عالي
صحبي فوق
عارف طريقي مش هتوه
صندوق الدنيا في ايااام
حدوتت قبل النوم
وكان ياما كان كان ياما كان
حمدت ربي
زدت نعمه
علي في ايدي
مش هعمه
هدي خيري
صون جميلي
ومش هسيبك والنعمه
النيه صافيه
و ربي اعلم
علي الارض
وروحي بتعله
عشتنا كابوس
بيبداء ، اول !
لما بنصحا !
صحبي خليك فايق
منمشيش علي الموضه
والصفار الي داير
اتربينا ع الاصول
في الروح اسود
عشنا فيها فقرا
بس ملوكصحبي مولع مارلبورو
بضرب الطابور محدش هنا ياخد دورو
مش بخاف من حد اصلي
عندي عين حورس
هتشاف مهما عملت focus
صحبي المجد بينادينا بنلبي
من بلد الغريب بنأدى
هخلي الاصم يسمعني
شووواف دهب
عنك معمي

قلبي معبي بس الفاضي اصلا نسيت
وصحيت مش فاكر حتا شكل البيت

في الغريق نزلوني
خرجة با دخنه فيها همومي
نتقابل بس في سكة الموت
بلاش نروح ياصحبي هنتوه
اخاف عليك لا تلف بيك ودور
لحد امته هيتقالك فوق
بنخسر بعض واحد ورا التاني
مش بكيفك ولا علي مزاجي
دوست معاك في الطين
وقولت عادي
دلوقتي محدش فينا بقا يستنا التاني
مش ارجوز مش هطلع مسرح
تعبت وهنهي حياتي بسرعه هاتي المشرط
مش قادر امثل اني قادر اكتر من كدا
هتخرج من النار ولا مرتاح هنا
كفايه كبر في الغلط
كفايه شرب في القرف
اصحا لحالك
صحبي
محدش هينفعك
بلاش تنادي
محدش هينفعك

Feed me hope I need you
Hope I need you in my home
Come in and bless my soul
You go way up high
With made up lies
I’m Leaving
I’m never forgetful
I’m never forgetful
 
I see an angel
I give her my name
She say
What you doing
In this long portrayal of pain
Won’t you go insane
Please don’t fade away
Nation
Feed me hope I need you
Hope I need you in my home
Come in and bless my soul
You go way up high
With made up lies
I’m leaving
I’m never forgetful
I’m never forgetful
 I never knew that you'd be back
You seem so distant from my path
I never knew you'd unfold
Your presence flickers
Deep inside my soul
I never see you
Never knew you
Never hear from you
But you got to shine
Cause you're my shedding light
All alone I've been driving all night long
All alone I've been traveling all night long
You're my light
You're my reason
You're my shedding light
Till the end
You will never fall
In the end
And I worked my way opening up to you
And I see that u put all my trust in you
I never see it
You know me
You see me
You got me
I never knew you'd see me after all
I knew you got me
You know me
You see me
I'm fucked up
I wanna get my way back home
To you
To you
I wanna get back home
You'e my shedding light
All alone I've been driving all night long
All alone Ive been traveling all night long
Cuz you're my shedding light          
            Lyrics for this song have yet to be released. Please check back once the song has been released.
          
        I don't hate, nor do despise
But one fact all heroes want
Yet it's time that flies
Does man feel strong in disguise?
Like an optical switch to dim our light
Why not leave it bright so we fear no night?
No wolves that howl may break our might
Arm in arm, left to right
Just see human, not black nor white
Just a brother that feels like I lost inside, a world that died
I see a sister I see in many
They all have stories, I have heard plenty
Greed and power run the quenching
Stop the ego and break the fences
And when they say, "Build a wall"
Will you say, "For who's house? Who should I call?"
I do not profess a political manner
But Oprah does, and I still stan her
I'm a poet, I speak my mind
Take what you will and comprehend it
A thought just popped in the middle of this sentence
if time just stopped, then we'd never see the ending
I guess that's the beauty of every creator given life
We see and feel the miracle around us all the time
We breathe and just the oxygen is enough to get you highLines of linear, though most times singular
Are not visual without contrast
We don't see white, unless on black
The two are tied with knots exact
Do we need time machines?
To see the scenes of a foreign past
Or is it there to stare at fact
Written words of visions blurred
There, one man's eyes
Why feel deterred, don't emotion stir
Let your noise be heard
Sheep, not man, that walks in herds
Hold in hand that wooden staff
That guides your light and shows your path
Live a life for the aftermath
Smile with joy and cry with laugh
The lines of life are intertwined
We feel them all a dark sublime
Massively flawed with a beautiful designWarming like a planet's core
Enormous heart with a pointless cause
Ginormous art without a meaning
To create and judge could be deceiving
On which pillar to which I'm leaning
I hate to pause, why not resume it
Hope consuming does the proving
Be it so
The battle's own and we're all losing
The villains win, I'm unassuming
Underdogs all win in movies
When honest words are spoke truly
There's nothing wrong with solely movingHear when she comes
'Cause she drowns the noise of the world
Her footsteps echo
Through my mind, every night, and day
She's so cold
But burns hotter than the sun
When she was mine
But now I'm not the only one
But I really want you
Even if it kills me
Poison ivy
Still I really want you
Even if you kill me
Poison ivy
Racing the streets
Yeah, I search your shadows every night
She calls my name
I come running almost every time
She's so clean
But always leaves a mess behind
Is it too late for me
Am I just wasting time?
But I really want you
Even if you kill me
Poison ivy
Still I really want you
Even if you kill me
Poison ivy
Poison ivy
You're poison ,you're poison, you're poison
Lost all control
My body, and soul
When you hold my gun
And press the trigger
Shoot to kill
But I really want you
Even if you kill me
Still I really want you
Even if you kill me
'Cause I'd do anything to get you closer
Jump on a moving train
Put a bullet right through my brain
As long as it gets your attention, baby
Baby, baby, baby
Even if you kill me
But I really want you
Still I really want youFreedom fighters
Throw your lighters in the air
Freedom fighters
Oh, tell 'em Matis
Sha' all of them freedom fighters
Now throw your lighters in-a da sky
Jus' a lil', ya' li'
I no don't real' lie
Another to ride the skies
'Cause you never know
When your wev' could go
From one day to another
I stay high like eagle's feathers
As I fly through the night sky
In stormy weather, brought the clouds
To stay tough, just like leather
I'm the cleverest dude to say never
Will I be 
Ya' an attempt that I rely on the sacred one
Lift me up from this dirt, and scum
I run over,a nd above the treeline
Climb the highest mountain, and rewind
Freedom fighters
Throw your lighters in the air
Freedom fighters
Throw your lighters in a-da air
Used to stay up all night fighting voices in my head
Got get me paralyzed, made me feel I was dead
But a fire inside showed me who I'm meant to be
Now I don't give a damn, it's who I am
I'll find myself in a past life
I'm running through the foolish life
1945, to stay alive
My swallowing the frights
I'm not afraid to die
But afraid to bow to this Nazi bite
I ride on the wolf cry, burns inside
I swear, one day I might fly
Take off like my dreams, and soar through the night sky
Crying "freedom", now I'm high above the treeline
Freedom fighters
Throw your lighters in-a da air
Freedom fighters
Throw your lighters in-a da air
I can feel it like Holy May
But I'm held by gravity
And these voices that they hold in me
I seen my destiny
I can feel it like Holy May
But I'm held by gravity
My eyes, and start to believe
That I've always been free
Oh, it'smy destiny
I've got to be free
My destiny
I got to be free
Freedom fightersWhile searching for the answer
I forgot the question
Tired of these circles I make
Around myself
'Cause I have a way to break everything
Inside
I think I've reached the end, could no longer pretend
I'm fine
Sometimes I feel like a zombie
Can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
I hope it's not too late for me
So can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
Maybe it's my father
That left with me these issues
I guess seeing my mother cry too many times
Left me confused
I need new medicine, or maybe some new skin
Somewhere else to hide
Maybe my soul has a glitch, maybe some past-life shit
Can you see it in my eyes, doctor?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie
Can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
I hope it's not too late for me
So can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
Wish I could go back
Crawl back in the womb
Where everything was good
And everything was good
Now I'm so lost
While trying to find my way
To me
Take my money, tell me what you see
'Cause I'm too blind to see it for me
Here's my struggle, it's all in here
All you gotta do is find the key
I can trust you, now I paid
Hope to God you're not a mistake
'Cause only the sick come to this place
Should I stop, then turn away?
Yeah, I'm scared
I don't know what the fuck I'm doing here
Why you cross your legs in front of me?
Have I accepted that I'm going crazy?
Whoa, so many books
No past-condescending looks
I don't care, the doctor said it would work
So tell me
Can you fix me, can you fix me, uh, Mr. Therapy?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie
Can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
I hope it's not too late for me
So can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
Sometimes I feel like a zombie
Can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?
I hope it's not too late for me
So can you fix me, Mr. Therapy?When I get to New York City
Yeah, pops, I finally make it
With the hipsters in the crowd
We'll run this town wild
When I get to New York City, yeah
It's been a long time coming
But I never lost a fire
You always inspire
When we're together
Oh, New York City, yeah, c'mon
I'll make a name in New York City
I'll get it locked in Brooklyn
They'll hear my music in the streets
DJ's playing my beats
In New York City, huh
'Cause I don't need no money
No girls to make me happy
You're the drug that gets me high
Skyscrapers in the sky
Oh, New York City
This dream
Like a drug in a vein
Oh, this dream
Oh, it's calling my name
Oh, this dream
Will take my soul in New York City
This dream
Won't let me open my eyes
Oh, this dream
Oh, there's blur in the lines
Oh, this dream
Is taking me to New York City
New York City
New York City
New York CityEverybody knows too much
Living has lost its touch
We gotta go too deep to find
An experience in our times
Are we growing up too fast
Are you catching on too slow
'Cause the answers don't fit the question
Why are you all so cynical?
Fuck work, and getting jobs until you're old
To retire at 60, when all you got left is broken bones
Wanna live a life that's built with riches in my hand
So I'ma pop a pill, and be a dreamer instead
We're just drugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
Drugs, and kids
Moving in a chemical free
We're just dugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
We're just kids, kids, kids
Running free
Parents lost the right to care
Broken families everywhere
How to find some clarity
Well, we lost faith in reality
Sometimes we throw your cares in the wind
To see the light that darkness brings
To find what lives in deep within
To carry on these dead-ends
In these crazy times, all I can see
We deeply crave something real
Knowledge strobe, discovery
And youth lost its mystery
We're just drugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
Drugs, and kids
Moving in a chemical free
We're just dugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
We're just kids, kids, kids
Running free
The girls look so in fighting
With the pretty eyes
When normal leaves so cold, yeah, yeah
I swear I'm Superman
When I'm feeling high
I can turn water to gold
Look at our friends
Aren't they crazy?
Parents ain't home
Come live with me
We got all night
The rest of our life
Could wait, we're in high
Excuse me world while I get wasted
We're just drugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
Drugs, and kids
Moving in a chemical free
We're just dugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
We're just kids, kids, kids
Running free
Just drugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
Drugs, and kids
Moving in a chemical free
We're just dugs, and kids
Dancing in a chemical garden
We're just kids, kids, kids
Running freeThe phone rings again
I know who it is
At 2 AM
Broken promises
I thought you said
It would be the last time
You crashed on the sidewalk
Under the rain
Wrecked, and broken
And pretending
That you don't love
Being at the end of the line
Here we go, like before
Though we played so innocent
When we both know how it ends
'Cause I'm not what you want
But I got what you need
Be your bandage when your heart bleeds
Crashing your phone
You've got to call on me
I'll be your last chance, be your answer for a breath
When it's all done, you're the only one left
Be your lifeline, baby, I'll be your emergency
Red lights, sirens
For your rescue
Fast as I can
Just to get you
Pleading, screaming all for the spectacle, oh
We need disaster
To bring us closer
But I know after
When it's over
We'll heal the scars, and be right back for more
'Cause I'm not what you want
But I got what you need
Be your bandage when your heart bleeds
Crashing your phone
You've got to call on me
I'll be your last chance, be your answer for a breath
When it's all done, you're the only one left
Be your lifeline, baby, I'll be your emergency
You're like a hurricane destroying everything, yeah
How long before there's nothing left to break?
I will run into the storm 'til there's nothing left anymore
Though I know you'll never change
'Cause I'm not what you want
But I got what you need
Be your bandage when your heart bleeds
Crashing your phone
You've got to call on me
I'll be your last chance, be your answer for a breath
When it's all done, you're the only one left
Be your lifeline, baby, I'll be your emergencyI feel so stupid
For letting it slip away
Maybe I'm just crazy
And now I'll never understand why I
Keep running these circles inside my head
Hopefully I get it before you find me dead
I can see the light in, and out
What's it trying to say?
Why do I feel so strange?
Why do I let it all get to my head?
How do I lose control
When it was all in the palm of my hand?
So strange
I get so lonely
Without her hand to hold
On Sunday morning
Who's gonna share my home with me?
I'm gonna rock a ship, going up, and down
Maybe I'll hit a star, maybe I'll turn around
Sometimes I feel like I'm from another galaxy
What is meant for me?
Why do I feel so strange?
Why do I let it all get to my head?
How do I lose control
When it was all in the palm of my hand?
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
Oh, I lose myself
Get put on the shelf
When the voices that coming in
I'm going insane
Took a trip on a plane
That keeps me far a-, far away
When will this end?
I stop, and pretend
Like it's all in my control
But when I open my eyes
It's all upside down
I'm staring right at my fault
So strange, so strange, so strange
So strange, so strange, so strange
So strange, so strange, so strange
So strange, so strange, so strange
Why do I feel so strange?
Why do I let it all get to my head?
How do I lose control
When it was all in the palm of my hand?
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do I
How do IShe's like a 55
Deville Cadillac
She takes the top down, and leaves smoke behind her tracks
You know she stops traffic
But don't stop for red lights
When I try to chase her, yeah, she's out of sight
When you say you want me, you need me
Girl, you just gotta know, you make me lose control
When she says she wants me, she needs me
Ooh, you know I'm good to go, I'm ready to explode
'Cause she's my supped up girl
That girl is overload
You know she overthrows
She's got me freaking
She's my supped up girl
When she takes me to the max
Gives me a heart attack
That's how she does it, my girl
That's how she does it, my girl
My supped up girl
I take her for a ride
Until she lose control
I race her all night, burn rubber on the floor
Put the pedal to the metal
Until she tells me stop
With my hands on her gears, I'll take it up a notch
When you say you want me, you need me
Girl, you just gotta know, you make me lose control
When she says she wants me, she needs me
Ooh, you know I'm good to go, I'm ready to explode
'Cause she's my supped up girl
That girl is overload
You know she overthrows
She's got me freaking
She's my supped up girl
When she takes me to the max
Gives me a heart attack
That's how she does it, my girl
Won't you come, and you give me your body
Won't you come, and you give me your body
You know how much I love you, baby
You know I love it when you're acting naughty
You know I crave it when you're acting crazy
Oooh, baby, baby, baby, baby
'Cause she's my supped up girl
That girl is overload
You know she overthrows
She's got me freaking
She's my supped up girl
When she takes me to the max
Gives me a heart attack

My supped up girlWe're in a state of emergency
Evacuate, and leave it all behind
Release your fears, set your mind at ease
Tonight we throw it all in the fire
Lose your grip, you got not control
Humanity is down to the wire
Let the music take over your soul
As it's getting hot, hot, hot
If it all burns down
Oh, our ashes will spread on to the dance floor
If it all burns down
Oh, we'll rise with the phoenix for an encore
Crash against the wall of apathy
Until you're bringing down every stone, yeah
Rebuild this world with integrity
And trace a path that will take us home, yeah
When the leader love a brand new way
Each time move around, it's crumbling down, yeah
You're the light of a brand new day
So keep it hot, hot, hot

Oh, we'll rise with the phoenix for an encore
The world is in a crisis

We could make a difference
If we really try
To come together

Yo, yo a fix 'em still after
You keep breaking my heart
But I keep coming back for more
Hello goodbye

Run as fast as I can
But you're quicker than a bullet
You shoot to kill
Mama, when you in your cold
You still trigger happy
Yo, yo a nuclear reactor
One touch and the flames comes after
You keep breaking me down
Why do I keep coming back for more?
Hello goodbye
Hello goodbye
Hello goodbye
We try to  times
When you come, and you come, and you calling my name
I go out of my head, girl, you drive me insane
I keep pressing the gas, though I know we're gon' crash again
I like to close my eyes when I breath in your lies
'Cause I love to pretend that everything is fine
But we both know that this madness has to end
Hello goodbye

Craves the taste of my flesh
Her latest victim
Not just her lover, her prey
She got, she got, she got

All that you need
But you might have to kill her yourself

Crazy 'til I'm screaming
First time I saw her, I knew, yeah, it was too late
Now I'm locked up in her cage
She got, she got, she got
She licks her lips when she's done
And leaves me wanting
Lying lovesick in her way
She's got all that you want
All that you need
But you might have to kill her yourself
She wants all that you got
All that you need
As she won't hesitate to kill
She's a maneater, a maneater
A maneater, a maneater
A maneater
And she won't let go, go, go

Little zay got the deal on em
Popped a Milli
Cause Im swaggin
When i kill on em
They walk around thinking they bad
But badly
Got the diamond on em
They posted up looking all sad won't em
They all like race tracks
They all come to an end
In that start position ready to take em inYo
Thinkin out loud
I must have about a milli on me right now
Single handed
I don't give a fuck about theses rappers
Kill streak
I can care less about these rappers
Uh
Slaying others gotta show these pop hoes
Ain't gotta run cause I'm paying shop closed
Ask me where I get it from it from
I don't tell a soul
If you wanna come and get it from me bitch whatever goes
Felicia wassup
Is you here right now
Caught you on cam digging in your ass right now
Yo
Yo
Do you fear me
I feed off others bitches when they scared of me
I might kill a couple niggas if you dare
I ain't never need a cell to take care of me
Yo
I'm on the billboard
Bitches can't touch this
I compete everyday
Bitches on my hit list
Your whole life and your fame I invented
I ain't taking that back cause i meantt it
