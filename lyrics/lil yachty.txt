Lil Boat!
Okay
I've got these strange voices inside my head
Keep a stack and .380 beside my bed
Not to be cool, but in case they run up on me
If y'all bet on my fam, clutch with double on me
Went to school on a dirt road with black hoes and potholes
This shit was just then, this was four months
Late nights with gang on them store hunts
Loitering Walmart for pure fun
Look at me now, all of my classmates like, "Wow"
My teachers like, "Damn"
I remember I didn't have not a fan
Now I step out and Lil Boat is the man
Woah, this shit is surreal
Pockets stuffed in with blue bills
So much people trying to ask how it feels
But, nigga, I don't know
Everyday I ball like finger roll 
How'd you do it? Only God knows 
I want to know who's real until the time folds
People looking at Lil Boat with their hands out cause I'm wearing nicer clothes
I'ma stay down with the same niggas I came up with, that's the master plan
26 for a nigga hand, diamonds so cold you might need a fan 
I don't know who I am sometimes
I might rap a verse, I might sing a song
Came up overnight from one song
One night get her out the thong
Old heads hating on Boat
'Cause I'm young as fuck and I'm rich as hell
Pants low like I'm fresh in jail
But I've been out, motherfuck 12 
See, he's a little--he's a little bit more aggressive. Well, you know, as this story unfolds, and you know what I'm saying, as the story gets told, uh, I'll tell you a little bit more about Yachty. He's a little bit nicer. Let's call him
Hello? Hello?

Riding an i8s in a race through Chicago

Back to the bando
I Tokyo Drift like the sample
When shit wasn't sweet and so simple
When it was just churches and candles
We ain't have no Turks and no Caicos 
No fresh pedicure for the sandals 
We learned how to pedal, no handles
Back when we traveled,  we trapped and we peddled right front of the Santos 
Like who wanna match? I'm runnin' the maps
I run it like laps, they runnin' in last
I might overlap and won't double back 'cause my past is my past
They all from my path and part on my back
She wanted a bag, wanted some Raf
Mines came with a name, hers came with some change
We want the same thing, let's not get offtrack 
I'm up in that bitch skatin' 
My wrist alone is the Ritz, I'm sayin' 
Super Saiyan blonde, her lacefront on 
Nigga, don't make me wait too long 
Flippin' rates of that Grey Poupon
I play you food for all
My bitch watch VH-1, first sixty days, RuPaul
She been around Tyler way too long
Um
It's young T and he be that boy
I talk death, but I don't like guns
I talk love, but I don't got none
They talk charts, but they don't got one
You got a stage, then it's one-point-one for one hour
Niggas came second to me, they so sour
Had a slow climb, that's why they all doubt 'em
And still came out on top, now that's power 
Fuck they respect, I won't miss a step, I won't intercept
The tip of my tongue, I still got my soul and still got the check like
Bling, bling, bitch, I feel like Juvie
Raw as fuck, bitch, I feel like sushi
Watch Blank Face and feel like Groovy
Neck lookin' like a thot in labor
But it's goin' up like it's an escalator
Boys goin' down like Titanic sailor
Yachty here and him from Decatur
Flacko freer than a Costco plate of them samples, nigga

Little ass bitch, nah, you ain't in my category
Unicorn rare, better put a saddle on, nigga

I went to your show and took little nap 
That's why we not in the same bracket of tax
I'm that nigga, bitch
I did it all with the passion, I'm a god in this fashion
Niggas tryna fit in with their arms in the jacket 
Had to pull myself together like it's all elastic
Got the heart of a dragon, I'm a star, call me Patrick
Heard the bitch was talkin' shit, so I caught him in traffic
I'm the type to walk in your house and shit on your mattress
, ugh
I'm good, you could take it all away 
I'm God, you follow me 'cause I know the way 
I'm in Philly and we all fly 
If we don't got the whip, we do the walk-by 
On your new picture, we archive 
If we cross paths, leave you cross-eyed
Had to slap a bitch, chose the wrong side 
Mob ties, bitch, you get hog-tied, you chose the wrong side
Mrs. Whack, I love your flow, nobody rhymin' like that
Had to clean out my trunk to put your mom in the back
The cops pulled me over, they don't know your mom in the back
Big Whack makin' niggas take permanent naps
These hoes can't rap, they need a permanent pack
I ain't fuckin' with you boys, need the cervical cap
Okay, I'm bored
Okay, I'm tired
Sleepy, huh
Yeah, I don't wanna be like nobody else 
Lookin' so good, I might rob myself 
Realize I gotta hide the wealth 
Told bro it's okay to be rich and stealth 
Twenty-two, I might go fuck a MILF 
My two assistants both white as milk 
Maybach, inside came soft as silk 
Put a bitch on the molly, now she tilt
This bitch been killed, built like a crushed can
Makin' rap friends more sketch than a white van
Billionaire Boat, more freedom than a white man
Fuckin' on a bitch and she sound like a hype man
Lookin' for a fly nigga, I'm what you type in 
Been counted out since I could count 
Got a public and a private account 
For my bank and not my Insta', bitchAll night I've been watching you

2016 RD gonna be fucking hoes down by the lake
Wait did that in 2012
Damn RD you living well
Bitches ain't on me begging, but now I'm on my name ring bells
Linking shit like Zelda, so boy respect your elders
I might be younger physically, but mentally I'm older
And visually I'm colder
And psychologically bolder
I'm back again with backwoods
Hoe roll 'em up
Where were you from throw it up
Cuz all my niggas down to buck
SKT my fucking gang
NAZ my fucking gang
YC that's my fucking gang
'Cause Byou let them pistols bang
Peter Piper picked a pepper
RD ran right through your ranch 'cause you ain't real
Niggas drink a little purple and swear to god they so damn trill
Dirty south Titanium grill
Show your bitch who really real
Looking so damn rich you would've thought a nigga hit a heist
Dabbing with all of this white
Looking like a bowl of rice
Flexing hard I'm Jerry Rice, I'm MVP on every night
If I get on I'm living right
Sip dirty Sprite like every night
RIP to A$AP Yams
Money like a bank scam
Counting all my money on a yacht with my bitch Tam
And she came from Alabama, new whip paint on Tropicana
Make it seem like opera
I'm shooting shit like GRA GRA
In love with the big tatas
Su casa, Mi casa
Run in your shit and then take it
Stacking chips like VegasBought a new bitch
And she white like work
If a nigga talking down
I got D Wade under my shirt
Monster truck rims on the Chevy
Got me up now
Water diamonds dancing in my chain
She wanna fuck now
Only time I drink soda
When I drink lean
Only time I'm geeking off
Is when I pop a bean
A nigga fuck with K $upreme
Then he fucking with me
Told these niggas not to trust me
I'm always gon' scheme
See that 32 is gon' stack
Put it in my backpack and watch it double up
Young RD from the 6 buckin on any nigga, I don’t give a fuck
Dumb dumb like a tow truck
On your gang gang, that’s an e-crash
Nigga want static that’s a e smash
Nigga’s not really stacking up the cash
I been livin' life low sippin Barney tear
I can’t wait to move out so I can pierce my ears
Put them rocks on my shit, got me look like first
I done talked to niggas once, It’s time to remember
I done dropped a couple hundreds just for my shirt
Nigga’s name not Ferg but I put in work
Pullin' off in a beam, make em skrt skrt skrt
Bitches all up on my dick, that shit’s startin' to hurt
I been workin' all night so my mom won’t hurt
Chopper chopper make em jump like he praisin' the church
Man, I pray a fuck nigga step up on my turf
Bitch It’s Young RD and I’m balling like Dirk
Yeah It’s Young RD
Shout out to them – shout out to them niggas at 
Niggas that got me fucked up all the way up
They thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney
You know what I’m sayin, You feel me?
Niggas thinkin' a nigga ain’t got shmoney ya digg?
That nigga got me fucked up
On the four on four to the two on two
You smell thatTold her, "Don't wait for me"
Your time is up, better save it, please
I just ran up me a eighty piece 
She on her knees suckin' dick like she pray to me
Doggin' that bitch 'til her face full of Maybelline
In my cup, maybe it's lean, we don't do no green
Left wrist on Billie Jean, Billie Jean, Billie Jean
Draft Day, he poppin', no, Sante ain't stoppin'
He need all his profits, some say that he cocky
I know that he got it, he flew a bitch out from the tropics
Exotic, I'm smokin', Supreme, had to box it
458 'Rari take off like rockets
Wide body kit like Buffie the Body
All-white Maybach, I nicknamed it Scotty 2 Hotty 
My Mexican bitch treat me like Liberace 
I threw twenty thousand on twenty-five strangers
Being raised by QC prepared me for the danger 
My stick got a scope like a Texas park ranger
I look up to Mom and Mom only
I ran up a sack in some orange grey Saucony's
My bitches give love, but I'm still feelin' lonely
My heart got a space the same size as a condo
No money can fill it, I'm hot as a skillet 
These rappers two-faced so bad, I could peel it
And see they true colors, I cut every finger for all of my brothers
I'll hop off the plane backwards wrapped in some Louis V covers
Head first in the gutter 
If it's for the guap, fettucine
Might cop a new truck, cream like alfredo linguini
These new niggas weenies
The year is '06 with my black Bapesta beanie
She rub on my gold like there might be a genie
I can't take a bad dressin' bitch to my mama
I might take the bitch from the hood to Bahamas
Show her 'bout the world, this bitch here ain't even my girl 
I pass the bitch off, let the homie go handle it 
Big pointer stones 'round my neck light the room like a candle lit 
Don't get too close, 7.62's knock off your shoulder, dismantle it
Masked up, no Rip Hamilton , you niggas squares like Carlton
I'm in Bel-Air  posted at Nobu, inside the whip, orange like Goku
Lil' boy, I done told you, I been hit the ho, that's old news
These niggas be cappin', no Pro Tools
Twenty-two, bitch, and I look like a mogul 
Got more money than your whole family tree 
Double that shit, and you still won't reach me 
You in the nosebleeds, I sit in floor seats
Right where the coach at, but you can't coach me
Draft Day been on that, sound like Kobe
Please name a nigga who really can stop me 
Can't no one stop you, you next like the runner-up
Niggas big flexin', they bitch, I'ma look her up
Hook her up, dick her down
Got a new stick, nine-mil' bullets, send thirty rounds
Ready to hunt a clown 
I been that nigga since, uh, I can't remember
Since when? Wintertime and I remembered December
Wore a dress, now they tryna slander my gender
My bitch was on set lookin' mighty tender 
So fuck what they talkin' 'bout, tell 'em to watch they mouth
'Fore I get outta body , and I knock 'em out
I bought twelve different whips like it's nothin' new
I keep blicks on the hip like they stuck with glue
I drop bombs on a bitch, I'm not DJ Clue 
My niggas bangin' red, it's the way of life 
We buyin' guns like it's illegal owning knifes
Fuckin' my Asian, she makin' me jasmine rice 
I took a whole lotta slander from fuck niggas, broke niggas
Fuck all of that, I'm the prototype
Grabbin' the wheel, I give a fuck 
Nigga want smoke, I hope that it's up
Aimin' the stick at the square like the game with the duck
Nigga gon' knuck if you buck 
I got like ten different watches I never wear
My Louis mono, not no Damier 
At the penthouse with three different concierge 
I know all of my haters cannot compare Rollin' in my pimpin’, ain't no tellin' what I’m finna do

My beeper just a-beepin' so I'm takin' a risk to drop off two

Keys in my lap , just in case these niggas stangin'

You can turn the headphones up
'Cause I’m equipped with that pistol grip
Slime 
The whole gang slime 
Pull up a sauna, I'm fine 
Reach in the bag, grab the iron 
Still rock the ice when I'm flyin', uh 
If she ain’t fuckin', she spyin' 
Niggas be hatin' on gang 
Really just sound like they cryin' 
These niggas bit on the cap 
Carl Ripley's, I think they lyin' 
These old niggas gettin' washed 
They can buy every new watch 
It still wouldn't buy 'em more time 
I pick the drip, you get slimed, huh

Caught me a vibe, yeah a negative energy
Don't be upset that I called you a mini-me
Keep me a Uzi, that shit be the minigun
Hunnid round clips, pop it right in the Tommy gun
My niggas shoot, they don't do the octagon, yup
Spider drop out like Decepticon 
Right at your crib while you're eatin' dinner 
Dressed in a mask like it's Comic-Con 
Twelve came in the hotel room

Nut fill up to her gums 
All in her stomach like TUMS 
Rollin' in my pimpin', ain't no tellin' what I'm finna do
Yeah, yeah, yeah, I said what I said nigga

Cleanin' her face off like she got a bump
I'm in a old school, so my bitch got a rump

Yup, yup

Broke niggas still talkin' the loudest
When you doing bad, niggas the proudest
Need a deposit before the private
Too exclusive, you can't talk to my manager
AK chopstick, cock it back and I damage her
Back in high school had a bitch out in Banneker
Talkin' bout Stephanie used to  selling act to the felonies
I fuck  caucasian, ebony, indian, cinnamon
"Ain't fucking, come again", never heard that before
Bitch off the X she bout high as a acrophobia
Geeked off the shrooms, she swear she seen a UFO
Brother had bricks like an old house chimney
Walk in the crib, that's the gang house reminy
Back in college I was fairly odd like Timothy
Now I blew up like you mixed the wrong thing in chemistry
And I give a fuck if you into me, fuck the industry
These niggas fake, my young niggas slimeball with the drake Niggas said you sweet as hell like you cake
Eat it up, eat it up off the plate, nigga
And I been poppin' and these niggas got animosity
I can feel it in the air like Phil Collins
Got a stupid bitch, she like doing pills, call her Mary Poppins
I could give a fuck bout a rap nigga
I could give a fuck about a pump, pump, pump it up old ass rap nigga
Talking about how it ain't gon' last for a nigga
Just to keep it real, I made more money in the last two than you ever did

Fuck that bitch up in my kitchen , the table granite 
Don't take me for granted 
Bitch, I'm not on this planet 
She keep sayin' it, she keep sayin it, she think I'm Satanic 
She see six hundred, six-six thousand, she think she's gon' vanish
Uh, Patek on Pacific time 
In that 'Rarri, I don't drive in lines
Rather pay the highway fines 
Brrat, blam, beep, fuck 'em
These lil' niggas, I ain't ever gon' trust 'em
Don't slide to the side, treat 'em just like Russ
Throw cash on the ground, watch it grow like a mushroom 
Thinkin' 'bout coppin' me a old school '64
Call up Big Gwaluh, gotta ask him to put the lick on

Fuckin' this bitch but got chemistry

Comin' up, Burberry, champagne, my bitch pure 
I create the cure, I fuck up the looks 
I pop Percs, sip lean, don't drink liquor 
From the D, might buy wires with the mink fur 
My nigga Yachty quit the Wocky, I'm like, "Is you sure?"
We off a lotta syrup, but I still'd shoot 
Know I be with niggas special as I'm killin' crews 
Yeah, whole gang of niggas who make niggas move 
Fuck a bitch and her momma if I feel it's bool 
Skubaroo make a pass , the daughter send me nudes 
I got racks on racks on racks so I see Roger Federer 
Fuck the opps, I up chops on all my competitors 
If there's smoke, we at your throat, we take extreme measures 
Shoot him in his shoot then do it again to make him bleed extra 
We at your door like extra, extra, read all about it
All my niggas teeth gold like they 'bout it 'bout it 
Three different hoes stacked up in my new Ferrari
They don't even know each other but they sittin' body to body 
Half of my staff white on white, look like Scotty 2 Hotty 
My main bitch got two phones, one for when I call
Strap it to her purse, that shit look like a lil' Tamagotchi 
On my momma, boy, I hate when they call me Lil Yatchy 
I hate the paparazzi 
 Niggas better not call me any fuckin' thang but Sada 
Call me Skuba and I don't know you, I'll beat up or shot ya

On our way back to the nearest  and

Keep all thatLyrics from Snippet
... time today
 her back to my balcony closet, yeah-eah
Pussies keep steppin' my shoes
So what's the problem?
Stompin' niggas out ...It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
They all straight clones
It seems like everywhere I walk they all look and talk like RD
They wanna be me
Shit like leadin’ the blind, all these niggas Stevie
They copy NAZ, these niggas wannabe
I just might aim the chopper tonight
And I store my ice right by the fuckin' Häagen-Dazs
Them niggas sweet as pie
Never will I rock with that shit up on my guys
Talk down I let it fly, gold teeth catch a bitches eye
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
They all straight clones
She lookin' at me cause she know I got a wallet
You got the drank on me, put it in my goblet
Just let me fold it, keep my pockets on flawless
I’m smoking leaves man it’s too easy, feel like autumn
My shit movin' faster than I’m sellin' it
I know they weak boy, got no skeleton
Do not ask me if you relevant
I’m shinin' on these fakers in my lemon whip
It seems like everywhere I go they all wanna be like me and my gang
They all straight clones
They all straight clones
In a white whip, boy I look like Gandalf
Slide that ring on your girls finger, take off
Northside, my guys know I never stop
We pull up to the spot then we make it pop
Then we make it pop, then we make it pop
Then we make it popLil Boat!

Got visions and I won’t stop until a nigga kill me
22 brothers back home and they need me
Got stacks in my wallet, they say Lil Boat be scheming
Never take bitches with me on the road
Pick them hoes up as we go
I thought that you know, thought that you knew
Went to a yacht from a lil small canoe, woah
I make it look so easy
That’s why they wanna be me, woah
They wanna be me
I remember when they used to laugh at Boat
Woah, woah, woah, woah, woah, woah
That’s why I don’t listen to nobody, no
Never spend guap on no bitch or no hoe
I remember when they told me, “Boat you can do it”
I told them folks, “sit back and watch me pursue it”
You gon’ see
All them hating on me
You gon’ see
Just wait, they all gon’ see

Ain't get rich overnight, no, I planned it
Sat down and I drew it out
Can a bitch get in front of my bands? No, never, she can't
I'm on the roof watchin' the ranks
I cannot lose and we pour the drank
She off a blue and I'm off a pink
I'm gonna do whatever I think
Don't know what the dude even gon' think
I'm poppin' up in schools and runnin' in banks
Not lookin' at you , I'm never not talkin' in vain
It's not that I will do but it's more that you can't
I will not name , I will not shame 'cause I know that pain
Nigga, this voodoo, the way I control you 
Bitch ain't let me fuck back then, oh why? That bitch is old news
I don't wanna put that time in, later on everyone just slid in

Fuckin this bitch she a matchmade in heaven
Met a little brother that nigga was madaline
Said he gon make it, told him keep peddelin
A don't be contained no substance can settelin
Gandma still bought on the Reverend
Ain't got this studio gambling
Broke out a bitch in the back and he damaging
Pass it to gang Peter fitch like makeup
Ass super fat but the titties are a-cup
Been had a tectonic gold like Marc Jacob
Shot for his chest and his life in a hiccup
Rich and I'm weak I cannot do a situp
Body can't just told him go get his fed up
And top
Eight grand
Need a bitch outside the door it's sand
Fuck on the jet till the time that we land
Cool we made it, you still a fan
All of the followers don't even know Gram
Say what I want cause I'm rich and I can

        Lyrics from Snippets
Yeah, for real?
Mm, yup, yup
Ha-ha, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh, yuh
Yuh, aye
Wow!
Tell 'em we rich now
Tell him I might fuck his bitch now
Might cop a coupe with the shift now
Finally got money to order my food and pay tips now
Might as well fuck with the crips now
But I still fuck with the big Bs
You’da catch hot shells like hot cakes all day like it's Mikey Ds
Use to ride 'round on the 22s, walkin’ around in them 23s
 call that shit double Gs
I done bought Gucci's last 5 seasons
I hit your bitch at the four seasons
Niggas find every reason I still  being life, dawg
I rock a wedding ring on my marriage finger
But I can't have a wife, dawg
Still with a tribe on a quest, tryna get it, yeah, R.I.P. Phife Dawg
Still switching lanes with the gang, lights blinkin'
Doin' dash in the white frog
Yeah, I done made millions on millions
Stack to the ceiling, ride down a chameleon
Can't go back to bein' broke 'cause I wanna have children
Took the whole gang, put ’em in one pavilion
Bro got my shit so it’s fuck how you feelin'
Nigga don’t fuck with me like I'm a villain
But I ain't do no wrong, I just be chillin'
I think they mad cause this car , iced down, this just the rich life
I think they mad cause they wife might get sliced
If it’s only a boring night
I'm a young nigga with a lot of money walkin' with a pole
Fuck a fist fight
I think I was born with a 76, I think my newest bitch heaven sent
Yeah, yeah, bitch I'm best friends with the mailman
Drop off some  at my doorstep
Walking your 
, didn't fuck with me till they knew I could help
Now I'm walkin' 'round with them big knots
Big Bentley Bs and them droptops
Big booty b-
....
 till they teeth rot
Fuck clubbing, I'm at the main spot
These niggas stay in the same spot
I had to clear up my mental, huh
 time in the central
VVS in my dental
Hella cars, it's a central, hey
I'm droppin' 30 like Kevin Booker
Snatch up yo bitch because she a looker
Bitch, I'm the wave like a bag of 
Not with the internet scuffle
My bitch say she want a bigger ass
I told her gon' head and pump it up
Now that's an Everyday Struggle, fuck
Yeaah, I'm getting tired of these frenemies
Cuttin' off all of the fake niggas
Lately, I ain't like your energy
I be better off by myself, oh well, yes
Yeah, I done made millions on millions
Stack to the ceiling, ride down a chameleon
Can't go back to bein' broke 'cause I wanna have children
Took the whole gang, put 'em in one pavilion
Bro got my shit so it's fuck how you feelin'
Nigga don't fuck with me like I'm a villain
But I ain't do no wrong, I just be chillin'
I think they mad cause this car , iced down, this just the rich life
I think they mad cause they wife might get sliced
If it's only a boring night
I'm a young nigga with a lot of money walkin' with a pole
Fuck a fist fight
I think I was born with a 76, I think my newest bitch heaven sentIn a dodge charger on the way to see the Dodgers
With my old bitch who really don't give a shit about me
She just want me 'cause she know a nigga poppin' shit
And I know it too but fuck it, I'm gon' fuck this bitch
You deserve everything comin' your way 
Not a nigga on my team that I would trade 
Strong chorus, solid foundation this way 
Loyalty's worth more than money any day 
I got bitches from the East Coast to the Bay
Before this rap shit, I was still makin' plays
Hothead just like Johnny Blaze, I do what I want
I can't wait to bring the pain and come bring the funkYou’ve got Homer, Marge, Lisa and Bart
You got Maggie and Santa’s Little Helper to start
At Seven-Forty-Two, in a pink lil' house
Where everything’s coming up Milhouse, D’oh!
Grampa’s yelling at clouds
Willie’s really keeping busy keeping the grounds
Wiggum is commissioner, incompetent officer
And his son Ralph’s doing the un-possible
Springfielders, ask Quimby, there’s plenty
The black one is Carl, the white one is Lenny
So many seasons, you can’t seem to settle on
One, ish longer than Nahasapeemapetilon
Go to Kwik-E-Mart, learn what Apu earns
Hans Moleman was saying boo-urns
Like the Sea Captain, I’m going overboard
I, for one, welcome our new insect overlords
Like Brockman, gimme a Duff, man
I wanna take a Malk but I wanna get drunk, man
Barney’s the barfly at Moe’s who falls
Down while Mike Rotch gives phony calls
Or Otto Mann on “The Bus That Couldn’t Slow Down”
Need a dump truck of money, call Krusty the Clown
Steer clear of Nelson, he’ll laugh at you openly
It’s worse than hearing “Okilly Dokilly”
Flanders, store just for left handers
Bar in the basement, call in Rex Banner
Two sons called Todd and Rod
Whose mom Maude got t-shirt clocked to God
And she’s smoking, like Selma and Patty
Comic Book Guy’s kind of a fatty
Like Fat Tony and Uter with his chocolate
Looking for another? Did you check your pocket?
I’mma school you like Chalmers and Skinner
Serving up steamed hams for dinner
I’m on fire, well, that’s a fallacy
It’s really Aurora Borealis, see?
Burns got a bear and the bear is Bobo
Burns got goons, Crusher and Lowblow
Nothing beats stabbin’ folks with my hobo
Knife, bring back Sheriff Lobo!
Flow so sick, someone call a doctor!
Hibbert is with it but Nick is awful
Hi everybody, it’s Mr. McGreg
With a leg for an arm and an arm for a leg!
Smithers can’t enter the League of Extra-Horny Gentlemen
There’s Itchy, there’s Scratchy, and there’s Gentle Ben
They’re all animals, call the hound dogs
Which are back like Alf with the Alf Pogs
Arnie Pye, Artie Ziff and Disco Stu
Martin Prince, McBain, Kirk, LuAnn, Lou
Sideshow Bob, Troy McClure, Radioactive Man
Who had a Fallout Boy before the band
I got more lines than Bart with chalk
I spit more lines than Maggie’s talked
That’s 59 names with more to report, Bort
Until next time, “Eat my shorts!”Well, this is more like it
See I know these youngsters don't know nothing about this here
This that Thanksgiving my time
This come on Christmas time my time
These youngsters swear they know something, boy
All 'em boys wanna talk about is
"Bitch suck my dick this", "hoe suck my dick that"
Boy, them youngsters is crazy, I can't even control 'em sometimes
I tell you
I love them boys though, them boys my boys
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' suck me up, suck me up like some damn spaghetti
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' ride Boat all night long just like a Chevy
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She wanna borrow money, I'm like no
I just thought that I would let you know
I fuck your bitches by the sixes, don't ask no questions
Ball like a Sixer, don't drink liquor, this shit too easy
Rich lookin' Freezy, call her slushy, I need a taste
Retro my Jordan, now I feel like CJ and Chase
Thinkin' shit sweet, thats how Boat gon' catch him a new case
Tip toe my way up to the top, I did it in days
But don't you dare worry 'bout Boat
I keep at least like ten hoes
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' suck me up, suck me up like some damn spaghetti
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She gon' ride Boat all night long just like a Chevy
I fuck my bitches by the sixes, no goin' steady
She wanna borrow money, I'm like no
I just thought that I would let you know
I had 3 play run in one day, can't you tell I'm sleepy
Two Japanese hoes at my show, they just wanna greet me
Fuck all the chit chat, kill promoters that's tryin' cheat me
Red bottom sneakers look like I just stepped out a TV
Bitch from Hawaii got a crib right next to the tiki
I love how you fuck me, but Lil Boat, I hate how you treat me
Lil bitch it's time to go
I been chillin' too too long, I gotta get back to my BoatWelcome to first class

Ain't scared of demons, spent 10k on Fear Of God
, still broke
Them hoes jump ship like Yachty, I should've stayed on a Lil Boat
My nigga killed Albert, I was armed and dangerous tryna get an elbow 
He gave away all his sprite, but he had to sell coke
Lil' baby takin' off her panties, I just want your throat
I took a break, there be little kids still calling me "Goat"
Send 30 thousand to my sister to get me a coat
That shit so real, I can't even be in it around smoke
My bitch don't hold no secrets, she know that I gotta know
Anything and everything, bitch I gotta know
Don't let me find out from the streets, bitch that's "Adios"
Since age 17, I been the one to fuckin' boast
I talk shit like I do up shit
With the 5'9 , they on that fuck shit
Snatch her phone before she walk in, she a duck bitch
Prolly shouldn't have her 'round, but her throat deep
And her ass sit fat like a pumpkin
Brought a pump in the function, 'cause I'm paranoid
Nigga try me, leave a mark like an asteroid

I can say some smart shit make you feel dumb
If I beat your doonies down you gon' feel numb
I don't wanna buy that pint if it ain't sealed up
I'm finna put your bitch out I think I smelled somethin'
Niggas waitin' on they stimulus like "when the mail coming?"
Nigga you do not own shit like "when the bills coming?"
Damn, my battery's going dead got my scale jumpin'
Phone slappin' all day I got sales comin'
I was posed to be there at 11, it's like 12 somethin'
Why the fuck you flashin' 5 thousand, that ain't real money
You can't jugg me if I was blind I can feel money
I can't bring young dog around he'll steal somethin'
Draco with a banana clip I'll peel somethin'

Coach said shoot it from the 3 but I still dunked it
Yachty why you do that man?Zaytoven

Damn my neck clearer than water
Old heads go hide all your daughters
Boat cannot be the father

Baby said swallow my kid
I cannot front on a bitch
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now

Nut on her face, paint up her face, just like an art show
Woah, just like an art show
Call it the art show, bitch it's the art show
Hmm, bitch fuck your daddy he don't want you with a boss
I met your mama and she hated how I floss
She said my style reminded her of Kriss Kross
She said I need to walk around with a cross
I can't have love for no bitch 
Watch how I lane switch 
Watch how I flood the wrist, oh
Damn, that's a flood 
Put that on the hood 
I'm living good 
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now

And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show
Ayy, just like an art show

Shabazz on the six, my nigga what it do 
Shouts out SK-Tebo and the whole crew 
Looking at my wrist and caught the whole flu
Niggas be hyping over the namebrand
Niggas be spending they guap with no gameplan
Niggas been rapping for years and still don't got no fans
Niggas talk down on Boat, they pull up in black vans
I cannot front on a nigga, I cannot front on a bitch now
I don't eat vegetables but I keep carats in my wrist now
Fly like a cardinal, brother keep all of the arsenal
And I paint all of these bitches' faces just like an art show

Yeah30, you a motherfuckin' fool, nigga
I befriended these niggas before they got famous, they turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game, all the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him and the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape, tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved, I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie
She ain't my main, so go fuck who you want, when you get here, I make that shit sing for me
My brothers pick up whenever I call, every time that I call, bought a ring for 'em
'Cause they never let the phone ring
And they honest even when it stings
I gotta stop takin' shit to the head and the heart, niggas hated on me from the jumpstart
Niggas be actin' original, low-key be studyin' all of my private parts
I never tried to be joker, I always was ace and my daddy was king of hearts 
Knew I'd be rich and be famous, I rapped in the mirror while cuzzo played Kingdom Hearts
I never let a bitch in 'cause if she don't get close, then my heart won't get broke apart
All of the bitches wan' ride on the Boat, let 'em in, now my shit look like Noah's Ark
He want the smoke, so we went to his mom's and we hit the front porch with a molotov
Niggas ain't gangster, we know they soft
Niggas switched on the gang 'cause the score was off
I befriended these niggas before they got famous, they turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game, all the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him and the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape, tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved, I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie
She ain't my main, so go fuck who you want, when you get here, I make that shit sing for me
My brothers pick up whenever I call, every time that I call, bought a ring for 'em
'Cause they never let the phone ring
And they honest even when it stings
I put my feelings inside of a bottle
I'm somewhere chillin' inside of a model
She ate my children, she grabbed it and swallowed
I'll probably leave her a couple of dollars
I put on shit that don't come out 'til next year
Hold up, wait, let me in, this the best here
I told Pee to call me when the check clear
Told the pilot call me when the jet here
Got a lil' nigga deal in my left ear
I'm not one to mess with, you play, you get left here
Got some niggas don't care if they get caught
I won't stop if she tough, she can get bought
Niggas act like they 12, make 'em bitch out
I won't say what I did, I don't need clout
There's the door, if you want, you can leave out
Boy, you play, we gon' spray when you leave out
I lost people I thought that would be here
That money start comin' and shit start to change people
Never switch on the gang, I was lit before fame
Kept it real and I'm still with the same niggas
We the one that was flippin' them thangs
You know what I'm sayin', don't play like we lame, nigga
Took the game I was taught and put flame with it
I ain't trippin', just don't put my name in it 
I befriended these niggas before they got famous, they turned on me
I give a fuck, ain't no friends in this game, all the bridges I had built, they burned on me
Whatever happens with me and the bitch after him and the bitch don't concern on me
When I was younger used to rock a cape, tried to save me a ho, then I learned from it
None of these bitches deserve bein' saved, I'm an ape when I bathe, I'm a king, homie

My heart, my soul, my life on the line, I owe it all to youPut her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model
We be together forever till we both turn fossil
She's my dream girl, she's my dream girl
She's my dream girl
Where are you now and where to be found
I heard you got a man, but that nigga a clown
He not fly, can't show you 'round
Take you to the town
He can't make you happy
Maybe it's me, hell nah it ain't me
I'm too fleek, not tryna sound cocky
But baby come be with me
You're my goddess in all my dreams
So when I go to sleep I don't wanna wake up
That's why I pour soo much purple in my cup
Your my baby and I need your love
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl, you're my dream girl
Together till-
You're my dream girl, you're my dream
You're my dream, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet get MIA
And in my A, and in my A
And in my A
Baby girl you're my dream girl
And in my A
But, you're my dream girl
You're my dream girl
And in my A
Put her on a play, fly her out to spain
You're my dream girl
I'm her baller, she's my model
You're my dream girl and in my A
Where are you now?
Put her on a plane, fly her out to spain
Berry, girl you my main she with me when I hit stains
Together we make it rain
In the winter we hop on a jet to get MIA
And in my A where we stay
In our palace where she'll lay
And I work hard and then we play
Make soo much money we'll be straight for days
Straight for days
I'm her baller, she's my model

Got this .45 in my tent, I go buck wild

Ice breaker 
Two black hoes in my bed, they some room shakers 
When they shake at the same time, it's a earthquaker 
My God , gang in the building 
She off  drank, that's a good feeling 
Feel like Wayne in '09, coupe got no ceilings 
My brodie live inside my mansion but he still scammin', damn
Go a-rat-tat-tat, kick a cat, rat and tell, dawg 
Rub a nigga sneaks on your couch like a doormat 
I don't give a fuck, fuck it up, if we black or white 
I'ma beat it up, we might hit the Prada store tonight
Cop you a new bag, fuck the tag, Mary-Kate and Ash'
I'ma do the dash, quick to slash, I got super-swag
I don't like to fight over hoes, that's just not my thing
How he know the man but his homies, they all gang-bang? 
Every day I wake up, it's R.I.P. my grandma 
Last time I signed, he ain't know me , and that's my grandfather 
So if one day when don't remember me, nigga know it's on 
Nigga keep playin' 'round with my name, smoke, get him gone 
War ready, eyes open real wide

Niggas think they hard, my niggas take they necklace
Niggas not reckless, load a Smith & Wesson
Type to fuck ya mother, type to kill ya brother
Type to catch a case and pass of flying colors
You the type to fuck a bitch without a rubber
Dance with her you love her, niggas soft like covers
Niggas sweet like sherbet, now you buying gerbert

Give a damn about a nigga history
Talkin' down it's gon be a mystery
Got good raps bitches wanna kiss me
Double dip, in the pussy
2 models, poppin bottles
Niggas hatin', but they ass follow
Got a Asian bitch, all she do is swallow
In a 2 door goin' full throttle like yahIt's beyond what I'm sayin'
Too much movin' fast without plan
Mess up, turn every boy into a man
See somebody fall, don't hesitate, extend a hand
Lets be honest put beef behind us
Let's work together keep on standin' and 
No limits riches we can conquer
Whatever color
You black or white ,you still my brother
Love to your mother
This life we seem to take for granted

Clothes on our backs, food in our mouth
And houses with the hood
You tell your fam you love 'em every night

And I keep my friend, , cause they phony
They don't need to know me
And I think they fuck with the boy, but it's okay
Broke niggas always got something to say
But I run from 12, like I'm OJ
Said I bet I fucked that bitch, but she easy
Bet I gave 'em hell, I do not play
Thirty round clip on my bro and it stay there
They don't want mе up, but I'm up, It's a sad case

        Wow. Darnell Boat here. And it's a–it's a pleasure, uh, to–it's interesting, it's a beautiful–it's a beautiful moment now. Two years, huh? That's a long time, two years, you know, obviously, it seems like it was just two years ago, and now it's–and now we on tour. Wow, now we on tour.
Uh, intro, intro, rich nigga central, VVS dentals 
Used to have the goals like Kimbo, guns on a , make a nigga limbo
New Maybach, no limo, tints on the window, black like Wesley 
These niggas Las Vegas Presley 
I ain't even die, but they miss me 
Made my first M, then I blew it to the club
Then I threw it, we had Magic polluted 
I ain't see nan new nigga on the Forbes list
It was just me and all the old niggas
Rap niggas fuck with the kid
I was down, now I'm up, and now they all wanna hate on me
I think these lil' niggas gay 
I'm DOLO, I'm really VLone 
I think I'm in love with my fans, gettin' these bands
No thousands though, million me 
Tellin' these hoes all that shit, and they run to me with the report
Dog, you killin' me 
I'm solid than  to the core, I couldn't change for a dime
Dog, that shit just instilled in me 
I shouldn't have let this shit build 
On the boat, turn that boy to a wildebeest 
Watch what you say when you tweet
I said watch what you say when you tweet 
Trust me, I know you ain't scared of me
Just be aware of me, speak real carefully 
I hate when the old people stare at me 
Drivin' the coupe so fast, hit the dash, I'm in Beverly instantly 
Open a TEC with a symphony
I heard I was worst rapper, last year I made twelve million, that's pretty good
I think that quote had came from Charlamagne 
Gang wipe him up 'cause his nose ring
Hold on to your ho 'cause the gang huntin'
And it's still fuck Joe Budden
Bro on the block, rock in his socks
Socks stuffed up like a Christmas stocking
Honestly, fuck all my old friends
Your baby daddy drive a old Benz
I fuck twice, then it's for the gang, gang, gang, gang
Seven chains swang
 in the cut with a hoodie tied
Take it off, he look like Major Payne
Totin' pistols like he Max Payne
Forty thousand on my pinky ring
I knew I'd be on since ten, if I pull up, I bet she gon' hop in 
Rockin' Carhartt, you gotta pay back your school loans
I spent that shit on my car parts
I'm makin' guap in another field
So it's fuck if I'm on the rap charts 
Mama life good now, she ain't gotta worry 'bout if her car start
She worry 'bout where her Porsche parked
Lil' Boat
Um, I think you guys are gonna really enjoy this one.
I think,  I think y'all are gonna like this one. Lyrics from Snippet
Rich young nigga fucking bitches now
Might go cop a ...no switches now
Free the gang, ...militia now
No Jonny Dang, this water need some  now
Hell yeah, I gave my momma hell
That's why her house like heaven
Fuck 12, every year I turn 11
I don't need no birthday, I'll just celebrate in heaven
And I love to watch her trynna squeeze into them leggings
Say she on the pills but I can tell that booty pregnant
You can spin the block, swear that shit a dead end
Thought it was a Glock, but it was a FN
Ride round like the President, you is just a residеnt
I play golf with drugs, but they don't ever see no еvidence
And I'm on a-

You can't suck my dick ugly bitch I'm so ditty

        Lyrics from Snippet
Thinkin' it be nice to just sit around and lounge 
Pretty little thing so I gave that hoe allowance 
Crooked, my neck, chain a whole damn pound
I could make her sing just like Toni Braxton 
She want shiny things just because we shining
This bitch broke his back but the parents masking
Four hunnid for the Rolls Royce, red seats...
Can't you feel the planes? Take me off the ground
Get to sturdy ground as soon as I skrrted out
Tryna beat my thing but I heard she get around
Brother on probation, I'm just glad he still around

Chodí nocí zlou
A kde nespí hodné dítě
Vezme si je ve své sítě
Houpy hou
Pak je veze ve svém voze
V dálku nocí zlou
Špatně se mu v noci spinká
Bez maminky, bez tatínka
Houpy hou
Na kozlíku starý cikán
Koně letí tmou
Přes bláto a přes kamení
V povětří se čerti žení
Houpy hou
Žáby spustí na močálu
Smutnou píseň svou
Netopýři sametoví
Probudí na věži sovy
Houpy hou
Když v postýlce hodné dítě
Spí až do rána
Na řasách zavřených víček
Tancuje mu andělíček
Tananynky, tananá

        Můj příběh je prostý a začíná tady
Sedím si v hospodě mezi kamarády a
Zrovna když u piva upíjím pěnu
Naproti u baru uvidím ženu
Ta žena je krásná její neskutečný vnady
Mi řikaj' kámo - teď a tady
Tady a teď svůj šarm rozjeď
Kolem prstu si ji vomotej a pak si ji vodveď
Tak vytáhnu kytaru zabrnkám na city
Jeden dva songy - starý dobrý hity
A pak už jen čekám až zvlhnou ji oči a
Úplně hotová mi do náruče skočí
Ale co to je? co se to děje?
No to snad ne snad se nesměje
Proč se tváří jako bych byl ňákej hmyz
Jako by řikala: hele mladej, rychle zmiz
Tvý songy budou nadosmrti staře znít
Pokud v nich nebude hustej rap a vostrej beat
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
Nevim jak se správně řikaj hiphopový mantry
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny vás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele
Můj příběh byl jiný a začal tam kde
Pokud si opravdu dobře vzpomínám
Skončil ten tvůj u kytary a piva
A naproti mně se posadila Iva
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a country
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a country
Ty chceš repovat v hustý repový kapele
Všechny nás tu hodně vostře posílat do prdele
To ti ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svíráš držíš jako ukulele
Ukulele ukulele uuukuuuleeeleee
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Jenže ten můj blbej kukuč vypadá tak nesměle
Celej život hrál jsem jenom folk a kántry
A celej život budu hrát jen folk a kántry
Já chci repovat v hustý repový kapele
Wabiho i daňka posílat do prdele
To mi ale těžko někdo uvěří když i ten
Majk co v ruce svírám držim jak ukulele

Reese's Puffs, Reese's Puffs, I can't get enough
Reese's Puffs, Reese's Puffs
Reese's Puffs, I can't get enough 
Peanut butter chocolate in the swirl in my bowl 
Flavor so sweet when the milk so cold 
Gotta take my Reese's Puffs everywhere I go
Even at my meetings and backstage at my shows
Yum-yum-yum
Yes, I have more, do you want some?
Please stop at the store, I need more Puffs
Oh my, they sold out, wow, that sucks
Reese's Puffs, Reesе's Puffs, I can't get enough
Reese's Puffs, Reesе's Puffs
Reese's Puffs, I can't get enough I don't pay for shit nigga
Fingers ashy but the diamonds glisten so it evens out
Money greener than some Brussels sprouts
Flip the work I'm like an acrobatic
Pussy nigga know he don't want static
Test Lil Yachty boy its gon' be tragic
 yea I made magic
Make it happen
Yea I'm happy
Fuck the work up like I'm Charlie Sheen
Want to be Yachty hah in his dreams
I am a real Ben Franklin fiend
In high school I made guap off of the beams
Serving selling like a mad team
I can't cop the Glock unless it got the beam
Y'all niggas  this motherfucker you feel me
Give a fuck what you think, give a fuck what you thought nigga
I just want all my motherfucking bread blue bills you know what I'm saying
I need my blue bills like I was crip or some shit you feel me

I ain't Jesus I don't got to break bread, this shit mine
I want all that shit
My new bitch smell like some cinnamon
K takin xans like they vitamins
All my niggas fuck up the whole fuck up
Never gave a fuck, I'm stuck up
If you broke then shut the fuck up
Lil Yachty I'm next up
All of my niggas be riding
All of my niggas be shot gun robbing for real
Popping like C4
Flyer than g4
I skrt in a two door
You faker than decor
I squat her like deploy
She sucking on the boy
No I'm not a d-boy
But I bring the checks in I get that work in
Make sure my momma not stressing
Make sure my game never resting
We working, working like it's Christmas time at Walmart
Pussy nigga don't get smart
Chopper, chopper pointing at his heart
Better not move nigga
Better be cool nigga
Silly rabbit
Nigga softer than a comfy fabric
Bitch I ball like a fucking Maverick
What's my nameUh, all I want is head
Gained $30,000 worth of diamonds, like a gumball
Playin' with my money, that's gon' turn a nigga awol
Could've shot with Paul , rather shot with Nick though
All my dogs fightin' like a mother fuckin' pit, though
Fight 'em like I'm 
Winter time, fur coat
My bitches rock 
My whip so damn stupid
It could've parked in handicap, you can get kidnapped
Why 
Bitch suckin' dick, in need chin strap 
Puttin' in work with the chop, it's gon' kick back
Tech gon' kick
Like a bitch, I need a tic tac
Niggas want the fame but all these niggas do is kick back
Bitch saw the gang and she damn near had a heart attack
Thirty racks racked up in a nigga backpack
I just snatched a groovie white bitch from the shake shack
Dunkin' in that pussy, like Shaq attack
Bitch, hey
I'm gone off that act
He who do not act, I don't remember no script
I juuged up prescriptions
Higher than ghost and he gon' build a stump
Boy, we don't smoke weed
We probably steal from police
'Cause they be stashin' more drugs than me
Then turn around and ask for 
They say runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Runnin' with the sack make you the main target, ayy
Well call me bullseye , keep a third eye 
Crippin' so damn slow, you would've thought it was drive by 
Runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Runnin' with the sack make you the main target
Well call me bullseye, keep a third eye 
Crippin' so damn slow, you would've thought it was drive by
Ayy, ayy, ayy
Gang break in two
Breakin' a bitch back, though
I'm smackin' on her pussy like the cartoons with cereal
Niggas get real serious when I run through they cereal
Numbers addin' up, like a...  )
You gon' go broke tryna impress the inferrer
A wise man once told me not to be into her, but still into her
Licked on that pussy one time, never again, it taste like vinegar
Dabble water on these fuckin' rap niggas, they be callin' me the fuckin' sinister
Could've been the fuckin' minister
Swag so just a mystery
Used to tease them, philosophy
'Til  but can't contest to me
Never been a dope boy, but I'm dope, boy
Only nigga that can jump headfirst in the ocean and still float, boy

        Lyrics from Snippet
The gangsters call me gang regardless 
They fuck with me 'cause I mean that 'cause I act the hardest 
You be fake and you be flossin', that's why you a target
I just fucked your trip with one trip out to Neiman MarcusAyy, hundred bands knock yo' ass right off 
Cover the wood, take the top off 
King of the teens, they do what I say
Baby, that's the power of , ayy 
Pull up and knock your whole block off 
Pull up to the scene and I wipe the chalk off
I give a fuck 'bout your body 
Trap, I stay whip it up like hibachi 
All on your face, all on your face
She want nut all on her face 
She suck that dick for the taste, uh 
They said Lil Boat look like Mase 
Janky promoters, these janky promoters ain't got the guap, get out my face 
Bitch-nigga, I'm 'bout my revenue 
I might go cop me a Bеntley coupe 
She think shе bring out the better me 
But I think I bring out the better you 
Post on the block, post on the block 
Lil Boat, he post on your avenue 
Suck on my nuts, suck on my nuts
Suck on my nuts, suck on my cashews 
Nasty lil' bitch so irregular 
I feel like I've fucked every bitch in America
You can't get on my level , if you wanted to
No-no, no-no-no
You , can't , get on my level if you wanted to
No-no , no
If you wanted to , no-no, no-no Lyrics from Snippets
Seth The Chef
Buddah bless this beat
It's Boat
Why this bitch so obsessed with taking island trips?
Same reason I'm so obsessed with making money flip
I'm gon' see if she fucking and that's off the rip
I'm gon' see how she sucking, I might leave a tip 
I don't miss, when I aim, I go for the lips
They say, "Boat, why you walk around like you hate us?"
That's 'cause my shoulder hold a big chip
Might be on the Westside chilling with them big Crips
Might be on the Southside with big Bloods, boowoo
She want  I bought two
I need  under my roof
I might let you spend the night under one rule
Let me get up in your mouth and feel drool
She said she love my style, it's so cool
Two pistols and a sword like Deadpool
Don't shoot me, I'm the messenger
Why this bitch so obsessed with taking island trips?
Same reason I'm so obsessed with making money flip
I'm gon' see if she fucking and that's off the rip
...*lyrics need to be transcribed*Got the chopper jumping like it's a

Hair red like a bright rooby

Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
10 pies de profundidad, estoy dentro
10 pies de profundidad, estoy dentro
Todos los días ganaré dinero
Todos los días ganaré dinero
Destruyo a esa pequeña zorra y hace como si me conociera
Crezco como Ginobili
La destrozo hasta que mi cadena se quede paralizada
Lo puedo sentir en mi hombro
Alguien me dio un Polaroid, porque mis diamantes están fríos
Hablan mierda, párate en tu barrio, ya tienes la guerra
Pon el Choppa en la acera
Tú no puedes pelear
Las zorras vienen de 2 en 2 como un dado
Las necesito juntas
Consigo mi dinero
Me la f*llo porque está buena
Montando en mi p*ne como en una bici
Ella no rentabiliza la noche
Ella no rentabiliza la noche
Estaba enamorada de esa chica
Ella estaba enamorada de una mujer
Yo me enamoré de esa bollera
No f*llaré con ella hermano
Me enamoré de esa bollera
Ahora tiene una esposa
Ya no pienso más sobre ella
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
LIL YACHTY
Tu eres para mi, lo sé
Eres más cara que otras, es como un lanzamiento
Mi dinero creciendo demasiado, no lo debo enseñar
Todos vosotros lo sabéis, lo sabíais
El rey de los adolescentes, lo seré para siempre
Líneas rojas y verdes en mi jersey, Gucci para siempre
Ella es muy lista
Tuve que escribirle una carta para decirle que le echaba de menos
Tuve que cortar con Vanessa, buen c*ño, la golepeo como Sylvester Stallone
Tengo una nueva casa y millones de dólares, ahora estoy solo
LIL UZI VERT
Ahora llegué a un nuevo nivel
Ahora volví a mi nivel
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
No soy Jordan pero soy el GOAT como Kobe
Mi coche es muy rápido, llega a 200, ¿quieres probarlo?
Conseguir dinero es una bendición
Rézale al señor que esté dándolo todo cada día
Algunos de mis amigos descansan
Sigo aquí, una bendición
Ojalá no me escriben
Eres muy bruta
Mi cadena está ajustada pero es muy pesada
No hagas ni crédito ni débito
Todo este dinero en mi bolsillo, esta mierda es tan pesada
Ahora llegué a un nuevo nivel
Ahora volví a mi nivel
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas
Cuando estoy en la A, te sigo sirviendo
Mantente, mantente
¿Por qué estás tan mal? Levántate
Detente en el skrrt, abre mis puertas

Oh yeah
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful
The sun is even more beautiful
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
Oh yeah
I'm cool, super cool
Ladies see me, they drool
Yeah, I act a fool in school
And passed my tests because I'm cool
I'm too cool for you
I could've followed rules
But I didn't 'cause I couldn't
I was busy being cool
I'm too cool for a fool
To try and fool me
When I walk the hall
These ladies call my name from wall to wall
I'm a player, player
Player, player
Player, player
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride
Oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah, I'm way too cool
Oh yeah, I'm just too cool
The moon is beautiful, that's right, that's me, baby
The sun is even more beautiful, that is me
Oh yeah, let's ride
Oh yeah, oh yeah
Oh yeah
Pocket full of ice
Ice cubes 'cause I'm cool
When I dance, homies wanna do
But they know they can't 'cause I got the moves
Watch me slide to the left
Watch me slide to the right
Keep it cool on the summer night
Take a real then I gotta change your life
I'm too... cool
Let's get it, let's get it
Let's get it, let's ride
Oh yeah, told y'all I'm too cool for y'all
Oh yeah, oh yeah, I'm too cool
Oh yeah
The moon is beautiful, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
The sun is even more beautiful, that's me y'all, that's right, that's right
Oh yeah, let's get it, let's get it, let's get it, let's ride
Oh yeah
Oh yeahSbohem a kdybychom se nikdy nesetkali
Bylo to překrásné a bylo toho dost
Sbohem a kdybychom si spolu schůzku dali
Možná že nepřijdem že přijde jiný host
Bylo to překrásné žel všecko má svůj konec
Mlč umíráčku ten smutek já už znám
Polibek kapesník siréna lodní zvonec
Tři čtyři úsměvy a potom zůstat sám
Sbohem a kdybychom si neřekli už více
Ať po nás zůstane maličká památka
Vzdušná jak kapesník prostší než pohlednice
A trochu mámivá jak vůně pozlátka
A jestli viděl jsem co neviděli jiní
Tím lépe vlaštovko jež hledáš rodný chlév
Ukázalas mi jih kde máš své hnízdo v skříni
Tvým osudem je let mým osudem je zpěv
Sbohem a bylo-li to všecko naposledy
Tím hůře mé naděje nic vám nezbude
Chcem-li se setkati nelučme se raděj tedy
Sbohem a šáteček Vyplň se osude!

Maybach Mitch fucking with me
I got bad hoes waiting on standby
I got big players chirping on my landline
I spent 200 thousand on my downtime
Since 18 I been bumping through your alpine
I end a nigga's world, like a spirit bond
I got 600K in watches 
All this damn drip I'm a faucet 
If I look in the mirror I get nauseous 
Reaching for my chain, boy be cautious
Got a white Maybach just like 
On a game bitch I live like the bosses
But that shit wasn't fly, until I flossed it
Fucked her one time, then I tossed it 
Fucked her one timе, then I'm off it 
Dick up in her throat, shе be coughing
{?} 'cause I'm coughing
Got a rich white bitch, she took me golfing 
No ass, but that pussy wet like dolphins 
Puerto Rican bitch, look like Joslyn
She was buddies, but I snatched it Randy Moss 
I got bad hoes waiting on standby
I got big players chirping on my landline
I spent 200 thousand on my downtime
Since 18 I been bumping through your alpine
I end a nigga's world like a spirit bond
Put a hole in a nigga like a CD-ROM
You ain't  with your kids saying dinnertime
I got stripes on my back like a  
 baby hit the foes that's the gang sign 
Shawty playing in my head, she like my  
Don't give a fuck about them niggas if they ain't mine 
Niggas look hard, they fragile just like sheet rock
She was sucking on my dick, sound like beatbox 
Got the crowd rocking
That's the hoes, and bankrolls,  ten toes
This bitch bougie, took that bitch to Margiano's 
Slatt say slatt, bitch I'm slime like Supranos 
I got bad hoes waiting on standby
I got big players chirping on my landline
I spent 200 thousand on my downtime
Since 18 I been bumping through your alpine
I end a nigga's world like a spirit bond
Put a hole in a nigga like a CD-ROM
You ain't  with your kids saying dinnertimePutting it on god 
I got the blade tucked inside the brim 
Hoes stick to me like the weed on the stem
 like a canvas
I'm here, got all my interest
I lost my innocence
Tell me  I promise they frenemies
Trying to go big, go big, go big, go big, knocking off ligaments
I'm trying to give them some game  ambiguous
My old bitch  everything 
My brother tip-toe through your window and stole all your shit like the 
Ten thousand dollars, spent on some sneakers 
 thеm shits was hideous
 had to have them
Hе was broke and I had to smack him
Go up!
Thinking this sweet we Coke Zero
I support all of my heroes
I got a real big bureau
She going to three-way out 
Sucking it up like mosquitoes
Stuffing it in like burritos
Bitches be coming with problems, I do not need those
Make them believe 
I got a trick up my sleeve
My bitch brought a friend, I help with her  like a 
You saw your bitch with the gang, she told you that we were just friends, you're not 
I bought a Glock, for me and my brother on god, 
I bought a new chain, new VV
Buy me a new  with the V-12
 look like some seashells
All of these hoes come to the  look like a motel 
Thinking this sweet we Coke Zero
I support all of my heroes
I got a real big bureau
She going to three-way out 
Sucking it up like mosquitoes
Stuffing it in like burritos
Bitches be coming with problems, I do not need those

        I know just what you want it
Oh my god, RonnyLyrics from Snippets
Ay, Ay
We've been on and off for four years
So tell me what it is 
Tell me what to do
I've been doing wrong
But baby so have you
Don't leave me by myself
Don't leave me all alone
Love is just a four letter word, yes I know
I just wanna know
Tell me do you love
Things that I do
The way that I am
Or do you pursue
Me as in my words
Or is it my life
Playing with my nerves
I'm not good with love
Baby girl I'm lost
I'll pay for you love just tell me what it costs
I'm not trynna flex, not trynna floss
I've been running up M's girl, come be with a boss
I know that love's a four letter word
Tell me what that mean
Tell me where you've been
Tell me what you've seen
Let's take trips to overseas
Where the grass is green
Unlimited drugs, mighty percs and lean
I know what you want.. I know-
